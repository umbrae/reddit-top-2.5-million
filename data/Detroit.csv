Being from Florida, I knew nothing about the city. I heard from everyone that it was dangerous and vile. Every time I mentioned I would be spending my summer there I was told to ""have fun, bring a gun"". I tried not to build these expectations in my head, and to just go to Detroit with an open mind, but it was inevitable. 

I arrived on a really gloomy Michigan day, not only was the city entirely empty as it was the weekend but the sun did not come out for a full 2 days. It was looking like Detroit was going to meet all these expectations I tried not to set. But after spending 3 months exploring, submersing and involving myself in downtown/surrounding areas and their culture I was blown away. The history, the beautiful stories the buildings tell, the intriguing people you meet, the establishments that have just popped up in midtown to the restaurants that have been on Michigan Ave for decades. I did not even know what to do with all of it. 

No one had told me about these things, just that I shouldn't drive a foreign car and I should never speak to anyone. 

Detroit is thriving in a way people don't understand. But I am absolutely thankful that I had the chance to experience it first hand. 

Detroit did not meet my expectations, because it wasn't disgusting nor did I ever feel in danger. I was not afraid to walk around on my own, or talk to random people. I saw abandoned buildings/houses but they taught me about the past. 

Detroit is everything I wasn't expecting. It taught me about myself and about others. It showed me that simple ideas can be manifested into endeavors. It taught me to never give it. It also taught me that Northerners can't make good chicken and waffles, but damn the rest of the food y'all make is delicious. It showed me some of the most stunning architecture I have ever been privileged to witness.

That being said, I'd like to thank everyone in the area for being so welcoming and cordial. I can't wait to return next summer. 

Edit: I lived in downtown Detroit for the 3 months I spent there. I plan on returning for another 3 months next summer to live in the same place. ",,False,,t5_2qkko,1346554413.0,,,True,t3_z7a1n,http://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/z7a1n/detroit_you_didnt_live_up_to_my_expectations/,

I am writing today to discuss what I believe may be one of the largest sporting scandals in Detroit history, and have hope that Dunkin Donuts and Comerica Park will do the right thing before it becomes a media circus. I have had a 28 game package for the Detroit Tigers for the past 2 years now and attend even more games than that per season (including playoffs). My section is 147, which places me strictly in the ""Cuppy Coffee"" section of the Dunkin Donuts Race.

Throughout the past two years, I can count on one hand the amount of times Cuppy has come through and won this race. What was simply a fun event at the ballpark became a minor annoyance and now is turning into a white whale. Do I want the free donut or coffee that comes with winning the donut race? No, that is not what this is about at all. This is about competitive equity.

It isn't that Cuppy Coffee doesn't win, Biggie Bagel also is constantly falling behind as well. Dashing Donut is miles ahead of its competition when it comes to consistently winning this race. Perhaps this is why the race is called the Dunkin ""Donuts"" race, because of the excessive number of wins by Dashing Donut. I firmly suspect that Dashing Donut is on performance enhancers. While yes, you could assert that Dashing Donut is fast because of a natural ""sugar high,"" the same argument could be used for Cuppy Coffee's ""caffeine buzz"" and yet we do not see those kind of results. An investigation would be in order so that we can get the Donut into a rehabilitation program before he (she?) ruins their life. The well-being of all competitors should be looked after first.

I trust that your respective corporations will do the right thing in this instance for the athletes. In the meantime, I will still shout for my Tiger's Phil Coke, Jeff Kunkel, and Miguel Cabrera while cheering loudly for Cuppy Coffee.

It's at Stoepel Park #2, 5 blocks East of Southfield Rd. on W. Chicago St.  To quote our founder ""Everyone is welcome, even if you don't have equipment. There is always plenty of tools and supplies around.""

I will be there with three push mowers.  

If you have an ordinary lawn mower, I say, that's great, bring it.  Sure, the big lawn tractors do more.  But every bit helps.  

The Mower Gang organizes via Facebook.  This event is  [https://www.facebook.com/events/587557977927495/](https://www.facebook.com/events/587557977927495/).

The Mower Gang page is at [https://www.facebook.com/MowerGang](https://www.facebook.com/MowerGang).


An editorial:  Detroit is in trouble and needs help.  We can blame the current governor, past governors, mayors, city council, city residents, suburbanites, etc.  But that won't fix it.  Can we work together to fix one small part of it?  Detroit's parks really are a gem.  

My dream is that the Detroit Mower Gang gets so big that they have to multiple meeting points, that there is an east side crew and a west side crew.  And of course, a South Detroit crew, especially for those city boys who were born and raised there.


C'mon out.  Say hi if you want.  I drive a Green Focus Wagon, I'm a middle aged guy who will probably be pushing a lawn mower.

1373133639.0,72,self.Detroit,1hrayg,Want to volunteer with the Detroit Mower Gang? Here's an unofficial primer.,85,13,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/1hrayg/want_to_volunteer_with_the_detroit_mower_gang/,"**What is the Detroit Mower Gang?**

The Detroit Mower Gang is a group of volunteers that meet every other Wednesday to clean up parks in Detroit. If you haven't noticed, the City of Detroit is in a *bit* of a financial crisis at the moment, and can't afford to maintain its massive number of parks. As a result, many of the parks become completely overgrown. This often results in blight, trash dumping, crime, and general badness in the area. Rather than writing strongly-worded letters to City Council, the Detroit Mower Gang decided to take matters into their own hands with direct action.

**When are the Detroit Mower Gang events?**

The location is posted [on the Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MowerGang) a few days before the event. People tend to arrive between 5-6PM, and the event usually goes until dusk. Check the [Events page](https://www.facebook.com/MowerGang/events) for the date, time, and location. There's usually between 10-20 people at each event.

**Do I need a mower?**

No, you just need to bring your lovely self. There's plenty of non-mower work than can be done: trash disposal, tree and branch trimming, grass clipping removal, playscape cleanup, etc. If you *do* have a mower, it always helps to bring it. Riding mowers are the staple of what we do, but push mowers excel in hitting the smaller areas that the riding mowers can't reach. There's always a need for raw grunt work. The goal is to get the park into a usable condition by the time it gets dark, and this often involves a lot more than just cutting grass.

**What do I need to bring?**

Any tools of flora destruction: trash bags, mowers, string trimmers, leaf blowers, branch cutters, weed and grass killer, etc. Basically, anything that can be used to help tame an overgrown park. If you don't have any of those, there's usually extra tools laying around that can be utilized. As mentioned above, a lot of this is grunt work that doesn't require any particular tools. There's *always* something to do if you volunteer.

**What do other people bring?**

- Riding lawnmowers.
- Push mowers.
- Trash grabbers and trash bags. Empty 40s and liquor bottles don't mix well with a mower blade, and it saves you from having to constantly bend over to pick them up.
- Gloves. You *really* want to bring work gloves. The trash can get exceptionally nasty. I was not aware that an empty chip bag could be used as a portable urinal until I started doing this. Seriously, bring gloves. You'll thank me later.
- Eye protection. Crap gets thrown everywhere. I wear [a set of these](http://www.amazon.com/20-Eyedefend-Allergy-Glasses-Earthtone/dp/B007RM28PO) to keep everything out of my eyes.
- Ear protection. It can get loud when you've got 10-15 riding mowers running at the same time. I prefer [electronic ear protection](http://www.amazon.com/Howard-Leight-R-01526-Electronic-Earmuff/dp/B001T7QJ9O/) so I can block out the noise while still being able to hold a conversation.
- Water. It gets hot out. We don't need people passing out.
- Branch cutters. A lot of overgrowth gets tangled in fences and just about everything else.
- Leaf blowers. This is more for grass than leaves. The grass is often 3+ feet tall. This results in *a lot* of grass clippings, and eventually causes the mowers to choke. As we're mowing, someone can hit the piles of grass clippings with the blower to spread them out a bit.
- String trimmers. These are useful for cleaning up around the edges.
- Eye drops and allergy pills. There's a crazy amount of grass and pollen in the air once we get moving. I forgot these last time, and my eyes were damn near swollen shut by the time it was over. However, thanks to the wonders of modern medicine, a few drops and a Benadryl can take care of the ""I have grass and pollen allergies"" excuse :). 
- Closed-toe shoes. Boots are better, but anything that covers your feet will work. Do not attempt to wear Crocs, sandals, or anything that exposes your toes. Actually, just don't wear Crocs. Ever.

**Where can I get Detroit Mower Gang swag?**

Talk to Tom Nardone, our leader and saviour. He's at every event. Tom has a system worked out with t-shirts, gloves, hoodies, etc based on the number of times you've volunteered. After enough times, you can eventually earn [a fighter jet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_v._Pepsico,_Inc.).

I was in Detroit this past week and I was pleasantly surprised. Admittedly, I wasn't really out of downtown, Greektown, near the ballpark etc. but I can see that Detroit has more to offer than I expected. 

I made it to a couple of the bars listed in response to my question, had some excellent local brews from Atwater, Motor City and Detroit Brewing, and met some cool folks downtown. 

I don't know what i was expecting exactly, but when i told people I'd be in Detroit, I mostly got either 'ewww"" or ""don't get stabbed"" in response. That wasn't my experience at all, it's a town with a cool history and what looks to me like an effort to improve things.

",70,5,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/j0t96/spent_a_weekend_in_detroit_was_very_moved_by_your/,"I used to go to Southfield as a kid to visit family, but the city of Detroit was pretty much always a mystery to me. 

I stayed in the awesome [Hostel Detroit](http://www.hosteldetroit.com/) and they were so nice and friendly. 
They seemed to be doing brisk business, lots of people coming in and out. There was a german dude, someone from memphis, oklahoma city, a car full of kids from NYC, and someone who I think was from norway or some other scandinavian country.  

Eastern Market is spectacular, very much the definition of how an open air market should be. I'm from Pittsburgh and while we have the Strip District it really doesn't compare at all. 

Roads are so wide and flat. Woodward is 10 lanes in some places and not even a highway. That totally just blew my mind. Some of the empty 6 lane grand boulevards in the city were eerie, although I'm sure everyone who visits Detroit talks about ruin porn. I tried to keep that to a minimum. 

Mexicantown is so enormous. It's amazing, the mexican shops just go on and on down vernor highway. 

I had a nice long talk with the bartender at LJ's Lounge in Corktown (next to slow's) That place was really cool. I stopped in at PJ's Lager house as well. The Old Miami was ok too. I think I liked the 3rd street saloon the best. Good crowd and good music. 

The Heidelberg Project was fascinating, although it felt really exploitative to take pictures of the art there. People still live in that neighborhood, and play on those streets. I threw a basketball back to a kid right next to one of the art pieces. 


One of the things that some of my relatives in the D talked about was the excitement about a flint GM plant being re-opened. It's interesting because that would be like if a steel mill re-opened in Pittsburgh, but I don't think Pittsburghers ever really thought that steel would come back (at least in my lifetime), so the difference in people's attitudes toward manufacturing jobs is interesting.


I had awesome food at Mudgie's, the Woodbridge Pub, and Avalon Breads. Everything was fresh, and I think a decent amount of the food was farmed in Detroit itself. Everyone seemed to be really up on the city, with lots of Detroit pride. 


Palmer Woods, Boston-Edison, and Indian Village are amazingly gorgeous city neighborhoods, nothing in Pittsburgh really compares. Albert Kahn's architecture is amazing and everywhere.  In fact so much of the architecture in the City of Detroit is just awe-inspiringly beautiful. That fresco inside of the guardian building? Holy shit! It really moved me on an emotional level.


I drove through Grosse Pointe too and saw a peacock there. The no parking signs and the private park made me :( though, I wanted to check out the beach.   


All in all, it was good to go to Detroit. Had some greek food at Pegasus near downtown the other night before I left. If I can I'll probably be returning for DEMF next summer. The city has a long way to go, but I think the general trajectory is upwards.

1369319490.0,59,self.Detroit,1ewksd,Want to help make Detroit a better place? The Detroit Mower Gang is having a 24-hour mowing event this Saturday starting at 9AM. Volunteers welcome!,77,18,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/1ewksd/want_to_help_make_detroit_a_better_place_the/,"Here's a link [to the event on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/471500222912656/). Don't worry, you don't have to help the full 24-hours and can join in at any time. The plan is to hit 11 parks within 24-hours.

Copypasta:

&gt; Tell Your Friends. It's a 24 hour mowing/barbecuing/camping event. The Mower Gang is hosting a Mow-A-Thon unlike any you have ever seen. For 24 hours straight we'll mow as much parkland as we can. 

&gt; We will be all over town, with the overnight portion contained within our home park of Dorais. 

&gt; More details will follow, but keep your calendars clear and sharpen your blades, we are going to accomplish a lot on May 25th. 

&gt; Rain Date: June 1st. 

&gt; What It Is: The event will last for 24 hours. During that time, teams will try to keep their equipment running for as many of those hours as possible while we clean and mow as many Detroit playgrounds and parks as possible. 

&gt; Who: The Detroit Mower Gang is a group of volunteers that clean and mow the abandoned playgrounds of Detroit. Everyone is welcome in the gang. You don't even need equipment. If you want to join, just post here and ask to be included in a team. 

&gt; Who Is Making This Possible: Volunteers like yourself make this possible and Husqvarna is helping us do great work by donating really great equipment. 

&gt; Why: Because kids need a place to play and they can't cut their own grass.

&gt; When: Typically, the gang mows every other Wednesday after work, but this event is a special one. 24 hours straight. 

&gt; How: We will mow as much as possible in any way possible. Members bring their own lawn tractors, push mowers, weed whackers, blowers, and work gloves. 

&gt; How Is It Judged: Some people will be there for fun. Others will be there to compete. The competition will make use of most mower's hour meters. The team that keeps their mower running for the most hours out of 24 will win the grand prize (whatever it happens to be)

&gt; How Much Does It Cost: There is no entry fee or anything like that. You'll need to bring your own gasoline, supplies, place to sleep, etc. 

&gt; Schedule: 9-10AM - Arrive and check in (O'Shea Playground).
&gt; 10AM - Start Mowing! until O'Shea is done.
&gt; Then on to the next park, then the next, then the next. We will use phones to let you know where we are heading next and to let the public where we are.

&gt; 2PM - Lunch - A restaurant is inviting us to dine-in. They have sinks and bathrooms. 

&gt; 7PM - Dinner at Dorais Playground (our home park where we will have porta johns and we will be spending the night. 

&gt; 11PM - Midnight Snack / Mowers go quiet, gardening continues

&gt; 6AM - Mowers start again
&gt; 7AM - Breakfast
&gt; 10AM - Finish

&gt; Is it fun: Yup.

&gt; Is it hard work: Yes.

&gt; Is it dangerous: Eh.. 

&gt; Is it the kind of work you will be proud of: Yes.

&gt; Why do you do it: Because it feels good to help people and because when you do good things, you meet good people. 

&gt; Prizes: If anyone is interested in sponsoring the event and/or donating prizes, please contact Tom: tom@mowergang.com 
&gt; We could use your help. 

&gt; Where can I buy Husqvarna Equipment: You can buy Husqvarna equipment at Lowe's and at Husqvarna dealers.

Which is awesome!  SO to make things easier- lets list ALL the good places that Metro Detroit has to offer right here once and for all.

Leave your favorite restaurants, bars, clubs, attractions, things to do, things to see, ect in the comments and I'll add it to the list.  Try to leave a reason why you would recommend it- something like ""great wings"" or ""dollar beer night"" or anything else.

**Edit:** Added all so far, and the list is a LOT bigger! About to exceed the 10,000 character limit for selfposts.. should be able to keep adding more.. just need to remove some of the metadata, or all the links. Will update periodically.

**Edit 2:** Added more, made the names bold instead of including links so more places can be added.  Will update more later and thanks to everyone who has contributed so far!

**Eateries:**

* **Supino Pizzeria** Eastern Market; Best NY style pizza in the city, delicious fresh ingredients

I'm participating in and raising money for the American Lung Association's Fight for Air Climb next month. My team, The Quadzillas, get to climb 70 flights of stairs to the top of the Renaisance Center in Detroit. We're doing this to support lung health, something that is very important us all. In 2011, my father passed away from complications with COPD and I've had numerous friends and other family members deal with lung issues their entire life. 

Please consider making a donation to support the FIGHT FOR AIR. Thank you for helping us on this important fight for children with asthma, people with lung cancer, emphysema, COPD and everyone who has ever wanted to breathe healthy and clean air in their communities. 

Even if you donate a few bucks, that helps tremendously. Consider donating the price of your latte this morning towards the greater good!

It's saddening and I started feeling bad for the city. Not because its a shitty place, but because its such an amazing city! beautiful architecture and its laid out great! This city was made and planned to be a great metropolis.. It's too bad that it had to crumble the way it has. 

I didn't get to interact with too many people since I was there only for about 5 hours. I stopped at the bathtub bar downtown for a buffalo burger and it was delicious! I talked to the border crossing guy and he told me to drive down woodbine and get out of downtown to see some nice restaurants.. sort of funny that he told me to get out of Detroit for that. 

My Gf and I wanted to see some of the neighborhoods around Detroit. This was the hardest to take in! These fantastic houses that we both would love to move into and make a home. That are now decrepit and falling apart, meanwhile next door is a intact home with a fence, clearly marking his territory. it's like a plague that the homeowners are trying to keep out and away from their homes. 

I hope that Detroit finds a way to get out of this. I want to revisit Detroit in a few years and see some change.. I have no idea what sort of change I expect, but I don't think the city should be the way it is now. 

TL;DR: Went to Detroit for a day, really liked the city, the people. Sad for a big city like this to be falling apart, an sad for the people with no jobs and not a viable way out of this yet. HOPEFUL that Detroit will recover fully and pick its self up.

The photographer we had arranged to meet us in Michigan for an engagement photo session canceled due to circumstances beyond her control.  My fiancé and I are from San Diego, and were in town visiting family for a long weekend, and Monday was our last day.  It was also the only day with real sun that we had!  My fiancé had been looking forward to taking these photos for weeks (probably more like years), and we were thrilled with the idea of using the fields, lakes and barns of Michigan as our backdrop.

I broke the bad news to her and there was immediate sadness.  She put a good face on, and pretended to be okay with the situation, but we were halfway across the country and our plan to take amazing photos was falling apart.  I'm sure others can identify with this, but at that moment in time, I was ready to do anything to make the situation better.  As a future husband, all I wanted was to make my fiancé smile and know that things will work out.  [So I turned to Reddit with this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/1e8wot/help_rdetroit_engagement_photographer_canceled_on/).

The response was incredible.  People began to forward my request for help and within an hour, I had recommendations of a dozen photographers in the area.

We spoke to a few people and looked at samples, and settled on [Lisa Hodack](http://www.lisahodack.com).  In short, Lisa was incredible.  Her personality put us at ease right away.  She was confident and comfortable directing us into different poses and backgrounds, but she genuinely listened to and encouraged us try out our own ideas.

Lisa sent over a [sample of the photos](http://imgur.com/DqeVRP0) that she took and we couldn't be happier. As much as this sounds like an advertisement for Lisa, the real moral of the story here is that reddit &amp; r/Detroit made me look like a hero. So thank you redditors, I continue to be amazed at how quickly you can accomplish even the little things like our situation.  If I can ever repay the favor in San Diego, please ask.

TL;DR: Reddit helps out-of-town couple find last minute photographer for amazing engagement session!

1346251747.0,41,self.Detroit,z0sj3,"After 10 years, I've given up and decided to officially leave Detroit. [East English Village]",54,13,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/z0sj3/after_10_years_ive_given_up_and_decided_to/,"[Note: I wrote this a few weeks ago as a way to vent after everything was finished. I figured I'd share it with /r/detroit. I'll gladly answer any questions too.]

After much time, money, and hair-pulling, I’ve finally managed to close the chapter in my life known as my house in East English Village. When I bought the house 10 years ago, a much younger and more ambitious version of myself wanted to see Detroit turn around. I’d moved downtown when I was 19, settled into a roach-infested apartment, and had a great time living there. I remember saying that the only way it was going to get better was if people that cared started moving back. About 5 years after that, I found East English Village and ended up purchasing a home there.

At the time, it was a decent area with an actual sense of community. The majority of people took pride in their homes and made sure the neighborhood was kept up. Lawns were mowed, yards were raked, trash was taken out, and anything broken was fixed. It was, for quite some time, one of the nicer neighborhoods in Detroit. Additionally, the neighborhood had a large number of police officers living there which made crime somewhat minimal. People were genuinely surprised when they saw the neighborhood and realized they were still in Detroit.

The housing crash took a severe toll. The majority of the houses lost something like 70-90% of their value, my own included. People had bought into mortgages that they couldn’t afford. It’d hit in waves: around the same time each year, you’d notice more and more houses where the lights were off and the lawns were overgrown. The police residents that kept an unofficial watch on the neighborhood slowly left. Neighbors that said hello were replaced with people that glared at you as you walked by. Break-ins and theft became more and more common.

Over the last few years, I’ve watched more and more ghetto “culture” creep into the neighborhood. I’ve seen people dump fast food garbage from their car into their neighbor’s front yard. People sitting out front blasting obnoxiously loud music from parked cars while weeds grow around them. Barking dogs with garden hoses used as a leash that are never let inside and rarely fed. People casually tossing bottles and wrappers onto the sidewalk instead of throwing them away. The common theme that I encountered is that if you can’t eat it, screw it, smoke it, or steal it, then you might as well try to break it. Ghetto culture took what was once a nice neighborhood and wrecked it in less than 5 years.

As far as the actual city, most services are absolutely awful and borderline insane when you consider what gets paid in taxes. Trying to get a final water reading involved sitting on hold for an hour, getting disconnected, and sitting on hold for another two hours, only to be told that it’s “my problem” that they can’t give me a time that they’ll be there before hanging up. It’s the same for literally any other service that the city of Detroit touches. Horrible customer service, insane waiting times, zero workmanship, and a complete lack of pride seem to be integrated into every single city “service”. 

I’ve come to the conclusion that there’s no point in maintaining something if your neighbors are going to destroy it. Each infested home takes out the surrounding homes with it. They eventually fall like dominoes until there’s nothing left to ruin. There was nothing more disgusting than walking into the back yard and seeing condom-filled beer bottles that my “neighbor” dumped into my yard for no apparent reason. Who knows? Maybe they were cleaning out their two busted cars and missed the trash can by 30 feet.

My last straw was spending $1000 to repair the damage from a total of $6 of copper plumbing that was stolen. Enough is enough. I sold the house for pennies of what I paid for it. I have no doubt that the next inhabitants will say they “stay there” instead of “live there” and act accordingly. I’ll drive by next year and see all of my hard work destroyed in a pile of garbage. The back yard where I had my graduation party will be a trash dump used by people that have zero pride in anything they do. The front yard that I always maintained will be an overgrown weed garden. I’ve watched it happen to home after home.

There’s still good people left in Detroit. I have met and know quite a few of them. However, they are the absolute minority when compared to the general population. For every person that attempts to make a difference, there are a few hundred other people that truly don’t care. There’s no reason to improve or maintain anything if it’s just going to get stolen or destroyed. You can’t compete with complete apathy and a total lack of pride. It’s a constant uphill battle that has no end.

Best of luck Detroit. I hope you can save yourself.

Back to the point though. Sometimes it seems that I am the only person who notices all of the stupidity of the city council. I rarely hear of a good idea coming from them. Then when I think Mayor Bing has a good idea going they just shoot it right the fuck down.  Now I'm not saying Bing is always right, but I do admit that I like how he thinks.  There is so much wrong with this city but dammit, why doesn't anyone want to TRY something, jesus, fucking anything! Everything is immediately put on hold. I understand the city is scraped for cash.  Why not try to actually bring more people in to spend money here? The suburbs are Detroit's salvation. All the suburbanites are just petrified of the city.  Make them feel safe. Make them welcome. Make them want the city again.  Sorry that I'm just rambling but I'm just fed up with all of the racial, political, social bullshit extruding from everyone in the city.  Do something.

I was kind of worried it would be some little high pitched stuff from Tokyo, but it wasn't at all it was pure power and really nice thick vocals! my house was rocked so I definitely would say go for anyone who is even thinking about it! they definitely put on a great show and were super pumped, I loved it. It would be sweet if some of Detroit could come out for them! 

anyways, the Facebook event they set up is here
http://www.facebook.com/events/460321210674196/

and their band website is 
http://akabane-vulgars.com/
where i'm sure you can find some music of theirs

its at the Corktown Tavern, what ever that is (i live in Chicago) I dont know if its free or what ever but id be happen to answer any questions or whatever. but you should definitely go!

Edit: Apparently its $6. Definitely worth it!!

Also this is there band facebook which i guess they update more if your into that sorta thing :

A big milestone considering about [one year ago we thought traffic was good](http://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/jd014/still_growing_rdetroit_that_is/), today its about 4x as high.

To celebrate reaching 5,000 subscribers we've added a new banner up top and have some updates/housekeeping to share.

In regular milestone fashion I will be posting the most recent traffic data for the sub. See below for the raw unique visitors and pageviews from the last month, Just a few weeks ago, in January /r/Detroit had the highest monthly traffic on record w/ 80,000 pageviews and 20,000 unique visitors.

* 2013 traffic stats: http://i.imgur.com/21gZgXs.png
* 2011 traffic stats: http://i.imgur.com/sSdTg.png

**Also THIS FRIDAY the monthly meetups return!**  r/Detroit's own 313HappyHour meetup group will be celebrating at the Skybar meetup from 5-7. This is a really great way to meet fellow redditors, take the conversations offline and make a few new friends- all are encouraged to come! More details can be found in the sidebar.

Also a lot of people wonder who exactly makes up r/Detroit so in lieu of reaching 5K, **next week we'll be posting a voluntary demographics survey**. A few questions about geographical region, gender, education, etc. to better understand the r/Detroit population.  Sound good?  When its posted please take a few minutes to fill it out and upvote for visibility.  Once the data is recorded ALL will be posted for all to see, individual responses will of course be anonymous.

Moving forward the goal is still the same, keep it simple and keep the sub open to all. Keep posting what's on your mind and if you have any ideas on how to make the sub better- post it in the comments!

As someone that's volunteered for patrols on a few different years, I have a feeling that this year is going to be pretty bad. Detroit currently has reduced police department, a vastly reduced fire department, and an extremely high number of abandoned homes and buildings. On top of that, tomorrow is expected to have extremely high winds due to Hurricane Sandy. All of these will likely contribute to a delayed response along with winds being able to feed and push any fires that are set.

If anyone has a high vantage point, feel free to take pictures tomorrow night and post them up on Imgur.",,False,,t5_2qkko,False,,,True,t3_129sva,http://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/129sva/remember_kids_tuesday_night_is_devils_night/,

My editorial: Detroit is in trouble and needs help. We can blame the current governor, past governors, mayors, city council, city residents, suburbanites, etc. But that won't fix it. Can we work together to fix one small part of it? Detroit's parks really are a gem.

To celebrate amassing 600+ subscribers- Phillip Laurie, founder of [Detroit Lives!](http://detroitlives.org) has agreed to do a special r/Detroit edition of AMA (Ask Me Anything) this Thursday.  More info on Phillip below:

*Philip Lauri, 28, is the founder and director of Detroit Lives!  The Woodbridge resident is concerned with revolutionizing the public image and functionality of Detroit. After delivering the commencement speech for his graduating class at Michigan State University, a lecture that focused on being decision makers, he made the decision to travel the globe for seven months.  Upon return, Chicago and Portland attempted to be Lauri’s home while he honed his professional craft in creative marketing with a few Fortune 500 companies.  But Detroit kept calling. Established in 2009, Detroit Lives! is a social brand and creative factory that is pushing to re-define the way that others perceive Detroit.  The brand uniquely manifests itself through a clothing line, filmmaking, public art and a blog.*


Stay tuned for the AMA tomorrow and thanks to everyone for continuing to upvote, upboat, reply, submit, comment, link, participate, subscribe, and being a part of this awesome community!

I'm just hoping to spark discussion- so please feel free to downvote this into oblivion for no reason. If you do read this though, you'll probably figure out why.**

I realize some of you Redditors live in the ""city"" (Metro areas, where it's significantly nicer) and have been for a few years. This is coming from someone who has never spent a year living away from the city-excluding college- and has been living here for decades. Please don't assume I'm just someone who came and spent 5 or so years in the city, or I'm someone from the suburbs. I'm just another person that's being unfairly looked down on for being a long-time resident of the city. Yeah, we're all people abusing welfare, stealing scrap from anything in sight, and carjacking people at gas-stations. *Even the ones who don't do any of that and are just trying to get out of the city.* To the ones that have spent long periods of time inner city, I assume you've seen the same problems.

All of these programs going in to help the city? They aren't actually here. This technology boom? Doesn't really have anything to do with Detroit proper. Things looking bright for downtown? It's going to get ruined anyway because you're ignoring the rest of the city. It doesn't matter if making it pretty for visitors will bring in revenue- the people stuck living in the city *will* destroy it because most of us are trapped here since everyone collectively assumes we're all incapable of doing honest work so instead of hiring some of us you hire someone else from somewhere else just because they're not from Detroit even though they're both equally competent.

Too many organizations are using Detroit as a media focal point to generate buzz for themselves instead of actually helping. Why not just say ""Detroit Suburbs"" (Metro Detroit includes the city proper. City proper isn't getting any help besides downtown which is going to go to shit because the people outside of downtown but still within city limits still don't get any attention so it needs to be excluded). Why don't we just change the name of the actual city to ""That Place From Robocop?""

""We should get the youth involved so the city gets better."" Great idea, but there's one problem. You're not gonna make the city any better by speaking to the suburban youth, or by going to the best parts of the actual city. Grow a pair of balls- come to the *bad* parts of the city and get the youth involved. Stop preaching to the choir- target the problem at it's roots. Oh, and it's not the child ""youth"" you need to look at. In fact, it's not the youth at all. You need to be looking at people aged 16 to 45- especially those at 26 and older. A 10 year old wont remember anything you tell them. You know what would really make the city better? Stop giving people looking for employment in the city but not actually living in it preference over people who actually live in the city and looking to work in the city. I'm looking directly at you, Quicken Loans and GM. I'd claim discrimination, but of course I can't afford it since I live in the city and no lawyer would bother taking on a large company just for the sake of a Detroit resident based on the idea that he might have been discriminated against for employment.

It's not like we could have people do all of the jobs nobody else wants to- like cleaning up the city roads, mowing grass of dilapidated buildings, collecting garbage and the like. Nope. Let's hire people outside of the city to do that stuff. Clearly nobody living in the city is competent enough to handle any of that stuff. Let's get people from the suburbs to do it- or even prisoners. One of the funniest things to me is how prisoners can get to do honest work, get better meals, and more options than a person looking to improve their situation. A cousin of mine is currently in a federal prison. Why, you ask? Because he (and I shit you not- HE SERIOUSLY SAID THIS) ""has a better life in prison than he ever did on the outside.""

Even the state hates us. Apparently the Michigan Lottery donates millions of dollars to to public schools all over the state. Quite funny how Detroit is one of the biggest (if not *the* biggest) city in the state, and our schools are STILL terrible and receive no funding. Parents in Detroit: don't send your children to a public school. Send them to a private or a charter school. Even if the public schools weren't corrupt as Nixon your child still wouldn't be able to get a quality education because of state requirements that we'd never have money to achieve. Oh, and the teachers don't really care since they're probably getting per year much less than they paid per semester to get their certificate to teach, and if they show signs of actually caring and holding a student back due to incompetence they'll lose their job. Don't even get me started on college students. Apparently the work I did while away at college had taxes taken out of it for being a Detroit resident... *while working 700+ miles away from Detroit.* All of my desperately needed college money taken by my city and they wont even do anything for me. I'm probably not going to be able to get a refund on that money, either. I'm surprised they didn't put their name on my degree in massive red font covering my name.

Maybe the National Guard should do the rest of the nation a favor and bomb us off of the face of the map since you all hate us so much. That way people like me who are nothing like the stereotypical ""Detroit resident"" no longer have to suffer the same fate as our moronic brethren. Or better yet, exile the ones who pass competency tests to a different country. I'm pretty sure I'd be happy of in the frozen north of remote Canada or even living out of a a forest in Germany. At least, much happier than I was in Detroit. It's sad that people someone with a genius-level IQ, uncanny athletic abilities, unrivaled imagination, or a mind for innovation could be stuck in a hole like non-downtown Detroit *just because their parents got shafted long before that child was even conceived.* I can't even mention how many people I've seen that could have actually done something good for the world slain, jailed, or otherwise victimized by the system because they couldn't get to the resources they needed to actually be something.

This might seem like I'm just ranting- because I am. I'm noticing my once-decent neighborhood be completely destroyed and because I wasn't born in a well-to-do family in a place with a good education system and good/fair employment options I'm stuck here unless I want to risk living out on the streets until I can hopefully land a job and housing somewhere far away- which would probably mean I'm going to die on the streets. Or maybe I should write a book about living ""in da hood"" and have it turned into a Madea movie, or become a rapper. Except I can't- since I don't have any experiences like that. I could try to join my neighborhood alliance and help out- but tried that I've heard nothing from them in weeks so apparently they don't need my help at all. I would take action on my own, but one person wont change anything and I still have my own things to deal with. The return on investment is way too low for just one person, but since I'm one of the ""forsaken"" I'd probably spend more time looking for help that I would getting things done. The only programs I can join to help the city don't actually service my part of the city- which is one of the 'bad' parts. THE PARTS THAT ACTUALLY NEED THE HELP. I've tried contacting city officials, too. I've been blown off and ignored. Even someone who was running for city office who originally seemed to be interested in what I had to say before primaries turned out to be just as corrupt as everyone city official. I've tried contacting companies, Oprah, city officials, the White House, neighboors... nobody really cares about us Detroiters. Not even our fellow Detroiters.

This is the first and last time I'm going to rant here because I know Reddit just wants to see regurgitated pictures of ""cute"" stuff collected from Google images (you guys aren't fooling anybody. A good majority of the stuff that makes front page has been on the net for about 5+ years), reposts, and ""TIL facts"" that anyone who even hits the random button on Wikipedia could find out. The only reason I posted this in Detroit is because you guys are probably the only ones who *might* read it just to see what your fellow Detroiters think about all this attention the city's been getting recently. I can let you know that I am not a fan of the attention, since I see where the attention is aimed at and I know it wont benefit me at all since I'm a resident of inner-city Detroit. I plan on starting up a blog about the things that REALLY happen in Detroit... not that it'll ever generate any buzz, but at least I *might* be able to show people how Detroit proper really is to at least TRY to break the stereotypes and spark action from it's residents.

**Tl;dr**- Everyone still hates inner-city residents for no logical reason- and it's part of the problem with the area as a whole... The other part being the idiots giving others a reason to hate EVERYONE in the city.

**EDIT** Wow, I didn't expect this many responses. Keep speaking your mind, fellow Detroiters! I'll try to answer to everything you guys throw at me to the best of my ability.",,False,,t5_2qkko,1346662018.0,,,True,t3_z9hcc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/z9hcc/im_noticing_that_not_too_many_people_know_much/,

I've seen a couple posts recently regarding the course, and I hope my fellow redditors respect their wishes.

&gt; Everybody,
&gt; 
&gt; We know that you are very eager to play this course, and we apologize for all the fanfare of a grand opening to be followed with the current complications of the course being locked. We have been hearing that people have been breaking in and playing it anyhow. Somebody, although it has not been confirmed as a disc golfer, even cut the lock off of the gate. Please understand that in doing these things you are putting the future of the course at risk. We are very confident that we will have everything worked out shortly. In the meantime however, we need to be respectful of the park and their requests. They have been very good to us over the last two years and we have been talking up what a great group the disc golf community is. If you hear of somebody planning to play the course right now, please remind them that our ability to keep it open in the future relies on our cooperation with the park right now. Petty acts of civil disobedience put everyone's privilege of playing this course at risk. As always, we are working hard to make this course a reality and we appreciate your support and cooperation. Please let us know if you see or hear of anybody trespassing on the property so we can notify the park.
&gt;

I just wanted to let any local PC gamers know that we're hosting the 9th annual [Expo Icrontic](http://icrontic.com/article/expo-icrontic-2012) in Warren from June 20th-24th; it's an extravaganza of LAN gaming, a Detroit food tour, golfing, Magic: The Gathering, boardgaming tournaments, and more (duct tape challenge, movie screenings, etc.). It's a con celebrating the geek lifestyle.

The premiere event is the BYOC LAN party. Team Fortress 2 is the most popular event, and we routinely have two full 24-player servers in a tournament bracket. The TF2 tourney is *insanely* fun.  We'll also have Tribes: Ascend (pending availability of the dedicated server, but that's said to be coming shortly), and we usually play UT2K4 because it's still fun in a LAN after all these years.

We have industry reps from THQ, AMD, OCZ, and Verizon attending, so expect some cool swag and availability of experts for upgrade advice, hardware discussion, or just general geeking out. 

**update:** I see that LoL is a very popular game. It's also very popular in the Icrontic community, but it's just not an organized, *official* game we play. I can guarantee that people will be playing it all over the place, though in random pickup games.

It started off as a community event, but it's grown into something bigger, and I figured I'd share with my other favorite online community :)

The turnout was great, maybe 25 people despite the rain, lightning, and thunder. 

We mowed quite a bit of the park, I'm guessing over half the park (it's 36 acres) and cleaned up a lot of trash. Volunteers also pulled out a bunch of downed limbs.

And we drank some beer. Many thanks to Woodward Avenue Brewers for the refreshments.

A shout out to LeftDetroitThrowAway for helping out.

Tom Nardone took a broken basketball backboard home to try to fix it and a local dude is going to help reinstall it.

Next event is on Wednesday, May 1, 5:30pm.  It's on facebook at [https://www.facebook.com/events/454297757969318/](https://www.facebook.com/events/454297757969318/)

Get me up to speed.,34,6,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/118tuz/reddit_may_have_inspired_me_to_start_a_business/,"[This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/117ffi/6_cities_that_will_pay_you_to_live_there/) in /r/Frugal may have just inspired me to start a business in the city of Detroit.  I currently live in Boston, and have been working on opening a facility here for the last few years.  Land prices are through the roof, the space available is far from ideal and the amount of startup capital I have is no where near sufficient.

After reading some of the comments in that post and doing some quick real estate research, I was blown away with the spaces potentially available.  I know crime and the economy are bad, but honestly, I'm pretty confident my business would succeed.  Not only would my lease be all but non-existent compared to my prior estimates, but there also seems to be relatively little in the way of competition.  So before I start calling brokers and booking a plane ticket, can you guys get me up to speed about the city?

* What is the West Side Industrial Area and Delray (near Historic Fort Wayne) like?  I saw some great warehouse space online in those two areas.  They seem to be minutes from downtown and right off major highways.  Are these abandoned or high-crime areas?

* How active is downtown on weekends?  I've read a lot of people live outside the city.  Do people come downtown at all for activities not related to pro sports?

* I see a lot of folks and organizations promoting small business, but how receptive is the government?  Especially when giving out variances?  I'm looking to build a business with retail level traffic in an industrial area (because of building needs).  Is the general philosophy to welcome anyone with an idea and money, or will I run up against a lot of push back (A problem I have here in Massachusetts).

I'm sure I'll have some more questions, but I'd love your thoughts.  Thanks

My husband read the article in Forbes about the most miserable cities and mentioned, half in jest, that I'd probably get all the opportunities I wanted to be a trauma nurse in a place with such a high crime rate. Not knowing a single thing about Detroit I started googling but quickly got distracted by real estate. Which led me to this gem: http://www.trulia.com/property/3108079600-3985-Trumbull-St-Detroit-MI-48208

That house is fucking awesome.

So now I'm honestly considering Detroit for our next adventure (I've never been east of New Mexico so at the very least I still need to visit, but having grown up on the west coast I think it would be nice to move to the other end of the country.) It looks like the Detroit Medical Center has a ton of jobs, my husband doesn't work so that's not an issue, and I like to live close to work because I don't drive.

So /r/Detroit, teach me what I can't glean from wikipedia. Why is moving to Detroit a good/bad idea?

* [Breakfast with Strangers](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com) 
* [Our video for the project](http://vimeo.com/43216845) 

If you are interested then please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA for 5 months this summer. We posted a few months ago our beta version and had a ton of great responses from the Reddit community. We will be in Michigan during mid-Sept. and looking to find great people now. 

**The Details &amp; Route**

On July 18, 2012 we’ll hit the road from Portland, OR bound for Portland, ME and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, we’ll blend old-fashioned and contemporary connection as we seek out strangers in a variety of ways: bulletin boards, classifieds, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, CouchSurfing, pure chance, and more. We’ll build community and engage local media outlets along the way.

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, learning what our new friends think about life’s big and little questions. We’ll chronicle these conversations in our blog so that strangers can meet strangers—virtually. Our project will foster connection, conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Conversation:**

This journey is a conversation. We’ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions, but our hope is that the conversation will continue long after the breakfast dishes are cleared. How? We’ll start here and see where it ripples out:

* www.breakfastwithstrangers.com
* www.facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers
* www.twitter.com/#!/BWS50Meals

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book, Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. We will donate 10 percent of the book’s proceeds to Servas US, a non-profit organization promoting peace through travel and relationship-building.

The most important outcome of all: the reminder that we are all part of a larger community.
Thanks for your consideration,

**Matt &amp; Courtney**
