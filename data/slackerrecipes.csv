* Ice Cream


Put two big tablespoons of Nutella into the bowl, followed by a teaspoon of ice cream. You just want enough ice cream to make the Nutella easy enough to stir. If you add too much, you'll end up with Nutella syrup.

Throw it in the microwave just long enough to melt the ice cream (~15 seconds on high).

Take it out of the microwave and stir vigorously with a spoon.

As it begins to boil, add a few splashes of soy, 1 1/2 Tablespoon of peanut butter, 1/2 a Teaspoon of garlic powder, a generous squirt or two of sriracha, and the broken up contents of two ramen packets (I used the flavor packet from one). Cover, bring down the heat, and let simmer for 10 minutes or until desired consistency is reached, mixing occasionally. Squirt a bit of lemon/lime juice on top. And them get you some.

Starting with tuna from a can.,73,10,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/slackerrecipes/comments/10nisr/i_dont_see_posts_frequently_enough_on_here_im/,"I used to never cook, aside from microwaving quesadillas and frozen dinners. I was afraid to bbq, because I didn't know what the hell I was doing and didn't want to ruin food and look like an idiot. I didn't know you needed to PREHEAT the BBQ for ten minutes, until a roommate pointed it out. Well, that's since changed, and over the past 5 years I've gone from knowing absolutely nothing to coming up with my own recipes and making food for large groups of people (that are frequently met with overwhelming praise!). The biggest deal is IMPROVISING and not following directions to the letter. That's how you figure out what works, and get over your fear or helps with the intimidation of cooking.

So, in an effort to catalog everything I want to remember, and help out others like myself, I'm going to start posting here for everyone to enjoy! Even if some things are relatively simple, some of them just didn't occur to me until I was shown or did it on accident.

So, for starters, I'd like to share my version of tuna, either for making a salad or for sandwiches. 

First off, I ALWAYS use the GOLD CAN BUMBLEBEE TUNA. It's much tastier than any of the other varieties I've tried, and SOLID TUNA is far superior to chunk.

So, proceed as follows:

- Squeeze all the icky tuna fluid out of the can. 
- Dump into a bowl, and squirt on some lemon juice. Enough to lightly cover the tuna.
- Generously cover with lemon pepper. You'll know if you put too much or too little after your first try.
- Mix in a few gobs of veganaise. I prefer it to regular mayo, myself. Give it a try!

Mix it all together, and you're done with the tuna base. For sandwiches, the way I make it is...:

- tuna
- cheddar cheese, per normal sandwich proportions
- an onion slice, whichever is your favorite
- spinach
- deli mustard

This yields a fantastic sandwich. Enjoy.

One word of caution: You might feel the need to mix the peanut butter and scriracha first, but don't do that! The sriracha is the last thing to add.

Items needed: 1 Package of Ramen Noodles, any flavor

1 egg

2 strips of bacon

Hot Chili Sauce (Siracha works awesome)

Sesame Seed oil, or Canola Oil

Garlic Powder

Onion Powder

Pepper

Soy Sauce (save those Chinese take out packets!)

Cook your ramen (microwave or stove top) to your liking and drain. While ramen is cooking, cook your bacon in a pan to your desired level of doneness. Leave the bacon fat in the pan. Remove the bacon strips and put on a plate, and once cool break into pieces. Mix your bacon, chili sauce, oil, seasonings, 1/2 ramen seasoning packet, and your soy sauce completely into your noodles. I don't give amounts because you should just do it to taste so if you like it spicy add more chili sauce - and be careful on your oils and soy sauce, as a little goes a long way. Dump the noodles into the pan (over medium heat) with the bacon fat. Move them around so as much touches the pan as possible. Allow to crisp up (check a corner every few moments to see if it is browning) and then flip over - either like a pancake or in chunks with tongs/spatula. Let the other side get crispy. Then, transfer the noodles to a plate. Finally, fry an egg in your pan but let the yolk remain runny. Put the egg over the noodles and eat the fuck out of it. Break that yolk and let it become the delicious happy sauce of joy.

Variations: Try beating your egg and dumping it into your noodles while cooking in the pan for a scrambled egg (similar to fried rice) version. Add other seasonings!

You can save yourself a fortune on ordering a steamer, and can save yourself a load of time trying to steam in the microwave or stove-top.  These recipes take anywhere from 5-10 minutes, in perfect Slacker Recipe style.

You can easily steam the following things in a Coffee Maker.  *Do not use a coffee filter.*

Some of these require multiple pass-throughs, but even that is open to how tender you want your food:

* **Noodles**: This works for Macaroni (DO NOT ADD THE CHEESE POWDER WHILE IT'S STILL IN THE COFFEE MAKER!), Ramen Noodles and a plethora of other types of noodles.  Simply put the desired amount of noodles (about 1 serving) into the coffee pot, put about enough water in to submerge your noodles and let it run through.  Let the noodles soak for about 3-5 minutes, then drain and add any other ingredients you want (or seasoning).  If the noodles are too ""al dente"" (i.e. chewy) for your tastes, let them soak longer.

* **INSTANT RICE**: Place rice in the actual coffee pot.  Put the appropriate amount of water (see your instructions) into the tank and run through.  After water has finished filling the pot, leave the rice on the burner (with coffee pot lid closed) until it has absorbed most of the water.  Drain and enjoy!

* **OATMEAL**: Similar to the rice recipe. Put the oatmeal into the pot, add 4-5 ounces of water per oatmeal packet (or 1 cup of non-instant oatmeal).  For added flavor, add a tea bag, honey, salt, etc. to taste!

* **BOILED EGGS**: Put the eggs (GENTLY!) into the coffee pot, add enough water to submerge the eggs.  Allow the eggs to sit for a few minutes.  For Hard Boiled Eggs, allow them to sit for 10-12 minutes in the pot.

* **STEAMED VEGGIES**: This one is one of my favorites, because it's probably the easiest and quickest way to steam vegetables without spending a fortune on a vegetable steamer.  Place vegetables (Carrots, Broccoli, Potatoes, etc.) in the filter area of the coffee maker (but with no coffee filter).  Run through a whole pot of water.  Repeat water filtration for added tenderness.

There are even more options.  With this guide, you can likely steam/boil just about anything in your Coffee Pot.  Just be sure to clean it thoroughly afterward!",,False,self,t5_2rcw0,True,,,True,t3_a63hz,http://www.reddit.com/r/slackerrecipes/comments/a63hz/tips_the_coffee_maker_the_secret_weapon_in_any/,

If it's like mine and takes awhile to heat up, start early.


_________________

You'll need to make sure you've got the following:

    2 tablespoons favorite oil
    20oz ground turkey
    Half a head of garlic, crush it up into small parts
    1 white onion, dice it
    1 red onion, dice it
    1 green pepper, dice it
    3 tablespoons chili powder
    2 tablespoons red pepper flakes
    2 tablespoons smoked paprika
    2 tablespoons cumin
    1 28oz can of diced tomatoes (not sauce, not stewed)
    16oz can tomato paste
    Half a can of cheap beer      
    1 jalapeno, diced

You should have much of it on hand. If not, the rest is cheap. The turkey is the most expensive part, usually about $6 a pound. You can sub burger or sausage, but chorizo will fuck it up.

_________________

**1)** Pour the can of tomatoes into the crock pot, turn it on high. After about a half hour, you're ready to start.

**2)** Put half the oil into a large skillet and heat it up on medium. When it's hot, add the crushed garlic.

When it's getting a nice beige color, add the onions. Keep it moving with a wooden spoon till they start to get transparent. At that point, put 4/5th into the slow cooker.

**3)** Put the rest of the oil into the skillet and make it hot on a medium high heat. Keep it moving with what's left in there. When it's hot enough, add the turkey. Keep it moving with the wooden spoon till it's just started to brown.

Empty it all into the crock pot. Drop the jalapeño, smoked paprika, chili powder and cumin into it, too.

**4)** Back in the skillet, heat up the green pepper, tomato paste, and pepper flakes. Let it simmer for a half hour while the stuff in the crock pot stews.

**5)** Combine it all together into the crock pot. Stir it really well for about a minute. Cook it on high for four hours.

**6)** After that, reduce it to medium for another four. If you've got a programmable slow cooker, all the better.

**Equipment**

* George Foreman Grill:

This is awesome. Plug it in, put anything on it, and enjoy delicious food. Burgers, steaks, sandwiches, quesadillas, bacon, anything...

* Crock pot:

Similar to the George -- plug it in and put anything in. [Here](http://crockpot365.blogspot.com/2007/12/alphabetical-listing-of-recipes.html) is a good list of recipes, many of them really easy (pretty much dump ingredients in and wait all day).

* Fry pan:

You probably already have one of these, and if you don't, get one (unless you don't have a stove). There is no better way to make things like quesadillas, stir fry, and stuff (can't think of an example), and if/when you decide to not be a lazy chef, you will use it every day.

**Seasonings**

Add one or more of these to anything to make it better.

* Garlic powder

* Lawry's Seasoned Salt

* Frank's Red Hot

* Sriracha (cock sauce)

* Paprika

* Cinnamon

* Chili powder, ground red pepper, and crushed pepper flakes

* McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning

* Teriyaki Sauce

**Ingredients**

The standards like milk, eggs, butter, oil, flour, and sugar are good to have. Keep lots of cheese, bread, and meat and you can make many, many things easily.

I'll leave it to the rest of the subreddit for the recipes -- this is just a start.

A closing tip: Often, processed or frozen food can be made lots better by adding some other shit to it.

* Saucepan
* Something to stir with (spoon/spatula)
* Measuring Cup
* Teaspoon
* Shallow pan (9""x13"" should be big enough)
* Candy thermometer

**Ingredients**

* 1 Cup of golden syrup (I use Golden Syrup because it's better than corn syrup, but either will work fine)
* 1 Cup of sugar
* 4 tsp Baking Soda
* Enough butter to lightly coat the shallow pan

**Directions**

* Combine sugar and golden syrup in sauce pan.
* Bring to boil over medium heat stirring until sugar dissolves.
* Continue cooking without stirring to hard crack stage (305 degrees) or until mixture separates into hard and brittle threads when tested in very cold water.
* Remove from heat.
* Quickly stir in the baking soda and mix well. (important to note here, the mixture will expand rapidly. Be prepared for this to happen while stirring, and for the love of god, don't ever make candy naked. Molten sugar can be a disaster.)
* Pour into lightly buttered shallow pan (9"" x 13"").
* Cool and break into pieces.

Dice or slice the veggies and then toss those in too.

Once the potatoes are done, plop in the eggs and scramble em right in the pan as they're cooking. Mix it around with the potatoes so that it gets caked on to em.

**Here's what you'll need**:

* Two slices of bread (*your choice*)

* Cheese (*I used velveeta &amp; meunster because it's all we had at the time*)

* Butter/Margarine (*butter works better, IMO*)

* An egg

* Spices (*if desired, I use either fresh-ground pepper or [Nature's Seasons](http://www.meijer.com/assets/product_images/styles/xlarge/1001029_024600010580_A_400.jpg)*)

* Butter *both* sides of two slices of bread

* Place cheese(s) between the bread

* Heat frying pan and some butter (*get it sizzling*)

* Add sandwich

* Let it sizzle until you can shake the pan and the sandwich slides around (*you'll know it's ready to flip when you hear a scratching of toast-on-pan*)

* Flip the sandwich and repeat the previous step

(here is where the ""*Frenchification*"" comes in)

* Have the egg beaten and ready (*spices added, some Ranch Dressing goes nicely with it - like a milk substitute, it makes the eggs fluffier*)

* Remove the sandwich from the pan and place it in the bowl of scrambled egg (*a la French Toast*), make sure it's completely covered in egg and that it has absorbed as much as it can

* Flip the bowl upside-down so the sandwich &amp; leftover egg goes back into the hot pan (*easiest way to get the now-soggy sandwich out of the bowl, IMO*)

* Cook both sides of the sandwich

It's yellow because I add oil, but it's not really in the recipe.

You need:

* chicken meat
* rice
* spices 

What to do:

* 1. Turn on the oven(on max). Use the spices on the meat, put it in a pan and in the oven, cover it with foil. (it doesn't need oil, or water, or anything)
* 2. Wait 30 minutes, check if it's *almost* done. Remove the foil and add water (just enough to almost cover the meat---note that it depends on the size of your pan, if it's bigger, you need a lot less water in height. the water's for the rice, it does not have a big effect on the meat), add the rice.
* 3. Wait another 15 minutes. The key is to take it out when there's almost no water left, but the rice's still moist. Time might vary. 

Eat. Obviously, add salt, doesn't really matter when. You can add all kind of vegetables to the rice, or lemon juice, or whathever you want.

Now that I've discovered that pizza can easily be made at home on the grill, these conflicts are a thing of the past. The instructions that come with the pizza crusts indicate that the oven should be used, but I find the grill easier, and I think the finished product tastes more like a real pizza.

Start with pre-made pizza crust. Around here, most of the stores carry Boboli brand in packs of 2 8-inch crusts, which is just right for two people who like different toppings on their pizza. Spray or brush olive oil on the topping side of the crusts, and put them topping-side down onto a medium-low grill for two minutes. [I use one of these to spray olive oil onto them.](http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/product.asp?order_num=-1&amp;SKU=11318517)

Before you remove the crusts from the grill, spray or brush olive oil onto the side that's facing up. Then remove the crusts and add sauce and toppings. We use whatever pizza sauce is on sale. Less is more here; usually about 2 tablespoons does it for one of my pizzas. Once the pizzas are loaded up, put them back on the grill (topping-side up, naturally) for around 8 minutes or until they look done.

I can get these done faster than we can call for delivery, they're cheaper, and we both like them better. She thinks it's better than any pizza available locally.

**Ingredients:**

1 Pack Chicken Tenderloin (boneless, skinless, around 1 pound worth)

2 Large burrito shells

4 Slices Cheddar cheese

1 Jalapeno

Drop of olive oil

Seasonings (I used black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and paprika)


**Steps:**

1. Warm up and drop a splash of olive oil in a pan, add the chicken. Season this side with whatever you like, I like 
what's listed in the ingredients.

2. Make slices of your jalapeno, seeds and everything. Add that directly on top of the chicken. Let the flavors seeeep in.

3. Keeping the heat right around medium, wait 5ish minutes and then flip the chicken over. Rearrange jalapeno slices so they're all over the chicken again. Add more seasoning to this side if you want to.

4. Wait 5ish more minutes, once the chicken looks to be almost done, add 2 slices of cheddar to each burrito shell, microwave for 20 seconds to soften them up.

5. Check doneness of chicken, if it's not pink you're good to go. If you're unsure, wait another minute or 2.

6. Add chicken tenderloins to burrito shell on top of the melted cheese goodness. Spread some now well done 
jalapenos on top. Roll them like a burrito, get the ends tucked in to prevent drippage.

7. Dig in.


Makes 2 rather large burritos.

Just did this for V-day, my wife melted with joy

A heating element that can be plugged in at the table is the best, or for outdoors a small grill

It's as simple as raw meat, red wine, and chicken broth for the main course.  Equal parts chicken broth and any red wine for the broth; simple man's coq au vin.  I added salt after tasting, but that's me.  Put them in the pot and set it to low boil.

Side course was just Sharp Velveeta and sour cream for a cheese sauce.  Just don't use a gooey/rubbery cheese and it should be fine.  I tried Fontina and it turned into a brown tire at the bottom of the bowl.  Same thing though, put them in a different pot, but does not need to be as hot as the entree broth.

I have an actual fondue pot, but you can put a small pot on a hot-plate/grill for the same effect.  Just need to keep the entree broth bubbling, and/or the cheese sauce warm to hot.  My next attempt will be on a mini-grill, where I can have several saucepans across the grill-top filled with various experimental broths/dips, and also cooking and eating outdoors.  Win.

Dessert?  Fruit and chocolate.  I made mine with hershey's chocolate syrup and some white chocolate bars.  Don't try to add caramel.  I looked that up after a terrible failure and realized that hot liquid caramel is kind of an art.  Mine turned into some sort of fibrous plastic.  Maybe I used cheap caramel, I don't know.  Either way, use chocolate sauce and pure chocolate bars of any variety and just melt them down.

So I laid it all out in front of my wife using the fondue pot and a crock pot with a divided compartment.  Chocolate and cheese in the separated compartments of the crock, coq au vin in the pot.  Then I put out broccoli (steam in bag microwave), cut up raw steak, and fruit.  Outside of the cost of the appliances I can't even remember, whole bit cost me $25 and about 30 minutes to feed us both, and all I really did was pour stuff into hot things and wait before serving it next to raw/microwaved food.

Yet, my wife was looking at me like I was Lancelot.

EDIT: I don't know where I'm supposed to be more ""detailed"" as per the comment below, and he never responded, so I'm guessing he's never had fondue.  So here it is.  How to eat fondue.  You have boiling broth and hot dipping sauces in front of you.  You also have raw meat and fruits/vegetables.  Get a long fork and snag a piece of raw steak.  Set it in the wine broth and wait a minute for it to cook.  Remove from pot.

For the very basic farofa, you'll want to melt 3 spoons of (preferably unsalted) butter in a frying pan and add 1 spoon of salt and as much manioc/cassava flour as you want, all the while stirring it; the best point to stop adding it is when the mixture dries inside the pan while it's still hot and the grains get fully separated (see [this photo](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Wec6le1GUHc/T5QRj7Z7YiI/AAAAAAAADSE/Qv0TCeMEs90/s1600/farofa+basica.jpg) as reference). Don't forget to keep stirring!

Farofa in itself is great with fish, grilled or roasted meat, white rice and beans. You can also add all sorts of stuff in the mix, from chopped bacon and scrambled eggs to onions and chopped tomatoes. Adding a small amount of olive oil can also help.

As a born-and-raised brazilian, I like to eat farofa pure. But since this is /r/slackerrecipes, try cutting a few sausages in 1-inch-thick discs, frying them on olive oil and garlic and mixing it up. Great for lazy afternoon munchies.

* 1/2 cup split red lentils (if you use any other lentil, you'll have to pre-cook them)
* 1 onion
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 14 oz can stewed tomatoes (diced and crushed also work, *I guess*)
* Spices: garam masala, cayenne pepper, curry powder, salt &amp; pepper
* GINGER, ideally 1 tsp fresh grated, or 1/8 tsp dried

Rinse lentils and soak them in water for 1/2 hour. While they're soaking, dice the onion &amp; mince the garlic. Grate the ginger if you're using the fresh kind.

Saute onion and garlic (and fresh ginger if applicable) with olive oil in a skillet until the onion begins to turn translucent (but not at the expense of burning the garlic!). Now here's where it gets crazy: toss in those spices. I don't even know what the proportions are, I've made this so many times.

Stir it around for a second or two, until the spices start to smell **amazing**. 

Now, dump in the can of tomaters, juices and all. Deglaze the FUCK outta that pan. Let it heat up for a moment or two. NOW, FINALLY, add the lentils. Stir it all up real nice, cover the pan, simmer for 8 minutes on low. Then remove the lid, cook uncovered for another 3 minutes (or until enough moisture has evaporated to suit your tastes - if it gets too dry, add water or chicken/veg broth). 

Salt &amp; pepper to taste. Serve over rice or flatbread. 

PROTIP: if the lentil soak is JUST TOO MUCH TO HANDLE, use a 14 oz can of chickpeas, drained and washed. It's just as tasty.

*  Water
*  Beef Boulion
*  Garlic and Herb Spice
*  Garaam Masala
*  Egg
*  Sriacha (off-brand works ok)

Boil some water and cook the noodles.  While the noodles are cooking, put some water to the side and add some garlic and herb seasoning, Beef boulion and Garaam Masala (note, you want to make it into a ""sauce"" as opposed to a broth).  When the noodles are done cooking, toss them in the sauce and crack your egg on top (I feel like this and the sriracha really add something special to this).  And now, enjoy!

**Ingredients**

1 cup chopped broccoli, fresh or frozen

1/2 cup water

salt/pepper to taste

1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

1 teaspoon onion powder

crushed red pepper to taste (optional)

1/4 cup dried milk or 1/2 cup fresh milk, or a few tablespoons cream. whatever you have that's dairy and can make it creamy at the end.

Parmesan for sprinkling


**Method**

Take about a cup of chopped frozen broccoli, or fresh if you have it, and put it in a small saucepan with about half a cup of water. Cook on medium-high to high heat for about 10 minutes, with the lid on. It should be boiling/steaming the broccoli, basically.

Grab your potato masher and smoosh down the now soft broccoli into the size/texture you like for soup. Add a dash of garlic powder, a larger dash of onion powder, some salt and pepper. Continue cooking for about 2 minutes to cook the onion and garlic powders. At this point I also added a healthy dose of crushed red pepper to make it spicy, but to each his own.

Now add some sort of dairy. I had dried milk on hand, so I sprinkled in about a quarter cup of it. If you have regular milk, lower the heat and add about half a cup of milk. You'll just need to cook it a bit longer to cook off more of the water. Maybe another 4 minutes on low to medium-low heat. Not too hot or you'll scorch the milk.

Put in a bowl and sprinkle on some Parmesan cheese. Enjoy!


The *non-slacker* version of this would be to chop 1/4 cup onion, 1 clove of garlic, saute in some butter for a few minutes until translucent, splash in some white wine and cook for another 2 minutes, then add veggie or chicken stock and broccoli, boil the same as above, then use a blender to blend to a smoother consistency before adding cream and cheese.

Obviously you can increase/decrease the amounts of ingredients, this is just how I make it. Rough estimate for the cost is a little over £5. Can be frozen and reheated. If you want to do rice the lazy way (rice in bowl, kettle of water over rice, cover with pierced clingfilm, microwave), I won't judge you.
Not the most slacker of slackerrecipes, but it requires no skill whatsoever. Just throw stuff in a pan and cook until it looks done.

**What it made of?**

* 1 tin/carton of chopped tomatoes

* 1 tin of mixed pulses - usually chickpeas, soya beans, black-eyed beans, pinto beans, red kidney beans, adzuki beans, but you can use a tin of kidney beans if you prefer

* 4 sausages

* 1 onion

* ~200g wild rice - I say wild because I prefer the texture, taste, and appearance, but normal is fine

* 1 (bell) pepper

* 2 or 3 chilli peppers - depends on what sort they are and how hot you like it

* olive oil - you'll only need a tablespoon or so

* smoked paprika - optional, if you want it smoky

* chilli powder - optional, if you want it hot but don't have enough chillis to hand

* salad - optional, a handful of spinach, watercress and rocket goes well with just about anything

**What am I cooking it with?**

* Large saucepan (for the stew)

* Small saucepan (for the rice)

* Frying pan/grill (depends which way you prefer to cook sausages)

* Sharp knife (for defence against intruders)

* Wooden spoon (for defence against easily-intimidated intruders)

* Can opener (for defence against armoured intruders)


**What do I do with all that?**

Start the sausages frying or grilling. Remember to keep checking to see when you need to turn them. Don't worry about cutting one in half to see if it's cooked through, you'll be cutting them up later anyway.

Put the oil in the bottom of a saucepan, start heating that up.

Chop your onion - I recommend in half down the middle, then remove the top and bottom, and cut into strips lengthways.

Throw the onion strips into the oil, which should now be hot. Shake the pan now and then to move them around.

Chop your pepper. When the onion is starting to change colour (but before it's completely brown), throw that in as well. Again with the shaking.

Chop your chillis. When the onion is browned, add to the onion and pepper.

Pour the tin of tomatoes into the vegetable pan and turn the heat down until it's bubbling gently.

*Decision time! How hot/smoky do you want it? Add paprika and/or chilli powder here if you wish.

Bonus decision! If you really want to, add a dash of bourbon. It's kinda nice.*
Remember to give it a good stir if you add anything.

It's probably about time to start your rice going. Wash it, or don't - you can skim off the starch as it cooks. Put it in the small saucepan, add twice as much water as there is rice and a little salt, set it heating up.

Sausages should be done by now. Remember when I mentioned cutting them into pieces? Yeah, that. (Don't do this in the pan, it ruins the non-stick coating.) Put the pieces in with the veg and tomatoes.

*Protip: count the number of pieces you cut the sausages in to, otherwise the second serving tends to have way more than the first.*

Drain the water out of the tin of pulses, add that. Stir it occasionally.

Simmer the whole lot until the rice is done (it should be firmer than normal rice, but not crunchy).

Drain the rice. This is where it pays to have removed some of the excess starch.

Plate it up (it's good to have a warm plate - you can use it to cover the pan as it simmers).

Try to keep the salad separate - it's nice to have some cold leaves to munch on if your mouth gets too hot.

Done!

**Ingredients**

* Elbow macaroni
* 1 hotdog
* Frozen veggies
* Some milk
* Some flour
* Some butter
* 2 cups cheese
* Sriracha sauce

1. Bring some water to a boil. Toss in 1/2 lb. (8 fl. oz.) of elbow macaroni. Also toss in some frozen vegetables and a sliced-up hotdog.

2. Once that's all cooked, strain it. Cover the noodles while they're in the strainer if you're worried about em cooling down, cuz we're gonna use the pot they were just in to make the cheese sauce.

3. [Read this](http://allrecipes.com/howto/cheese-sauce-made-easy/). It basically tells you a bunch of ways to keep cheese from getting stringy, which was alway my biggest problem with homemade mac &amp; cheese cuz these long strands would hang down from my fork and get all tangled up in my beard (hello, ladies). So, read that link and pick out a few tips to make your cheese not stringy, and/or read on to see how I've been doing it.

4. Put a dab of butter or three into the pot. Coat the bottom with it and sprinkle in some spices to taste. If you're lazy, use one of those pre-mixed blends like Mrs. Dash. Add like a tablespoon of flour and a cup or two of milk. Stir occasionally until it thickens, then add 2 cups of cheese. A lot of people say the cheese needs to be cheddar. They are liars. I use marble jack all the time and it tastes just fine.

5. I hope you're reading fast, cuz as soon as you add the cheese *stir like you're life depends on it!* Don't let that cheese come to a stop for one second. It stops, you die. Only once the cheese is good and melted can you stop and add back the macaroni-veggie-hotdog mix from the strainer. Mix some more until it's all covered in gooey, delicious cheese.

Here's my attempt to recreate them, slackerly.

* Flour tortillas, fajita sized (you'll need something that's pretty thick and soft)

* Mozzarella cheese (this isn't in the original recipe, but whatever)
* Wok oil, or some kind of oil you'd pan fry with
* a pan

Heat the pan over medium-high, splash a tiny amount of oil into the pan. If you can, get some wok oil - it comes infused with ginger and garlic and makes everything taste awesome. Lay out two tortillas - put down a very thin layer of cheese on one tortilla, pour a thin layer of General Tso's sauce on top of the cheese, then cover with the other tortilla. Place in the pan and heat until golden brown with a few spots of black popping up, then flip over and heat the other side. If you're making multiple flatbreads (you will), make sure to put more wok oil into the pan before cooking the next one. The cheese melts and binds the two pieces together.

-honey
-cinnamon
-round cake pan or some other suitable baking sheet


The method:

Heat your oven to whatever the writing on the can of biscuits recommends. Put a generous layer of honey in the bottom of the cake pan or baking sheet. Sprinkle some cinnamon onto the honey. Place the uncooked biscuits on top of the honey/cinnamon puddle, arranging them so they are all touching each other. Bake in the oven until the biscuits are done, which should take about the same amount of time as the package directions dictate on whatever biscuits you happen to be utilizing for this purpose.

1258594668.0,21,self.slackerrecipes,a5v3c,Chicken.,23,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/slackerrecipes/comments/a5v3c/chicken/,"This subreddit has inspired me to share my awesome cooking ideas.

Chicken is extremely versatile, pretty cheap, and, most importantly, freaking easy to cook.

Boneless skinless breasts are my chicken product of choice, but they can be expensive, so everything here works just as well with thighs, wings, legs, etc. (dunno about nuggets -- just put some hot sauce on those)

Please keep your meat in the fridge (or frozen if it's more than a few days).

**Marinate**

This is the easiest way to get delicious chicken (breast, thigh, etc). Get some ziploc baggies and add:

* Italian dressing

* Teriyaki sauce (this can be salty, so dilute with water)

* Vinegar, oil, and some seasonings of your choice (McCormick has some awesome chicken seasonings)

Put the marinade and the chicken in a bag for a while, simple as that. The longer it sits, the more powerful the flavor will be. (Use the fridge if you don't want salmonella)

**Grill**

Get out your George Foreman or whatever and put the chicken on it until it is done.

**Bake**

Put some foil on a pan (so you don't have to clean it -- this is the extra-lazy step) and put the chicken in a 350 or so degree oven for about 50 minutes (until it is done), turning it over once.

**Fry**

Dip your chicken in something like milk and eggs (or even water) and then dredge it in something like flour or bread crumbs (crushed potato chips are awesome). Heat some oil in a pan and throw the chicken on it, turning it over once the side is cooked.

**Boil**

Plain, boiled chicken breasts are extremely cheap and awesome with BBQ sauce and a microwaved potato. Put chicken in water and get water hot.

**Microwave**

I haven't made chicken breasts in the microwave, but I'm sure it can be done with enough time and patience. What I have done is microwaved frozen chicken wings -- it will take a while and they won't be crispy, but they are delicious with garlic and hot sauce.


_________________________________________________

Once your meat is cooked, put whatever the fuck you want on it (Frank's is awesome, or bbq sauce, or A1) and eat it with something good (microwave a potato for 5 minutes, add cheese, sour cream, and salt and pepper or steak seasoning).


**EDIT:** Forgot to add my favorite chicken-thing ever: Fried chicken strips with spicy garlic sauce. It's hard to prepare, but totally worth it: Bread and fry chicken breast strips, and mix Frank's with butter and garlic powder. Put the fried strips in a pan, pour the sauce over them, and bake for a while. They will be tender and delicious and awesome in every way ever.",,False,self,t5_2rcw0,True,,,True,t3_a5v3c,http://www.reddit.com/r/slackerrecipes/comments/a5v3c/chicken/,

Step 2: Buy some cheap Basmati rice in big quantities (so it's even cheaper). You can replace this with noodles (Asian ones or ""normal"" ones), but rice is cheaper and has less calories.

Step 3: Buy anything you want to go with that. Here's some of the combinations I've tried.
- Fish sticks
- Scampi
- Chicken
- Beef
- Vegetables (any vegetables, really, from beans to peas to potatoes to tomatoes, whatever, really). Also, combine those vegetables from any of the above.

Most of those are usually deep-fried and from places like Aldi, of course.

Step 4: cook the rice.

Step 5: put that other stuff in a pan, sauté it.

(Step 5bis: if you feel like it, you can even put the cooked rice in the pan for a few minutes to sauté it, but it's not necessary. If you don't it's more watery, which can be nice, too. Your choice.)

Step 6: put all of it in a soup plate or something.

Step 7: put a SHITLOAD of Sriracha (disclaimer: the first time you use ""real"" Sriracha, maybe tone it down a little. You might die, I won't be responsible.) on it.

",20,4,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/slackerrecipes/comments/ukw18/garlic_butter_canned_asparagus_and_artichoke/,"Picture: http://i.imgur.com/VGTXU.jpg

First time posting here, created this out of the limited supply of food left in my pantry. I think it's pretty slackery, but if you disagree let me know, I wasn't sure whether it would be better for budgetfood or elsewhere :)

This isn’t exactly a specific recipe but I’d say by my measurements I made about 2 servings. I have leftover pasta but ate all the vegetables—but I’m pretty sure I just overate all the vegetables :)

Ingredients (that I used)
-	½ Vegetable Rotini, ½ Whole Wheat Rotini 
-	½ a can of asparagus 
-	½ jar of artichoke hearts 
-	Roughly 1 tablespoon butter (maybe a bit more)
-	2/3 tablespoon of minced garlic from a jar 

I used a random smattering of the following spices
-	Garlic powder (Probably unnecessary but I am an addict)
-	Onion powder (fairly small amount)
-	Italian Seasoning
-	A pinch of some of the seasonings from one of those bread seasoning packs
-	Crushed red pepper flakes (small amount)

I feel like this is very open to interpretation, but what I did was put the rotini on first,
Then put the butter in the pan on low to begin melting while I put the canned asparagus on a paper towel to dry it out a bit. I would recommend using more stalky parts than the tips because otherwise it can become a big clump in the pan, but make sure to include some for flavor. I added these, the minced garlic and the artichoke hearts at roughly the same time. The spaces I slowly added while it was cooking, but it probably doesn’t really matter. I cooked the vegetables until they became a tiny bit browned.

It took the same amount of time to cook the vegetables for me as it did for the rotini to be finished.

I drained the rotini and put the veggies over it on the plate and let it cool for a minute while I melted some additional  butter and garlic in a pan to drizzle over the dish.

Since I have leftover asparagus but no more artichoke hearts tomorrow I am going to try replacing it with broccoli.

Feel free to make suggestions and hope someone enjoys!

You smell it, and you realize it's about to turn, with maybe a day or so left. What do you do?

You can't re-freeze it with hopes of re-thawing it later, that will cause harmful bacteria to form and make the meat inedible.

You could try eating it all before it goes bad, but depending on the amount, this might not be feasible.

You could give it away, but that should be a last resort.

One trick I discovered is to prepare the meat in a way that can go into a variety of dishes, and cook it thoroughly, but without any browning. For instance, with chicken breast, I cut it up into little chunks, and cooked it until it was white all the way through (no pink remaining) but not until it has a golden brown crust. Then it goes back into the fridge and can be used for recipes as per usual.

IMO these are very good, you can replace pork with other meat items. Hotdog was suggested earlier, I don't think I recommend it. Add seasoning salt to pork if you please. Depending on how much pork  you cook, just refrigerate and make more through the week.

The basic recipe is the following, adjust it as you like (as I have never followed it precisely and always forgot what quantities I used):

+ Cream:

8 table spoons of flour;

6 table spoons of sugar;

3 table spoons of cocoa - the better the quality, the more delicious the cream;

150-200ml of milk (about a glass of milk);

100-200g of butter/margarine (half a pack is good enough though);

grated coconut;

whatever essences you like, I use about a table spoon of rum essence or none whatsoever.

+ 3 (or more) packs of not-so-hard biscuits, [these](http://img.garbo.ro/images/uploads/biscuittop.jpg) are the best kind.

You put the flour, sugar, cocoa and half the milk in a deep pan on the stove at medium-high and mix continuously with a wooden spoon. If/when it gets too hard and sticks to the spoon, add more milk and keep stirring until it gets creamy. Get it off the stove, add the butter/margarine and stir until melted. Easy chocolate cream, I usually end up eating half of it before I can get to the biscuits.

Now you have two options, the easy or the pretty way: 

1. Easy way, or what I usually do: break the biscuits in small pieces and incorporate them in the cream with the spoon, as many biscuits as you like/can. Then you pour everything in a large glass pan (or whatever you like, I prefer glass) and sprinkle tons of grated coconut on it. It should be left to cool and have the biscuits moistened in the cream. I love it just out of the refrigerator.

2. Pretty way: in a glass pan (I like glass pans, sue me) you put a thick layer of cream, a layer of biscuits, another layer of cream and so on and so forth until you're done with the cream or biscuits. Sprinkle grated coconut on everything, leave it to cool and you're done.

The easy one looks like a delicious delicious creamy mess, while the pretty one ends up looking like [this](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hQO1O3FRGlM/Sa7fMG8HYeI/AAAAAAAAAeQ/29dpMmivRgE/IMG_2609_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg?imgmax=800) and it tastes even better.

It's much better than it sounds :),13,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/slackerrecipes/comments/b5lgv/veggie_mash_wrap_its_much_better_than_it_sounds/,"I made this burrito-style wrap recently when I had very little refried beans, but a good amount of canned vegetables.

I realized that the peas and green beans I had could be mashed up, and could therefore have a similar consistency to the refried beans.  So, I took a spoon and a bowl and mashed the two veggies together, then for extra texture, I added some corn.  The rest is history... or, at least, the rest is this recipe:

INGREDIENTS

* 1 Cup Peas
* 1/2 Cup Green Beans
* 1/2 Cup Corn (optional)
* 1/2 Cup Refried Beans (optional)
* 1 Tortilla
* 1/2 Cup Cheese
* 1/2 Cup Salsa (optional)
* 1 Bowl
* 1 Plate

Combine the green beans, peas and corn into the bowl.  Mash to a paste (except for the optional corn) and add seasonings to taste.  Add refried beans to the veggie mix, then stir thoroughly until mixed.  Don't mind the color, it's the flavor that counts!

Spread onto tortilla, sprinkle on cheese and salsa.  Microwave open-face (i.e. without folding) for 1 minute or until cheese is melted.

Fold burrito/wrap, like so:

Roll bottom of the circle up about 1/4 of the way, then fold the left and right side 1/3 of the way.  Take the bottom and continue to roll upward until burrito/wrap is fully closed on all sides. 

Enjoy.  For added flavor and crisp, lightly butter a skillet, crank up the heat and brown either side of the burrito/wrap lightly.  30 seconds on each side is usually sufficient, depending on the temperature of the skillet.",,False,self,t5_2rcw0,False,,,True,t3_b5lgv,http://www.reddit.com/r/slackerrecipes/comments/b5lgv/veggie_mash_wrap_its_much_better_than_it_sounds/,

Instructions: 

1) Procure a bowl, or some other kind of mixing vessel.

2) Into bowl: one can of tuna (I prefer the kind preserved in olive oil).

3) Into bowl: the edible contents of one ripe avocado. The avocado serves as a delicious and healthy substitute for mayonnaise. 

4) Optional: Into bowl: a spoonful of hummus. I recommend garlic hummus, if you're into that kind of thing.

5) Mix ingredients thoroughly, to the point of desired avocado chunkiness.

That's it. From here, the possibilities are endless... maybe spread some on some buttered bread, layer on some sliced cheese, pan fry until the bread is golden brown and the cheese is melty? Or broil until melty and delicious? Or if that's too many steps, just spread onto some bread and toast in a toaster oven, until melty and delicious? 

Note: I'm not 100% sure on this, but from my experience with avocado, I'd say: probably better not to keep this in the fridge for too long, avocado exposed to air has a tendency to become brown.


Edit: I forgot to mention, this amount of tuna salad will generally serve more than just one person, so if you find yourself with a surplus of salad, I recommend using it as a delicious dip! for bagel chips, pita chips, whatever. But I'd go with bagel chips. Or, if you're into hot dips, maybe sprinkle a layer of shredded cheese on top, and microwave for a bit (in a microwave safe bowl).

In the end I managed to rustle up some very old forgotten penne pasta which I part boiled.  I put the mussels in a pan with some oil for 5 minutes then added the part boiled pasta.  I gave it a stir and then added garlic paste and primula tube cheese, (I know, I live the luxury life!)  Stirred once more, tasted and added salt.  The meal was pretty ''meh''.  It was hot, and I was hungry, so that was enough to overcome the blandness.  Next time I may add a couple of dashes of chili powder.

I mistakenly gave the impression that I had fresh mussels!  In fact they were the pre-shelled kind that sit in a supermarket chiller.  I have another pack of mussels and there is still some of that pasta though, so in the next couple of days I will try again.  I will read all these comments again, and ponder deeply.

This isn't remotely authentic, anyway.

You'll need:

* 0.5 to 1 lb smoked andouille or spicy Italian sausage (Pre-cooked is way easier to work with. Raw tastes better but you'll need more prep time.)
* Half pound of pasta (I go with farfalle... because I like saying ""farfalle"")
* Half an onion
* One red bell pepper
* Decent sized bunch of baby spinach
* Ground black pepper, cayenne pepper, and red pepper flakes
* Jar of Alfredo sauce
* Jar of pasta sauce (try to go with a basic marinara, nothing flavored)

Start cooking up your pasta. Cut up the sausage into coins, dice the onion and bell pepper. Add a few teaspoons of olive oil (not the good stuff) to a large saucepan or wok and toss the sausage on high heat until they have a light sear.

Add the onions and bell peppers and cook until the onions turn translucent. Turn down the heat a bit and add the alfredo sauce and marinara sauce; I haven't really measured this part, so my best guess is 3:1 ratio - honestly its up to you how creamy and tomato-y you want this to be.

When the whole thing starts to simmer, add the spinach - you'll need more than you think, as the spinach will wilt and take up significantly less volume. Add ground black pepper, cayenne pepper, and red pepper flake to taste. Strain your cooked pasta and add to your sauce. Toss the pasta until its nicely coated. Serve!

To be honest, I only half remember it:


* Peel and then boil potatoes.
* Drain. 
* Shake them around in the pot a bit with the lid on (apparently this makes them taste nicer), 
* Put them in a suitable roasting dish and add butter.  
* Roast the fuck out of them.   Turn the potatoes over halfway through and continue to roast the fuck out of them.

Yesterday I followed that recipe, substituting oil for butter through laziness.  It didn't taste good.  I've done it before with oil instead of butter before and didn't taste as bad as this. 

Is there an easier way to do roast potatoes?  Peeling potatoes is already too much work for me, so this recipe already stretches me.  

**Edit:**  Ok I think I was boiling the potatoes for too long.  From what I've read below, you should only boil them for 5 mins..10 max.  Also I will cut out the peeling part.

I opened the cupboard and only saw a few boxes of macaroni, some ramen, one can of tomato sauce. Opened up the fridge saw some beer, butter, gatorade, bacon and some semi-old (not too old) garlic and onion (in the same plastic bag no less).

I decide, fuck it I'm going to make macaroni and tomato sauce, and maybe add some onions. Then I got real wild and thought - what if I make a pan of diced bacon, onions and garlic - and then add regular plain tomato sauce (I sprinkled some olive oil on top stupidly - forgetting that bacon grease would work the magic - but then realized afterwards that olive oil added a great flavor). 

The addition of bacon to a standard pasta recipe made the meal look legit and made me feel like a real chef.

So again, a breakdown of how to make it....

* Diced [2 slices of] bacon, onions and garlic on low heat, with a small bit of olive oil. 
* Let the bacon cook about halfway - then throw the can of tomato sauce directly in the pan.
* On the side cook your macaroni in a pot of boiling water (I had no salt, so this is now made with no salt).
* Drain the water, pour the immaculate sauce in the macaroni pot - and just like that- I've become a god damn super sexy chef. 

It will be used on my next ""come over for dinner"" date. I will update if it gets me laid.

Using a knife or spoon, spread out a thin layer of pesto onto your pizza crust. The pesto is a) delicious and b) provides a nice oily layer to prevent your sauce from making the crust soggy. Put down your sauce, cheese, and toppings. Anything goes for toppings. I personally like sauteed onions and peppers. Sprinkle basil, oregano, and crushed red pepper and/or black pepper. Bake for 10-15 minutes at 375F. Make sure to rotate the pizza around if your oven doesn't heat evenly.

Did I say that it was really cheap?",12,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/slackerrecipes/comments/a6lyj/rice_and_lentil_porridge_really_cheap_really_easy/,"As a result of my creation of that [rice and lentil](http://one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2009/10/rice-and-lentils-for-breakfast.html) dish a while back, I've been doing some more thinking and research, and this morning I made a rice and lentil porridge:

* 50ml White Rice (I used Basmati)
* 50ml Red Lentils
* 400ml Water
* 1 teaspoon powdered chicken stock (or 1 chicken stock cube)

 1. Place ingredients in saucepan.
 2. Heat to boiling point.
 3. Reduce heat to low, place lid on saucepan.
 4. Simmer for 25 minutes.
 5. Serve.

Notes:

* Serves one adult - adjust servings to fit the amount of people being cooked for (double for two people, triple for three people, etc)
* Powdered beef stock can be substituted for the chicken stock in the ingredients.
* Powdered vegetable stock can be substituted for the chicken stock in the ingredients, making it a truly vegetarian dish.
* I measured the rice and lentils by using a shot glass of each.

What I ended up with was a nice, tasty, savoury porridge. The lentils had disintegrated while the rice was engorged with water. While it was different in taste and consistency to regular porridge (what Americans call ""oatmeal"") the same proportion of dry ingredients to liquid is used, namely 4 parts liquid for every dry ingredient. For Oatmeal it is generally 4 parts water to one part oats.

Of course I have added lentils to the mix, and lentils pretty much act the same way as a grain when cooking. Lentils, however, are high in protein and when added to rice provide the body with a complete set of proteins that are missing if a person eats only staple food.

As I pointed out, though, what has interested me is the proportions. In my last rice/lentil post I gave instructions for a 2:1 liquid:dry ingredient ratio, and this was great for creating a fluffy rice and lentil dish. Today's recipe, however, doubles the amount of liquid (and that's the only real difference), which means that it produced a porridge consistency. As I did more research I discovered gruel, which seems to have an even greater proportion of liquid. Congee, a tasty Chinese gruel, appears to have an 8:1 liquid:dry ingredient ratio. I'll try to make that at some point, probably with short grain rice.

What I'm also going to experiment with is the use of other grains. If I replace the rice/oats with millet, barley, sorghum, maize or wheat, will I end up with the same sort of result (though different in taste and consistency)? Moreover, will the liquid:dry ingredient proportions remain the same?

Let me just end here by saying that this sort of food is exceptionally cheap to buy and cook. It is high in complex carbohydrate and protein, low in fat, and high in fibre.

Liquid:Dry Ingredient ratio

Steamed = 2:1

Porridge = 4:1

Gruel (Congee) = 8:1

Remove rice from heat source and add diced tomatoes (liquid and all DO NOT DRAIN) to the rice.  Stir rice to complete mixing process (no need to be quick about it) If rice is still wet simmer lightly to texture desired.

I've been told this is more of a tomato risotto than anything else, presentation wise I typically complete this with a grilled chicken breast on top and damn I love it. ",,False,self,t5_2rcw0,False,,,True,t3_a5y4f,http://www.reddit.com/r/slackerrecipes/comments/a5y4f/spicey_tomato_ricey/,

If you're an impatient lazy slacker like myself who likes the least amount of cooking (i.e., *order*ing instead), you probably order a lot of Chinese takeout and that's my main ingredient. Hope you like these.

**Tuna Rice** (microwave)

* Can of tuna (*in Oil* for best results)

* Leftover boxed rice (*cooked*, of course)

* 2 packets of soy sauce

Instructions: Empty contents of rice box onto bowl. Put tuna on top. Mix with 2 packets of soy sauce. Microwave for 2 minutes.

*Option 1: Add vinegar. 2 soy sauce to 1 vinegar ratio works best for me.*

*Option 2: If you don't like mixing the tuna into rice, you can put them in separate bowls, but I suggest mixing the soy sauce with the rice so that it doesn't dry up.*

**Sautéed Hot Dog** (pan)

* 2 - 3 hot dogs (defrosted, *sliced thinly*)

* 1/2 onion (sliced)

* Sriracha or 2 packets of hot sauce

* 2 packets of soy sauce

* Bit of oil

Instructions: Sauté the onion slices in oil until they're nice and brown. Add the hot dog slices, followed by the soy sauce and Sriracha/hot sauce. Mix thoroughly for another minute or so.

**Sweet &amp; Spicy Fried Rice** (microwave or pan)

* Leftover boxed rice (*cooked*)

* Leftover sauce from orange chicken or General Tso/Tsao/Gao's Chicken^1

* Sriracha or 2 packets of hot sauce

Instructions *(microwave)*: Mix rice in a bowl with the sauce from the orange chicken, as well as some Sriracha/hot sauce. Make sure there's enough sauce to go around. If there isn't enough, add some water or risk making the rice too dry. 1 teaspoon of water per cup of rice works for me.

Instructions *(pan)*: Warm a bit of oil then follow it up with the rice, sauce from the orange chicken, then hot sauce. Also good with powdered pepper from your favorite pizza joint.

Enjoy!

I made this through experimentation and it turned out surprisingly well.  Originally it was supposed to be pimped out pasta roni but it took on a life of its own and I skipped the box all together.  It's not a true marsala because there's no wine, but if it would probably be a baller to add if you are skilled enough to cook with wine or have some rossi laying around.

necessary shit:
whole container of fresh mushrooms.  A can of mushrooms might work.  
can of condensed cream of mushroom soup
olive oil
salt
either water, veggies, or milk.  I had zucchini and grape tomatoes, and I panicked for a second because all of a sudden I had all this water in the pan from the vegetables that I didn't have before, but the thickness of the soup made it all work. I had to add a splash of milk because I let too much veggie water boil up. but I digress.  A can of tomatoes would probably be prefect.  
advanced level additions: 
meat, if you swing that way
garlic
shallots
whatever veggies you want
white wine
steps: 
Garlic/shallots first in olive oil over medium heat, if you are rolling that way. Otherwise, just heat a glug of olive oil.  Lower medium heat that noise until it's soft and awesome.
add mushroom/veggies on lower heat, than cover and go do whatever.  Check on it every 5ish minutes until mushrooms are cooked.  If you didn't use veggies or a can of tomatoes (with juice!) add some water with the mushrooms.  I don't know how much, if you add too much just let that shit boil off. 
Add can of soup.
Mix it, the sauce should turn brown from mushroom juice.  Add whatever liquid you're using if you need loosen that shit up.  I was really tempted to try some v8 but I don't know if that would have worked. Oh and salt to taste.  I didn't have any salt and desperately wished that I had.  

remove from heat.

serve.  You could probably skip pasta all together if you add enough veggies and meat.   This may seem more complicated that it really is, essentially you just put it in one pan and try not to burn anything.

**STEP 1:**

* 2lbs Ground Beef

* 2 onions diced

*Heat a large stock pot over medium-high heat. Crumble the ground beef and onions into the hot pan, and cook until evenly browned. Drain off excess grease.*




**STEP 2:**

* 3 regular size cans of beans (I usually get 1 can of mixed beans and 2 cans of Red Kidney Beans) *don't forget to drain the juices first*

* 1 can of refried beans

* 1 large or 2 regular cans of diced tomatoes

* 1 can of tomato paste

*Add this stuff and cook for 10 minutes at medium heat*

* 5 cloves garlic finely chopped

* 2 red + 2 green chilli peppers (finely chopped)

* 2 Tbsp bacon bits

* 1 cup beer

* 4 cubes beef bouillon

*Add this stuff and stir for 5 minutes*



**STEP 4:**

* 1/8 cup chilli powder

* 2 Tbsp Worchestershire Sauce

* 1 Tbsp Dried Oregano

* 1 Tbsp Dried Basil

* 1 Tbsp Salt

* 1 Tbsp Pepper

* 1 tsp Cayenne Pepper

* 1 tsp paprika

* 1 tsp white sugar

*Add the spices and cook for about 2 hours on **low heat**, just high enough so the occasional bubble emerges, if there are too many bubbles, the heat is too high. If you are really lazy, don't have the spices or whatever, then just buy two packets of taco or mexican seasoning and use that instead of all the spcies listed above.*

Once done, taste and add any number of spices that you feel are missing.




Let it cool down before refrigerating and you'll have about 10-12 decent size servings. The chili tastes even better the next day when the flavors have melted together.

incredients:

* old stale rice, de-clumped (asian food leftovers, nonsticky medium/long grain white preferred)
* curry powder (try various kinds/blends, e.g. garam masala)
* peanut oil (more peanut aroma = better flavor, less peanut aroma = higher heat, both ok)
* garlic (optional, easiest through a garlicpress)
* salt
* egg (optional, pre-scrambled or cook it on the skillet, apart from the rice)
* fresh herbs (optional)
* other asian-ish flavors (sri-racha, soy sauce, sesame oil)

how to do it:

* heat the peanut oil (tablespoons, you want rice coated but not super oily) in a skillet/wok, get it hot (2 min on high/medhigh is good) 
* ""bloom"" the curry (and the garlic if you have some): add it to the hot oil and stir it around till you smell it strongly.  keep it moving or else it will burn.  this step should be 10-20s tops.
* quickly add the rice and keep stirring (make sure the spices/garlic don't burn).  heat should be on high/medhigh and keep it moving until it looks like fried rice.  a few grains of rice may pop like popcorn.  the rice should be a nice bright yellow color.  
* if you are adding egg, add the pretty well scrambled egg to the rice (adding raw egg to the frying rice makes for weird texture).
* add a pinch of salt and whatever other condiments/flavorings
* keep tasting it until you like it
* take a bunch of fresh herbs in your hand and snip some off using kitchen shears
* eat it.  

notes: 

* cast iron skillet gets nice and hot and gives you a bit of that ""stone bowl bibimbap"" crusty/delicious thing.
* be careful with soy sauce.  it's way too easy to pour in way too much.  same with asian fish sauce.  watery condiments aren't as good on this, can ruin the texture.  when i add soysauce, it's just a tiny capful for that brown color.
* obviously you can add other stuff (chicken, tofu, veggies, sausage), but this is a good base rice.
* if you're a regular rice eater, you'll NEVER throw out your rice again, and may start making/buying extra rice.  
* this can cost close to NOTHING.  curry is crazy cheap esp if you have asian/southasian grocery stores. when ppl order asian food, they often overorder rice so you can get it free.  fresh herbs like cilantro or green onion often come in quantities too great for a regular joe and they go to waste.
* i've tried this with week old rice and with day old rice, and everything in btwn.  those white take-out boxes are perfect for airing out the rice for nice dry grains.
* turmeric (the thing that makes curry yellow) is suspected of having anti-alzheimer's properties
* if you don't mind chopping onion, or have leftover chopped onions, add that to the hot oil first before garlic/onion.  it will hold more of the heat (it's full of water) and insulate the garlic and spices from burning.
* curry powder DOES go bad, as it loses its flavor.  smell the spices if you can, some stores will try to sell you years-old curry. 
* you definitely want dry rice.  if something is wet when you fry it, the water keeps the aromas and cooking oils from getting into the food, and causes some of the cooking to be ""steaming"" instead of frying.  fried rice should give each kernel a bit of crust, and not be glue-y at all.  when you saute fish or sear steaks, same thing holds true, a drier food surface will create that nice crust.
* remember, you can always add more salt/sriracha/soysauce/sesameoil.  overseasoning is the most common way to ruin fried rice.  
* if you substitute some asian rice noodles (buy dry, soak in h2o for 10 minutes) for the rice, you can have a singapore-style curry noodle!",,False,self,t5_2rcw0,True,,,True,t3_i95t7,http://www.reddit.com/r/slackerrecipes/comments/i95t7/curry_fried_rice/,

One of the first things I learned to do with it is make a sort of spicy pickle, but I've also used it on watermelon, mango, and chicken with success.

[This is it!](http://imgur.com/yOflv)

I've only found this particular variety at Albertsons, but I'm willing to bet they have this exact thing (or something equal to it) at a Mexican market. Plain chili powder won't do, and it's more expensive anyway. 

I should mention that these recipes don't have a set way to make them as your tastes may vary. Just start with what you think is right and go from there. It's easy to add more later, but much more difficult to take something back out again if you put too much in.

SPICY PICKLES

In my other post I mentioned a vegetable slicer. I highly suggest getting one, as it turns a 5 minute task into a 30 second task and those kinds of savings are priceless. You should get a vegetable peeler too while you're at it. Also, If you can pick up a few sets of those Lock-n-Lock containers they're simply amazing for making and keeping food. I make lots of food in the containers themselves to save time on cleanup. Hooray!

Mexican Spicy pickles require:

- Cucumber
- Tapatio
- Limes 
- Pico de gallo
- Salt (Margarita or kosher preferred!)

Peel the skin off a cucumber with the aforementioned peeler, and slice it completely up. Dump into a decent-sized container with a lid or a bowl that has room for swishing. You'll be doing some swishing, so it's important.

Squeeze in the juice of a lime, maybe two limes. You want enough to have the cucumber sit in. Cover with tapatio. Dust in the Pico de gallo. Cover and shake, or swish enough to mix and cover everything equally. Take a spicy slice, dip it in a little fancy salt and you're off for flavor country! I highly recommend AGAINST mixing the salt in with the cucumber, as it's easy to screw up by putting too much in. You do that and you just negated all those precious seconds you saved by getting the vegetable slicer in the first place.

and an AUTHENTIC MEXICAN CHICKEN MARINADE:

- Chicken breasts, or whatever you have
- Pico de gallo
- Sunny delight

Take chicken, put in bag, fill with enough Sunny D to cover and put in Pico de gallo. Shake and let sit for at least an hour. BBQ or simmer in a pan and cook like normal. (I'll come back to cooking chicken another time when I can take pictures and vouch for authenticity)

And finally, with the watermelon or mango, you just shake some on and eat. Maybe with a little lemon also. I swear it's fucking amazing. If you're of Mexican descent, you already know that most food with lemon and chili added are fucking amazing though.

Breakfast ahoy!,1,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/slackerrecipes/comments/1112w7/the_secret_to_pancakes_and_eggs_and_bacon/,"So you want to impress someone with a fancy breakfast and all you know is Pop-Tarts and Cap'n Crunch? Heard of something called Bisquick? That's great for when you're lazy, just add water and an egg and you've got batter, but we want something a little better. We're going to make pancakes from scratch. This is important. Do not skimp on ingredients, and make sure you're using the freshest everything possible, within reason of course. This is a breakfast to impress. If you have an iron skillet that's the win condition for this, but anything will work.

**BUTTERMILK PANCAKES**:

- 2 large eggs, brown
- 2 cups white flour
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 cups buttermilk
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract

USE FUCKING BUTTER AND NOT THAT MARGARINE SHIT. IT DOESN'T COOK RIGHT. Save that for toast, we want authentic ingredients this time.

I bet you've never bought buttermilk before. Every supermarket has it, and it's right next to the regular milk on the top by itself. One container makes about 2 batches of pancakes, IIRC.

I find it's easiest to melt the butter ahead of time in the microwave and mix it in with everything but the flour and buttermilk. Pour in the buttermilk, mix it up, and lastly mix in the flour 1 cup at a time. 

Heat the pan on a medium flame and get some more butter in there. Start melting in and spinning it around. We don't want the batter to stick. A measuring cup works best for pouring the batter in, as pouring the bowl into the pan leaves a bunch of shit on the side and makes a mess.

So, grab the measuring cup and pour some batter in. If you're making some for kids try to make fun shapes like cacti or walruses. It'll come out like a round and crappy amoeba, but act like it's a work of art anyway. It's about showmanship. Feel free to add more butter around the edges during the cooking process. Once you start seeing some bubbles through the top of the batter, flip the pancake over with a spatula. You'll know if you did it too soon or too late by the color. If it looks like you want to eat it, it's the right color. If not, do better next time. The first pancake is usually the test model anyway as it's the coldest one at end of the whole ordeal, and you're dialing the heat in the pan.

This is the most important part. You need to get yourself a genuine bottle of honest-to-goodness maple syrup from New York or Vermont. This is what's going to make it fucking magical. If you like breakfast, do it. It lasts forever, and you can keep it in the fridge. It's good for a quick pick-me-up right out of the bottle, too. I swear if you use that Mrs. Butterworth or Aunt Jemima crap you're dooming your breakfast to a world of pain and misery. DO IT. NO EXCEPTIONS. You came this far, go for broke. If you still refuse to buy it, at least get something non-maple, like one of those fruit pancake syrups. I had coconut syrup before. It was ok.

**EGGS**

We all have eaten eggs at some point in our lives, and they're usually pretty meh unless you have them in omelette form or something spectacular like that. We're going to change that. I'll give you three different ways to prepare them. Fried, scrambled, or hard-boiled.

HARD BOILED 

...is the easiest, and the easiest to screw up. It's simple, really. You take a pot of water, put in your requisite amount of eggs and begin heating it. Once it starts boiling, you're done. Try it once, then adjust for timing on subsequent eggs. DON'T PUT THEM IN AFTER THE WATER IS BOILING! They're going to be all hard and have that greenish-farty coating around the yolk and have a talcum powder consistency.

FRIED

I just learned this and have yet to perfect it, but the concept is sound. You start with heating 6 or so tbsp of vegetable oil in a pan. (The trick to knowing if oil is ready for cooking is by flicking some water in. If it spatters, it's ready. If not, it's not.) 

Heat the oil till it's just starting to get hot, then crack the eggs carefully in. You're going to take a spoon and start ladling the hot oil on top of the egg as it's cooking. The idea is to cook the top of the egg with the hot oil the same time you're cooking the bottom. It should only take a couple minutes till they're ready, and they should be fucking perfect when you're done. Sprinkle with fancy salt. Boom.

SCRAMBLED

EVERYONE has had scrambled eggs, but no one has had GOOD scrambled eggs. Here's the trick. With eggs in general, you don't want to cook them too quickly. So, you start with a cold non-stick pan instead of a hot one. When you mix up your eggs ahead of time, pour in a little milk, whole cream, or pre-heated butter. You need something to thin out the eggs a bit, and any of this works. Pour the eggs in a pan and begin heating over a medium flame. Every minute or so, take the pan off the flame and mix it up with the spatula. You'll be doing this constantly. Do this until they're finished, basically. It will be like nothing you've ever had before, and takes about 10-15 minutes if done right.

If you're on reddit, you know how to make bacon already. I always fuck mine up but it's always edible. I personally like getting bacon from the butcher at the counter. It's cheaper and thicker cut.

This is the perfect breakfast trifecta. The key to cooking well is getting it all to finish at the same time. Plus it makes you look like you know what you're doing. So, do everything on it's own once and time it, then when the big breakfast day arrives you'll know what to do.",,False,self,t5_2rcw0,False,,,True,t3_1112w7,http://www.reddit.com/r/slackerrecipes/comments/1112w7/the_secret_to_pancakes_and_eggs_and_bacon/,
1348903555.0,1,self.slackerrecipes,10nrss,Delicious breakfast tacos in ten minutes flat,1,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/slackerrecipes/comments/10nrss/delicious_breakfast_tacos_in_ten_minutes_flat/,"So, following [this guy's](http://www.reddit.com/r/slackerrecipes/comments/10nisr/i_dont_see_posts_frequently_enough_on_here_im/) lead, I'm going to post the thing I've been eating for breakfast pretty often now. I'm a relative cooking neophyte and I have often found cooking for myself tedious, hence this is aimed at those who find themselves in a similar situation. 

I'm Canadian but my trips to Texas have inspired me to revolutionize my bacon and eggs delivery methodology in a way that I suspect would make Ron Swanson proud. I noticed [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/slackerrecipes/comments/ypmks/easy_breakfast_burritos_xpost_rfrugal/) but honestly, microwaving eggs is really quite inferior to a few minutes in a pan in my opinion, and I've found that if I do things in the right order this can be really fast (the 10 minutes mentioned in the title).

I've ordered the instructions in approximately the order that has allowed me to get this over and done with as quickly as possible; yours will certainly vary a bit.

Non-food cooking pre-requisites:

 * A microwave
 * A stove
 * A pan of some kind (I use a stainless steel saucepan but whatever)
 * Two large plates for better time efficiency (at the expense of slightly more dishes to do)
 * one bowl (a mug will work in a pinch)
 * a fork
 * Paper towel

Ingredients:

 * Bacon (1 to 1.5 strips per taco) - I've started using the low sodium stuff and it tastes fine (still fatty though)
 * Large-size eggs (1 per taco)
 * 10-inch tortillas
 * Pre-grated Monterey Jack mix
 * some sort of pan grease (I like canola oil, pretty cheap and supposedly one of the better ones heart-wise)

Optional things that have worked well as additions in my trials:

 * black pepper
 * dijon mustard
 * hot sauce
 * jarred salsa

The cheese is key, both for additional taste (turning ""scrambled eggs and bacon wrapped in a tortilla"" into so much more) and for the ease and speed of pre-grated. I often buy the store-brand pre-grated stuff because, while it costs a tiny bit more, the Monterey Jack mix livens things up over just plain cheddar, and saves me both time grating the cheese and the frustration of cleaning the grater afterwards (I actually enjoy grating cheese, cleaning up is the annoying part). You could save yourself a few cents to a few dollars (depending how often you make these) by pre-grating a lot of cheese and leaving it in a zip-lock bag in your fridge.

----------------

**Setup/baconing** (5-6.5 minutes)

The order here is somewhat arbitrary but you should experiment with how long it takes you to do things. Obviously, as anyone who's ever watched 5 minutes of a cooking show knows, the key is to do stuff while you're waiting for other stuff to finish.

1. Lay out the strips of bacon parallel to each other between several sheets of paper towel (2-3 above, 2-3 below) on the first plate.
2. Turn on one of your stove burners to medium-low heat (I set my dial to about 4) and pour a *tiny* bit of canola oil into it. Tilt the pan around to coat the inner surface. Make sure to get the up the sides.
3. Shove the plate in and start microwaving the bacon on high for about 45-1:15 per strip. You'll have to experiment with this depending on your microwave's power and how crispy you like it.
4. Crack eggs into the bowl/mug and beat them with a fork. Bowl produces better results, in my opinion, if you know how to beat an egg properly. Basically you should poke all the yolks to get them running and then try and make a rapid circular motion up and down, as if you're rowing a boat, or turning a crank towards yourself. This lifts the egg up and gets some air bubbles into the mixture, which leads to a nice texture when you cook it. You can also use a [whisk](http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/images/products/ikea--hjalte-balloon-whisk__0107942_PE257740_S4.JPG) for this purpose but with some practice a fork is usually sufficient unless you're making a ton of eggs. Whisks are also kind of a pain to clean. This should take 40 seconds max with a fork.
5. Lay out tortillas on one plate, sprinkling shredded cheese over each.
6. The bacon should be about 2-3 minutes into cooking at this point and the pan should be fairly well heated up.

**Cooking the eggs and finishing up** (3.5-4.5 minutes)

1. Carefully pour the bowl/mug of beaten eggs into the pan. If it's hot enough you should hear a satisfying sizzle and see a layer of egg semi-solidify almost immediately. Since we're not making an omelette but rather some firm-ish scrambled eggs, crash this sizzling party with your fork, stirring the egg mixture round and round. Again, you can use a whisk, but the fork will do the job. Tilt the pan around to get the more liquidy parts directly onto the pan's surface.
2. After they've started to firm up (you don't see a lot of liquid egg), which should happen within about 60-90 seconds, your bacon should be finished. Pull that out of the microwave (careful, it's hot) and swap in the tortillas and cheese. Microwave the tortillas on high for about a minute. This will melt the cheese a little and warm up the tortilla (potentially also making it softer if it's stiffened because you left the bag open the last time...).
3. Pull the eggs off the heat -- about 2.5-3 minutes is all they need in my experience, and they continue to cook a little bit while not actively being heated. While the tortillas are microwaving, get the bacon out of the paper towel, which should have soaked up a good amount of the grease. I usually throw it in the pan with the eggs for temporary storage while I throw out the paper towel and toss the plate in the sink/quickly rinse it.
4. Pull tortillas out, place bacon in, distribute scrambled eggs into the tacos with your fork.

[The end result](http://i.imgur.com/ylLUQl.jpg) from one of my early attempts -- I usually make two, three when I'm really hungry/not anticipating eating lunch on time.

It takes a little bit of practice, but it can be done in 10 minutes -- I've timed myself. If you follow the order I've outlined and figure out the right microwave and stovetop settings it shouldn't take you more than 15 on the first few tries. The results are *much* better than microwaved eggs, sorry other guy.

Other notes:

 * If you've used enough grease then your pan should require *very* minimal scrubbing -- mainly needs a rinse and a quick wipe. The eggs should basically slide off of it. It doesn't take a lot of oil but you have to be sure to coat the pan rather thoroughly. Fill the pan with water and leave it on your stove (*off*, obviously) to soak. Anything stuck will come right off later on in the day.
 * If you use butter (I did once, when I was out of canola) be very careful not to burn it in the pan -- I find the animal fat burns a lot more easily.
 * If you like your scrambled eggs softer and fluffier you can cook them for longer over a lower heat, and use a whisk to get them nice and fluffy. If speed is critical the ""omelette-esque"" method I've described works better.
 * Some people will hate on cooking bacon in the microwave. I contend that it is the best compromise between ease, speed, and grease-reduction (via the paper towels absorbing it). More cooking time + paper towels plus a thorough patting down after cooking can further cut down on the greasiness of your bacon. If you eventually want to get fancy (and have a really simple, brain-dead way to cook lots of meats and vegetables) sink $30 into a George Foreman Grill.
 * I've estimated the cost per taco at about $0.80 - $0.90, since I'm in Canada where I pay about $6 tax for just over a pound (500g) of bacon, and cheese is expensive enough that [a cottage industry has appeared around illegally importing it from the US](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/09/27/161917296/cheese-smuggling-ring-is-brought-down-in-canda).

Lazy person's recipe:

Get a half ham (should be 5-7 lbs.) that has been smoked and cured, but isn't already cooked. Get some oven bags (they're plastic, look for them near the foil) and a can of Coke.

Stick the ham in an oven bag, pour a can of Coke over it, and close the bag. Stick the bag with the ham in it into a roasting pan.

Bake at 325 F for about 2 1/2 hours. Internal temp should reach 160 F.

Serve hot (good with a potato dish and a green vegetable) or cold (make sandwiches or serve with yeast rolls). People go apeshit for this, and it takes almost no work.

3/4 - 1 LB of ground beef. (see comments)  
30 oz of drained canned beans. (Two 15oz cans or 1 30oz can)  
Salsa. (see comments)  
A healthy amount of pepper.

A bit of clarification on this recipe. The salsa is basically there for spicyness and flavor. You can either go small jar for less spicyness or a larger one if you want more. If you are unsure what would be too spicy I would say a mild spicyness level would be either a tall jar of mild salsa or a short jar of medium salsa.

With the beef it tastes better the more you have so you would just want to buy what you can afford. I tend to find the cheapest prepackaged thing in the meat section which tends to be ~2/3 or 3/4 of a pound.

With pepper its the same as the salsa. Just use as much as tastes good. I tend to add maybe a little under a tablespoon? Haven't ever measured it. I shake till a pretty decent coating on top of pan ingredients then stir in. Can optionally add at the time of eating instead of in pan.

**Cooking instructions:**  
I tend to cook all of this on High to cook faster.

Cook the beef until browned (i.e. its cooked)  
Drain off grease (another preference, drain as much or little as you like)  
Drain the bean cans and add to pan, add salsa, add pepper  
Cook until warm/hot  

**Reheating:**
I store leftovers in a bread loaf pan/ brownie pan covered.
For reheating I just plop in a bowl and microwave for 2-3 minutes, stirring ~2 times during this. This is with a 1200 watt microwave.

**TL;DR**

package of beef  
2 cans of beans  
1 jar of salsa  
pepper

Cook beef, drain beef, add other ingredients, cook till warm.

**Chicken Noodle Soup recipe:** (This serves a lot [maybe 5-6?])

3/4 - 1 lb boneless chicken  
2-3 cans chicken broth  
2 potatoes peeled and cut  
1-3 carrots cut into slices  
1 can cream of chicken soup  
1 bag of reames noodles

In this recipe you can wiggle around with the ingredient list quite a bit to make cheaper (e.g. add more potatoes and carrots, less chicken) or more tastier (e.g. add twice as much chicken)

Only big thing of note in this list is the noodles. They are a frozen bag that is damn near impossible to find and I use the 12 or 16 oz bags. If you want to use this recipe first make sure that your local store has these or a similar type of noodle. They are known as egg noodles and their site actually has a locator function if you really want this specific type: www.marzetti.com/where-to-buy/

For the prep make sure you cut the carrots and potatoes small enough to actually fit on your spoon. Same with the chicken if you bought whole chicken.

**Cooking instructions:**  
**Note:** You don't have to cook like this but I suck at judging cooking times so doing chicken and potatoes/carrots separate makes it turn out better in the end.

Boil chicken in chicken broth till cooked.  
Remove chicken (fish it out and sit on a plate)  
Cook potatoes and carrots in broth until tender (can pull potatoes apart with a fork)  
Add everything else in (chicken, noodles, cream of chicken soup)
Cook at this point for ~10 minutes medium/medium high.

**Reheating:**

Same as with the chili. Microwave 2-3 minutes stirring once or twice mid way through.

**TL;DR**

1 LB boneless chicken  
3 cans chicken broth  
1 can cream of chicken soup  
2 Carrots  
2 potatoes  
1 16oz bag of noodles

Cook chicken in broth set chicken aside, cook carrot/potato in broth, add in all ingredients, cook for ~10 more minutes on medium/medium high.

I'd like to bring in a salad a few days a week to work. Get my nutrition on. Get my not spending money at lunch on.

What I know I can do now is go to the local market and get fresh greens or to the resident hippy market and get some spinach or whatever the spring mix is, this is the base. I would like suggestions for another veggie or 3 I can put in. I'm thinking some of those ""still on the vine tomotoes"" as I can slice a few of those up each morning and put them in the tupper ware.

What I'd really like is a simple suggestion for cooking chicken thighs. Idieally, I'd by like 9 or 12 or whatever, through them into the oven after some proper doctoring, have some for dinner, then save the rest to be sliced up and put in my salad. But real set it and forget it. I'm talking preheat, doctor, cook, remove(turn off oven), let cool, and preserve for lunch use. I don't know how long to bake a thigh. Also, any suggestions for doctoring besides salt and pepper?

Last question, anyone have a suggeston for a small salad dressing container? just a small plastic thing that I can put salad dressing in so my salad doesn't marinate the entire day, then I wash out the plastic when I'm done with it after lunch.

Any suggestions?

* get a spoon

* spoon some cottage

pretty good. as you see, it requires more tools, so it might not be your thing...
