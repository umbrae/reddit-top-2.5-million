1362666187.0,3701,self.ProRevenge,19ug08,"""I'm Getting Orange Juice""",6624,2923,772,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/19ug08/im_getting_orange_juice/,"I wish I could say this is my story, but it's not. This one is courtesy one of my closest friends. For reference I'll be referring to him as ""BP"". Slightly not safe for work, I suppose...I'd rather tag it and it not be, than not tag it and have someone's boss walk up and read it :D

Also, names and tiny details are changed or omitted, but the overall story is legit.

A few years ago, BP was dating this girl. He really dug her and did everything he could to please her. He was a reasonably funny dude, not bad looking,and he sung for a band, so he had his choice of a few ladies, but chose this one because he was really fond of her. Bent over backwards for her, so to speak.

After the relationship goes on for awhile, he finds out she's been cheating on him. And it didn't just start, she's been cheating on him since they were courting. Apparently, his love for her wasn't mutual, and she just refused to give up other guys, even after their own relationship seemed to get serious.

BP was furious, but he wasn't the type to shit in her cereal, beat up the other guys, etc. But he wanted to get back at her somehow, some way.

A few days later, we're all out drinking, hanging out, hitting the bar circuit, having a good time when who else but his ex's mom actually shows up. Ex's mom gets liquored up with us when BP actually saw his opportunity for revenge.

So he sweet talks the mother to the point where she ends up bringing him back home with her, and then...you guessed it. He had sex with his ex's mother. 

But the story gets better.

Post-coitus, he decides to get up and go to the kitchen to get a drink. Not putting anything on but a t-shirt, he walks into the kitchen and opens the fridge. At this point, his ex, who was out herself, comes in and runs into him, naked from the torso down, in her fridge. She screams at him, ""What the fuck are you doing here?""

Nonchalantly, he replies, ""Getting some orange juice.""

**tl;dr, good friend's long term girlfriend cheats on him, gets revenge by sleeping with her mom, gets caught in the kitchen by his ex and says ""getting some orange juice.""**

Eat some fucking paint.,1720,246,174,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1fi9a8/so_you_want_to_shoot_my_grandmother_with_airsoft/,"There are some little troublesome assholes across my street. Probably about 11 and 12. Their parents decided it would be a good idea to buy them some airsoft guns from the local sporting good store, so out they emerge. My grandmother from my fathers side was over this week, and she is a FANTASTIC gardener and cook. She cooked some pies and decided to help my mother in the garden while they were cooking. I was upstairs (coincidentally) installing my new barrel on my tippmann 98 custom. I have a rotor and an egrip that I cranked up to shoot about 20 BPS on full auto, which is faster than an assault rifle for those of you who don't play paintball.

As I'm installing this barrel I hear my grandmother yell out an ""ouch""! a couple of times and I look out the window. Bees maybe? *nope*. I can hear the electric whine of a shitty airsoft gun from a long ways away. The two little douchecanoes are in their front yard taking shots at my 68 year old grandmother *who is fucking gardening*. They have the widest shit eating grins on their face, just laughing as they keep shooting. Fuck that.

I quickly get the barrel on the whole way, load up my rotor with some paint, grab my mask, and run down the stairs. My grandmother came in, crying, with welts on her arms. I am infuriated at this point and I run out my front door. *Shit's on like donkey kong, motherfuckers.* They have apparently crossed the road since I came downstairs, and they are now sneaking around the side of my house. I sneak behind them to see what they are doing, just as they start shooting at my *dogs* in my backyard. Alright this is the line drawn here, fuckwads.

""Hey whatchya doin'?""

Just as they turn around I unload on them. They start SCREAMING and drop their guns and just run home. I probably shot about 60 paintballs at them. One short burst. They're across the street now and out their guns which probably costed $100 each (Canada is expensive yo) 

When their parents get home I bring the guns and explain how their kids were shooting at my grandmother and mother while gardening to the point of tears, and shooting at my dogs. I was spontaneously ""going to a paintball party with friends"" when they decided to shoot at me and I returned fire. Parents were upset, but understanding and threw away guns and probably beat the little troublemakers. I told my grandmother and she was more than satisfied, she laughed her ass off when I described the expression of horror as they turned around.

This lead to her drinking, whoring around, and the physical abuse of me and my younger brothers for years while my dad was away. She made my life hell any way she could.


Well, go figure she cheats, gets caught and my dad kicks her out after finding out about the abuse. She comes to my dads house while he is gone unannounced to take some of his things (Coffee maker , TV, really petty things that she ""needs"" for her apartment he got her )


Well as she is making her way out the door from the kitchen she says to me. ""I hope you know that you are why your father and I divorced, you should feel ashamed of your self "" I fucking exploded. ""No! You and dad split up because you were too busy drinking and sucking cock to see your relationship falling apart, too see what a shit mother , what a shit PERSON you are!"" the words will always be as sweet as the moment I said them. She was INSTANTLY pissed, and I could see what was about to happen as she came around the counter and gave me one swift hit to the face. I was still pumped up from what I said to her, and for the first time, I hit back, and it scared the crap out of her. I will never forget the look on her face as I picked up the phone and started to dial 911 and said ""you are so fucked.""




police arrive, bitch is charged with going into my dads house with out his say so, trying to take his things, and hitting me.

We had to attend 6 university forums.  One night at the first one of these terribly dry presentations, my brother and I were seated in the back of the auditorium near the entrance -- right next to a hand-lettered, moveable sign that read ""Please no food or drink in the auditorium.""  Out of boredom, we started picking the letters off of the board and rearranging them.  The final result left the board reading ""OLD PENIS IN THE RUM DRINK"".  This seemed like the best possible combination.

We had a chuckle and forgot all about it.  After leaving, I realized I had left my keys under my seat, so I went back inside only to find several faculty appalled at the public obscenities someone left on their precious sign.  The most outwardly upset of the bunch coincidentally also happened to be my 80 year old statistics professor.  He was a heinous old fuck.  It pleased me to see him helplessly perturbed, so we made it a point to change the sign every week while attending the forums.  

Week after week, it became more challenging to ninja our way to 60 seconds alone with the sign as they had started covertly guarding it during the presentations.  But week after week, upon leaving the gathering, everyone was again saluted with OLD PENIS IN THE RUM DRINK as they went home.  It was a slow continuous burn.

On the final forum of the semester, two of the old bastards shouldered the sign the entire night.  So, anticipating this we simply hand wrote several poster boards with our mantra:  OLD PENIS IN THE RUM DRINK! and taped them all over the lobby walls.  This caused the old professor and his humorless gang to almost shit themselves.  They ran around pulling down the posters as the student body exit the theater laughing at them hysterically.  You see, we had become a hero of the people.

To put one final nail in this angry mathman's heart, the morning before our statistics final, my brother and I found our way into the classroom early, pulled down the projector screen (knowing it would not be used in class), and left one final message written on the whiteboard behind it.  As class was starting, in walks angry, old Dr. Statistics, he promptly raises the out-of-place projector screen and BAM!

My little brother is probably one of the most kind and pure-hearted kid I know. One of those people who would rather let a spider outside rather than end its life. I, on the other hand, am a cruel and unforgiving person (when it is needed). I'm 5 years older than my brother and was in high school at the time, so I would get home about 30 minutes before he would.

We lived within walking distance of our schools so everyday we walked rather than take my car (good exercise). One day my brother gets home with some unusual bruises on his forehead and arms. After some poking and prodding he finally told me that some older shit heads follow him home on their bikes and punch him on occasion. This did not sit well with me. In fact my blood boils just recollecting this event.

Instead of letting my fury get the better of me and simply beating the spit out of them, I decided to formulate a plan. The next day, I waited for them a couple of blocks away from my house, envelope in my hand, until I finally saw them riding behind my little bro. I could already hear their little mouths spewing so much shit, their assholes must've been jealous. I approached them

My brother sees me and stops, a look of worry and confusion on his face. I give him a quirky smile. I walk up to the ring leader and extend my hand with the envelope, drawing his attention away from his front tire. In my best douche-style voice I say ""Yo man I'm having a killer party this weekend. Here is the address and shit"". The look of awe and happiness that came over his face was priceless. (Being invited to a high school party was a big deal back then)

I guess I should mention that as he was accepting my party invite, all while telling me how pumped and excited he was, he failed to notice me nonchalantly jamming a small but solid piece of wood into his bike spokes.

He began to pedal, but is quickly upended. With a squeal of terror, his face met the ground with a sound I will remember until the day I die. He cried, lost a tooth, and did something nasty to his nose. His ""posse"" ran to his aid. I patted my brother on the head and asked him how his day at school was as we walked home.

Never had any problems after that... also the envelope contained a piece of paper that said ""fuck you"".

Well I forgot to move my car back over once she got home and my step father took offence to this. Instead of asking me to move my car like a rational human being he decides to ram his Dodge Ram into my Escape and force it out of the way. Unfortunatly the bars I had on the front [looked like this] (http://www.autotrucktoys.com/escape/images/AOR3062_SS12.jpg) did far more damage to his truck than expected. So I hear the racket and go to see what was causing the noise only to find my suv at the end of the driveway and him staring at the back end of his truck.

He then turns to me and says that as soon as he gets back from his errand I had better have the money to fix the damage. Well as soon as he left I called the cops and reported a hit and run. Gave them the licencse plate number and his discription. I then called the insurance company and told them the same story, gave them the licence plate bladabladabla. 

So fast forward about an hour and a half. My mom gets a call from my stepdad at the police station. Saying he needs to be picked up. We have a huge screaming match as soon as he gets home which ended in him taking my car keys from me and claiming he was going to sell my suv, to which I reply that the vehicle is in my name so he can't do shit. Oh btw there was next to no damage to my vehicle from the impact. I'm just glad that he didn't have his trailer hitch on.

Next morning suprise surprise my suv is gone. So I confront my stepdad about it. He looks me straight in the eye and says "" I told you I was going to sell the piece of shit and that is exactly what I did."" So while he was still glaring at me I pulled out my trusty phone and called the cops again, this time to report a stolen vehicle.

As soon as I told the cops his name, he took off running (his truck was still in impound). This time I go to the police station with my mother. When the cops ask if I want to press charges I just told them if he gives me my suv back then no but if he refuses then yes, yes I would like to press charges. Turns out he ""sold"" it to his brother ie. he stashed it at his place until I payed for his truck, cause the insurance company refused. Needless to say my mother and he were not married much longer after that.

TL;DR: Stepdad was an asshat, rammed my suv out of his way, demanded I pay for the damages. I called the cops, stepdad gets arrested for hit and run. Stepdad then steals suv and basicly tells me he did it. I call cops again and back to the police station he goes. Mother and stepdad get divorced.

Long post but worth it,1192,207,147,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1gdh5y/stole_my_ipod_have_a_custom_virus_long_post_but/,"This all took place many years ago when I was a freshman in high school. I had bought an iPod nano (hot shit back then!) with money I had earned by helping my neighbor, and as I didn't make much, I was pretty protective of it. My scumbag sister had also recognized that it was worth a few hundred. As I later found out, she had stolen it and given it to a friend (temporarily) until the heat was off.

I suspected this immediately when it wasn't on my desk where I knew I left it. I asked my parents if I had done something that warranted a punishment, but neither had touched it. Clearly, I needed evidence to pin my sister.

As a freshman, I was pretty computer savvy. At the time, I was learning a few programming languages and had a good feel for novice hacking. Nothing serious, but enough to get in trouble at school kinda thing.

I got to work on a spy tool: my plan was to get into her email and facebook, where I hoped to find evidence. At the very least, I could fuck up her account and get revenge. A few hours of work later, the program was done. And it was way more than a simple spy tool.

Although I honestly had no idea how to make a spy tool at the time, I damn sure knew how to write a batch file that would fuck your Windows partition six ways to sunday. I had basically written a carpet bomb that had the same icon as Internet Explorer. The virus (can I call it that?) was armed when you replaced the default iexplore.exe file with the malicious file that shared the same file name and icon. Of course, when you went to run IE, you set it off. The original file would be launched after the virus ran, so everything was still usable.

Of course, my original goal was still carried out. I had packaged in a simple keylogger (records keystrokes) that any decent antivirus would have noticed instantly. But once my sister was out of the house, there was nothing stopping me from ripping her antivirus out by the roots. Which I did. And then planted the virus. A few hours later, she came home and started her normal computer browsing - log in, open IE, check facebook and email (this was before Twitter I guess) etc etc.

But today was a little different. She probably didn't notice, but Internet Explorer lagged a little when she opened it. That was because ""Internet Explorer"" had to execute a few little things before it extracted and then launched the real browser application. For instance, a few files (marked hidden, with innocent names) were copied to her startup folder, waiting to execute at the next login. The keylogger was embedded deep into the system and was started right up, and within a minute her passwords were saved in a protected log file. She was completely unaware.

Of course, that all changed in about 20 minutes. The virus, which was running in the background, ran a fake error message that caused a reboot: ""There appears to be a beaver dam obstructing your flow of internet connection. CODE RED, reboot required!"" She was somehow stupid enough to not instantly realize that this was some sort of malware/spyware and just patiently waited for the login screen. As soon as she logged back in, the hidden startup files ran and she was greeted with some weird error message and important-looking command prompt windows (which were busy doing important things, like deleting system files and corrupting huge registry chunks). Suddenly, she was getting errors about things like her hard drive being jammed with peanut butter, and ""Windows has detected an intelligence deficit in USER. Consider a system upgrade."" Complete with an annoying BEEP noise every time she tried to close it. Her CD tray kept popping open, no matter how many times she closed it. She even got a snarky message (""put it in me babe!"") every time it opened back up. Meanwhile in the background, a small script uploaded the keylogger file to my FTP account and deleted the keylogging portion as well as the hidden startup files, in case investigation was done.

Naturally, this triggered her mashing the power button and waiting for the screen to turn off. She knew something wasn't right as soon as she had the login screen: everything was 640x480 resolution. At this point, she asked me to come fix it, because I was the computer nerd in the house. I had to contain my laughter. ""Just try logging in, this is really weird. I have no idea why this would happen."" The desktop was a beautiful pixel collection featuring 256 colors (that was a lot a couple decades ago!) and barely distinguishable icons. Her theme was set to Windows Classic, which she hates with a passion (she's one of those people who spends hours ""customizing"" the look of the icons, cursors, and other piddly-ass things). Unfortunately for her, I had plans with friends and couldn't help her with her computer. Sorry about that. All program files and hardware drivers were gone, so she had no luck running a browser amidst the chaos, or even getting an internet connection in the first place.

In the end, I got my iPod. I spoke to her the next day and asked for it back. Naturally, she claimed not to have it. She didn't know that I had read her facebook messages, and already knew that her friend had it (she and her friend were messaging about how to turn it off or something). I asked my parents right in front of her: ""can you ask her to show her facebook messages just so she can clear herself? I thought I heard her saying something to her friend about the iPod and how she would talk about it on facebook."" Sure enough, she broke down and said that she was ""just borrowing it."" Obviously, my parents forced her to show the messages, which clearly proved how it was a little more than borrowing that she had in mind.

My dad recommended that she have someone fix her laptop. Luckily, I was around to do it, and for $20 I would be happy to re-install Windows. And that, ladies and gentlemen, was how I got even with my sister. I am so sorry this is a god-damn novel, but I hope you enjoyed it.

My story started the day before orientation into my college program. You see I applied for a very competitive program and never received an acceptance letter till the day before class started. I was also working the day it arrived so I never really got the  letter till that evening.

After some begging and pleading I managed to convince the dean of the department - a heartless compassionless bitch of a woman - to not count that absence against me. This program had a strict attendance policy where you were given three absent days a semester and would be kicked out on the fourth. They made this very clear, and I didn't want to take any chances so I fought for that first day.

A little over a month into the program I was asked to go see the dean. I had been sick for two days prior and I assumed she was going to give me a warning about the attendance policy - others I knew had the talk with her already.

When I got into her office she asked for my security badge. I handed it over, slightly confused. She then says ""I'm sorry to tell you but you've broken the attendance policy and can no longer attend class in this department"". 

I was irate. My eyes were watering from a combination of fear, rage, and confusion. I explained that I only missed two days. She tells me I missed the two sick days (which I did), she mentioned that I also missed orientation (which I did, but she said she wouldn't count against me), and then she said I missed a fourth day which I actually could prove I didn't with a signed and dated test I took that day. I explained this to her and told her to look at the test which I still had with me. She ignored my proof.

I kept trying to talk some sense and reason into this emotionless wench. I made sure to point out that I just spent $5000 on tuition and $2000 on books/supplies. She didn't care. She didn't interrupt me, but she wasn't listening. When I stopped talking she says ""you can leave now"".

The confusion and fear subsided and the rage intensified. I blacked out for a moment and literally wiped my arm across her desk ensuring nothing was left on it when I was done. I broke her picture frames and ornaments she had and even managed to crack her laptop. I stormed out knowing security would be there very shortly. 

I went directly to the administration office to get a refund, that is when I realized she did this the day after refunds would be given. That smug cunt scammed me. 

Even more pissed I decided to go to our off campus pub where I had planned on meeting some friends later. I was in there a couple of hours when one of my professors walked in. She was a younger professor and attractive. I had been flirting with her since I started the program so I could be on her good side when it comes time for marking.

She tells me she just heard I was kicked and my friends in class said I would probably be at the pub. She tells me she has seen the dean pull this stunt a few times and never really thought about what was happening until now. The dean was scamming students by kicking one out after refund deadline and bringing another in - ultimately getting double the tuition for a single seat.

I was slightly drunk and my now former professor said that I needed to meet her the next day. So I assumed she had a plan, I hoped she had a plan. 

The next morning my former professor arrived and I hopped in her car. I drove to another college in the same city (my second choice but equally good). I figured she was going to use a connection to get me into a program, and I was right. But that's not where it ended. 

Her former professor/mentor was also a lawyer and happened to work at this college. We sat down and explained the situation to him and he agreed that we have a case - at least to get my money back. 

He wrote up a letter to the dean of the department on my behalf. We sent it through registered mail. Within 48 hours of sending that out, I received a phone call from the lawyer telling me that the dean has agreed to refund my money in full for tuition/books/supplies. 

I was happy with that outcome, but still felt like she was getting away with doing this to other people. I explained my concerns to the lawyer and we devised a plan. 

My former professor was sent an email every time someone was kicked so that she didn't allow them into her classes. All professors got this. She sent me all of them and I tracked down the 30 most recent ones and found that 16 of the 30 were in the same situation. The lawyer and I compiled a list of those names, drafted a letter on their behalf, and sent it to the dean of the department and the president of the college. 

This time it took a few weeks, but we were both asked to go in for a meeting. We got in and the dean was there along with several board members and school lawyers. We told our story and the dean had her chance for a rebuttal. In it she explained that she was being nice by returning my money since I missed four days. Expecting this I had the proof that I did not miss one of those days and presented it to everyone in the room. The meeting ended on that note.

A few days later the lawyer was called by the president of the school. The school had terminated the dean for breaking the schools ethical policies. They also agreed to contact each of the students she had personally kicked out for false reasons and refund them their tuition in full. 

I was so excited that I called my former professor to tell her the good news. I took her out for dinner to thank her for all of her help in this situation. We dated for a few months after that dinner. While we were dating we heard the former dean took a much lower paying job in a much less desirable city. 

**TL;DR** School expels me for false reasons to get double tuition for each seat in the program.

It's a long 'un as well.

Working as a bouncer in a quiet gaming room tonight whilst struggling with my fifth day of being off cigarettes so I'm pretty edgy. A young hipster chick comes up to the bar and asks me; 

'*what goes with a Liquorice liqueur?*' 

I'm a Single Malt Scotch man, so I'm not too sure. I reply with, 

'Not sure, when in doubt try soda water I suppose.'

She then turns around and orders a pint of the cheapest beer for her equally cheap looking friend, and a *soda water.* at this point I'm thinking to myself, *nah, she can't be THAT stupid!* Well sure enough, her friend with the beer goes to the table whilst Soda Hipster *(Man, I gotta trade mark that, good indie band name)* goes directly to the toilets, returning a minute later with that murky blue Soda Water / Black Sambuca combo. 

How stupid do you think I am girl, really? 

So, I hover close enough to glean snippets of the conversation they were having; plans of where to go from there, involving going to get refills at the bottle shop and hitting a club, both of which are nearby, and happen to be guarded by good friends of mine in the Security Industry. I duck into the adjacent smoking room and snap a pic of them, plan forming. 

I then 'clean up' around their table, when I accidentally (air quotes) bump her drink, sending it flying over her white cloth bag and phone. I immediately apologise, and offer a replacement. Part one in action.

Going to the bar, I pour another Soda Water. When I put it down in front of her, she genuinely looks puzzled, telling me she ordered a Sambuca and Soda. To which I reply that she had in fact ordered a soda water, self served her own alcohol into said drink (illegal here to clarify), and that once she finished her Soda she could leave the venue as she wouldn't be served anymore. She informed me that she didn't know it was illegal to do that, to which I replied if you didn't think it was, why do it in the toilets so no one could see you? No response, so I walk away, telling the staff what happened. 

Part two involved me sending that pic to the venues the two hipsters (who had been joined by equally hipster BF's) were going to after here with a request to refuse Service / entry to Soda Hipster^TM. 

Around 10 minutes later, she goes to the bar and asks for another soda water. I calmly reiterate that she can't be served anymore, to which she says with a smile 'Thanks, you 'Ranga cunt!' (Non Aussies: 'Rang-a' = 'Ginger') And walks away, obviously happy with this insult. Pfft, I get called that and *worse* daily. Anyway, I send a follow up text to the venue bouncers asking that when they knock her back, tell her 'Courtesy of the Ranga Cunt.' 

When her friends try to buy more drinks, I have informed the staff to refuse them, and to say 'Courtesy of the Ranga Cunt' as well, just for a laugh. 

After a few attempts, Soda Hipster^TM storms out with her obviously embarrassed friends. As the bottle shop and club are literally on the same block as I with the bottle shop a few stores from the entrance to my venue, I walk outside, texting a third time that the group are leaving my place. I can see the doorman, Big Dev, down the road at the bottle shop check his phone, then stick his thumb up in the air without looking at the group.

The group arrive at the bottle shop and Soda Hipster^TM is refused service. I can tell when Dev said the punch line as he bowed slightly before she spun and stared back in my direction, to see me giving a casual wave. At least her boyfriend found it funny by the look of him. So they disappear around the corner to their second destination, only to return around 5 minutes later, heading towards me, whilst the venue Manager and myself are pissing ourselves laughing at Soda Hipster^TM storming ahead of the pack.

She pulls up at my door and angrily demands my name. I inform her that by law I can only give her my Security Tag number. So she wants to talk to the manager. The VM steps in and says that I had done everything in accordance to the law and that if I said anything to other bouncers to help them in their duties that I was able to do so as its my choice, not his. Frustrated, she now wants the manager to get my boss down here. I feign surprised horror at the suggestion, then defeat, telling the VM to grab the company business card from the security register. 

As he is doing so, Soda Hipster^TM is standing there with a smug grin and crossed arms, saying things like *you're fucked now, there goes your job* etc while I try my best to look ashamed. The boyfriend is clearly amused by the situation, but also torn between being on his GF's side of the matter as well. Been there, done that buddy. 

The VM returns and gives Soda Hipster^TM the company business card, to which she pulls out her phone and starts dialing the after hours number. Idly, I turn to her boyfriend and ask him if he likes magic tricks. He looks confused.

The intro to *Murmaider* by Dethklok emanates from my pocket. I whip out my phone and theatrically ask the BF;

'Is ***THIS*** her number sir?!?'

Guess Soda Hipster^TM didn't realise it was my company, but at least he saw the humour in it.

The smell of justice still hangs in the air.


I'm driving down this quiet one-lane residential street. Playground zone, but it's 10:30pm, so I'm doing 5 over the speed limit of 40 (kms). All of a sudden, some putz comes flying down the road behind me, stopping mere inches from my bumper. I mean, I couldn't even see his headlights anymore, and I drive a smallish car. I just wanted to get home, not into an accident, so I moved over into the ""parking lane."" There's not two lanes there, but at this time of night, there was nobody else on the road, and I was driving in the gravel at the side of the road. This guy had more than ample room to pass me if he wanted.

    \&gt;nope.jpg

This paragon of driving etiquette follows me over, still so close that I can't see his headlights. Well shit. What now?

I keep rolling along, and see my salvation in the distance: [the saddest, most useless piece of curbing I've ever laid eyes on. - Actual picture](http://i.imgur.com/965Amko.jpg)

I keep driving along towards this thing, drawing ever nearer. My palms are getting sweaty. My eyes are darting back and forth from the I-want-to-be-a-real-curb and my rearview mirror. I have a very small window.

All my training, my years of experience, have led me to this moment. I either go home a hero, or not at all.

I wait till the last possible second, and swerve back into the lane proper. Doucher McGee back there just didn't have the time to react.
What followed was possibly the most satisfying series of sounds I'll ever hear. I watched in my mirror as his front end hit the curb at 45. His bumper was immediately ripped off (don't lower your rides, kids!). His car jumped up onto the curb, and devoured the unsuspecting sign as a dolphin would swallow a fish.

A final glance back as I turned the corner a few hundred meters ahead rewarded me with the glorious sight of smoke pouring out from under his hood.

And I got my revenge.,888,123,115,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1fazy8/i_was_victim_of_a_hitandrun_i_received_threats/,"This story is a from almost 2 years back but I just found this subreddit and thought it would be a good story. (with video) Also note, this story uses kph because this is in Colombia.

It was Sept 2011 and I was driving my Nissan in a quiet residential area. I approached an intersection that was rather notorious for people disregarding the stop sign. I have the right of way as streets going either north or south usually do.

I was going 40kph and I look right as I'm about to cross the intersection and I see a big Mercedes SUV hauling ass just meters away from the intersection (easily 60-70kph). I see a cellphone by her ear. She sees my car and brakes to around 30-40kph. Crash. My car even hit the sidewalk with enough force to lift the entire right side away from the ground. I am shocked and a little bruised, and literally crying 10 seconds after the crash (I love my car).

She drives away 10 seconds later. As a first (but small) victory for me, a cab driver that saw the crash (can be seen on the far right edge, after the crash) turns around and chases her and brings her back. My family and some friends arrive to help me (uncles are lawyers) while the cop and the respective insurance lawyers sort everything out. This lady driving the Mercedes and her husband threaten us, ""You're going to be screwed out of insurance"" ""Watch your bank accounts"" etc. The traffic cop was bribed by them (we saw her husband giving him money) and drew the accident's sketch incorrectly. My uncles not-so-kindly proceed to point out this error. Sketch is corrected, and they didn't like that we noticed (second victory). Cop asks both parties to sign off the report (I don't sign it, you'll know why). We leave. My car was towed as it was undriveable, and her car was never even present at the scene of the accident after the accident itself.

Fast forward two days later, a friend suggests ""You know, the building in front of where you crashed has to have surveillance footage..."" Bingo (third victory). We go, ask, get the video, and take it to her insurance and our insurance company. Now, the reason I didn't sign the accident report was because in her statement she claimed I was speeding, going the wrong way, and that I attacked her car. Lying to the insurance company is grounds for cancellation.

On top of that, my dad found out both the cars they had (the Mercedes and a BMW) are leased. My dad is friends with the owner of the lease company. He handed over everything. A week later we get the call that they took both cars back (cause they were used). (fourth victory)

A month after the accident, I get my car back as good as new. The cost of repair was greater than the value of the car! (Biggest victory!) But it was fixed because my dad is also friends with the owner of Nissan in Colombia. He told the insurance company (friends as well), ""Don't let this car get totalled, he loves this car"".

And that is how I got my great revenge on the person who I hate most in this life. The video, if anyone wants to watch it, is here https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=4--6Fnk9yFc#t=25s (Accident at 0:30)

PS: We also investigated them. Got their address, names, kids' names, where they go to school, what they do for a living, everything. Long story short they have stolen a lot of money from the state thanks to shady businesses they run.

Edit: The reason I refused to let my car go was because at the time, it was a 14 year old (1997) Nissan Sentra with 45,000 miles/74,000 kilometers.

[X-post from /r/PettyRevenge],932,173,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1h2h22/teacher_humiliates_my_prematurely_born_little/,"I originally posted this to /r/pettyrevenge but soon realized that this revenge wasn't really petty and was assured of that by some redditors, so I figured I might x-post it here for those who might be interested and/or don't browse /r/pettyrevenge

**Context**

So my 11-year-old little brother was born 2.5 months prematurely and despite the doctors giving him marginal chances of surviving, let alone developing normally in the event that he should survive, he did and is fully functioning, except he lacks in certain areas, such as drawing and crafting. He draws worse than a 5-year-old in kindergarten, but he can't help it.

So one day, the teacher in his art class collects all assignments, looks at my brother's work, starts laughing and commenting at it and parading it around the class saying ""this is the kind of crap you're not allowed to bring in"" and ""did you use your toes to draw this or something?"" among various other things in front of the whole class. 

My brother naturally didn't want to attend art class anymore and told my mother about this afterwards and mentioned she's been saying mean shit to him for the entire 3 months he had taken her class, but not as bad until now.

**Revenge**

After having told my mother about this, she was naturally infuriated and went to his school the very next day only to hear the same teacher making rude remarks about other students of hers behind the half-open class door. My mother just stood there for a bit and eventually smiled at the teacher and asked if she could have a word. The teacher was mortified, blushed harder than Maybelline, but finally managed to stop stuttering and shaking and came out of the class to meet my mother. Just a note: at this point, she had no idea who my mother was or what she wanted, she was just shitting bricks because she knew my mother had heard the how she talked to her students.

So they started talking about my little brother and her remarks and once my mother was done explaining his situation regarding shitty artwork, she handed the teacher her business card with a date and time on the back and told her to be sure to show up.

Oh yeah, I probably forgot to mention that her title on said business card says: ""Head Inspector"" of the ~~Censored~~ County Department of Education.

The teacher was suspended without pay for 30 days and was made to take some sort of classes on ethics and communication.

tl;dr: my little brother who was born prematurely was made fun of by his art teacher since he can't draw well due to being born early, my mother who happens to be the head inspector of the county's Department of Education confronted her; teacher gets suspended without pay for 30 days and has to take mandatory classes on ethics and communication.",,False,,t5_2vjvl,False,,,True,t3_1h2h22,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1h2h22/teacher_humiliates_my_prematurely_born_little/,

We were reading Moby Dick, one of my favorite books, and in classic nerd style, I spent all quarter working on the paper. I was very happy with how it turned out, but when I got it back, she had given me an F and had just written ""See me!"" on it.

I went to see her and she said ""these ideas are too sophisticated for a college sophomore to have come up with. It had to have been plagiarized. I brought in all of my notes, outlines, previous drafts - it was obviously my work. She said - find, but it is still an F paper because it is terrible! She gave me a ""chance to redeem my grade"" by rewriting it.

The paper was typed (this was in the 80s - no computers) so I coped the paper word for word in blue ink and went back to her office hours. She told me she could tell I had ""really worked on the paper"" and gave the paper a C. Then she sent me home to rewrite it again.

I recopied the paper word for word, this time in black ink, and brought it back, and she begrudgingly gave me an A. I have her a nice big smile, thanked her for her time, and then went right to the chair of the department with all of the papers. Long story short, she was put on probation and had to have the chair sign off on her paper grades to ensure that she was being objective.

TLDR: English prof gave me 4 different assessments for the same paper - ended up being supervised for failing to grade objectively.

When I was in highschool a friend of mine was dating this sweet little girl that we all got along with. But this girl had an ex boyfriend who was a real piece of shit. Threatened to beat my friend's ass a couple times (never followed through), harassed her, told everyone she had laid down with him and other stuff. Just an all around dick. 

The girl did a great job of ignoring his bullshit, which pissed him off even more. Well one day her family comes out of their house and sees their mailbox has been ran down and someone had driven across their lawn. Her dad righted it and straightened it out, just for it to be ran down again a few days late. Everyone assumed it was Scumbag, but there was no proof to be had.

Scumbag had made one error in judgement though. And that was the girl's dad was a retired welder with nothing but time on his hands. This man spent hours building this beautiful mailbox out of 1/2 steel sheets. He then mounted it on a steel pole filled with concrete and painted the whole thing red and black to conceal the monstrosity it really was. 

A week went by with no progress and we were disheartened that maybe Scumbag had given it up. But then one late night the family is woken up to a smash outside. Scumbag had slammed into it again and the mailbox had gone clear through the radiator of his truck.

End game is Scumbag is arrested for DUI, underage drinking and I am sure a whole list of other shit. Two jackasses with him are charged too.

I had a really close female friend when I was a Junior in high school.  She was getting a little friendly with a guy she had met online on some sort of chat room. (Not exactly sure what it was) but anyways, eventually I was with her one day and she did not seem to be her usual self.  I thought it was a little weird but brushed it off as nothing. Maybe she was just having a bad day or something.  However, this attitude of hers persisted for weeks.  She also became increasingly protective and scared of her new male friend.  

I was really worried for her and I told her of my concerns.  After a really deep conversation she eventually told me that the boy she was with had raped her.  Not a date rape either where she was pressured into having sex, but he had full on raped her.  She said that he had gotten really angry randomly while they were talking in his room and he threw her on the bed and forcibly held her down while she was crying and screaming... she told me more but I don't want to think about it.  It's making me extremely pissed off just thinking about it.

Over the next few weeks I decided that I'd plot my revenge.  This kid wasn't too much bigger than me but I had no experience fighting so I decided that that was out of the question but eventually I had an idea of what I would do.  I asked her if she wanted to stop being friends with him and she said she did really badly but was scared to for some reason.  I still don't understand why she didn't just leave him to this day, but oh well.  

He had never actually been to her house.  He didn't even know where she lived.  Every time they had hung out it was at his house so I convinced her to cut contact with him completely... as soon as we all went on a road trip to Las Vegas.  She was confused but I told her of my plan and decided that it was a good idea.  

The next weekend me and her invited him to come with us on a trip to Las Vegas.  We'd be staying there the weekend, I'd have my own hotel room and he would be sharing one with her.  When he heard that I could see a little smile form on his face and I knew exactly what he planned to do when we were in Vegas.  (Note: He didn't know that I knew that he had raped her.)  It pissed me off and I wanted to punch him in the face then and there but I decided my plan would be better if I didn't do that.

The weekend came and I picked up her and him and we went to Vegas.  On the way there I saw my friend delete his number out of contacts and I was really proud of her (still am) for doing that.  But anyways...

We stop in St. George, Utah on the way to Las Vegas (this is about 1-2 hours away from vegas) and decide that we all needed to take a bathroom break.  

We all got out of my car and started to head to the bathroom.  

Except me and my friend didn't go to the bathroom.  

We watched as the rapist walked into the bathroom to go pee or something and then we got back in my car and drove all the way back to Salt Lake City (which was where we lived.)

My friend says she never heard from him again (she blocked his number half way back to Salt Lake City so he never could contact her again.  And then we threw his phone out of the car somewhere along the freeway.)

I never heard from him either, but I always like to think about how hard it was to walk back to Salt Lake City. (~300 miles away)

Edit: I forgot to include this: But the reason I made this particular plan was because my friend told me that he had an irrational fear of being left out in the middle of no where and had no way to get home.  I really hope that he suffered on that long walk back home.  I hope no one gave him a ride.  I hope he learned his lesson.  He's a piece of shit.

Edit 2:  I forgot to include this as well:  I **DID** want to go to the police and report it.  I was going to but my friend got really upset and told me that she didn't want that to happen.  She didn't want to deal with court and she was worried she'd be called a liar or that people would bully her about it.

He has to have everything in order at all times, however every once in a while he forgets stupid shit. In the late 90's my dad owned a beautiful black truck, he spent a lot of time and money making it look great. One day my mom and dad go out to dinner but decide to take my mothers white jeep instead of my fathers truck. Originally they were going to take the truck but figured it would be fun to take the jeep out with the top down. This is where my dad messes up. 

He already had the trucks keys in his hand and while helping my mother take the top down, he left them resting on the back bumper. He immediately forgot he put them there and they drive off without a second thought. So now my dads car keys are in the middle of the street in front of our house. 

A man is walking around the neighborhood and spots them on the ground, he then starts to click the unlock button to see if the car is anywhere near him. My dads truck lights flash and the man decides to take a joy ride. The asshole speeds into a field and proceeds to drive as fast as he can throwing all of my dads CDs and personal belongings out the window, including my dads wallet. This guy absolutely destroys the car, tons of huge dents, scratches, and the bottom of it is covered in mud, sticks, and grass.

 At this point my mom and dad arrive home and freak out because they are short one car in the driveway. My dad immediately remembers the keys he left on the bumper and gets pissed at himself. He wonders if the guy who took his car would be dumb enough to ride it around their neighborhood, so he takes the jeep and starts looking. 

Sure as shit my dad finds the dumbass 10 minutes later cruising down a street by they're house. My dad passes in front of him and slows down to a stop, gets out of the jeep, walks up to the guy (who now has the window rolled down wondering what's going on) and punches him square in the face. 

My dad is not a very violent man, but seeing the condition his car was in mad him see red. My dad then holds the guy back with his arm and calls the police telling them he caught the guy who stole his car. The man is arrested and pays for damages to the car and all of the shit he threw out of the window.

I knew this would be a terribly long post, so I broke it up to make it slightly easier to read, but here is everything in 1 post.

**Part 1 - Betrayal and Planning**

This is a long one, but it made me feel oh so good.
In my high school, there was a counselor who just didn't like me. Well to put it more accurately, he didn't like my family. His daughter and my eldest sister had been academic rivals their senior year and my sister won a state-wide award over the counselor's daughter. It didn't help that my second sister actively pissed this guy off by ignoring him and going over his head for things (she was the SBP and went out of her way to not involve him in things). Which set me up for a bad time when it comes to this dude.

In 10th grade(Year 11, I think, is equivalent) I tried for a $10,000 dollar scholarship that came with a brand new laptop. I got teachers, staff, and coaches to be my references, wrote an essay, and sent everything in. Three days before the deadline, I get a phone call from the company offering the scholarship. One of my references hasn't sent in their letter. Let's have a show of hands of the times a company offering a scholarship calls someone to make sure they get their stuff in. I get on the phone to the one guy I know messed up and sure enough, he forgot to mail it out. Wait patiently for the results to be announced, and when they do, I'm not one of the winners. I didn't even win 1 of the 4 minor scholarships that were for my school. The 4 kids who did win, all of them very smart people, were called out of class by Counselor Scumbag specifically because he wanted them to apply for the scholarship. To put this in perspective, there 5 students in my grade that everyone agreed were the ""smart kids"". I was one of them and I didn't get an invite.

I shrugged the loss off. I really just wanted the laptop anyway. Fast forward half a year. I'm taking a foreign exchange-student to the Homecoming. The girl's host family was one of my reference, a nice teacher who works with the juvenile delinquents and is the adviser of the Honor Society (I worked with him in Honor Society). The girl needs a few more minutes to finish getting ready, so I sit in the living room with the teacher and shoot the bull about school. He steers the conversation towards this scholarship I missed out on. I say that that was just tough luck. He gives me a confused look and says, ""So you don't know what happened?""

I ask him to elaborate and he tells me a tale. About a week after the deadline for the scholarship ended, he receives a phone call from the scholarship company. The lady on the phone was very confused as to how the teacher could have written such a nice reference letter for a troubled and dangerous student like me. The teacher says that I am one of the best students he's ever worked with (a bit sappy, but his words not mine.) He then asks how the lady came to think I was such a terrible person. &lt;Cue suspenseful music&gt;

This lady had called the school to ask about the 5 applicants to the scholarship from our school. The first person who she talked to was Counselor Scumbag. He said 4 of the applicants were star students and never got in trouble. He claimed the last one (me) was a troublemaker and a terrible student. He had on several occasions had to speak to me about my actions in class. I would be a terrible candidate for the scholarship due to my aggressive and dangerous behavior.

Now, I'm a little bias, but I had only spoken to this counselor a handful of times. Mostly it was ""Hello Counselor."" I'm not trying to make this juicier or more revenge worthy. I just never spoke to this guy when it wasn't absolutely necessary. This counselor, a person who was suppose to be there to help students just straight up character assassinated me so that I had no chance to win the scholarship.

After the dance, which was lovely and the foreign student thoroughly enjoyed, I began to think about this information. This counselor didn't like me and obviously would offer no help when I started to look at colleges. I'd have to do it myself and this revelation gave me an idea.

The counselor was notorious about scholarship amounts. He love to brag about how much a class was offered in scholarships. He even had a ceremony at the end of the school year to announce the cumulative amount a student got and where they had accepted to attend college. He even let the top earners say a few words in thanks for those who helped them. I resolved then and there that that would be the hour of my revenge. I would earn more scholarships that anyone else in my class, forcing the counselor to let me speak in front of my class and the faculty. I would blast this scumbag for the jerk move he pulled and let everyone know I got those scholarships by myself and with no help of our benevolent counselor.

**Part 2 - ""Am I suppose to be impressed""**

Now that I had decided to get revenge from this counselor, I needed to get to work on getting the scholarships. Since I pulled a 31 on my ACT, I was able to apply to schools early and bypass the stupid pay-to-apply process that many universities have. I worked to improve my resume as best I could.

My grades were around a 3.5 GPA because I wasn't interested in school, so I drove home the extra-curricular activities. I got more involved in sports, joined the Scholastic Bowl(Quiz Bowl) team, ran for student government, and did both on-stage and behind the scenes theatre.

I never got elected to Student Government, but my teachers always nominated me for Class Rep. It gave me the unique opportunity to study my prey up close. Counselor Scumbag had a system. If you were a family friend or lived in his neighborhood, you got preferential treatment. Not noticeably so if you didn't look for it, but it was in everything he did. So-and-so got a scholarship that wasn't advertised throughout the school, despite 50% of the school being eligible. Awards were given to certain people despite being on equal or lesser footing than other students.

This is how I found out the reason only 5 people applied for the scholarship when I was in 10th grade. It was never publicly announced in the school. I didn't notice since my family found the scholarship online. Small things like this should not have happened. This counselor claimed that he would help everyone get into college if they would come to him, but he kept the best scholarships and opportunities away from the majority of the school.
By the end of my junior year, I had applied to 10 universities around the US. In the next 4 months, I had another 6 applications sent out. By the time school was starting up for my senior year, I was winding down on schools that I wanted to apply to. I thought it would be a good time to move ahead with my plan.

I walked into Counselor Scumbag's office one day and asked him if there were any scholarships he knew of that I could apply for. He had spoken with a friend of mine, one of the other 4 people who were dubbed the ""smart kids"". Scumbag gave this guy a stack of applications to fill out about 3 inches thick. Every major university for 300 miles was covered as well as many private scholarships from companies. What does Scumbag give me? 2 scholarships, neither of which I could ever qualify for. Thanks to genetics, I was neither female nor hispanic. I thanked him anyway and said I would apply to both.

Over the next 6 months I received letters of acceptance from 14 of the 16 schools (never heard back from the other 2). In total, I had be offered $516,000 over 4 years, with $136,000 from a single school. Some may say I'm privilege, that I have nothing to complain about. They maybe right, or the 6 years spent working construction with my dad may have put the fear of hard labor in me. Either way, I had done it. That amount surpassed any single student's cumulative scholarships by about $200,000. I was pretty proud, and then I get a note from the office asking to meet with Counselor Scumbag.

I had written up a word document that listed all 14 scholarships with amounts and schools and brought it to school that day to show some teachers that I used as references. I chuckled to myself as the fates had decided to shine on me that afternoon. When I got down to his office, I asked what he needed. Scumbag said he had two things for me. First was that he needed a list of all scholarships I had been offered for his presentation at the end of the year. Second was the wonderful news. I had received a $1000 a year scholarship to school #9 on my list. He said I should be proud of such an accomplishment. I laughed in his face.

""$4000 isn't even a piss in the bucket."" I slide the list across his desk to him, ""That is my list. $516,000 in scholarships offered from 14 different universities, including the $4000 one.""

He looks the sheet a couple of times, reading it in earnest. Some of those schools were nearly 3000 miles away. I'm not sure if it never occurred to him that students wouldn't want to go to school within a day's drive of home. He sits back in his chair, takes a deep breath in through his nose and says, ""Am I suppose to be impressed?"" This is where I made my mistake. I had played my hand too early, but I didn't realize it. I told him that I had earned more than anyone ever had at our school and that I was looking forward to his presentation. I picked up my bag and walked out, feeling like a king. Scumbag sat at his desk, with his fingers pressed together in front of him.
I was on my way to a perfect revenge. Oh was I ever so wrong.

**Part 3 - An Unexpected Result**

A month had past since my encounter with Counselor Scumbag.  Word had gotten around that I had earned some serious scholarships, but I kept it a secret so to have that big *GASP* moment.  Scumbag had not made contact with me and I was fine with that.  I was winning.  I had done what others had thought improbable.  Earning over a half a million dollars in scholarships was nothing to scoff at.  With the ceremony a week away, I was assured of my victory and absolute revenge.  Let this be a lesson for everyone.  Never trust the system to play fair.

The first sign of danger was that with only a week left, no one had been notified about speaking at the ceremony.  I kept checking with the ""smart kids"" to see if they had been approached, but nothing.  Then the hammer fell.  

""The ceremony would be changed this year.  In an effort to save time, we will not be having the students speak at the ceremony since they already do this at Graduation.  We will still present the letters of acceptance to students who were accepted to a local university.""  That was all the announcement said.  I can still remember it now because it caused such a pit to fall in my stomach.  I had the slimy bastard and he changed the rules.  In 15 years of him being Head Counselor, the top earning students had spoken at the ceremony.  And time?  The ceremony was never longer than an hour, so what were they conserving it for?

Something had to be up.  I swung by the front office to talk to the secretary.  I had been an office aide for her in the past (it helped to figure out Scumbag's system) and she knew most of the gossip around the school.  This time, she too was clueless and couldn't figure out why a man so set in his ways would suddenly change the ceremony just a week before it occurred.  As I walked back to class, I saw him out of the corner of my eye.  He had just finished speaking with another counselor.  He glanced my way, did a slight double take and smirked.  I stopped and glared back.  If there ever was a point in my educational career that I wanted to punch a faculty member, that was it.

This man had used this ceremony for his purposes for years.  I had seen him read off scholarships amounting to $100,000+ to one student and $2,500 to the next.  This wasn't about making sure people's feelings weren't hurt.  He didn't care that a student had put his time and effort into gaining more than anyone thought he could.  This man wanted nothing more than to control his system.  I had to force myself to walk away. (If any of you think I'm being harsh or bias, it's possible.  These are the events seen through my eyes, but a little bit down I'll explain more, so hold on)

The day of the ceremony arrives.  My family goes and gets good seats near the aisle.  Happy faces are all around me, but I can't help but feel a little displeased.  This was to be the stage of my grand revenge.  I sighed, and thought that he would at least have to announce my scholarship of $136,000 to a university halfway across the country.  Counselor Scumbag gets up and begins with his usual droll about how wonderful the class was through the years.  He subtly hints that he had a hand in guiding these ""brilliant upstarts"" towards a brighter tomorrow. The usual sappy sludge dished out at events like these.

Scumbag begins to give out the awards.  First to the students going to the local universities, then moves on the the students who have earned their nursing licenses through the HOSA Club (Health Organizations Student Apprenticship, or something like that), and finally he gets down to me.

""ArcVal has accepted a scholarship to Awesome University.""

... ... ...If you waiting for more, that's it.  After putting in hundreds of hours or applying, writing, getting references, and visiting campuses, I get ""ArcVal has accepted a scholarship to Awesome University.""  I can't say anything, my family is shocked that he didn't say the amount of the scholarship and that he said it almost in a hushed whisper.  I just bite my lower lip and stare dead ahead.  Defeated, humiliated, and ashamed.  Not much more he can do to me now.

You can't tell, but I honestly had to stop writing for a minute.  I still get upset just thinking about it.  The only thought that came to my mind was to confront him after the ceremony was done.  I had to know why he changed everything just because I beat his system.  So I did.

I waited for the crowd of thankful students and parents to disperse.  When it was just him and me on the stage I asked, ""why?""  He looked at me and said, ""Because you don't deserve it.""  I look at him for a second, and say, ""Well, it's a good thing you don't get to decide everything then is it.""

In that one sentence, he had brought back a memory that I had of my freshman year.  My Sister was the Student Body President and she wanted to have a celebration at lunch for the end of a term.  Most everyone was on board with the idea, but Counselor Scumbag wouldn't aid it (He was one of the advisors to the Student Government and had to give his permission before any funds could be spent).  When asked why, he said, ""You don't deserve it.""  My sister, being a hothead, gave him some choice words to think about and went to the principle and got the celebration approved.  That was what I had been missing.  I wanted to prove the system wrong, when I should have ignored the system.

The Principal was like a really good father.  He'd eat in the cafeteria with students and even join in the basketball games at lunch, however you knew he would come down on you if you broke the rules.  I went to his office the next day and laid out my story just as I have done for you.  He gave me many of the arguments I alluded in my (side notes).  After asking him to just confront the counselor about it, he said, ""ArcVal, I care about you, but this isn't enough to go off of.""  I stood up, turned to walk out and said over my shoulder, ""If you cared about me as much as you said you do; you would do something about this.""  I walked out and went to first period, 30 minutes late.

Now I can't vouch for this part.  I only got this through hearsay and the secondhand telling by the principal's daughter, but here goes.  The Principal thinks about what I told him for a bit.  I had been in his office a few times, but never for anything bad.  True there were measures in place for bad students before they got to the principal's office.  However, no bad kid had volunteered to be the mascot for the Homecoming Parade.  No bad kid had broken up a fight between Sophomore girls.  No bad kid would have earned $500,000 in scholarships.  Something was wrong.

What I wouldnt give to be a fly on the wall in Counselor Scumbag's office for those 20 minutes.  The words were never told to me, but it was a verbal beat down that should have been remembered.  The Principal walked in and wanted to know why a kid who had earned 1/3rd of the entire class's scholarships, money wise, hadn't been recognized as he should have.  After much backtracking and confronting, the truth came out.  Scumbag didn't think I should get the recognition.  The Principal told Scumbag that if he tried anything like this again, he would have him removed from office (union contract said you couldn't fire him, but you could put him on administrative leave.  The things you learn at the water cooler...).  A few days later, after this has been circulated around the school a few times, the Principal stops me in the hallway and says everything is taken care of.  I thank him and hurry off to class thinking that is the end of it.

Classes finally end and Graduation night rolls around.  We're lucky enough that the weather cleared up and we get to walk on our football field.  The Principal gets up to give his sappy congratulations to the class despite a few misfits, a joke about his daughter being one of them to liven it up a bit.  He then congratulates our class on being the 2nd highest earning class when it came to scholarships.  Over 1.5 million dollars were offered.  Then he says this,

""1.5 million is a remarkable feat.  However there is a greater one.  The measure of a student is how far they are willing to go when faced with adversity.  While some influences in the world push these students down, this class pushed back, and none exemplify this determination better than ArcVal.  His efforts alone have earned him $516,000 in scholarships.  A feat he did by himself without aid.  Let's give him a cheer for his intelligence and determination.""

Not sure if it was tears or a bit of cotton in the air, but my eyes were misty at that point.  It wasn't what I expected and I'm sure it's not what you the reader wanted.  I would have loved to have the knee jerking ""Gotcha"" moment with that counselor, but I didn't get it.  Instead I got the recognition for hard work and determination.

If it's any consolation, my little sister was a freshman at this time.  The next year that counselor offered here a chance to attend a leadership mini-camp in our state capitol.  He also started posting every scholarship available on a board for everyone to look at.  The Principal looks in on him from time to time to keep him honest, but I think he has wised up to the fact that he should help everyone, not just his chosen few.

And that's it.  That's my tale of grand revenge.  I planned out a huge revenge party, just to slip up near the end and ruin it.  Take from this what you will, but I got something better than revenge.  Closure.  Closure and the knowledge that my efforts may have helped someone down the road get a better scholarship.

The whole thing seemed like it was laid out and planned by a 12 year old, with a lot of bottle necks, dead ends and zero gathering areas. So because of this, it was pretty slow to walk around the whole place. My husband and I didn't mind, we would just grab 2 samples from each stand we went to so we would never go thirsty between vendors. 

There was one girl however that felt the need to get somewhere as quickly as she could. My husband and I had just picked up our latest beer samples and began walking towards where the rest of our friends were standing. There was a long line of people in front of us trying as well, to get to the other side of the venue. It was slow as you had to stop every 2 seconds to avoid spilling beer on some one or disrupting small groups trying to hold conversations but everyone was polite and would move out of your way as quickly as they could.

So we're on our way, my husband leading the way, but there's a woman behind me with her cell phone literally on my back texting away who keeps bumping into me since she's not paying attention. We had to stop at the corner where there was a massive bottle neck, she ran directly into me and then I hear her say ""This isn't going to work for me"" and proceeds to push my arm, trying to bulldoze past me which in turn causes me to spill some of my beer on my husbands arm and my forearm. Upon seeing this the woman behind me turns to her boyfriend and laughs then again proceeds to try to push past us. 

Revenge mode kicks in, and all I can think of is the dose of instant karma this cunt needs. So with my beer still in my hand, I quickly turn towards her at the same time she is trying to push past us, my arm hits hers which proceeds to fling the entire contents of my beer cup all over her chest and face. Of course I apologize immensely as she stands there in disbelief. She slinks away in one direction as I turn back and get another beer from the closest vendor. Victory is mine and the next beer tasted delicious!

TL;DR - Girl at beer fest thinks she is important enough to push me from behind so I ""clumsily"" spill my entire beer all over her chest and face.",,False,,t5_2vjvl,False,,,True,t3_1dfa78,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1dfa78/beerfest_bitch_gets_whats_coming_to_her/,

The driver was on his cell phone and clearly not paying attention. Over the course of the next little distance he proceeded to cut me off several more times. 

Unsure if this guy was genuinely clueless because of the cell phone being held to his ear or if he had some random vendetta against me, I decided to put some distance between us. Unfortunately, at the next intersection we were both stopped at the red light. 

The second the red light turned green I heard a honk. Okay, I didn't leave the line as if it were a quarter mile drag, but I wasn't taking any longer then the average driver. Then a second honk, and I looked in my rear view mirror and this guy is giving me the finger. 

Being a little pissed at this guys not-so-stellar driving I decided to throw my truck in park and go confront him. It was a stupid idea for so many reasons, but sometimes my lack of fear makes me do stupid things.

I get back to his window and simply ask if there is a problem. He puts his phone on his lap and then goes on a rant about how shitty of a driver I am and that I didn't move once the light turned green. I asked if he wanted to start over in a more polite way. He told me to fuck off, then picked his phone back up and I shit you not he said: 

""sorry mom, some asshole is blocking the road"".

I ripped the phone out of his hand and began walking back to my truck. He hopped out and began to charge at me but stopped the moment he realized I was not fucking around and ready to fight back. He then asked for his phone back in a decently polite way.

I told him ""sure, as long as you can catch"". I launched his iPhone straight up into the air as high as I could. He managed to stumble and miss catching his phone by mere inches. It smashed into a million little pieces. 

I immediately felt bad, not for breaking his phone - that felt great. I felt bad that I was probably going to get in shit by the police and have to deal with that. I don't mind a minor thing like that going on my record, it is perfectly spotless otherwise. So I decided to go straight to the police in hopes that I could reduce problems by immediately turning myself in. 

At the station, the other driver arrived shortly after me - I assume it took him a little bit of time to pick up the pieces of his phone.

The police spoke to us separately. He was first and it took about 15 minutes. Then the cop came in to speak to me. He said:

""I have issued him two tickets, one for distracted driving (cellphones are banned while driving) and one for reckless driving. He has had three complaints and written warnings for other similar situations where he was on his cell phone and nearly caused accidents so I don't believe him when he tells me he wasn't on his cell phone.

As for you, you shouldn't break peoples cell phones or even confront them no matter how bad their driving is. Report them to us and we will deal with it. On a personal level, I bet that felt good. Have a good day and remember not to get into any of these altercations.""

I laughed at the outcome of that. I walked outside and seen the other driver pulling out of the lot. I gave him the most smug smile and wave I could muster up. 

**TL'DR**: Bad drivers cuts me off several times. When I confront him he verbally attacks me. I smashed his phone. Police sympathized with me and gave the other driver two tickets.",,False,,t5_2vjvl,False,,,True,t3_1ekyqe,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1ekyqe/smashy_smashy/,

This happened to my best friend. His wife was Japanese and living in America with him on a spousal visa. Long story short; she was banging some guy who was always an asshole to us. (we know why now) She made the mistake of telling her best friend who lives in Japan whom is also my good friend. (I live in Japan) The friend was recently cheated on and still very upset. She told me. My best friend was in the middle of finals. (went back to school after getting laid off to get a more specialized degree) I sat on this information for two weeks and then told him. He took it pretty well as it filled in a lot of holes for him.
Then I said so many guys when hurt are too nice. I convinced him to ruin this bitch. We figured out her Facebook password. (Why do most women pick the most obvious of passwords?) Sure enough there were picture, conversations, and what's this?!? The boyfriend's parents. Glorious!!!! It turns out they are super Christian. My friend contacted the boyfriend's Mother and very politely explained who he was and what went on. She was very sorry and she promised my friend that his wife would no longer be welcome in their home. Step 1 complete!
Step 2 was going to take more skill. My friends wife was pretty butt hurt about him ruining her relationship. She said she will just tell her parents that my friend beat her. They don't speak English, so there was nothing my friend could do. I told my friend to write the letter which he did and again explained it very politely. Per my advice my friend also included the dated photos of them together. My mutual Japanese friend translated the letter into natural Japanese. My friend's wife had no idea of his plan. She was also planning to go home for a month to visit. My friend timed the mailing of the letter so it arrived one day before she left. She received a phone call from her Father and he totally sided with my friend. His wife called up crying and called him an asshole.
Now if you think this burn couldn't get any better, you are wrong. His wife was looking for her dream job at an industrial design company. She had an interview lined up for when she got back. They were ready to hire her, but when talk about her visa status came up, she explained that she will be getting divorced and will lose her status. The company explained that they couldn't hire her because they don't have it in the budget to sponsor a visa. Bam! Mission complete. :)
She's now back in Japan. I guess she works at a Japanese company now, but that isn't her dream.
TL; DR
Sometimes cheating bitches get what they deserve.

This is also a throw-away name as I don't care for it to be associated with my regular forum posting. I can't tell if I'm a bad person or not... I mulled it over, but I may be blinded by my own sense of justice. Because I am the Batman.. Woman. Whatever.

I was 19, living in Phoenix, and working at a restaurant while going to college. One of my managers offered to come over and assist in a school project I was stuck on. I lived alone and was a bit naive, but still allowed him in when he came over much later and had been drinking with other co-workers.  Without lots of details, he drugged and sexually assaulted me. The next day he lied about it at work, but he then phoned the restaurant repeatedly while he was out of town and not only admitted to it but gloated in the fact that I was ""good"" and it's a pity I didn't remember. 

Oh, yeah, he was also in his early thirties, married, and had a child. 

I didn't phone the police because I was 19, scared, and remembered bits and pieces. I understand how women can be treated in rape cases and I chose to not pursue it. I quit that job and moved about six months later after becoming ill in what I can only assume is some kind of PTSD / nervous break down.

Here's the revenge part: I found him on Facebook. He still lives in Phoenix. I found his wife's Facebook. I found his address. I created a fake profile and wrote his wife (who was pictured with ""Daddy"" and three children) and told her every bit that happened. It was nothing graphic, as I was sincerely not trying to hurt her, but there was definitely enough detail that she would know it's true. I've never heard back from her, but I know she has seen it. She has since moved to another city in Phoenix from what I can see.

TL; DR -- Asshole drugs and rapes me, so I find his wife years later and tell her what he did shortly after the birth of their child. 

ETA: I really, REALLY appreciate the feedback from everyone, even that which I may disagree with. Obviously rape is a very touchy subject for many people and can be quite divisive. Thank you all for the kind words and support. Even though this is an anonymous internet forum, it really does mean a lot to me personally.

1373215094.0,550,self.ProRevenge,1ht3ht,My ruin rightfully ruined a warrant officers career,671,121,115,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1ht3ht/my_ruin_rightfully_ruined_a_warrant_officers/,"My friend was stationed in Korea at the time on a 3 yr tour (he had AIPed his wife is Korean) when a new warrant officer came in approx 6 months after his arrival. My friend never really cared for this officer however he dealt with it. It was a known fact within the office that this officer was married with a family back in the states.

Well shortly after arriving in Korea the warrant officer met a young 20 yr old Korean girl who he began dating. They dated quite a bit and everyone kind of turned a blind eye. This is actually ILLEGAL in the military.

Before I say anything, please note I married a lovely Korean woman and I am very happy with her and think Korean people are great. With this being said because of how Korean society treats school/education young Korean people generally lack the relationship maturity when it comes to dealing with the opposite sex. As an American dating at 14-15 yrs old is not uncommon. My first girlfriend/kiss was at 13 I don't think that unusual. My wife's first boyfriend/kiss was at 21 and most of her friends are right around that age group. Many Korean girls that I know first boyfriends/kiss came in around the age of 20-22 yrs old. Which means this girls first boyfriend was this officer. She didn't have the relationship maturity/experience to see everything.

Not saying Korean people are immature, however I just thought that point needs to be clarified. In fact they are VERY hard working.

Well it really surprised everyone, especially my friend when this officer proposed to this girl. My friend got extremely worried at this point, what was this guy doing? Was he really this stupid? 

Well he still turned a blind eye, it was time for the officer to go back home. By this time the girl had moved all of her stuff to the officers home. The officer had all of her belongings packed up and sent back to America. The officer brought the girl to the airport to get on the flight. This girl went out and got her passport, told her parents she moving to America and dropped everything in her life for this guy. Who she didn't even know he was married.

Well they get to the airport, and its her first time at the airport. They walk around grab a coffee etc when he tells her he has to go to the bathroom. He grabs his bag and off to the bathroom.

She waited for him, she waited for him for approx 30 mins before she decided to start looking for him. She spent a good 45 minutes checking for him asking around if anyone had seen him. She got airport security involved about 2 hrs later but they weren't much help. She was in tears, she of course thought the worst, something terrible had happened to the love of her life.

She called my friend in tears, my friend was obviously confused. The flight had been scheduled to leave 2 hrs ago what happened. He handed the phone to his wife so she could speak Korean and he saw his wifes face go from a face of concern, to confusion and then he knew...

Her face became angry. No angry is a nice way of saying this she fucking pissed off at this scumbag. I'm sure at this point she'd like nothing better to cut his balls off. His wife explained everything to my friend. The officer had abandoned his girlfriend/future wife at the airport. Not only did he ditch this girl in the airport with the pretense of living with him forever he also TOOK ALL OF HER STUFF TO AMERICA. 

My friend rushed off to the airport (a lengthy drive approx 3 hrs) to collect her) on the way he took the time to make a few phone calls. He had one of his soldiers even pull the officers home phone number. Lets just say my friend had a very interesting conversation with the following individuals

1. Commander of the officers former unit

2. Commander of the officers next unit

3. His wife

I'll let you assume how those conversations went suffice to say that officer was discharged from the military, and received a court martial. 

Here is what I know what happened for a fact

1. He got divorced, (alimony/Child Support)

2. He got kicked out of the military, he lost his retirement (This was worth  millions of dollars over the course of a lifetime)

He had her put everything except his cell phone in her name as his history with the utilities was bad. MG catches him cheating on her. Does she confront him? Does she get in a fight with with him? Nope. She just moved out.

Remember how I said everything is in her name?

MG tells Landlord she is moving out. No, no one else lives there. Landlord did not know about boyfriend.

MG tells Electric company to shut off the power. No one is living there.

MG tells cable company to end service. No one is living there.

MG tells water company to shut off water. No one is living there.

MG tells Phone company to shut off Land line. No one is living there.

MG tells mutual friends he moved out and does not care where he is living.

MG has her mail forwarded to new address. No one is living at old address.

So he is sitting in the dark, unable to leave because landlord changed the locks. He can't take a shower as there is no water. can't watch tv due to no power or cable.

How do I know all this? He called her and left several long messages complaining about it. And since the number is now mine...

If you don't know what that is (or haven't seen A &amp; E or TLC US cable channels for the last few years) hoarding is the inability to dispose of objects, and the accumulation of objects to the point where it negatively affects one's life and the life of one's family.

My ex is also an alcoholic, and cheated on me with 4 different guys.

To make a long story short, we have an ugly custody battle.  I think it's going to be a slam dunk, and it turns out not to be.  The courts buy her ""I have problems, but I'm getting help"" routine.  We end up splitting custody 50/50.  

My ex, from my perspective, is thumbing her nose at me and the courts.  She shows up to pick up our kid with alcohol on her breath, and her house continues to be an absolute shithole.  Every time I send him with her, I die a little inside.

Fast forward a few months: my ex has my kid for the evening.  I fall asleep on the couch.  I awaken to my phone alerting me to a voicemail, at roughly midnight.  I listen to it, and it's pretty apparently a butt-dial.  I hear bar noises, and my ex's drunk voice.  I hear a bartender say to my ex ""you've been drinking for a while, huh"", and she gives a slurred reply.

I go into full on freak out mode.  Where is my 10 year old kid if she is at a bar getting loaded?  I call the cops.  I go to my ex's front door, knock, no answer.  I beat on the door, and the cops shine their car search lights into her windows, no answer.  

I text my ex, asking where she is, and where our kid is.  She says she's inside--hah, yeah, right, and you don't see the lights, or hear the pounding?

Eventually the cops leave, as they tell me they don't have probable cause to break the door down.

15 minutes after they leave, I see my ex's car pull-up.  As I approach the car, I see her sitting there, doing nothing.  The next thing I know, she puts her face into the steering wheel and passes out.

I call the cops back.  They return, and get her out of her car.  To shorten the story, she eventually gives them her house keys, as she can't operate her own door lock. She's arrested for DUI, and endangering the welfare of children.  The cop tells me that he doesn't think the EWOC will stick, but he's willing to charge her with it, and let the DA sort it out.

A couple of weeks go by, my ex gets out of jail.  I call the DA handling my ex's case, and explain my situation, and what's been happening with my son.  I plead with him that both charges need to stick, as the combination of her 2 DUIs (she'd had one earlier that year) and the endangerment charge would turn the tide of my custody fight.

Fast forward a few months: my ex has her meeting with the DA and he plays hardball.  She has to plead guilty to the DUI, and the child endangerment charge, do 90-180 days in jail on the DUI, probation on the child endangerment charge.

It took a while,but with the help of the charges, I finally won my custody case.  I move with my son to a great suburban school, and I've been busily re-building my own life and his. My ex sees my son every other weekend, and she has to do so at her parents' house, as her place is still a hell-hole.

My ex is having difficulty finding work: she just lost her only job since this happened two years ago. She has no bank account, doesn't pay child support, and has trouble finding jobs when employers  hear of her record.

Edit: changed a few spelling and verb tenses.  Also, once I got my ex's keys from her, I retrieved my son from her house.  She had left him there, alone, while she went out to get loaded.


**TL;DR**: Ex leaves my kid alone in the house while she gets loaded.  I have her arrested, and make sure the resulting charges stick.

Gets owned.,630,96,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1eblsb/school_director_tells_me_i_will_go_nowhere_if_i/,"Growing up, I studied on a pretty renowned private school in my neck of the woods. Public schools here in this part of the world are terrible so the private school business does not cater to the rich like in North America, it's a requirement for even the middle class. Of course there are the cheaper ones and the more expensive ones, and the one I was in was the most expensive in the region. It was pretty hard for my mom to afford it but she busted her ass to be able to provide that to us.

As the years went by the tuition kept getting more and more expensive so my mom would have to beg for a discount every year. Bullying was getting more and more intense and the school kept turning a blind eye to it. The final straw happened one time I tried to correct a teacher on a grammar error and he went completely apeshit on me, sent me to the director's office and ridiculed me throughout the whole year - and the school sided completely with him. So my mom asked me if I was OK about looking for a new school. This was two years before high school ended and I would have to face the big exam to get into a university (which is how you get into them around here).

She went there to give them the news and the school's director said this to her: ""*Well, good riddance, see you guys in two years when PolanetaryForotdds will have to come back and do some extra courses here so he's able to get into a university*"" - implying that I wouldn't make it anywhere without the school.

I found another school, private but cheaper, and studied there the remaining two years of high school. Made life-long friends in the process. Studied hard and applied for a test to get into a coveted university, on the most contested program.

Results are in... passed. In **FIRST PLACE**.

If that wasn't sweet enough, days later we are contacted by the school I studied last. They asked me if I wanted to do a commercial that would run on TV and would be plastered all over the city!

I never talked to the previous school's director again, but I'm pretty sure he remembered the words he told my mom when he saw my giant mug on a billboard advertising for his competitor.",,False,,t5_2vjvl,1368549857.0,,,True,t3_1eblsb,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1eblsb/school_director_tells_me_i_will_go_nowhere_if_i/,

It was raining outside and I was braving the elements to bring in carts for customers, and a lady, I will call her ""Mrs. Wonderful"", decides it is my fault that none of the available carts are dry, directing her very loud and aggressive voice past the stand with paper towels to dry the carts, right at me. I begin fuming inside at this entitled bitch who is too good for the elements, but I smile and wipe down her cart for her. I tell her that if customers brought their carts up to the front after unloading their groceries, none of them would be wet, but she disregarded my statements, and later left her cart in the middle of one of the handicapped spots, for it to get rained on. The gears have begun to turn in my head.
Months go by, with her coming in about twice a week to buy $300.00 dollars worth of expensive wine and vegan groceries, for her very wealthy husband I assume, based on her massive ring and Porsche Carrera GT. And then I became a cashier, and I saw my opportunity. Whenever I worked, I would watch for her, and when she got in line I would hop on a register and call her over to my line to checkout. Everything was ready for my revenge.
At our first encounter behind the register, I slipped her salt off the belt to the side, because the only reason people buy salt is because they are out, and basically everything needs salt. I don't ring it up, its not on the receipt, its not in her bags, and its not hers. Perfect. She comes in the next day, only for salt, and with a very unhappy look on her face, I smirk. I do this a couple more times, not every time, because this is a long play, and I cannot get caught, but about every third time.
But I think she is about to put 2 and 2 together, so I move to phase two of the plan. I start to take items off her belt at other cashiers register. She comes in screaming at my manager because her items keep going missing. On the day before, I had taken the Cumin from her belt on another cashiers register. Mrs. Fantastic speed walks in, arms a-swinging, and walks up to the 58 year old gentlemen who had rung her up the day before, and yells ""WHERE IS MY FUCKING CUMIN"", and he started laughing. Made this all worth it, and made me want to continue this to the next level. Mrs. Compassionate then storms over to my manager, who says she will look into it but never does because she thinks Mrs. Forgiving is just looking for free groceries.
Then Mrs. Giving begins to stare intently at the belt when she is checking out. Fuck, what am I going to do now. So whenever I am sweeping the floors and I see her. I steal an item from Mrs. Sharing's basket. Even watching the belt she sees nothing happening, yet her butter, an egg (yes, only a single egg from the carton), some spices, the occasional meat, and when I'm feeling really ballsy, a bottle of wine, gets put swiftly back on the shelf. I can visibly see her breaking down week after week. Looking in her cart to make sure everything is there every minute, watching the belt, being aggressive and hateful to the cashiers.
I step it up another notch. I start to not steal her groceries, but swap them with the competitors brands. I have no idea if she notices, but it makes me feel good inside to think that she is confused when she gets home. One particular night I replaced her 50 dollar bottle of wine with a 3 dollar bottle which I had stored under the register, one that looks eerily similar to the one she bought, and I think I saw her start to tear up when I rang the correct one up for the next day. At least I hope that's what I saw.
1 month ago I decided to lay off this woman because I think I broke her enough to say I've gotten my revenge. That didn't stop her from still checking over her shoulder, watching the belt, staring at the screen that tallies up the order every time she is in the store. BUT, she still leaves her cart in the lot and doesn't put it away, so I am still taking items out of her cart every once in a while, just to keep her on edge, anxious, and fearful, and will continue to haunt her shopping experience, Forever.
So Mrs. Delightfull, thank you for shopping at Ralph's, where you get Real Low Prices, and a Fast Checkout.

1369060591.0,529,self.ProRevenge,1ep1nm,McDumbass (Copied from my r/justiceporn post because of removal by mods).,600,71,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1ep1nm/mcdumbass_copied_from_my_rjusticeporn_post/,"Thought I'd share my tale:

Back in January, my friend and I drive to our local McDonalds. So we are sitting in drive-thru Lane 2, waiting for our order to be taken, when I feel my car inch forward. I didn't have on the e-brake, so I thought maybe I forgot to put my foot on the brake pedal. 

CRUNCH
...
CRUNCH

""WHAT THE FUCK!"" I look behind me and some fuckass in an Envoy is ramming my bumper (I drive a small Hyundai coupe). So I throw my car in gear and pull into a parking spot just past the lanes, friend and I get out, see my bumper marked up like hell, and proceed towards this fucker's truck. As I get closer, I notice this guy's Envoy is half in the lane and half in the flower bed, and I can hear the dude keep trying to drunkenly speak into the mic to order. I finally see the guy and my god he was massive (easily 6-3/6-4, 250lbs+). Also, he was shirtless (real winner, right?). 

I get to his window and my buddy walks around the guy's car for whatever reason (tell ya in a second), and I pull out my phone to take notes, get a phone number...

*keep in mind that this asshole is insanely drunk, sitting in the drive-thru lane throughout this conversation. I tend to approach the type gingerly, as to not get my shit wrecked by a dude that has a good 80lbs or so on me. And though I was pissed as fuck I probably would've taken it easy on the guy had he been cooperative.

""Yeah, I'm gonna need to get some information from you. Pull up and we'll try and work something out, alright?""
""My...name is Jason.""
""Okay, my name is _________. What's your phone number? Do you have your insurance card or anything?""
"".....""

The guy rolls up the window and drives away, as I'm like jogging behind him screaming obscenities. FUCK

So now I'm burger-less with a beat-up car, and some dick just pulled a hit-and-run on me. God fucking dammit. End up calling the cops, and one car with two officers show up about five-six minutes later. I give them the run-down on the guy's looks, kind of truck, color of it, etc. ""Did you get a tag number?"" Ah well shit, I didn't. My friend hears this and comes around with his phone, with a picture of ""Jason""'s tag (mahnigga.jpg). The second cop runs the tag number, and it doesn't match the Envoy. Fucking. Great. Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck. The cop that ran the tag just goes back to sit in the car while the other finishes up with me.

Unfortunately for me, ""Jason"" was probably long gone. I had a bogus tag number, a pretty vague description of the guy, no information besides what was probably a fake name, and an Envoy to go on. No insurance info; not shit. So if I reported it to my insurance at this point, it would've been like I fucked my car up myself. GREAT

Anyway, the cop and I are about to finish up with the scene and he's taking down some of my own information when the second cop gets out of the car.

""Hey, what was that tag number again?""
-reads out tag number
-Second cop points to the drive-thru
-""Son. of. a. bitch.""

The dumbass had come back like, fifteen minutes later, with the cops and myself still there, to the drive-thru for his burger. Cops acted quick, pulled him outta the truck, searched him and the truck, and put him in cuffs. Truck was towed.

""Jason"" scored a Minor in Possession, Hit-and-Run, whatever the charge is for having a bogus tag, and a DUI charge. His parents were nice enough to pay me some cash for my car (which I gladly accepted and finished paying my car off), and I decided not to press any further. The state is gonna have a lot of fun with him, so why should I bother?

I owe a lot to my friend for being so proactive in documenting the scene. He's received plenty of beers for the act since. And the cop said I was the luckiest dude he'd ever seen. I'd agree.

Kids, if you're in a fender-bender, take pictures of that shit. Hope you enjoyed!

**Background**

I work in a big international company, instore as a part of the warehouse operative (basically we do everything for everyone). The manager of the warehouse team is a ~~really nice person~~ cunt. She employed her son full time when he turned 18 and gave him his own pick at what hours he would like. So now he has become her whipping boy when she is around (never), but when she is not he does as he likes. He orders people around, shouts at people and sits on his big fat ass and does nothing at all.

**The Actual Story**

So the other day after feeling bad all day i told him that if i feel this shitty i will not be coming in tomorrow and i will call his mum and tell her. So i carry on working the rest of the shift, i think he's cool, i dont know why everyone slags him off. We are locking up and he asks me if i smoked weed. I said oh yeah im going to smoke some when i get home. We carry on talking and he admits that he smokes to. Shift ends.
I call in sick the following day because i feel really shitty. So when i return to work 2 days later i found out he told his mum that i ""couldnt be arsed to work"" and i was going to lie to get the day off.
Manager pulls me aside bollocks me. He spreads around work i lied to get the day off.

The same day the manager bollocks me, i also get a random locker search. I have some items in my bag that i bought earlier instore. They didnt want to see the reciept, instead they sniffed through my bag saying they where looking for something in particular (obviously the weed).

So by now i know that he snitched on me to his mum twice. i then decided i was going to have some fun with it.

**REVENGE**

So then i asked him if he wanted to buy some cocaine (Something he said he takes all the time) from me. I will be bringing quite a lot in tomorrow at work so he can buy. I hinted that i would have about half a kilo (LOL).

So when i get to work scan in i get a call from the manager to meet me in the locker room. By the time i get in there three private security officers are following me from the staff room. Then i go into the locker room there are a further 8 officers and 1 drug sniffer dog. I get made to open my locker and empty my bag. During this time the manager and her son are standing in the locker room with me smirking. Also the regional manager is instore so he is in there to.

No drugs in my bag. 
Store gets fined a lot of money for wasting time. 
his mum gets demoted for calling in the search
he gets the sack and trys to fight me. 
he gets arrested for assault. 
he gets 7 months in prison.

A nice added bonus to my last pay packet. 
I leave the company the next week to go to University.
We are even.

**Prison**

Basically i was coming in work one day and he was waiting for me in the staff area. I thought nothing of it and just got changed when i was getting changed coincidentally the a security guard was just starting his shift to. So then when the guy saw me i was with the security guard.
He walked up to me and basically punched me in the back of the head whilst i was walking away (cheap shot). But it was all on camera and the security guard was a witness to it all. His mum got a new job after this.

A tale of evil clients and knights in shining QA departments. &amp;nbsp;

**The Setting:**  
Our company runs a set of databases with a light website for managing reports on data, all of which is used as a customer management system for a large number of large clients that want to host websites but don't want to manage a database to sit behind it.   
  
**The Heroes:**  
I work as a lowly QA Tech in a QA department of about 8. I've been working in this place for about 5 years now and I'm frequently asked to sit in on calls with clients. They trust me enough now to leave me to get on with things and communicate with the client directly if there's anything I want to ask about.  
  
My boss is a certified legend with a degree from the college of How To Earn Respect. The guy lets me get on with my work and takes care of all the business side and interdepartmental politics. Great boss.  
  
My good friend (who we'll call Greg) works as a fairly senior member of the Customer Support department. Greg's got my back and I've got his. If he has something come through that he needs help with or looks serious then I'll help him out.  
  
**The Villain:**  
The client's project manager (who we'll imaginatively call... Douche) was tasked with being the gateway for all communication with us and was either extremely vague or mathematically incompetent whenever he discussed the requirements for what would be delivered. When paired together, these things often mean that bad things will happen. To make things worse, this guy was intentionally insulting because he could get away with it. After all, he is a paying customer.  
  
**The Pledge:**  
The client paid us for a piece of work where we made a custom API which we expose on our SOAP interface. It was a good feature, and one which our sales representatives had probably been told to try and get a client to fund for quite some time. Implementing it was a nightmare because they had added some complex functionality in their requirements document just before they signed it off. All my best attempts to try to resolve inconsistencies and make it work logically fell on deaf ears and eyes that refuse to read emails. One exchange with Douche on this topic went thus:  
  
&gt;*Me:* Hi Douche, its Derp at &lt;Company&gt;. Just calling abou...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Oh hi, yeah, the slacker at &lt;Company&gt;. Hows it going?  
  
It should be pointed out that we were slightly behind schedule because there were a number of outstanding issues in the database procedure behind the call, hence why this was obviously MY fault.  
  
&gt;*Me (biting my tongue):* I'm... I'm OK... thanks. Just calling about your requirements on the API which you sent throu...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Oh this again? Haven’t you finished that yet?  
  
&gt;*Me:* Well, no. You'll remember that we've delayed it due to some issues with the procedure which you've been infor...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Oh for the love of.. Why is it taking so long?  
  
&gt;*Me:* That's what I wanted to ask about. Requirement 6.5.12 says its supposed to calculate X but lower down it states the maths you want it to use. The problem is that this equation doesn't actually represent that val...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Look, you're supposed to follow the specification I'VE written, so just do it! I don't want to hear about this again until its done!  
  
The next day my boss tells me that Douche complained about me to his account manager, saying that I was being offensive and was questioning his competency. (He can read minds?!?) I then completed this piece of work, ensuring that his specification was followed to every exact instruction.   
  
**The Turn:**  
After the best part of 6 months, and the client is about to go live with their site. They've been trying to sort out their own internal testing teams and third parties for such a long time that we ended up completing the work a full 5 months before they were even able to test it, and at this point they were going live in 3 days because that's when their marketing campaign said it would. Because of these tight deadlines, they signed it off in our Acceptance Testing sandbox and we considered the work to be complete. I had all but forgotten that previous conversation with Douche.  
  
About 3pm Friday afternoon, Greg from CS calls me up says he's got an issue with Douche. Greg now knows first hand how douchy Douche can be. This is because after our work was completed and promoted to our live system, any issues they had integrating were not development issues, but customer support issues.  
  
I make my way over to CS land and this is where things get fun.  
  
&gt;*Me:* 'Sup Greg? (sipping my coffee because these usually involve a long conversation about the functionality of features)  
  
&gt;*Greg:* Hey Derp.You ever worked on this new API that went up for &lt;Client_Name&gt;?  
  
&gt;*Me:* Yeah, I did the verification process on it. What do you want to know?  
  
&gt;*Greg:* The Client seems to think it doesn't work.  
  
&gt;*Me:* It was implemented to the letter. Plus other clients have been picking it up and using it since it went out, haven't they?  
  
&gt;*Greg:* Yeah, that's what I thought when I read the documentation. Ok, leave it with me and I'll let Douche know.  
  
I head back to my desk and start pulling out all the documentation I have on this feature because I know exactly what's coming next. After not too long, Steve (the account manager for Douche) storms into QA and straight into Boss' office. There's a lot of shouting and raised voices and eventually I'm called in.   
  
&gt;*Steve:* Would you care to explain this?  
  
Steve points at an email on Boss' screen. I go in for a closer inspection and it's an email from Douche claiming that their launch is probably going to be a disaster because the API has “obviously not been tested at all”. I'm surprised Steve believes this because he knows me and I've worked on various projects for him in the past.  
  
&gt;*Me:* I was firmly told my Mr Douche that I was to implement it to the specification.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* But the reporting section of the response that comes out is utter nonsense! It doesn't make sense!  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Derp, what did the specification say about this?  
  
&gt;*Me:* I can grab the documentation from my desk if you like.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* I think that would be a good idea.  
  
I go and fetch the documents and all the eyes in the department are on me, wanting to know what's going on. On the way back, I see Boss trying to calm Steve down.  
  
&gt;*Me:* Here it is.  
  
I slide it across the desk and take a seat. Steve and Boss scan through it and find where it talks about these reporting figures and wait to be spoken to. Steve turns a little pale and Boss smiles.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* But that makes no sense!  
  
&gt;*Me:* I know.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* Why didn't you raise this with the client?  
  
&gt;*Me:* I did. I then was accused of insulting the client’s project manager and calling him incompetent.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Who wrote this specification?  
  
&gt;*Me:* Douche over on their side did. I'm pretty sure you two would have been CC'd on the email when it came across.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* Well what are we going to do? We have to fix this before they go live on Sunday! (it's now 3:45 Friday Afternoon)  
  
&gt;*Boss:* No chance. We only release new code on Monday or Tuesday unless it's a priority 1 issue. Even then, this is an API that multiple clients are now using and we'll have to be careful not to break their integrations.  
  
&gt;*Me:* Steve, You might want to look at section 21 on that document.  
  
Steve quickly flicks to this section of the documentation where the final clause states how any modifications to this constitute as a change request and chargeable work. Steve is much more calm because he knows his ass is covered. That and I've made him some serious commission from clauses like that in the past.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* OK, wait there.  
  
Steve now stands a chance to make a considerable amount of commission. The client wrote the requirements, signed off the requirements, signed off the work in Acceptance Testing, and have only 32 hours before they launch. They will be willing to pay a significant sum to fund the overtime required from personnel to get this straight.  
  
***The Prestige:***  
It's 4:45 and I am considering what I'll spend my weekend doing. Boss walks out of his office and comes over to me.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Can you just join me on a conference call?  
  
&gt;*Me:* If it's quick.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* That's up to you really.  
  
Intrigued, I follow him into his office where I can hear a much more humble sounding Douche on the phone, explaining to Steve what needs to be done.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Steve, I have Derp here, do you want to explain what the plan is?  
  
&gt;*Steve:* Derp, we really need to get this sorted. You worked on the original feature so you'll know the best way to test this. We're still working on getting someone to develop the change but we'll be willing to pay you triple time this evening and tomorrow to work on this for Sunday. We reckon we can do this patch without any impact to our other clients.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* I really need you to help me out here mate, otherwise it'll really hit the fan over here.  
  
I pause and enjoy this brief moment of pure justice.  
  
&gt;*Me:* I've already made plans for this weekend and...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Derp, seriously, you HAVE to help me out here.  
  
&gt;*Me:* I don’t really feel like it.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* WELL SOMEONE NEEDS TO FIX THIS!!  
  
&gt;*Boss:* It's 5pm on a Friday. Most staff are on their way home or out the door. Sorry Steve but it looks like it'll have to wait until next week.  
  
Douche rages down the phone and, once this torrent of abuse subsides, Steve lets me go back to my desk.
I'm packing up for the end of the day and my phone rings.  
  
&gt;*Me:* &lt;Company&gt;, Derp spea...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Please, I need you to do this.  
  
&gt;*Me:* You need to sort this out and calling me won't help you.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Please, I'm sorry, just help me out.  
  
&gt;*Me:* You have been extremely rude to me and insulted me whenever we've spoken. Your failure to listen to me is the sole reason you're here right now. I did exactly what you asked and you have treated me with contempt every step of the way. I am not helping you.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Please...  
  
He's actually crying. You can hear it in the way his voice is all shaky. So I hang up and leave for my weekend.  
  
**The End:**  
Monday rolls around and Steve introduces me to a new project manager for the client who's organising the fix to the API.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* So, Derp, this is Herp. Another project manager for &lt;Client_Name&gt;.  
  
&gt;*Me:* Is Douche not working on this project?  
  
&gt;*Herp:* Douche no longer works here.  
  
Tl;DR: Douche PM for client writes Spec for API. SPROC logic makes no sense, PM thinks he's infallible. QA Tech questions logic, gets reported for being insulting. Client doesn't test the API, signs it off anyway. It hits the fan, release date is ruined. PM is in DEEP and pleads for help.

I've mentioned in a past post ""Don't wish bad on other's, wish good on yourself."" This is a prime example.

After college, the recession had started up and jobs were severely limited. I ended up taking an entry level call center job for retirement plans which is quite possibly the worst hell you can imagine. I was talking to 80 yr old women during the stock market plummets and had to tell them what happened to their life savings.

It was heart shattering.

You also experience the worst of the genetic toilet, and that's where this one caller I'll name ""Big Mac"" falls in.

I was called at 9 AM by an older man who demanded to speak with my friend (who was a manager in training). My friend wasn't going to be in until 9:30 AM, so I told him and offered to either transfer to his voicemail, take a message and email him personally, or transfer him to whatever manager was available. Ill call my friend Bob

Big Mac: You're not *listening.* I'm *telling you* to transfer me to Bob RIGHT NOW.

Me: ...I understand you want to talk to Bob, but he doesn't get in for another half hour. It's literally physically impossible to transfer you.

Big Mac (or BM) didn't comprehend this. Stating it was absurd that he was on vacation in Florida (he lived I think in Jersey) and he had to call and couldn't talk to Bob and just kept bitching in general. I offered numerous times to help him myself or any of the other options I gave him earlier. He became more irate

BM: Now you listen to me. You make *sure* Bob calls me before he has his first cup of coffee. *DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME??*

Me: Ok. (Staying calm, I mentally checked out on this dude after the 3rd time explaining Bob wasn't there)

BM: Now listen *very* closely. If Bob doesn't call me when he gets in, I'm going to my local McDonald's and shooting up the place and I'm going to blame *your company* and-

Me: SIR, *SIR* we're on a recorded line I really ask you *not* to joke about murder

BM: YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW SERIOUS I AM

At the exact moment I spoke...Bob was walking by me.

Me: Ok.

We hung up within 20 seconds.

Me: I really hope I never have to deal with a dude like that again (here's where the wish comes into play)

Bob: That guy sounded pleasant. Now...what's this about ""joking about murder?""

I told him and within 20 minutes, they called BM's local police and arrested him (in Jersey. Calling from Florida, huh?)

The police later told me when they arrested BM, he was yelling that he was going to sue the cops, his town and state, my company and most of all *me* for slander. He continued to yell and deny until he was sat down in the police station and was played the phone call.

The cops tell me BM immediately burst into tears and begged for forgiveness and that he didn't mean it. This was immediately 5 minutes after he maintained his stance on denying allogations and suing everyone.

I ended up talking to BM once more two weeks later. Much more sheepish than before and ended the call by telling me how much he appreciated my service (he recognized my name and voice and knew I was the same guy).

Like I said, don't wish bad on others, wish good on yourself. If a wish comes true one helps you more than the other.

How my dad dealt with student neighbours who parked in our yard.,568,82,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/14j2ud/xpost_from_pettyrevenge_how_my_dad_dealt_with/,"This dates back to 1992 when I lived with my parents in a university town. We used to have students live next door and a little downhill from us, and they'd continually park their cars inside our property near a dodgy fence between our properties. Their place was full of junk and only had one accessible driveway where one of the longer-term students would always park. Dad was a lawn-proud man, and while he was incredibly patient with these guys, and would ask them repeatedly to move their cars, he hit breaking point one weekend there was a big race in town. Half a dozen visiting student guest shitbox cars ended up in our lawn, and he went around to protest, saying it'd gone beyond ridiculous, especially in wet weather when it'd be likely to damage his lawn all the more. They promised like they always did that they'd get the cars out and not park there ever again but hey - the race was on, they all wanted to watch it and have a decent sunday and they'd leave them there until the race was over.

As I mentioned, our back yard was uphill from theirs, and part way through the race it really started bucketing down. Dad didn't show any outward anger, but he went into town, came back with a few bottles of dishwashing liquid, and coated the whole lawn in the stuff. Come evening some of the guys needed to move their cars and when they got to the downhill slope to go out our driveway found they couldn't steer or brake.

Two made it out without much damage, but the third slid sideways, got onto the steeper part of the lawn and went straight through the fence and into one of the other students' cars and pushed it sideways into the house. Total damage? four student cars with dents, one with busted front suspension, one wall of the student rental totalled, a bunch of arrogant students kicked out, and a few skidmarks on dad's lawn. Total cost to my dad? four bucks in dishwashing liquid, a few weeks lawn regrowth and a brand new fence shared with the new neighbours, who were pretty decent people.

Dad's response to the police asking about the frothy shit on the lawn? ""White oil. kills bugs""

**TL;DR: Arrogant neighbours kept parking on my dad's lawn, so one day when a whole lot of them were parked on the hill he lubed up the lawn and they went everywhere. Damage caused neighbours to be kicked out, problem solved, revenge gained.**",,False,,t5_2vjvl,False,,,True,t3_14j2ud,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/14j2ud/xpost_from_pettyrevenge_how_my_dad_dealt_with/,

Does it count as petty revenge if the target didn't specifically do anything to me, personally?

A few years ago I went back to school to get another BA because the first time around my GPA could be charitably called ""aggressively mediocre"" and I really wanted to go to grad school. My wife had a full time job at the time so I didn't need to get a part time job or anything but I get bored easily. I applied for a campus security job because it fit my schedule and wasn't particularly demanding work. It was a pretty easy gig involving mostly sitting around in the lobbies of various dorms on weekends and checking IDs of incoming individuals to make sure everyone coming into the dorms was a resident or guest. It was part of the campus safety initiative. Most of the time I just sat there and studied since most of the excitement was just after last call—this is in Canada so it's pretty normal for freshmen to be legal drinking age. Occasionally, I was asked to patrol around campus and ticket cars that were improperly parked. I didn't mind the walking but ticketing students never sat well with me—who has money for that shit?—so this was not my favorite part of the job.

As an aside, I tended to not give out tickets unless the person parking was actually blocking something important or their parking job caused a hazard. Fuck the man.

Anyway, one day in the late fall—still above freezing but not by much—I was outside the engineering building and I saw a newish BMW 3-series—or maybe it was an M3, I don't recall so I'm just going to say it was an M3 for brevity—parked in the handicap spot and it did not have handicapped tags. As usual, I approach the car slowly, like I'm sneaking up on it. I discovered that people who are about to get a ticket tend towards the loud and aggressive. I've found that no one actually likes the meter nazi and a loud, blustery car owner tends to attract an unsympathetic crowd. It's better to sneak up on the car, confirm that it is, in fact, illegally parked (or has an expired pass), walk away, write the ticket, and then casually return and slip the ticket under the wiper. 

&gt;Be me, meter nazi

&gt;Use stealthy ticket

&gt;It is very effective

I wrote out the ticket stuck it under the wiper and walked off. I did another walk around the rear parking lot and then, because it was near the end of my shift, I returned to that same building because there was a Tim's inside and I wanted to grab lunch and a coffee. I go inside, get my coffee and sandwich then go back outside to have a smoke. I'm standing by the [smoking pawn](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-22DySWZ92tE/TefG5ONiZXI/AAAAAAAAA2o/pf35mfKs20o/s1600/smoking_pawn.jpg)—I don't actually know what these things are called—drink in one hand, sandwich tucked in my jacket pocket, smoke in the other hand, and just zone out. Next thing I know there's some guy in my line of sight swearing loudly. I zone back in and realize it must be the owner of the M3. He's this skinny dude, wearing a [puffy vest](http://www.gap.com/products/res/thumbimg/quilted-puffer-vest-blue.jpg), and he's got fancy hair. I figure he's probably 18 or 19. 20 tops. He's got the yellow envelope in one hand and he's all, ""Fucking shit, fuck fuck, dick, cunt, shit, fuck, motherfucker, etc."" 

While he's swearing and having a bit of a spaz, he's also looking around, presumably to see if the meter nazi is still around so he can give him a piece of his mind.

Oh wait, I'm the meter nazi! And I'm like 30 feet away! Still smoking. Sandwich in my pocket, coffee in the other hand, parking ticket printer slung across my chest. Well shit. 

&gt;Be me

&gt;Be at the end of your shift

&gt;Expect to be yelled at by Puffy Vest Fancy Hair


I steel myself for the eventual tirade. Policy is we have to be all beta about confrontations. Our interactions should consist of ""yes sir/ma'am"", ""no sir/ma'am"", ""I understand, sir/ma'am"" but overall being firm about why they received a ticket.  He swings his vision around several times but doesn't seem to spot me. I'm not wearing anything distinct other than the mandatory, blue, campus security jacket, and a *ticket printer*. He keeps looking around. Left. Right. Left. Right.

I take another drag.

For whatever reason, he doesn't see me. He angrily throws the ticket and yellow envelope into his car, bleeps the car with his remote, *and heads back into the building*.

So, I'm still standing by the [smoking pawn](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-22DySWZ92tE/TefG5ONiZXI/AAAAAAAAA2o/pf35mfKs20o/s1600/smoking_pawn.jpg), sandwich in my pocket, half-full medium double-double—the old medium, not the new upsized medium—with one drag left on my smoke. So I finish my smoke, feed the pawn, and sit down at the nearby bench to have my sandwich. I'm sitting on the bench, eating my sandwich, drinking my coffee, and staring at this M3 that is still parked in the handicap space.

""I'm gonna finish my sandwich, drink my double-double, *have another smoke*, and then I'm going to give him another ticket"", says I to myself.

""It's a trap"", replies my brain, making a very good point.

""I dunno man, this is too good of an opportunity to pass up.""

""I'm just saying""

""How could it be a trap? What, he has a gang of puffy vested bros in there just waiting to challenge me to a [dance off](http://nycxplorer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/West-Side-Story-2.jpg)?""

""Do whatever you want, just no concussions.""

My brain made a valid point. This would be an excellent trap. I pop the last of my sandwich into my mouth, wash it down with my now lukewarm double-double and light up another smoke—Du Maurier Light Kings with the droopy cigarette impotence warning, no doubt—and stare at the entrance to the engineering building.

No sign of Puffy Vest Fancy Hair. With one hand I start typing out the ticket on the printer but don't press the ""print"" button yet—if I hit the button it saves the data and there's no way to undo it once that happens. I wasn't yet ready to commit to this course of action. I finish my second cigarette, pull out a yellow envelope, take a breath and hit ""print"" as I start walking toward the car. The thermal printer quickly spits out the ticket and I quickly insert the ticket into the envelope and sling it under the wiper. 

Nothing happens.

No ambush.

No screaming.

No Puffy Vest Fancy Hair.

All that buildup for nothing.

I check my phone—if I recall correctly, it was a motorola flip phone of some variety—and shift ended a few minutes ago. I'm not technically in any hurry to get back to the office, we have lots of ticket printers for the next shift so I'm not preventing anyone from starting their shift by dillydallying. I use the camera phone—with a whopping 640x480 resolution—to take a photo of the ticket sitting on his passenger seat and a photo of the ticket under his wiper. Then I walk into the engineering building, get another coffee and plant myself back in the designated smoking area, and I hope that this kid isn't in a three hour class. I'm now here for a show. I'm going to get yelled at, it'll be a huge scene, I'll have to be all professional about it, but seeing Puffy Vest Fancy Hair have another spaz is totally worth it.

""You're an idiot"", says my brain.

I let my coffee cool just for a bit before I take a swig. Of course, I forgot to check where the paper cup seam was and dribbled coffee down my chin. Son of a bitch. I put my coffee down and awkwardly wipe the coffee dribble from my chin just as I hear another stream of, ""CUNT FUCK MOTHERFUCKER WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK"" erupts from the vicinity of the M3. 

""WHO THE FUCK DID THIS?!""

""WHAT THE FUCK?!!""

There's Puffy Vest Fancy Hair: Sack of fast food in one hand, jumbo fountain drink in the other—ah, to have the metabolism of a 19 year-old again—He's whirling around, trying to find the meter nazi again while swearing up a storm. He's now making enough of a scene that people are actually staring at him as they walk by. For some reason, he still hasn't spotted me. I'm standing a mere 30 feet from where he is spazzing. I am right beside the smoking pawn, wearing a blue jacket that says ""Campus Security"" on it. I have a printer slung over my shoulder and across my chest. For some reason, his gaze never lingers on me at all. After a few more seconds of spazzing, he gets in his car, throws the other ticket onto his seat and speeds away.

Why he didn't see me is inexplicable. The only hypothesis I have is that he was expecting the parking enforcement officer to be wearing something else. Maybe a [high visibility vest](http://www.legionsafety.com/high-visibility-safety-vests.jpg) or maybe something [like this](http://www.sjsu.edu/parking/pics/interceptor.JPG), I dunno.

I don't recall how much those tickets  run (a few hundred I think) but that kid had one expensive day. My boss did tell me that the kid's father called in pretty pissed about the tickets. I had emailed my boss the camera phone photos that afternoon because I figured he'd probably ask my why I wrote two tickets to the same guy on the same day. My boss explained to the kid's father that because campus security had witnessed the driver return to his vehicle, remove the ticket, and leave, it counted as a separate parking incident, thus, two tickets were warranted.

Except for my manager, BrownNoser. Now, BrownNoser (BN for short) was about 19, not all that bright, and got to his position as warehouse manager by kissing massive amounts of ass. I was a few months older than him, and had been there for a year or so. Maybe a bit less. But point is, I was one of the more senior guys on the delivery staff.

So, one fine day, my truck went out, did it's deliveries, and was back by about 1pm (We started at 8, and usually went to 4-5, for reference.) I was looking forward to going home a bit early, but BN had different plans for me. What's important to remember in what follows is that BN was a salaried worker, and I had an hourly wage.

I finish loading up my truck for the next day, and am just walking to the punch clock to punch out for the day, when I hear his nasally voice.

BN: Hey, Bedfellow, hold on a sec.

Me: What is it, BN?

BN: I need you to go out and wash your truck. It's dirty, and that doesn't reflect well on the company.

Me: youbestbejoking.png

BN: Come on, chop chop. I'm not paying you to stand around.

Me: You don't pay me shit. (I had no respect for this guy, and he and I both knew it. But, I got shit done, so the higher-ups weren't about to get rid of me.)

BN: Yeah, well, that can change if you don't do what I say. Here's what you'll need to wash it. The pressure washer is outside.

*BN hands me things like company-made bottles of glass cleaner, leather polish (for the dashboard), industrial soap, you know, basic truck cleaning stuff)*

Me: Whoah, whoah, hey now. I've never used this stuff before, and I've seen these [WHMIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_Hazardous_Materials_Information_System) symbols before. I'm going to need to have a look at the [MSDS](http://www.cagreen.ca/images/benmuti1msds.jpg) sheets for all of these supplies.

BN: Dude, no. It's glass cleaner and soap. It's in literally every household. Just go do what I tell you.

Me: No. I have the right to refuse unsafe work and until I fully understand the hazards that these materials present, and have all the necessary PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) I don't feel safe using these products.

BN: Stop being dumb. Just go do it.

Me: This is in direct violation of Occupational Health &amp; Safety guidelines, and if forced to proceed, I will be lodging a formal complaint both with OH&amp;S, as well as BigBossMan.

At this point, BN knows he is defeated. But I'm still just warming up.

BN: Fine. The sheets are this way.

He takes me to the room with the MSDS sheets, where I spend the next 15 minutes perusing the sheets, asking inane questions just to make sure he doesn't leave. Remember, I'm getting paid by the hour. He isn't.

Me: Well, these supplies have the potential to cause skin and eye irritation, and this other cleaner needs to be used in a well-ventilated area. I'm going to require PPE to protect against these hazards.

Cue half an hour of BN and I rooting around the warehouse looking for rubber gloves that came past my elbows, a thick rubber apron, rubber boots, a plastic face shield, safety goggles, and a respirator. Pretty much [this](http://www.workplacelawconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Battery-PPE.gif) stuff, but it wasn't all in one convenient location like this.

I don all the safety gear. BN is visibly agitated.

BN: You look like an idiot. I hope you know that.

Me: I look like a *safe* idiot. I'm alright with that.

BN: Alright, NOW will you go wash the truck?

Me: I've never used the pressure washer before. I'm going to need to be fully trained on that before I operate it.

BN: There's an on button, three power settings, and a trigger. A 4 year old could work it.

Me: I don't feel safe using it until I've been properly trained in it's operation. I could hurt myself.

If looks could kill, I would be dead. But luckily I am protected from his acid gaze by my PPE. Seriously, I'm fucking immortal under all this shit.

We head out to the pressure washer, and I make him go over everything in excruciating detail. Again, I question everything. ""If there's a kink in the hose, could the machine rupture? What if it ruptures? This is a gas-powered washer. What if gas spills? I'll need a fire extinguisher..."" This takes almost 20 minutes. We also have to go find the aforementioned fire extinguisher. At this point, we're about an hour and fifteen minutes into this, and I haven't even started washing the truck.

Me: Oh hey, BN. Before you go, you'll need to show me how ot use all these chemical cleaners. I read the MSDS sheets, but I still don't know how to properly use them.

BN pretty much washes half the interior of the truck (no PPE of course) with me asking ever more questions.

Me: Alright. I think I feel ready to do this now.

BN: Finally. Asshole.

Me: I take my safety seriously, and you should too.

BN storms off, muttering under his breath.

I proceed to take 10 minutes wiping down the truck, and another 5 rinsing it clean. I go into BN's office.

Me: Alright, I'm done.

BN: That was fast.

Me: It was a pretty easy job. Here's all the PPE back. Thanks for being understanding concerning my safety.

I drop the PPE in a pile on his carpeted floor. It was covered in the mud from the exterior of the truck.

Me: I think I'm going to take off now. Have a good night, BN!

He didn't reply. He just looked like he wanted to cry.

I left a little after 3pm that day, having wasted almost 2 hours of BN's time. I found out the next day that he didn't leave til 7 that night.

I was never asked to wash the trucks again.

I will make Twilight your fucking prison.,575,127,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/17a4ue/you_ruin_the_halfblood_prince_for_me_i_will_make/,"Long story short, my (asshole) sister ruined the Half-Blood Prince installment in the Harry Potter series. At the time, she was OBSESSED with Twilight, and was reaching the end of the last book. She was 16, I was 13, and I was house sitting until she got home (Roughly an hour from when I devise my plan).

Here's the plan which I started: She kept the last Twilight book in her room on her shelf. I ripped out all of the necessary pages to read the big finish. I then disconnected out internet from our router (She couldn't figure out the power button on my Xbox, I had nothing to worry about). She gets home, leaves her purse in the kitchen and goes to her room. She forgets her cellphone in her purse, I take it and hide it to be given back anonymously later, that way she can't call anyone for an extra book (She can't drive, she got home on her school bus, no permit). Best part of all, she can't leave the house without my parents permission, which she can't get because I have hidden her and all the other phones in the house (No safety hazard, I knew where they were and were easily accessible, if you knew where they were).

Now comes the fun part: She's mad because she finished all of the rest of the book and finds her last necessary pages ripped out. She's searching the house first for her pages, then her cellphone/any phone, and can't find either. She's trapped in our house without her final pages or any way to get a borrowed copy. Our parents finally get home from their jobs, and as they are opening the garage door I run past my sister's room and yell in her door the spoiler ending to the last Twilight book, which she never read. She immediately goes to our parents and tells them everything I (supposedly) did, giving me time to cleanly (and unnoticeably) tape the pages back together, put her cellphone in her purse (She is standing at their car telling them everything, keeping them in their car), replace the home phones, and get in my room to act like I've been staring at my video games ever since I got home.

My long term Italian GF surprised me (I'm Australian BTW) and everyone else, including mutual friends, when she used her key to my apartment, grabbed all her stuff, and left the key at the top if the stairs as her break up. I was *literally* proposing to her that fucking night at the restaurant we frequented. After numerous attempts at contacting her, 3 days later all I get was a text of 'I'm sorry.' And nothing else for the next year, to no one. Total embargo of all contact. I'm not the *perfect* boyfriend, but I was stumped and utterly *destroyed* emotionally. Had no idea what would make her do this, and so were all our friends, mutual or otherwise. I hit my local after the text of course, where one of the bartenders (let's call him Fritzl) who is a backpacker, expresses his condolences and gives me free drinks for the night. 

Fast forward 12 months, Fritzl and the ex are married. And this would not do. After a few discreet enquiries, this is what happened:

First, an anonymous phone call to Immigration has them investigating the marriage. I didn't think much of it at the time (stupid social networking) but according to her Facebook she was 'engaged' to Fritzl *3 months before* the split. That, is what I and Immigration would call precedent, believe it or not. 

Second, her Hyper-Catholic mother (who never liked me cos I was an 'Aussie Heathen') had set up a joint bank account for them around the same time at her bank, where she is Manager. More info for that paper trail, Immigration! ( found this out from her younger sister and also reported it, more info in a moment) 

Thirdly, a rather descriptive video from a drunken house party, was sent to her employer displaying a very drunk ex slurring on about how much she hates children, and what she does to them when they piss her off in detail. ( She's a kindergarten teacher.) Whoops, there goes her job, I find out gleefully.

Fourthly, as the Operations Manager of a Security Company that handles the majority of contracts for pubs and clubs in and around her area, I put a blanket entry ban on her and Fritzl complete with photos. You wanna go out, or to places you used to enjoy? Awww, I guess you **have to go for an hour ride to the other side of the city now!!!**

 Lastly, and the icing on the wedding cake, I am now engaged to her pregnant (not mine, but the Ex thinks it is) younger sister, who kicked her off the lease so I could move in. (Father owns this house and *loves* me) 

Needless to say, I don't think she will be at the wedding. And if she does come, ill casually mention **every fucking thing I did.** and then finish my drink with a flourish, and kiss my new wife.

Update: my SO was in a car accident a few hours ago out in the sticks. Word from her father is not good, she's still unconscious. Typing from a cab after my replacement security arrived. Don't know why I'm putting this here, trying to keep my mind off the worst I suppose. News as develops.

Why my aunt married him, is a mystery. He was an alcoholic, and a pervert to the extreme. He couldn't hold down a job, and was a terrible father. Not only that he was always in the trouble with the law for some reason.

Well this happened quite some time ago (think 20~ years back) in a small town in the middle of no where where the sheriff also had the same high regard for Bob.

Well Bob was renowned for peeping into bathroom windows for a bit of voyager action. However one night he decided he'd peep in on my cousin taking a shower. Not only was this perverted, wrong, and illegal, it was within the family! 

Unfortunately for Bob my other uncle Tom was walking home when he spotted Bob grazing through the bathroom window, and he could hear the shower running so he knew Bob was peeping his daughter.

Well unfortunately for Bob, Tom is quite a large man, he works construction. For every ounce of strength Tom has Bob lacks. 

Tom grabbed Bob and for the next several minutes pummels him into submission, punches to the face, gut, throwing around, just a general quality beat down. Of course this all speculation, as the police report was quite different.

The after math was not pretty, broken nose, cracked eye socket, broken ribs, and plenty of blood over both men.

Of course the Sheriff who is well acquainted with Bob is called in. The Sheriff arrives a few minutes later and sees Bob on the sidewalk obviously in pain and he sees Tom it's obvious there was a fight. So the Sheriff walks up to Tom and says ""What happened here"" Tom starts to go off and the Sheriff stops and says ""now Tom it appears to me as if Bob came over and tripped? Is that what happened?""

To which Tom responded indeed it was. The sheriff turned around looked at Bob and said ""Bob, it appears as if you tripped and fell and I'm going take you the hospital""

 A girl (call her C) I knew was raped. Another girl (Call her M) was always mean to her and to my group of friends in general. This girl bullied anyone who wouldn't retaliate. She slept with girls boyfriends, she faked being a lesbian and led a girl on for as long as she could for the attention, and went after C at every chance she could get. 

 So one day when it was known that C was raped and M walked up and told her she was faking the whole thing. That the whole story was a lie and that no one would want to rape someone like C. I wasn't personally there but when i found out i was furious. 

I had a couple of friends that were younger and being only slightly in my circle of friends anyways, I figured I wouldn't be a suspect. I gathered my other scattered friends, and told them M's name. I mentioned that she did something to wrong a good person and that she deserved whatever they could come up with. 

The rumors started about M. She slept around a lot so having an STD was believable. No one would sleep with her anymore. This was the only big rumor. It ended her ego. Her friends even believed it. (I should mention that one of the boys she slept with frequently while he was dating another friend of mine, had chlamydia.) It worked. She left C alone and went into her own little world of drama. Everyone knew one of us did it, or started it but I kept my mouth shut. No one knew about my friends, or about what I started. 

I never heard anything about it again until recently. She is still having trouble trying to get a boyfriend. Apparently they want her tested before they go any farther. Every one of them. 

This was a terrible thing to do. I know this, but I got my revenge and C got better without any trouble and no one got physically hurt. All I did was ruin her reputation.

I just fucked over my ""family""",485,76,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1elnyi/pettyrevenge_told_me_to_post_this_here_i_just/,"To give you some background, I'm 26 years old. I've been taking care of my family my whole life, while they really never gave anything back in return. Especially the last 8 years.

When I turned 18/19 years old, my grandparents and my dad passed away. All the expectations were put on me to go get a job, take care of my grandparents, then their place once they passed away until we could sell it. And basically handle all the stresses and responsibilities while my mom coddled my younger brother (23 now) and they sat around watching TV all day cause they ""couldn't handle it"".

Even up until recently whenever they needed money for something, or a bill, or whatever I'd be the one to go get a job, a second job, sell some of my shit while they did nothing except say ""oh..thanks"".

Anyways, fast forward to today. I'm still living at home, taking care of my mom and brother. My mom FINALLY got a part time job (only because she pissed away all her inheritance money) and has been working for awhile. About a month ago, my brother gets a job. Yay, good for him. He tells me he's planning to move out with his girlfriend in about 6-12 months cause he wants to get out on his own. I have no problem with that, so long as we all have plan. The bills being split 3 ways is fine, but if one of us leaves, it's gonna mess everything up for the other two people, unless we have something set up.

A week later he moves out. Then he denies ever saying any of that. Gets pissed at me because even though I'm happy for him, it sucks cause he's kind of fucking things up for us. He calls me an asshole, tells me to fuck off, and cuts me out of his life since ""I don't do shit"" even though I've been taking care of both their asses the last 8 years while he sits in his room all day eating taquitos and playing maplestory.

He also takes his mom's car, because for some dumb reason she put the car in HIS name, paid it off, and is keeping him on her insurance, even though she doesn't have a car and has to walk to work now. She doesn't even get mad, or try to talk to him, she let's him do whatever cause apparently he's the good kid or whatever.

So now we're in a bit of a crisis because we've got to figure out to cover his 1/3rd of everything. At this point I should also mention our bills are way higher than they should be because during one of the times I was living on my own, my mom apparently ""forgot"" to pay some of her bills for like 8 months. Which I should also mention, during the times I lived on my own I was always paid for my costs, plus gave her money to help with her own bills, and then she would still try to mooch extra money out of me by bullshitting me about some bill or whatever and then giving that money to my brother or buying cigarettes.

Anyways, back to the present. I'm now scrambling for a second job. I stay up about 3 days straight, with barely 2-3 hours of sleep per night, applying for jobs online/in person, going to interviews, etc etc. What's my mom doing? Watching TV and smoking e-cigs. I get on her ass to do something and she gives me the same answer she's given me the last 8 years: she'll sell something, or borrow money from a neighbor. Which NEVER happens. At this point I should also mention she's kind of a hoarder and has all my grandparents and my dads shit in the garage and backyard. Apparently she can't sell the stuff yet (which she's been saying since 2005) because she needs a digital camera. Even though both my girlfriend and I have explained to her HUNDREDS of times that we have cameras on our phones, there's ebay apps. It takes two fucking seconds, but regardless, most of that stuff is shit anyways save for a few personal items and some jewelry. And she should just get off her ass and get another damn job.

So I'm driving to work last night and I'm fuming. But I'm looking at everything objectively. Realistically, we're behind on rent, which again, my mom doesn't care about. ""Oh, our landlord's nice she doesn't mind."" ""Oh there was problems with this place before we moved in, so it's okay if we're little short.""

Our rent is due on the 1st. We got an extension to the 5th. Then the 8th. Then the 15th. My mom's planning to pay this month on the 24th! Every month I've always had my share, plus more, covered. It's always on her, or my brother's end that the money isn't there.

So I'm looking at this and I'm like: ""there's no fucking way I can do this. Even if I get this month, what about next month? And the month after that?"" I mean, yeah, I already work 7 days a week, I COULD get a 3rd, 4th, 5th job, but then I wouldn't have time to go EMT school. I'd be making just enough to cover EVERYTHING but I wouldn't have any extra money to get myself out and into something better.

And it's at this point I say ""fuck it"". I'm not paying a single penny more. I've got several offers from friends to move in with them for 1/3rd of what I'm paying now, no cost for utilities or anything else. I'm good to go. I'm taking my money and gtfo.

But I'm not a complete asshole, not just yet anyways. This is still going to benefit my mom as well because if she's not paying anything either she can save up her money. She's probably got 30-90 days to gtfo, and even then she could milk that by squatting or whatever. That's thousands of dollars to get another place, get a cheap car, whatever, get her shit together. She's never really had to figure things out on her own because me, or someone else would always ""fix"" everything.

Here's where my revenge comes in: I'm not on the lease. Years ago, when I was living on my own, my mom wanted me to co-sign on a lease with her. And she swore up and down that it wouldn't affect anything, and that she'd handle everything, but I didn't buy it. My brother, however, did.

So I'm not liable for anything. I'm leaving, and they can have fun dealing with clearing out all of mom's shit. Oh and they're also required to have a professional cleaner come in and clean before they leave as well. Which could be a bit costly considering my mom has a few cats that she lets do whatever they want and doesn't care. They piss on something or tear on the carpet and ""oh well, the fence was kind of messed up when we got here. I don't think the landlord will care. There are 'wear and tear' laws too so I don't think she expects it to be immaculate or anything.""

And I'd offer to help buy getting a u-haul truck to get all their shit out, or help pay for a professional cleaning, but I'm not on the lease. Oh and my brother just told me to ""fuck off"" and cut me out of his life a week ago while my mom just sits around not doing anything to fix the situation like she always does.

So now they can both ""fuck off"" and ""deal with it"".

TL;DR: Lazy mom and coddled younger brother treat me like shit and only need me when they need money. Brother moves out, tells to me FO, and mom puts all the shit on me. I have enough and leave and their left to deal with everything since their name is on the lease and not me.

I worked for a small company that manufactured and sold things found in small retail stores. I was the Customer Service Manager and had a few Sales Reps that worked for me. Basically we would call stores who carried our products and check to see if they needed to order anything. Also we would call stores who didn't carry our products, tell them about our products, send them samples, and then get them to order from us. I had a small staff of 4 sales representatives. This was not an easy job but it paid well.

Now I was good friends with the owner of the company. He was never there and I ran things for him. I was introduced to him by a former colleague named John. John used to run a small investment group at the same office. He would take investment sales calls and then get a group of people with money to invest. So John was no longer there but he would get sales calls on our main phone line. People trying to sell investment opportunities in Oil &amp; Gas or some Technology start up. All sorts of crazy stuff and the salesmen were top notch professional sales guys. In other words aggressive, so I would have the calls transferred to me. Then I would explain that John wasn't here anymore and they would stop calling us.

Jessica was one of our better reps. She was an aggressive but well mannered woman. In fact she was a bit of a firecracker but in a good way.

So one day Jessica gets a call from a deep voiced man asking ""Is John in?"" She says he isn't there and is about to ask him to hold for one second so she can transfer the call to me. But the guy hangs up on her mid sentence. She bitches to me in a no big deal kind of way but basically says can you believe the nerve of some people. We move on with our day.

The next day she answers the main line and a deep voiced man asks ""Is John in?"" She says No and he hangs up on her before she can utter another word. She tells me in a slightly disturbed manner. I tell her if he calls again to tell him that John doesn't work here anymore. 

The next day she gets another call from the deep voiced man. He asks ""Is John in?"" and she says ""No, he doesn't work here anymore!"" But he hung up as soon as he heard the word No. I don't know if you have any experience with Sales but you need to have a good attitude. I need Jessica to be in good spirits. Hanging up on someone is one of the rudest things you can do on the Planet. Jessica is fuming. This is really getting to her. 

So I think some Revenge is necessary. I tell Jessica that when this guy calls tomorrow and asks if John is in to tell him ""Yes, please hold on for one second while I transfer you.""

Sure enough the guy calls the next day and Jessica transfers him to me. I put him on speaker phone and tell Jessica to come sit in my office in order to listen to the call. I close the door.

I know how to talk the talk when it comes to investments. I ask him his first and last name. His first name was David. Then the company he works for and then I say our phone lines are having problems. I asked him ""What is your direct phone number in case we get cut off?"" So I listen to his sales pitch about investing in real estate development. I ask him some good questions. Signs that I am going to invest like ""What kind of ROI can I expect?"" and ""Is there a limit on how much one person can invest?"" At this point the guy thinks I am the whale that is going to put his kids through college. 

I then begin to share my story. What we do here. That we are in the business of selling also. That I have Sales Representatives that work for me. 

Then I switch my tone completely. I was raised by a former Marine and I know how to chew someone out. So I go all [R. Lee Ermey](http://youtu.be/aUc62jD-G0o) on his ass. 

I shout ""ARE YOU THICK IN THE HEAD?""

David says in a stunned and offended voice ""Excuse me?""

I continue ""ARE YOU SLOW OR SOMETHING?""

David ""No!""

Me ""THEN WHY HAVE YOU BEEN CALLING HERE EVERYDAY AND HANGING UP ON MY EMPLOYEES WHILE THEY ARE MID SENTENCE?"" Jessica looks at me like I just gave her every Xmas present she ever wanted.

David ""I haven't been doing that, I think there is some kind of misunderstanding.""

""LISTEN DAVID, YOU HAVE BEEN SET UP! WE DON'T GET MANY INCOMING PHONE CALLS. EVERYDAY FOR THE LAST 4 DAYS YOU HAVE BEEN CALLING US AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME. YOU HAVE A VERY DISTINCT VOICE. WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TO CALL TODAY. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT YOU HAVE BEEN CALLING MY OFFICE AND HANGING UP ON THE PERSON AS SOON AS THEY SAY THE WORD NO. YOUR CALLS HAVE BEEN UPSETTING MY PEACEFUL OFFICE AND WE DECIDED TO TAKE YOUR SALES CALL TODAY!""

David ""Uhh, (long pause) I didn't mean anything by it""

""WHO IS RUNNING THE BUSINESS OVER THERE?""

David says in a meek voice ""I am.""

""AM I SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE YOU ARE THE OWNER OF THE COMPANY?""

David ""no""

""WHO DO YOU REPORT TO?""

David finally gives me his boss's name and phone number. He also tells when he comes into the office next and I tell David he should probably confess to his boss before I call him. David agrees and apologizes.

I end the call and Jessica says ""That was the best thing to ever happen"" Needless to say we didn't get any more calls from David. I never called his boss either. I thought our conversation was punishment enough and I am willing to bet David never hung up on anyone again.",,False,,t5_2vjvl,False,,,True,t3_1g4epk,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1g4epk/sales_guy_keeps_calling_and_hanging_up_on_us/,

There are two payoffs - my revenge, and karma also steps in with one of its own. Mine is not a direct tit-for-tat revenge, but one final big payback to a major asshole who has it coming.  I posted in /r/pettyrevenge and it was suggested I move it here.

Many years ago I lived with a real douchebag roomate, a 30-year old Scumbag Steve personified - doesn't pay bills(but racks them up), doesn't clean(but makes messes), you get the idea. Sorry, but some character development is required. He's also really bad with his money - his paycheque goes straight to the VLTs, then he's broke for 13 days til the next payday. He spends those 13 days on the computer(that he made zero payments on) in his bedroom, trying to meet women online.

Of course online, he can be anyone he wants to be, not a pathetic loser, so ONLINE he does pretty well. And in creating his phony life online, he uses achievements of people he knows in real life(this matters later). Oh, and I need to mention he's a deadbeat dad. Has 10 year old twin boys, and brags about how he's never paid a cent in child support. Can't have utilities in his name, won't file a tax return, all to hide from child support. Owes tens of thousands, if not more. I tried turning him in for it, but faced a wall of bureaucracy and apathy I couldn't penetrate. So let's call him DD for Deadbeat Dad.

ANYWAY, he meets a young woman from Colombia online, and over a few months they fall for each other. Of course she's falling for a total liar and fraud. And she seems to be a genuinely nice girl. She thinks she's meeting a nice guy who wants to start a family some day(kids are very important to her). DD repeatedly makes clear she's never to know about his kids or child support issues. She really doesn't deserve this guy to happen to her.

They decide it's time for him to go to Colombia so they can finally meet. She just wants to meet - of course as far as DD the mooch is concerned, he's going to stay for life and mooch off her(apparently her family doing well; not wealthy but mooch-worthy). So he ""saves up"" (doesn't pay any bills) enough to go, and by enough to go, I mean JUST enough for the plane ticket - and literally not another dime in the world. He's all in on this trip.

Now this was around 2000...no smartphones, no tablets, no airport wifi...the second he leaves the house, he's disconnected til he gets to Colombia. So the instant his ride pulled out of the driveway, I signed into DD's email, and sent her a simple one sentence email - ""Ask me about my kids when I get there."" Apparently it went over about exactly as well as I'd hoped. They were over before they left the airport. Now of course, DD has no money and his return flight isn't for a month. And her family doesn't want him at their house anymore, obviously.

But there's a saving grace for him - he'd told her during their courtship that he'd studied to teach ESL and is fully qualified to do so(in reality it was his boss at his former job who'd done it - DD is barely literate and couldn't teach stink to shit)...well her dad is apparently a higher-up in Colombia's Department of Education(their equivalent) and a very nice guy, and had found DD a job he could have once he arrived, as a surprise. Now he only offers the job to save face himself at work, and to get DD to earn money to go home, get his own place, basically get out of their lives. All he has to do is provide proof of his credentials. Of which he has none whatsoever.

It was April 1st, 2012 and I was in cramming mode for exams. I had popped an adderall and was extremely concentrated on my work when all of a sudden my phone buzzed. Unknown number:

""Heyy I saw ur ad on CL and I wanna buy ur phone please""

*Wrong number*

I get back to work and within 2 minutes my phone rings. A different number. 

""Hi I'd like to buy your phone please."" 

""Sorry, you've got the wrong number.""

As soon as I hang up, I realize... *oh fuck, this is a prank.* 

I get on Craig's List and immediately find out that my roommate is ""selling my brand new iPhone 4 for US$100. Call me ASAP at 555-5555-5555""

*That motherfucker.* In the next two hours I got a total of probably 100 calls and texts. I was gonna get him back good. With the adderall still coursing through me, I racked my brain for the best possible prank I could pull.

Then I remembered I had introduced him to the deep web two days ago. We were surfing it, we had checked out the armory, the silk road, even the assassin's advertisement pages. And at one point, on his computer, we stumbled onto child porn.

I knew how I was going to prank him. When he got home, there was an official FBI envelope waiting for him. Inside, [**this letter**](http://i.imgur.com/0xNUZRj.png?1).

I lifted correct names, signatures, court addresses, court dates and official language (other than misspelling appertaining), but that didn't really matter. As soon as he opened it up, he almost started crying. I had to tell him it was a prank within seconds because he just broke down.

I lost my job a couple years ago and had to move out of state. The owner of the apartments I moved to hired me to be the maintenance guy, I was the first repair man she had that wasn't hooked on meth. I agreed to lower than minimum wage, but it was under the table so I was sorta ok with it at the time. I worked my ass off, she would give me one to two days to turn apartments over. I laid carpet, linoleum, paint you name it I did it. I cleaned the grossest places in the world.
Fast forward 2 years...I was needing some money to renew my Id so I asked for a check (most of the time I just applied my wages to the rent) she shut me down and said she didn't have the money, I wasn't able to get my ID so I wasn't able to take another job. I was stuck being her slave, that summer I had a apartment that needed to have all new everything, even toilet. The place was a mess. She had another renter help out but his gf went into labor that night so he wasn't able to help....problem was she never adjusted for his absence and called for a inspection for 3 days after I started...I half killed myself to finish in time, the night of the second day I hurt my back trying to lay carpet by myself...my back hurt really bad, so bad it was hard to walk. She was informed that I was injured but didn't seem to believe me, she was only worried about the inspection. I beasted out as much as I could and finished in time to pass.

My back was hurt so bad I was laid out for a solid month, crazy pain. I've never felt that type of pain before... Two weeks in she bought a bunch of bark dust and plants for the yard. I was doing the best I could but it was hard to even walk but I was getting it done. She noticed I wasn't working as fast as she wanted and decided to give me a lesson on how to use a shovel ( like I don't know) It really started to make my blood boil but I tried to keep my mouth shut, but she wasn't done...she went on to give me a speech about how she needed the ""biggest bang"" for her buck. Wrong thing for her to say considering I'm the first guy to not rob her blind and I wasn't even getting min wage and could even get a check when I needed it most...I lost it, threw the tools down and walked of.

Fast forward a week, I decided it was time to move. I found a better job and was getting ready to move... I still couldn't forget the ""biggest bang"" speech, just couldn't let it go....sooooo I took weed killer to all the bushes she just bought and drilled small holes in all 14 metal roofs!

He was driving across the city to a friend's place.  He was in a lane that was ending soon, so flips on his turn signal, checks over the shoulder and in the mirror, sees a fellow a good distance back with plenty of room to spare and moves over.  Well, the other fellow didn't much care for that, as he'd been speeding (probably 30km/h over) like a typical BMW ""my car is teh fastest"" owner and, as a result, had to slow down to match my brother's 10 over.  Now, it wasn't close or anything, guy had plenty of time and room, but he got right up on my brother's tail and was flashing his lights and honking his horn.

So there's a red light up ahead, couple cars stopped in front of my brother but the other lane is open.  Asshole jumps into the other lane, but instead of pulling up to the stop line, he stops next to my brother and does the ""roll down your window"" cranking motion.  My brother does, guy starts yelling and cussing about how my brother nearly caused a massive pileup.  He just starts laughing at the asshole and says, ""You had plenty of room, sorry you had to slow down to only ten over.""  Super polite and all.  Guy gets pissed, rolls forward, and peels out when the light turns green.

A bit further down, the road turns a bit, then climbs a hill.  Now the cars in front of my brother had exited off, so it's just him and the asshole, who's a good bit ahead.  My brother drives this road regularly and knows the police like to hide just over the hill, and our city was in the middle of what they call a ""big ticket event,"" where cops all put in extra-special effort to set up speed traps and catch speeders.  

So the asshole slows significantly for the turn and my brother, having a good idea of his and his vehicle's limits, as well as familiarity with the road, doesn't slow at all and blows past the asshole partway through, making sure to smile and wave as he goes by.  Asshole is bound and determined to show him up and prove how fast his car is, so he lays into the throttle and, by my brother's estimation, is doing more than double the 50 km/h speed limit when he crests the hill.  Sure enough, there are about six cop cars parked, along with a couple flatdecks, and my brother sees the cop standing with the radar gun walk out, point at the asshole, and point to the roadside.  Last thing he sees in the rearview is guy on the side of the road.

Just some idle speculation, but around here, I'm told that the penalty for going double the limit is automatic license suspension, court date, and vehicle is impounded.  I'd bet dollars to doughnuts his oh-so-badass base 318i was languishing in the impound lot for at least a day or two and he's probably taking the bus to work.",,False,,t5_2vjvl,False,,,True,t3_1f40ir,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1f40ir/roadraging_asshole_gets_served/,

Was told by a friend to tell this story here, so here it goes.

This happened six years ago: 

There had been a new biker gang forming in my home town, there were already two other ones at that time but this new gang was being real jerks to normal people and they were annoying as shit. 

This gang had started harassing people at local bars and restaurants, just showing of and trying to make a name of them self.

A few weeks later and they had now started riding their loud bikes through the neighborhoods, cunts as they are. About three to four times a week between 12am and about 1am.

The police was contacted several times but nothing is changed.

We in the neighborhood decided to take the matter in our own hands. We started talking to each other what we can do that wont hurt them, just something so they will stay away.

We started talking about putting out obstacles and parking our cars on the street blocking as much as possible but still make a hard to ride through making a zick-zacking like pattern. Just so he would slow down, bothered so he wouldn't come here any more.

Then we decided that a good old egging would sent a message. We talked to all the neighbors, told them our plans. If they had have enough, they should buy plenty of eggs and join us.

The street i was living on was formed like a ""U"", with three apartment houses and about 40 apartments with the window (and some balconies) to the street.

We said that we would sit up and just wait for him to come, have our windows open because you could hear him from a great distance.

The first night he didn't come, we tried the next one.

About 0:30 am, I hear him coming.

The pulse is rising, this is it. He is finally entering our street.

He sees the roadblock and slowly cruises forward, making as much noise as possible for the trouble we gave him. 

He takes the first obstacle and now the first apartments are starting to launch their eggs hitting him really good on the helmet and his bike.

We blocked the road so much that if he wanted to turn around, he would have to fully stop several times. So he just went forward faster thinking it would be over.

Not in this neighborhood, he rode though a rain of at least 200 eggs. All soaked in eggs from head  to bottom, as well as his bike, he was never to been seen in this area no more.

Victory!

Yes, we got eggs on our cars to but it was worth not having to deal with them waking us up at night.

1367857134.0,366,self.ProRevenge,1dss8x,crosspost from r/pettyrevenge - How I got revenge on violent drug dealers which eventually lead to there arrest.,456,90,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1dss8x/crosspost_from_rpettyrevenge_how_i_got_revenge_on/,"TL;DR: Got violent drug dealers arrested after shooting my TV via gas bombs.

Somebody at /r/pettyrevenge told me to post this here, so here you go.

After my second year in college, a friend and I moved in with another friend. He was renting a 3 bedroom house in a lower income area, so it was pretty cheap. It was fairly close to the university campus, and as all three of us were attending, we were able to work it out where it would be a whole lot cheaper living there than on campus.
The neighborhood itself wasn't bad at all. It was mostly other kids, elderly folks, and a few others here and there. Everyone in the neighborhood was pretty relax and chill except for our fucking neighbors. We'll call them Walter and Jesse.

Now Walter and Jesse were brothers, and entrepreneurs of sorts. They ran a small, in-home business selling product in niche market that required very little advertisement. They were meth cooks and dealers. Obnoxious, loud, violent, drug dealers. Everyone hated them, but nobody would say anything about it due to the constant threats they would make while, strung out, from there front yard.

We pretty much fell in line (at first). They would blast music and porn from there house from 7am until 7am. We'd hear screaming matches at there house that became full blown fights on their lawn. Huge fucking parties that would go on for days. And to our chagrin, we ignored it all.
Well up arrives march, and my income tax comes in, I only get about $500, but goddammit, that's my $500 dollars and I'm gonna fucking buy something for me. Everything has gone to college and bills and I want to splurge. I go out and buy a 42"" LCD TV. It's a VIZIO, but it's the first HDTV I've ever had. My friends and I set it up, and oh boy did we have fun that week. And only that week, for that's as long as I had it.

The Meth bros decide they're gonna shoot their BB gun at whatever the fuck they can see. At birds, bushes, fences, and especially windows. Well one little BB decided to go straight through my window and hit my TV, cracking it while I was playing some MW2. My face dropped and I heard laughing. Which then immediately turned to death threats if I called the cops. Now I know they had real guns. They had no issue showing them to anyone who looked at them.

My friends and I were all disappointed at the turn of events. And both of them had submitted to not doing anything about it. But nay, not I. The one time I purchased me a bit of joy in my life (I grew up fairly poor), it was taken away from me. So I plotted. And I plotted. And I plotted some more. And an evil plot I did accomplish.

I saved up every gatorade bottle I purchased for about 3 weeks. And every other day I would go to a different store and purchase pool cleaning tablets and rubbing alcohol at a different one, all with cash of course. Now some of you might see what's going. And you'd be right. I had about 15 bottles saved up. And I made some spectacular chlorine gas bombs.

I waited for a night when both of them were gone. It was about three in the morning so virtually everyone was asleep. I had prepared the gatorade bottles with the alcohol prior, so I started loading the tablets into the bottles and throwing them over the fence. Since I didn't break down the tablets, it took a while for them to go off. I was able to get them all over the fence before the first one went boom. And boom they went.

I go back inside and into my room. I hear them going off. BOOM. BOOM. One of my roommates wakes up and goes ""WHAT THE FUCK!?""
BOOM. He wakes my other roommate (his room was closer) and there both freaking out. BOOM. 

Time to put my game face on. I scramble on out of there and react visibly scared. BOOM. I look at them and tell them to call the cops. BOOM. BOOM. He calls 911 and tells the cops he hears explosions. I go outside and pretend to look like I'm trying to find out what's going on. BOOM. I tell my friend that it's coming from next door. BOOM. He tells me that the cops have already been sent to the area by a previous caller. BOOM. BOOM. I tell him there's a bunch of smoke coming from outside. BOOM. They tell us to stay inside. BOOM. The last one goes off. We close the doors and watch the mayhem unfold.

Right before the cops come, the Heisenbros show up freaking out. Right as they go inside about 3 cop cars show up and go through the front door. The officers haul them away and we go outside. They question us we tell them what we know. As far as the chlorine gas is concerned. It has already wafted into the atmosphere.

They came back a couple days later and asked us questions specifically about the brothers. We told them what we heard about them and how they acted what they did. The officer left and that was the last time I talked about it. Nobody knows about what I did but me. And it was the happiest we've been in a long time.

The last I heard about them, they were doing hard time for their drug ring, being in possession of illegal firearms, and human trafficking suprisingly.

If it doesn't fit, my apologies, and you can remove it post-haste!)

I just remembered this one while drawing in my sketchbook today. Apologies for the length.

When I was in middle-school, I believe 7th Grade because that was a shit year all around, I was constantly bullied by a kid named D. 

D was just an all around dick. He thought he was hot shit because he was athletic and girls thought he was good looking. He had the snarkiest voice-like Dash from the Incredibles except not cool. And he had the most *punchable* face-even though this was years ago, thinking of it makes my blood boil. 

D had it out for me. Maybe because I was smarter than him, maybe because I was *infinitely* more handsome than him, or maybe it was because I was a nerdy kid that looked like the type who should get bullied. I don't know. But he was always on my case. He would knock my stuff out of my hands in the halls, whisper about me behind my back, and constantly make attempts to fight me in order to get me in trouble.

Two events forced my hand. The first was when he pushed me into my locker while I was bent over picking up my stuff. My glasses snapped. I am someone who's prone to avoiding violence as much as he can, but when put into a sudden, shocking situation, I can get upset quickly. That was the case here. I turned around and went in swinging with every bit of emotional force I could muster. I only got him once in the gut before my math teacher pulled us apart. I think she knew what was up, because she left me off with a warning. D denied doing anything, and was believed. And I still had to replace my glasses, spending money that my family couldn't afford to spend. I was aware of this, and devastated.  

Then came the final straw. D made fun of my weight in front of everyone in my art class: including the girl I had a crush on.

That was it. It was like a gunshot went through me. Like a needle snapping from being pushed down too hard for too long. I felt like an entirely different person. I slowly closed my sketchbook, looked straight into D's eyes with a blank, almost serial killer stare, and simply said: 

""You're going to get it.""

D gave me a weird stare, but thought nothing else of it. 

Months passed. D slightly kept his distance from me, only bothering me now and then, probably out of fear I would do something terrible to him. This was my plan. I waited it out, and here's why:

In said art class, we have a sketchbook. This sketchbook is comprised of all the work that goes into producing our final projects. When we're done with our sketchbooks, we are meant to put them into cubbies in a cabinet. The sketchbooks are turned in at the end of the trimester for a final grade.

I realized, waiting outside my drama class, which was one room down from the art class, that the janitor came to clean out the art class' trashcan about five minutes after we we left the classroom. 

Perfect.

I had to time it just right. It's two days before our sketchbook is due. We all put our sketchbooks into our cubbies and leave the classroom. My art teacher starts to walk down the hall, after locking the art room. I chase her down before she turns the corner.

""Mrs. Art!"" I say. ""I forgot to put *one last thing* into my sketchbook. Do you mind if I can get your keys and fix it really quick? I'll turn it in to you right after I'm done, it'll only take a few minutes.""

After contemplating this, Mrs. A decided to give me the key. She had no reason to believe anything sinister. I had been on my best behavior all trimester, *just* for this moment.

I had only minutes. I rushed into the art room. Then, I ripped open D's cubbie, pulled out his sketchbook, and stuffed into the trashcan. I threw in just enough scratch paper over the book to make it not look suspicious. Then, I dipped out. 

As I left the hallway, I checked back to see that the janitor had arrived. Right on time. I grinned, going to Mrs. A's office.

""Thanks, Rockblocked!"" she says.

""No, thank you. And can I say, this was probably the *best* art class I've ever had!"" I replied, beaming.

To keep a long story from going any longer, D failed the class and had to go to summer school. I knew this by watching the chaos from affair, eavesdropping on his conversations. He was moved out of my middle-school the next year.

From here on, let's call her Bam.

When I was pretty young, I did a lot of acting and a little bit of modelling. I wasn't a star, but my face was recognized often in the streets. I was the starchild of the theater my mother put me in at a very early age, loved by everyone because I was, as well as being adorable, a really good kid. (As we all know, beauty and virtue sort of dies during/after puberty).
Being an almost-star had it's ups, sure. But it also had its downs. E.g.

- Everybody always expecting far too much from you
- Hot lights and heavy makeup shouldn't mix
- The pressure of having to do well as a star performer
- Ridiculous rehearsal schedules, especially for someone as young as I was (e.g. 5:00am - 5:00pm with a half-hour break in between.)
- Mini-Bam


Mini Bam was the vilest, most atrocious child I've ever had the misfortune of meeting. Even as a little kid, I understood she was a filthy little manipulative brat. Very beautiful - a lasting beauty that carries on in adolescence - and sickly sweet around anybody she could use to climb whatever corporate ladder her mother, Bam, had introduced her to.

Mini-Bam and her mother was incredibly jealous of me for somewhat differing reasons. Bam hated me and despised my mother because I was a star and Mini-Bam wasn't. Mini-Bam hated me because her mother taught her to hate me in the most disgusting manner possible. Brace yourself, extreme hatred for this insane bitch is coming.

Bam would tell Mini-Bam to her itty bitty angelic widdle face that I was more talented, far more beautiful, better in every way compared to ""a good-for-nothing lump"" like Mini-Bam. A MOTHER said that to her CHILD. I caught her saying such things several times, and when nobody but I and a handful of other little kids were in earshot, she wouldn't bother hiding the abuse.

Of course the poor little girl couldn't help being such a complete and utter cuntbag piece of shit. Her mother had brought her up to be such. She must've been so conflicted, seeing her mother display obvious disliking towards me yet comparing her to me nonetheless.

Bam personally attached my mother and I in various ways, such as bringing up her low income in public, exaggerating little stories about me where I may have misbehaved a little or something, intentionally interrupting me during rehearsals to throw in her two 2 cents even though our coaches and choreographers and elder performers would constantly bitch at her to shut up.

I think the worst thing she ever did was when she sabotaged the show as well as endangering my life. After an especially grueling dress rehearsal for one of our biggest shows, we had a pretty sweet banquet-esque potluck snack table to reward us for our hard work. This snack table included a prawn ring.

I. FUCKING. LOVE. PRAWN.

Bam somehow knew and made sure the prawn wasn't anywhere to be seen when I wasn't around. She'd run by me with the tray, saying she had got new dip for it or something every few minutes, luring me into her trap. Something definitely smelled fishy (ha, get it?) but I chose to ignore it (BIG mistake) and gorged myself. Turns out, the shrimp had gone bad a while ago and bitch had been feeding me this poison for about ten minutes before I noticed any pain or discomfort. I couldn't do the show the next day. Mini-Bam was my understand. Well played, bitch. Well played.

But the straw that broke the camel's back was when Bam bribed Mini-Bam into ripping my costume to shreds.

This was a private costume my mother and her tailor had worked on for weeks. When she was found sitting on the floor, shredding my dress with craft scissors she obviously couldn't have gotten her hands on without an adult (such stuff is kept away for safety's sake), she claimed that she was ""tailoring"" the dress because it didn't fit her, and she was my understudy after all.

A. Everybody has a costume built to fit them. Even understudies.
B. Bitch wasn't my understudy.

I knew for a fact her mother had gotten her to do it. I could see the woman gloating a mile away. When everybody began to reprimand Mini-Bam, mother-of-the-year got all defensive and cursed a bunch, took Mini-Bam's hand and walked away.

Well, parents sit in a room off to the side to keep them out of the way. The room has a small, quaint pink and green kitchen, several uncomfortable worn out fake leather sofas, a few tables and chairs, a bookshelf holding more magazines than books, you know the stuff. Conveniently, it also had a cloakroom and bathroom off to the side, with a window that opened just wide enough for me to crawl out of. A few meters away was a fire-escape that was accessed through a different door, but it wasn't too far away from the window. A short, calculated jump (and now that my legs are longer, a long, calculated step) would take me to the banister which I could hang onto while I swung my body onto the stairs.

I had the perfect excuse. A little into practice, I started coughing a little. Insert acting skills here When asked if I was alright, I shrugged it off and said I'd be fine. A few minutes later, I began coughing again. They looked at each other worriedly. When my staged coughing got a little too bad, they easily excused me to get some cough drops from my mum. I ran to the parents' room where my mum was sitting and told her I had to go to the bathroom because all the stalls in the other one were occupied.

I ran to the cloakroom, grabbed Bam's car keys out of her hideous faux-snakeskin purse, jumped out of the window, ran down the fire-escape, and keys the FUCK out of that woman's gorgeous car. As if it wasn't quite enough, when I went to put the keys back, I had a better idea and flushed it down the toilet.

*Cherry on the fucking cake.*

I have no idea what happened to those keys or the car :3

The latter in this string was especially bad, but dad stuck with the job because the pay was outrageously high.  Arguably, though, his boss's wife was far worse than he.  She would harass the employees there whenever she was there, and she visited her husband's store once a day to bring him lunch.

The worst bit, though, was that she always ate whatever the broke college kids had packed for themselves.  Eventually it was discovered that she had a huge weakness for bon-bons.  Dad brought in a 12 pack of bon-bons as a gag gift for one of his co-workers and found it completely empty at lunch.  This continued for the next couple days when he brought in more packs.

Something had to be done, and dad determined that the best way of retaliating would be to encourage her weakness.  Every day for the next year he worked there, he, or one of his co-workers, brought in a 12 pack of the greasiest, creamiest, fattiest bon-bons they could find and left them in the fridge for her.

Throughout the year, she became bitchier and angrier because she was putting on weight.  Serious weight.  By the end of the first month she had gained 15 pounds.  She and her husband got into huge fights about it.  At the end of the year, she had gained ~100 pounds.

For context, I moved across the world when I was 11. In my country of original citizenship, I started a year early and skipped a grade, so if I had continued along this path, I would be graduating High School at the age of 16.     
I moved to Australia, and because I had almost finished 7th grade but I was young, I was told I needed to be evaluated to check my competency. Fair enough, I guess - my family expected as much. What we didn't expect, however, was the school counselor. He 'evaluated' me, asked some questions, and then spoke to my mother afterwards. He decided that I should be put into 6th grade (which was just starting, due to start date of the school year) even though I was about halfway through 7th grade. I believe his exact words were ""Spaghetti is very eloquent, which makes him appear more intelligent than he actually is."" Pretty crushing thing for a 10 year old to hear. You aren't actually that smart, you just sound smart. So here goes mate, I'm going to prove you as wrong as I possibly can. I'm going to be the best damn 6th grader you've ever seen IN YO LIFE.    
  
Fast forward to senior year of high school, and it's college application time. I've been invited into several extended programs, and as a result, I've finished two semesters of University Mathematics, and one of Physics. This counselor meets with all students individually to discuss college plans (or lack thereof), so he knew I was looking into international programs - specifically, Cambridge, Yale and Harvard. Several weeks after our initial meeting, he approaches me about a program that's being established in the Middle East; American campuses expanding into international waters. The school had been invited to nominate a student, and he had chosen me because of my stellar grades, tenacity, and motivation to explore different options. My mother and I were invited in to discuss this possibility after I realized I was going to apply. I had already written my essays and needed to discuss some logistics as a nominated student (him signing off as the nominator, references from faculty etc.)    
    
I will never forget the expression on his face when my Mum asked him if he remembered the last time they had met. ""I remember you!"" she said. ""We met about 7 years ago. Do you recall what you said about Spaghetti?"" He shakes his head. ""Oh, you told me he was eloquent and appeared smart, but wasn't actually that smart. Isn't it funny that you're nominating him for this now?"" Ringing dead silence, and he goes bright red.  
For the record, I was accepted to the program (a liberal arts college with a sub 2% acceptance rate) and I'm lucky enough to study and live all over the world. Spaghetti: 1. Counselor: 0.

This is a story from when I was in 8th grade. To provide a little background, I was a nerdy kid of less than 100 pounds with no muscle whatsoever. I was frequently bullied because of this, usually just verbal but sometimes more. This kid named A realized that he could take my lunch and I couldn't do anything about it, so that went on for a few days. He had a particular taste for packaged meat products- this is important.

After the second time he stole my lunch (and I went hungry as a result), I was fed up. I went home, took a piece of beef jerky, and soaked it in Dave's Insanity sauce for 36 hours. After sampling the meat (holy shit was it spicy, and I have a high tolerance for heat), I brought it in to school. I told my friends and classmates what was about to go down so that they could watch it happen.

Well, what do you know, A came around and snatched the beef jerky out of my hands at lunch. I hardly complained, just told him it was a special recipe of mine. He took a giant bite and started to talk about how spicy it was, me telling him that was how I like it (and with a big shit-eating grin on my face).

Fast forward to 10 minutes later and A was visibly sweating, face red, swearing loudly about the beef jerky he was still nibbling on so he didn't look like a bitch in front of his friends. He snatched my fruit snacks and applesauce, ate them in front of me, and then I knew I had to end this once and for all, so I tried to think of a plan. Meanwhile, A spent the rest of lunch blocking anyone else from using the water fountain in order to wash the heat from his mouth.

On the way back from lunch, A still swearing at me, I told him I knew a little trick to get the heat out. I told him to just massage the corners of his eyes, right near the tear ducts...

Anyway, few years back, I was working as a hotel receptionist. We were a Hotel of about 75 rooms so roughly 150-190 capacity and we just so happened to have the bulk of 2 weddings guests staying with us. Needless to say, we were busy and seeing as it was just us two on, we manned the bar and reception (they were joint).

One wedding had a lot of these rich, smarmy, silver spoon in mouths type of people. They weren't all dicks in their party, some of them were genuinely nice interesting people who were behaving politely and well behaved. It was for this reason that we kept the bar open for them.

Anyway, as the night starts to wind down, people are going to bed, we shut the bar, people are fine with this...except one. This one smarmy prick who wanted everyone to know his upper class status, his wealth, what car he drove. Ergh.

So, we tell him that we will not be serving any more Alcohol and that the bar is closed. Nope, he didn't like that. Demands that it be left open, and that he has spent loads of money to demand this (the guy spent £75 on a room, and about £30-40 on beer, not earth shattering amounts seeing as people had spent far more than that).

We politely tell him to retire to his room. Nope again. This time he squares up to my friend. At this point, I should note that my friend is a licensed Doorman and ex military, so he can handle himself.

My friend proceeds to tell Mr. High Society that he will need to return to his room or vacate the hotel. Nope. He pushes my friend.

I call the Police as we couldn't kick the guy out of the Hotel and let him wander around as the Hotel was on a Roundabout which was in between 2 busy roads and it would be irresponsible.

The guy knowing he's fucked up just sits there all quiet whilst we wait for the Police. The Police arrive and arrest the guy for being drunk and disorderly.

Here's the juicy part.

They put the guy in the back of Police car and talk to myself and my friend. Whilst we're talking, we here this strange noise over the Policemans shoulder radio. That noise turns into some screaming to be let out. Yup, scared the crap out of all of us.

So we all turn around and Posh boy is holding the in car radio, screaming at the top of his voice. Yup, Police weren't impressed. So they cuff him and station the other officer with him.

They finish with us and they're about to leave, when they find the dirty bastard is laughing his head off at pissing himself on the back seat of the Police car.

SO. MUCH. WIN. Because of this guy not wanting to go to bed, he landing himself with an £80 Drunk and Disorderly Charge, Unsolicited use of Police Coms, Criminal Damage, and the cost to clean.

And to add icing on the cake, when his friends come down the next morning to check out and ask where he is and if we checked him out already, we tell them all what happened. And they laughed their arses off.

Oh, and we found £20 on the floor where he was sitting.

Fin.

tl;dr bar shuts, guy gets abusive to staff, police called, makes more trouble for himself by fucking with their radios, pisses himself, permanent criminal record, public humiliation by his friends

This was told to me by a friend. He is the pilot of the story. This happened on a towboat. A towboat holds about 5-7 people. The captain is the highest and his word is pretty much law on a vessel, then the relief captain, then pilot, then engineer/tankerman, then deckhand.

The captain who we will call Cap was a colossal dick. He constantly tormented the deck crew. He lost over 50 deckhands in one year. Deckhands would literally just leave the boat whenever the boat would dock for fuel or for barge transfers. The captain was giving a stern talking to but considering that captains are like gold, it would take an extreme amount to get them fired. 

Enter Riou. Riou was an innocent faced, 18 year old kid. He was very eager to learn and tried to take the initiative to do as much as he could. He had a great attitude and my friend could easily seem him advancing soon. Cap on the other hand had a permanent stick shoved up his ass and hated Riou. He would constantly make homophobic slurs against Riou. Frequently implying that he wouldn't even let Riou perform certain sexual favors no matter how much Riou begged. 

Riou at first, took it well. He just figured it was new guy hazing, but even the other more experienced deck hands thought this was extreme. Not because of what was being said but because of the malice behind it. Cap also gave Riou extremely ridiculous jobs like telling him to go out with a toothbrush and scrub the barge. It's around a 110 degrees in August and he is having this kid on his hands and knees on a heater barge that has heaters that heat the sludge/oil so it doesn't solify inside the barge. So the barge is easily 300 degrees. 

My friend did what he could to help the guy because he didn't want him to quit. He was telling him that he only had to make it 3 more weeks then he could request a transfer to another boat and he would make sure he got it. Riou had other plans.

So to make sure you guys understand what happened. Watches are 6 hours long. Captain was on front watch, so he worked 6 to 12, both times. The pilot worked back watch which was 12 to 6. The wheelhouse is the usually the highest point of the boat. This boat had 4 decks. Wheel house on the top, then the pilots rooms on the third deck, then the second deck which housed the crew, then the bottom deck which was the galley, engine room, generator room, and rudder room. Stairs separate  each of the decks.

So, Cap just relieved my pilot friend and he was heading downstairs to his room to get some stuff then go eat breakfast. Riou was heading up to the wheelhouse, as the captain usually calls him up there first thing in the morning to give him his shit list. As my friend was coming out of his room he heard Riou screaming along the lines of ""No, get your hands off me, Stop! Oww. Why are you doing this?"" Then the pilot hears a large thud. He ran to the stair case and saw Riou laying at the bottom in a crumpled heap and Cap up at the top screaming stuff at Riou. 

My friend thought the captain finally snapped and tried to kill a deckhand, he did insinuate that he would do it often enough. So the office is contacted. They had to get Riou off the boat and to the hospital. I believe he ended up having a couple broken ribs, a broken wrist, and I believe a concussion.  The local authorities are called and Cap is arrested after they took everyone's story. Riou claimed that Cap pushed him down the stairs. 

Cap lost his job, his license, I think he was put on parole. My friend said he never talked to him again and only heard about what happened through other towboaters. Riou on the other hand healed nicely and even continued towboating. Fast forward 5-6 years and Riou is now an experienced engineer when my friend is riding over to make some extra cash and is put on the same boat as Riou. Before my friend got off the boat, Riou confessed to him that Riou did it to himself because he couldn't take it anymore. My friend had a lot of self conflicting issues with this story as to whether or not to tell the office the truth, but so far, he still hasn't. It's been about 10 years since this has happened.

(slightly-NSFW),461,116,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1dvrq0/how_to_deal_with_a_douche_bag_slightlynsfw/,"(an old story of mine) I used to go to a public high school where the majority of students were low to middle class Italian origin kids of immigrants (90% +). Tough going to say the least. When I was in high school I used to get bullied by a guy called Renaldo. We had a few scraps, either verbally or fisticuffs over the years. I was always the type of guy who wouldn’t take other people’s shit and while others balked at giving me a hard time particularly when I went through puberty and became one of the tallest, largest guys in school he somehow always managed to give me a hard time. It was a tough time but in a way, I paid my dues early and learnt from a stern father that if people punched you, you punch back and you punch harder and you'll know if they are men or not.

As luck would have me, Renaldo ended up in the same college I went to and he always managed to somehow, someway be a little shit to me. What made things worse is that we fell for the same girl, Andrea who eventually became my girlfriend of over 4 years. Everyone knew he had feelings for her and that it killed him she was with me and not him. He always tried to “seduce” her with random calls and emails, being the son of a wealthy father who owned his own construction company, that he had nice cars, lots of money, a bunch of shit that I didn’t have and over the years worked hard to earn coming from a low income family that was having problems making ends meet.

He was a constant issue the first year of my relationship and we had several conflicts,

Years later, after college and shortly after I broke up with Andrea, I received an e-mail from him out of the blue. I never corresponded with him (Facebook didn’t exist back then) and he went out and told me in an epic letter which went far too long, swore at me in excess and used terrible English (no wonder he never finished college and dropped out to work with daddy). Basically it was a ""No one liked me in college and to F off"".

I haven’t seen him in well over 2 years, nor did we have any real friends in common. As a way of keeping my cool, nor did I want him to have the satisfaction to get me mad, I never responded to his emails (he sent several).

However, I couldn't let his taunting go without consequences.

So I went online and Googled his name. After searching around a bit I easily found a complete profile of him regarding his career, where he worked and what type of work it was. His father passed away recently and he now owned his father's business and had a team of employees working for him. I spied a bit more and hung onto the address of his place of employment for several weeks while I plotted.

One day, I proceeded to go into a local sex shop and I purchased the largest, fattest, floppiest black dildo that I could find along with some KY and I went home, wrote a special note for him and put it along with the big fat black dildo and KY and boxed it in a standard box that couldn’t be traced back to me and sent it priority mail that required for him specifically to sign.

The note read, ""Since you have so much time to search out people that never gave a shit about you to begin with, I figured you'd have enough time to go fuck yourself with this!""

One of our mutual acquaintances dropped me an email a few days later. This acquaintance worked for Renaldo during his ""internship"" and apparently the package arrived while they were preparing to head out for a team lunch on a Friday and he was very excited to get the box opened since Renaldo thought it was something he ordered online that he was expecting and would ""make it a good weekend"" and he opened it in front of a number of co-workers and instead of whatever he ordered he pulls out....a giant black floppy dildo.

I had little-to-no involvement in this whatsoever. Obviouisly, names have been changed.

The story begins with my best friend Otto winning 4 tickets on a Cruise Ship to Cozumel, Mexico. He first offered to me, but I was single at the time and to quote myself, ""didn't want to waste a cruise ship not-fucking."" So he reaches out to his sister, Jane. Jane is ecstatic and asks if her boyfriend, Steve, can be invited in tow and Otto gives the thumbs-up.

So it's Otto and his fiancee, Claire, his sister Jane and her boyfriend Steve. Again, this story was told to me and I'm repeating back to the best of my knowledge/ability.

The cruise is about 8 days and for the first 3 everything is going swimmingly- there's plenty of drinks, plenty of dancing, karaoke, gourmet-ish food and entertainment, and there's plenty of time left before even reaching Cozumel. Everything's going well until the 3rd night when Jane knocks on Otto's door, crying and shaking.

""She didn't look that bad since she wrecked her car that one time"" Otto told me the morning after.

Jane was reticent and very reluctant to give any details, but she had asked to sleep with Otto and Claire that night. She cited the reason being that she and Steve had been fighting and didn't want to be in the same room as him. Red flags were waved, but Otto was pretty cool with Steve at that point, so he waited to gather more details.

The next day, Claire and Jane talked at length and Jane finally admitting that apparently ""fighting"" translated into ""rape"". Steve had forced her down while they were both tipsy and Jane wanted to sleep it off.

Otto was pissed, but he was also fucking unbreakable. They were going into a foreign country and there were opportunities. However, it was established that Jane would be sleeping with Claire and Otto would be rooming with Steve. Otto wasn't happy, but my buddy's fucking unbreakable- he looked the fucker in the eye and smiled knowing full well that Steve would get his. Steve, on the other hand, was told that Jane just needed to ""cool off"" and that nothing was wrong- he's not naive, but he bought it.

Day 4 and they arrive in Cozumel. As soon as they step off, Otto and Claire tell Steve to give them all of his belongings. Steve gets suspicious but is diffused when Claire explains that ""This place is loaded with pickpockets who know how to steal from tourists. We'll hang back.""

Steve went off with Jane, having conspired with Otto and Claire- he had only $200, which was quickly borrowed by Jane, who asked sweetly if Steve could lend it to her while she looked for a nice pair of shades.

Steve never saw the money again, nor has he seen Jane as far as I know.

His cell phone? It thrown into the Gulf. His wallet's cards were cut up and tossed in the trash while his cash was used to buy lunch and some souvenirs. His ID card, which would get him back into the ship? Lost with his passport. In the Gulf.

I don't quite know the details about how a missing passenger is dealt with. Otto didn't give me any details on the matter, but he did make it a point to tell me that Steve didn't speak Spanish and ""He'll be there long enough for someone to go all ""Cartel"" on his ass hopefully"". While I suspect Otto bribed the staff to count Steve as present, I'd rather not implicate my best friend for something I don't know, nor do I want to.

The rest of the trip was decent, but nothing like a cruise- Jane was in bad shape the rest of the way and most of the time was spent with her, helping her calm down and talking her through her issues. There were drinks, some gambling in the casino and some really fun moments, but Steve had left his mark and the return home was a welcomed sight.

BONUS:

Steve still hasn't been heard from, while Jane's been seeing a grief counselor and making strides to move on from the trauma Steve caused her. I got to be the best man at Otto's wedding and Claire is expecting her first child with Otto in 6-7 months.

I needed a roommate, so I Craigslist-ed an ad and conducted a small set of interviews to fill the extra room. A guy named Travis moved into the room eventually. He was younger than me by about 4 years, but he had a consistent job and seemed reasonable so I took him. 

Moving in three weeks later, I find out he lied about everything in the interview. He had no job. His dad paid his rent. He had a click of collar-popped douche bags that would hang out at the house all day. I had invited in a self proclaimed ""playa"" into the house. Face to face, he would be nice to me in his sly way. When I left the house, he would subtly search through my room and steal petty shit - a used fax machine, quarters out of my change jar, outdated mp3 player, old watches he found to be ""baller"", etc. I confronted him a few times, and he would always deny it. When I caught him openly eating my food and denying it, I attempted to kick him out. He stayed by citing his tenant's rights. Because most of it was petty, I decided to look the other way while his ego grew bigger.

Things died down for a few weeks. One day I come back home from work and Travis had stolen the only shirt I knew he would steal from my closet. It was a two year old Lacoste shirt. When he had the nerve to wear it in front of me, I decided this was the final straw. Giving him his last way out, I decided to ask him: ""Hey, I have that same exact shirt in my closet."" I figured if he had any soul left, he would simply say ""I borrowed it from your closet"". He decided to lie about it telling me he had gotten it from the mall a few days ago. The audacity! 

The sociopath switch in my head decided to flip on. I knew Travis thought I was too pussy to ask for the shirt back. He thought I was a doormat, and I was going to play directly into that. I understood the mindset of a young 20 something ""alpha male"". Travis' birthday was coming up in about a month and a half (he made it known because he told me his mom was going to get him a new Burberry shirt) and I was going to make that the day I strike. I played into his fake friendly-ness and started hanging out with him. I made friends with his douche bag friends. When they started calling me, I knew I had them. I'd buy them occasional drinks when we were out to seed my future plans of generosity.

Birthday comes. Game time. Travis had an obsession with doing cocaine over the last few months. Nothing big since he was broke, so most of his binge's were in small amounts. I pulled him over in the middle of the day and told him I had a birthday surprise for him. To pump up his ego more, I told him I only did this for the best of my ""boys"". We go out for a night of drinks. I buy him enough drinks to get him shit housed and we head back to the house for the after party. I had called a few females over during the night to make the after party request legit. When we get to the house, I walk out of my room with half an eight of cocaine in my hands. 

""Travis! This is the surprise you've been waiting for!""

I dump a mound of white onto a black plate and spelled his name out on it. I was going to take a picture of Travis hitting the fattest line of cocaine in existence- with his name one it.

With his name laid out in cocaine over a black plate, the stage was set. I hand Travis a rolled up twenty, and told him to hit it. The pandemonium behind his back built the pressure cooker need to push him into doing it. As Travis sucked his head down to the plate, I told him to give me a party pose next to his special surprise. Travis produced the single best duck face pose I had ever seen. One hand holding the rolled up twenty, and the other to throw his white boy downward deuce. 

Gotcha.

The next morning, everyone was flaccid. The girls had left about an hour after we reached the house, and the chemical leftovers of the alcohol and cocaine destroyed any productivity planned within the house. I call up my friend Nick to induce the second part of the plan. Nick was labeled as my Russian body guard. He was 6'5, and weighed in at about 280 pounds of pure muscle. When Nick arrives, me and him go into Travis' room and drag him by his legs into the living room. Travis was startled, but barely awake. 

I bring him a laptop with the picture I had taken last night of him. 

""You are looking at a picture I took of you last night. I've already uploaded it into a image hosting site, and copied this picture into a couple of safe places. There is no erasing this picture. Understand?""

""Yes""

""You're job right now is to prevent this from getting sent to your parents. The only way prevent this from getting sent to your parents is to pay for the coke I bought you last night, and move the fuck out.""

Because Travis did not have a car, I gave him rides to his parents work and place of residence. I also knew a few of the addresses of where his friend's parents lived (google!). Travis was scared shit-less of his dad. If I had threatened to send any details of his fast life to his dad, Travis would obey everything. In the end, I had Travis pay $400 dollars for the half eight I had only paid $50 for. Travis moved out of the house within the same day.

About 3 months after the situation, I moved out of the house we shared. I sent the picture to his parents. To his parent's bosses. To all his parent's neighbors. Then to all the friend's parent's addresses. The cost? About $250 dollars. All paid for ala' Travis.

**I do have proof. Picture is around on one of my computers, and I'll post that in the update if people are interested.**

TL;DR    Talked my clepto, thief of a roommate into buying a sack coke and having me take a picture of him doing a line of cocaine with his name spelt out on it. Which then I used the picture to blackmail him with. Then using the money I extorted from him, I sent the picture to everyone his parents knew.

A friend of mine recently bought a house.

Thus, he parks his daily driver on the street. There is plenty of parking on the street, as nearly everyone parks in the driveway, but every few days this woman with a playboy sticker on the windshield of her white 90's mustang parks right in front of his house before he gets home from work. 

One day, he pulls up behind her right as she's getting out of her car. 

He says, ""Excuse me ma'am. I was wondering if you would mind not parking in front of my house. I like to park here.""

She responds with tons of attitude, ""this isn't *your* parking spot. You don't own the street."" 

He's annoyed at her being rude for no reason, but wanting to get his way, he keeps calm and says, ""I know. It's just there's plenty of parking on this street. I'm asking you as a favor."" 

""Yeah? Well I don't know you, and I'll park wherever I want. Get rid of that pile of trash and park in your driveway if it's so important to you."" 

To be fair, the ~~alpha~~ alfa does look like a pile of trash, but still this woman was pretty unbelievable. Thing is, my friend works in private security, and has contacts in the local PD. He calls his buddy, and asks her to run the lady's plates, getting her address. Then he waits. She continues to park in front of his house, but he doesn't make it home from work early enough to actually see her. A couple of weeks later though, the stars align, and he is out getting his mail when she pulls up. 

He walks over to her, and says, ""Excuse me. I just wanted to ask you again to park somewhere else. Just 15 feet forward. I'd really appreciate it."" 

""Look asshole, I'm going to park here, because it's across the street from my friend's house. Deal with it."" (Her friend is a skeezy douche who inherited a nice house from his dad, and proceeded to neglect it until it was the street eye-sore). 

""Listen lady, this really isn't cool. It's not like I come to 123 Example Ln. and park in front of your house...""

This is despite my doctor warning my parents of my allergies and urging them to not to let me do it, or let me be outside while its being mowed.

But my parents still make me do it and I have to grit my teeth and sneeze my way around the yard.

One day, my parents leave to go for a walk with my sister. I'm kinda ticked because I would much rather be going for a walk than to sneeze my brains out mowing grass.

So as I finish up mowing the yard just as they come back with ice cream in hand! none for me apparently...
They now are going to go to the mall and do some shopping and offer for me to come along. I ask if they would wait for me to have a shower and possibly stop for ice cream so I could have some too. Nope, they can't wait for me to have a shower and they wouldn't stop for ice cream anyways...

So they leave me behind again.

I pull out the fertilizer spreader and large bag of fertilizer. I know approximately 1/8th of a bag is the usual amount I am told to use for our size of yard, so I load the rest of the bag (about 3/4 of it) into the spreader and proceed to spread fertilize in the yard.

I then found the ""round up"" plant killer and loaded that up in our sprayer. This is the stuff that we used to kill grass around the shed and around the deck to stop the grass from growing. I sprayed an even light coat through the middle of the yard.

Guess who didn't have to mow the grass for the rest of the year? Our grass was like straw for the rest of the summer, and even the next year it grew back very thin.

**TL;DR** I was allergic to grass, parents made me mow the yard even though doctors said I was too allergic. One day my parents take my sister to get ice cream and go to the mall without me so I get revenge by over fertilizing and spraying plant (grass) killer through the yard.

I flashed my lights at him (once) and he freaked out at me turning in the saddle to give me the finger.
 Now fair enough do it once,-- but he carried on doing it, shouting ( from inside his helmet Doh!) and shaking his fist at me and (this is important) -not paying attention to the road in front.

I saw my opportunity :)

I opened my eyes, dropped my jaw, gripped the wheel and slammed on my brakes.

My words cannot do justice to his frantic attempt to turn his body, snatch at the handlebar, brake hard and steer all at the same moment whilst is brain was engaged at trying to figure out the emergency.

There was this guy that would hang out with my group of friends, but it seemed like no one really liked this guy. Even though no on really wanted him around he would always somehow figure out where we were at.  Anyhow, this guys was constantly an asshole to me making off-hand comments and jibes at me all the time.
It was around the time that every one of my friends was getting their driving license and just starting to drive.  At this time there was some friendly window chalking of each other's cars.  Nothing harmful, just if you saw a buddies car you would write something on their windshield like: Got you bitch. Something like that. 
Fast forward a couple of months, and that asshole gets my car. He doesn't use window chalk though. He pours syrup on my car, and rubs candles on my windows/windshield.  It was a cold night so the syrup froze on my car, and the only way to get the candle wax off of windows is with a razor. I find out that it was the asshole that did this to me, and I swear revenge. 
My car back then was a junker that I didn't really care about, but the assholes car was a 2 year old jeep. So, the next weekend one of my buddies is having everyone over to his house to play poker. Now poker is the assholes favorite game to play, so I know he will be there. When my buddy calls to invite me over, I decline feigning sickness. I plan on getting my revenge that night. Since the asshole has an idea that I will try and get revenge he gets my buddy to let him pull his jeep inside his garage. So when I get there I check all the doors to the garage, they're locked. I then do a little reconnaissance, and find that everyone is in the basement playing poker. Then I sneak in the front door, and creep into the garage with my bag of goodies. There is the Jeep. I proceed to dump: cheese sauce, salsa, syrup, chocolate syrup, cooking oil, bird seed, and planting soil. I also fully covered every one of his windows in green candle wax. I then slinked away, and went home. The best part was apparently eveyone stayed the night at my buddies, so the asshole didn't get to his car for around 10-12 hours. Apparently the combination of all that stuff messed up his paint job a little bit, and he had to get it redone. He also suspected it was me, but couldn't ever prove it. He threatened me with law suits, but never filed one.

When I was 11, I was pretty timid. I wasn't bullied or anything, just generally quiet and soft-spoken. In my art class, I sat next to a girl who was both pretty and very annoying -- she was giggly and hyperactive all the time. Still, she had a lot of friends while I mostly kept to myself.

I can't remember how it started but she would *eat* the erasers from my pencils. She thought it was hilarious, and other people did too. I had a mechanical pencil, she stole it, took the eraser out and ate it, cracking up laughing. The first time, I just shrugged it off. But a mechanical pencil without an eraser is annoying! If I used a wooden pencil, same thing -- she'd chew it off. And we were in the middle of doing sketches, so I really needed a pencil and erase! So when she ate my eraser the next day, and the next, and every time I got a new pencil or an eraser, I was getting really sick of it. I asked her to stop, and she just laughed at me. Everybody would always *encourage* her to do it. She did it until I had no erasers left, and she thought it was so fucking funny. Thinking back now, I should've just told a teacher -- but I didn't want anyone to think I was a humorless baby telling on people, so I took my own personal revenge.

For Christmas, I asked for one of those long eraser pens, the one where an eraser shaped almost like string cheese goes inside a plastic container and is pushed out as it's used. I got one with several replacement erasers. I took one of them, put it in the bath tub, and peed on it. I let it dry and put it in the pen. I knew she would take care of the rest.

Sure enough when school started back up, and I pulled my eraser pen out in art class, she said, ""Oh, is that my Christmas present?"" Giggling, she snatched it from me, pulled the eraser out and started chewing on. I just smiled and watched her devour the whole thing. Maybe she finally got her fill of erasers (seriously, why was she eating them in the first place?) or maybe that one put her off erasers forever because she never stole another eraser from me.",,False,,t5_2vjvl,False,,,True,t3_1j4bqr,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1j4bqr/erasers_and_pee/,

I had just moved to Houston with my then girlfriend and we got ourselves a great deal on a two bedroom apartment. We didn't need two bedrooms, but it was something like $20 per months more for that one, and it had washer/dryer hookups.


Anyway, we met the downstairs neighbors who were somewhat uneducated... I think that's the nicest way I can describe them. They bragged about running into various wal-marts and running off with 24 packs of beer without paying and such. We didn't think much of it at the time. Just stupid kids doing stupid things. As long as they stayed out of our way, we didn't care. Well... that changed pretty quickly.


One night, they had a party. Nothing wrong with most parties, but this thing was getting out of control. We asked if they could keep it down a bit, and they apologized and said they would. Then a fight broke out among their group. We called the cops. Cops told them to chill out. Party kept going. We couldn't take the noise anymore. it was something like 5 in the morning and I had to set up a bed in our closet so we could get something close to peace and quiet... but that did almost nothing.


We called the cops again and the police said they had to shut the party down. So, instead of getting all rowdy with music, they started playing washers right outside our window. The sound of metal hitting metal, plus their bullshitting and yelling were still going right through our windows and kept us from sleeping. I went outside for a second time and asked them to keep it down, that we hadn't been able to sleep all night. They were still drinking and casually said ""yeah sure"".


They must have stopped somewhere around 8 am. My girlfriend and I had already decided there was no point to trying to sleep, and I asked her for permission to get my revenge. She smiled and approved.


We had breakfast, some coffee to get ourselves into some state of awakeness and I headed into our second bedroom... where I had set up my drum set. I had given them a couple of hours to make sure they got all comfy in their beds and such, put on my practice headphones and started taking out my anger to some good 'ol Led Zeppelin. I had been in a band for 5 years at that time, so I had some endurance. I made sure to play nearly without stopping for somewhere near 3 hours.


That was the first and last party they had while we lived there. It was also the last time we saw any women stay late at their place. No one complained about my drums.

I go to school at WVU. I'm a medical student and I live in a building that is 10 minutes from the hospital. It's a nice building and every apartment has (at least) a full bedroom and a living room. Each floor has a boys bathroom and a girls bathroom, and each consists of a number of stalls, along with 5 or 6 showers. Due to policy, and at the request of other occupants, the building's only cameras are out front and in the back. 

Lately, there's been this guy going around and taking shits in the showers. The first time it happened, it was on the second floor (I live on the fifth). A student walked in early in the morning before class and said that it was right over the drain. Personally, I found this to be incredibly funny and thought nothing of it, assuming it was a one-time prank.

The following Tuesday, on the sixth floor, it happened again. Needless to say, us students didn't find it as funny this time around. From this point on, everybody was extremely cautious when stepping into the showers.

On Thursday, it happened once more. This time was different, though. It happened on my floor. To be more specific, it happened to me when I stepped into the shower. I was not lucky enough to see it before I stepped in it. This was becoming personal. I was so pissed that I even called the staff to complain. They said that since we didn't know who it was, and due to the no-camera policy, they couldn't do anything about it at the time. I then took it upon myself to find a solution.

I spent the next week planning my revenge. Throughout this week, the shower-shit had become more frequent. It happened almost every day. I figured it had to be someone in the building, because according to the building staff, no one had been coming in-and-out every day who was not a resident. Eventually, I had narrowed it down to two revenge plans:

1. Wait it out, let somebody else handle it, then extract my revenge later on whoever did this. The problem with this plan was that whoever did it was sure to be expelled/suspended. AT LEAST kicked out of the building. I wanted to either be the cause of this or make this awful person suffer more.

2. I was going to find out who the midnight shitter was, and turn him in, after I had executed whatever I was going to do to this monster.

I decided to go with option 2, and the problem now was how to find out how to catch the person. I could try a camera, but that would be an invasion of both building policy, and the law. You cannot but a camera in a bathroom. The other option was to gather several of other occupants (who I knew could not be the shitter) and stand guard outside the bathrooms. Once again, I went with option two. Me and twelve residents stood outside the bathrooms on each floor, and pretended to be texting. There were six floors and we each took shifts throughout the night. Whoever was the shitter must have heard of our plans, because nothing had happened for the first two nights of doing this. On the third night, however, my luck skyrocketed. I saw a student go into the bathroom I was watching. He was on my floor, but I didn't talk to him. He was new, and he had recently transferred from UGA. He walked in and I waited. No shower sounds, no toilet flushing. I peeked into the bathroom, slightly, and looked. No one was in the stall. I then slowly scoped the outside of the showers until I saw a small shadow inside the last one. I had finally found this man.

Since he was on my floor, I knew all about the guy. We will call him Jim. Jim was a man of indian decent. He had several friends who I knew of, and both were in classes with me. The next Monday, I approached one of them. I explained my whole situation, and we hatched a plan together. The plan was that this friend was going to spend the night at Jim's place, then let me in when Jim was asleep. I was then going to enter with 3 bags of cow manure and pour them ALL OVER THE APARTMENT. Then, in the morning, I was going to report him to the proper authorities. Surprisingly enough, my whole plan worked, and he was evicted from the building.

So you have seizures when I go like this?"" and proceeded to flip the lights on and off.

Now, it wasn't yet dark enough and he wasn't doing it fast enough for it to actually set off a seizure, but the thing about seizures is that people can literally die from them, so as soon as the first moment of panic passed and I remember that, I was *pissed.* So I punched him in the face hard enough to break his nose in full view of everyone else.

Somebody called the police, but no one else there was an asshole and some of them had seen me seizing before (mostly absence seizures, but I've been told that those can be more terrifying to witness than tonic-clonic seizures). So when the police came and I made up a story about how I had had a seizure because of something Richard did to try to set off a seizure, they backed me up and said that I wouldn't have known what I was doing. So they lectured Richard and escorted both of us to the hospital.

I want to start off saying I gave up on revenge long ago and adopted the ""don't wish bad on others, wish good on yourself"" philosophy as if your wish comes true, one benefits you while the other's worthless.

That being said, here's one of my last acts of revenge from Freshman year of college 10 years ago.

My dorm was a 3 story brownstone. I lived in a double on the first floor and had a quad and triple of freshman above me. I admittedly was a little intense my first semester of college, but I always tried to make friends rather than problems. For whatever reason, all the other freshman in the dorm started to shun and exclude me except my roommate. It was really lonely and I felt really unwanted and fucking insecure all the time. It got to the point they didn't talk to me or go near my room if I was there.

March of that year, I went home for a weekend. When I came back, I found my Cookie Crisp was gone (I bought cereal for breakfast as it wasn't included in my meal plan. It was all I had in the morning) and my tissue box was empty (that STILL creeps me the fuck out). My roommate told me it was the freshman who shunned me.

I calmly went to ask about it and ask why and they immediately put on angry faces, told me to calm down and they would replace it that night. Well, hours pass and they didn't leave. The school store was closing soon so I went up stairs and politely asked Jimmy (the guy the douches all followed) if he could please go soon so I would have breakfast in the morning. He grumbles and says ok. Another hour passes and the stores close to closing, nobody went. I politely ask again and Jimmy says ""I'm not going and I'm not going to let you *harass* me into it.""

""Well, that's nice, but that's not the decision you made when you ate my breakfast.""

""WHAT DO YOU MEAN BREAKFAST? WHAT TIME YOU WAKE UP? WHAT TIME IS YOUR CLASS? WHY DON'T YOU EAT IN THE CAFETERIA? ""

""None of these questions matter, you ate it, you replace it.""

He stomps off into his room. At this point, I stop being forgiving and know what to do

The douchebag left all his toiletries in the bathroom, which was a small one toilet one bathtub bathroom for 9 college dude.

I got in for my shower and proceeded to piss in his yellow shampoo and then as quickly as I could move, jizz in his

-On his hand soap and face bar

-in his toothpaste

It was hard to make sure I got it everywhere and no clear signs of it, but I got it to work.

I didn't tell a soul for a year, and I don't think I told anyone about the toothpaste for a little longer.

I didn't care if he mouthed off to me afterwards. I already ruined it for him.

Once again, I'm apprehensive to post to r/prorevenge. It really seems like it should belong in /r/petty revenge

Let's recap on the main characters. Bam is your typical bitchy alpha mum whose child is the second coming of Dickens/Beethoven/Tesla and whathaveyou. Mini-Bam is her equally bitchy daughter. These two had been out to make hell of my theater-life ever since they laid eyes on my ruby red shoes (Mini-Bam was one of the flying monkey things. Serves her right).

My mother had just set my hair with more than the dose of hairspray I'd recommend one use on children. My hair has always been very straight, to a point where people ask me if I straighten my hair. So one can only imagine what a task it was for my mother to coil it all up and keep it in place.

Bam took it upon herself to give me a quick ""touch-up"" while my mother took a break. Said touch-up included tousling my hair until the crackly curls cracked and the entire hairdo came apart, sticking pins in my head where pins should not go, and generally making me look like a cross between Goku and a troll doll.

In retaliation, my mother ""accidentally"" snipped off half Mini-Bam's pigtail.

When I moved to Australia, about 9 years ago, I was 9 (now 18) and had no friends. This was understandable, but the sad part was that no-one WANTED to be my friend. I did everything wrong, I sat with the wrong posture, I said the wrong thing, I acted like a 5 year old when something serious was going on, I acted like a 20 year old when some game was happening, every little thing just went wrong for me.

Then, this amazing person became my friend. I'll call her Sophie Coldfish, to protect her identity, because that would be going a little far. Anyway, Sophie was my first real friend here, and I met her after easily 3 years with literally not a single friend in the hemisphere. We did pretty much everything together, and later she introduced me to her own friends, and we very quickly bonded. Now, this was fine for about 2 years. I had a great best friend, who was warm and friendly to me, and I had a great group of new friends who were interested in science fiction and classic literature and all the other nerdy things I liked. 

And then I got my diagnosis of autism. This wasn't something I bandied about or anything, I kept this information close to my chest, telling only the people I thought I could trust most in the world.

Apparently this did not extend to my best friend, little miss Coldfish. She went screaming about how I was a freak, a liar, a retard and a pervert (where did she get that one from? And yes, all of these and more were her actual words). It got so bad I tried to kill myself on three separate occasions. It turned out she had a serious problem with anyone she perceived as mentally ill, and held virtually neo-Nazi views about what should be done with mentally disabled people. 

I vowed absolute, total revenge on this bitch who had ruined my carefully-constructed life. We ended up sparring a little, mostly verbally, until after about 6 months of this we just sort of lapsed into furious silence. 

She should have remembered that I was the winner of the prize for science in my school for 3 years running. After about 2 more months, I got really sick of her shit. I still had my old friends from before, but my former best friend was now my absolute nemesis. I trusted her with everything, and now she was using that against me, telling people I was bigender (""Hey, did you know the nutjob is a faggot too?""), that I had Tourette's (""Yeah, like that retard on YouTube"") and that I liked Star Trek and old sci-fi movies and things (""What a fucking nerdy bitch"").

I found my way onto eBay, and bought 8 ounces of 99% pure iodine crystals. I then went to the local shops, and got some disposable pitchers and a few bottles of ammonium. If you mix these up in a certain ratio, you get a highly volatile chemical called nitrogen triiodide. This is also known as explosive paint.

Later that night, I went to her house, and painted this stuff around her door handle. Her door is one of the ones where if you turn the handle on one side, the other turns too. I also painted it under the wheels of her car, and under her welcome mat. Since nitrogen triiodide will explode with a small amount of force and a terrifyingly loud bang when touched or moved, leaving an indelible yellow stain, this might be quite interesting.

Fast forward a little. I come back four days later. There's a deep yellow stain on the door handle, and on her driveway. Two of her tyres have the same mark, two others look new (I later found out from a co-worker of hers that they burst ""for some reason""). Turning over her mat, there are deep yellow and black scorch-marks in it.

I did this again, only this time on her bike wheels and under her window (which I heard from her boyfriend had been replaced, very expensively, since she thought she broke it because of the cracking sound), a week later.

She'll never know it was me specifically, but I have a fair idea. She's stopped calling me names in the street, which is something, and I may even have the restraining order (200 metres) lifted if she keeps up this enforced good behaviour.",,False,,t5_2vjvl,False,,,True,t3_1emkjk,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1emkjk/my_former_best_friend_turned_nemesis_finally_got/,
1374925162.0,281,self.ProRevenge,1j5mt1,No cake for you,347,66,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1j5mt1/no_cake_for_you/,"Background:
I am a sysadmin for a web dev/marketing company. For those who didn't know, yesterday was 'Sysadmin Appreciation Day' where coworkers are encouraged to give appreciation to their sysadmins.

One of my coworkers, let's call him Matt, is smart, slighty arrogant, egotistical and a bit of a dick. He **loves** to tease and annoy people as a joke and he'll happily let it go into harassment if he can get away with it. On the flipside, if you do anything to him, hoo boy he doesn't take it well.

tl;dr: he can dish it but he can't take it.

Anyway, so yesterday he was looking forward to some appreciation from the rest of the company as he believed he deserved it (and he let us all know this). Which he does to a degree because he has been doing a lot of the shit work - we've been secretly assigning those tickets to him :p

Over the course of the day we did get a lot of thanks from our colleagues but one of the project teams came down with beer and [cake](http://i.imgur.com/BL6nG89.jpg) (had to hide the project name due to the NDA) in thanks for all the work we've done for them. Well, by 'we' they actually meant me (and they said as much) as I had been the sole sysadmin working on the hellish project. The rest of the team had no issue with this (because they knew how much hell I'd gone through working on it) but Matt didn't like this one fucking bit. The only present we get and he couldn't have any of it? Insufferable!

So he became very vocal about this and insisted that the cake was actually for all of us (not that he cared about the others). I was planning on sharing anyway but looking at how he was acting I saw my chance to piss him off. Revenge for all the false rumours he spread to make my life difficult, revenge for all the times he'd randomly tamper with my Linux shell settings right before project deadlines, revenge for all the other things he'd done to piss me off for his shits and giggles).

I insisted that the cake was only for me and that he should fuck off. He started calling me a 'greedy cunt' and a 'fat bastard' and a bunch of other things. He insisted on some cake because he had done some work on the project as well. He had actually, but it was so minor no one remembered or cared. Except for him, right now, because he wanted some cake. 

So I laughed and said, ""Sure, okay, here's your piece"" and threw some icing at him. He got even more angry at me and I explained that it was proportional to his contribution to the project. He got so angry he tried insulting me more but it came out in a splutter and he stormed off mumbling something about getting lunch.

When he left the rest of us burst into laughter at how childish he was acting. We decided to prank him even more so we took photos of us eating all the cake and only left one plate (on my desk) to make it look like I had eaten all of it while he was away. I also knew that he'd start to play the victim and try get others on his side. So, I sent out an email to the company explaining the prank and asking that they play along and ignore any rantings from him. Turns out it was a good move as he'd already started texting several people about me being a 'greedy bastard' and that ""this is why you shouldn't give rohei anything""

So when he came back he was still petulent and sulky and stayed like this for the rest of the day. It wasn't helped by other victims of his deciding to get some revenge and coming down with donuts, chocolate, etc just for me :P This was completely unintended and a masterful stroke on their part because he stayed so upset that he stormed out of the office the minute it hit 17:30. He didn't even take any of the free beer and he's normally all over free alcohol.

Jesus, how we laughed when he had left. Who knew that the cooler-than-you Matt would get so upset over something like cake? I sure as hell didn't and I hope he enjoys the photos of us eating the cake that are in his inbox :)

**Edit:** And how did the cake taste? Delicious :D

**Edit 2:** So, yesterday he came in an saw the pictures and seemed to take it pretty well. He laughed at them and admitted that we got him good. I think he realised that he was being a stupid twat about the whole thing (I mean, it's only cake for crying out loud). However, I'm still keeping my guard up as this may be a ruse, to be honest :/

This is a throwaway account because I don't need my girlfriend (among other people) learning about this story as it relates to my involvement in it. 

So I play in a band and hang out with a lot of other guys in bands. If you listen to Van Warped Tour kind of music, there's a chance you may be familiar with our work. Here is the thing about bands: they share woman very candidly. Once a girl starts dating a guy in a band, she's off limits. Don't touch her. It creates drama not only between the two guys, but between the two bands as well. Record labels and managers especially hate that drama, so it's in everyones best interest to never, ever cheat with a girl dating a guy in another band. It's an unspoken but well-known fact.

Another well known fact is that, once a girl is single, regardless of who she has dated in the past, she is fair game. Guys don't usually raise a huge fuss when their ex bangs another guy from another band... it's almost expected. In hockey you have ""puck-bunnies"", in bands you have ""band-bitches"". It is what it is.

So I get a call from a girl, call her J. She was engaged to the singer of a band who you may be familiar with as they have found commercial success. J calls me up and says ""lets get together tonight"". Now, I know what this means. Long and short of it is that we hung out, smoked a bit and had some beers and hooked up. Now, she was NOT wearing an engagement ring and she CLAIMED she and her ex were completely done. I was out on tour so I had no idea of their status... and she led me to believe that it had been this way for a while. 

Once I found out she lied, I took charge and wanted to let the guy know I just hooked up with his ""ex"" (current?) fiance. I felt terrible and knew it needed to be done. Here's where the drama starts. She denies every-single-thing. She claims it never happened and that I am a total liar. Now, this band bitch has some pull. She knows people all over the industry and because she was so pissed that I tried to fuck her over (tell the truth?) she started a campaign against me. Her fiance and her told everyone I was making shit up and trying to get attention from other bands. In reality, I was just trying to do what I viewed as the right thing. Now, this went on for months. And months. And months. I would get calls in the middle of the night where one of them would call me, or both at the same time (for real) bitching me out. I lost A LOT of good friends who ""sided"" with them and wanted nothing to do with me. 

Fast forward another few months. They break up for real. Like, for real. She ends up hitting me up again (total band bitch) and asks to hang out. We end up fucking and she thinks the whole past year or so is just the funniest thing. After getting her pretty stoned, I pull out my phone and I start taking photos of her (these will not be shared fellas). I got photos of her from behind while fucking, from on top, from everywhere. She was so into being photographed that she started taking photos of herself getting REAL dirty. 

Month or so later we get a call and wouldn't you know it, we're scheduled by our label to meet up and play six shows together with this band (the one who the singer was with J). Now originally, I was thinking about maybe just texting these photos to the guy and being like ""Yo, fuck you""... but it wasn't enough. So I'm pondering what the hell to do in my mind, and nothing seems to click, until I realized something! This band did a song where their ""backdrop"" was a bunch of photos and shit. I don't want to go into detail other than that, however the program that ran the backdrop was controlled by their guitar-tech on side stage right. It was a simple program that ran the photos... it was matched to a click track so they changed with the beat of the song.

On our last night with this band, we're on the east coast. A fellow bandmate of mine and myself figured out what program the tech used, what the ""click rate"" was on the track and after 5 nights of watching, how it was all set up (really easy... just plug your computer in and the images project on a huge ass screen behind the drummer). When it was time for them to play the song that uses the photos, we waited until they started. After 10 seconds or so of them playing to the normal backdrop, my guitar tech called theres away and I plugged my mac in instead of his. I waited for the beat to hit and I clicked the space-bar. With the beat of the music, pictures of J slopping my dick, fingering herself and dancing around my house naked were displayed behind the band. They went 20 - 30 seconds before the band noticed, another 2 minutes before it stopped. The mother fuckers kept playing, and best of all, the singer stood there in front of a cheering crowd who LOVED it, forcing him to act like it was ""part of the show"". 

He was pissed. You couldn't tell it was me in the photos, but it was my mac plugged in and because of my history with his ex, he figured it out pretty quickly. I got jumped that night by him and two dudes when I was smoking a cig out back. Punched in the face 4 or 5 times and kicked pretty hard in the ribs once or twice. I felt like it was pretty fair, I didn't fight back or retaliate. Just laughed my ass off while getting fucked up.

Worth every bruise and the black eye.

He lived at this apartment in Dallas for a while and his landlord was a real dick.  He would complain about non-existent noises, he jacked up the rent via some slimy loophole in the contract, he refused to make any repairs and left my friend to call plumbers, etc. on his own.  At lot more stuff that I can't remember.

The final straw was when my friend announced he was moving out.  He gave about two months' notice, but the landlord screamed bloody murder about this and that (I don't really know), but bottom like he flat out announced that my friend would never get his security deposit back.

My friend was prepared to fight this, but then said fuck it; a plan of revenge is worth a few hundred bucks.  By lucky chance for this plan, the move out was at the end of August--the middle of summer.

There was a closet in the apartment that he cleaned out completely.  It was fairly large with hardwood floors like the rest of the apartment.  

Then he went down to a butcher's shop and asked for the offal--basically intestines and scrap--they were going to throw away.  He came back with a trash bag full of pig stomach, intestines, fat, bones, and god knows what else.  He went back a few more times and got even more bags.  He put all this offal in these big Hefty bags and put them in the closet.  He then closed the closet door and taped it all to hell--it was hermetically sealed, no air in or out.

Fast forward two months.  It was time to go, he was moving out, he had all his stuff out, all that was left to do was leave the keys on the counter and go.  Which he did.  But the *very* last thing he did was put on some rubber gloves, rubber boots, and a facemask and unseal the closet door.  Working as quickly as he could, all within a few large breaths, he took a knife and cut cut cut all those Hefty bags with the two month old offal festering in there.  He said even holding his breath and breathing through his mouth the stench was unbelievable.

He dumped the contents on the floor, closed the closet door, and walked out.  He never heard back from the landlord again.  ",,False,,t5_2vjvl,False,,,True,t3_1dgtra,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1dgtra/landlord_revenge/,

She literally had just turned 18, and I was proud to have a ring on my finger and be able to call her my wife. We have been married for almost a year now, and while it is not marital bliss, we are still enjoying life to the fullest. She is wonderful to me in every way, and I cannot imagine life without my wife. Whats even more enjoyable is her extended family.

I come from a very small family. My father, an adopted child, never really knew his real parents, but grew up well nonetheless. My mother too lived in a sort of broken home, and both of my parents had to grow up almost dirt poor. As you can imagine, living dirt poor has had an effect on me as well. As small as my family is, my in-laws make up even more of my family, with my wife having a larger family then mine could ever have.

I am giving you this small history lesson for a reason. You see, my wife has a great-grandmother that is one of the sweetest ladies in existence. She is kind, beautiful, funny and been through so much, I regard her with great wisdom and love. The woman has lived through generations of technology, grew up in the Great Depression, and has seen almost every major war this country has been embroiled in.

Marrying young to a carpenter, they grew their family as much as they could, sewing love and a hard work ethic into their kids at a very young age. Her husband was the kind of guy that hated hospitals, and didn't need the finer things in life. He once put a nail through his hand, cursed out loud, pulled the nail out, and sealed the wound with carpenters glue. He was a man's man in every sense of the word. He passed in 2012, and you can imagine that she is now very lonely and heartbroken without him.

Now that you know a little about this woman, you can imagine my shock and complete rage when I found out someone had smashed my great-grandmother-in-law's (Is that the right word?) custom-made mailbox. It had been hand-carved by her husband, and was something she loved so much, because he made it before he passed. Apparently, she found it smashed right outside her house, and she cried for hours.

Several young teenagers grew up on the road where G-GMA lived, so I had my idea on who broke the mailbox in the first place. So, I did what anyone would of done, and cooked up a plan for revenge. I built my G-GMA another wooden mailbox, and made it out of a very pliable and thin wood. I am not a carpenter by any means, and it was an incredibly ugly mailbox. I placed it outside and waited for the fools to destroy it.

Sure enough, it was found in literal pieces the next day, right around 3-6 o'clock. So, I built another one, out of the same material, and placed it outside just like before. I needed to make sure exactly when the fools came by. For this, I waited at her house for the exact time.

At 4:00PM, a screaming and hollering alerted me to the front of the house, where several idiots driving a large, red truck came flying down the road. They drove past the mailbox, and boom, it shattered into a billion pieces as one of the idiots smashed it with a steel bat. They yelled in jubilation, and I had guessed that the destruction of my mailboxes had become routine, as it shattered very easily from the bat.

Now understanding what time they came around, I built another mailbox, and made it easily destructible. It was ugly in every way, and I made it even more flimsy then the first two. I installed it like normal, and the next day, waited for the mailman to drop off the mail. I realized how ugly it was when the mailman gave it a concerned look, as if he were afraid if he reached into it, he would gain thousands of splinters and maybe AIDS.

Picking up the mail, I promptly replaced the mail inside with a large, cement cinder block. It barely fit inside the mailbox, but it was concealed quite nicely. I knew that at the speed they usually went, and the bat they used, this could serious screw up whoever was striking the mailbox, but at the time, I did not care in the slightest.

Sure enough that day, they came around at 4:00PM. Flying down the road, the bumbling idiots screamed as their batter got ready. CLANG. A scream echoed out across town and the truck sped off quicker then usual. I have no idea what kind of damage was done, but you better believe that was the last time someone bothered destroying my G-GMA's mailbox.

Years back in high school we had a guy in our friend group that was a complete asshat. He would be a dick to girls, make up all kinds of ridiculous stories, talk shit behind your back, and whip off his shirt whenever possible. The kind of guy that would turn off a Xbox when everyone is playing, just because he's losing. Our friend group was  slowly but steadily becoming disillusioned with this guy. And after a particularly extensive display of asshatery, we decided to get back at him.
The moment of inspiration came when my brother was watching an episode of True Life. It was dedicated to people that frequent online chat sites. We thought why not pose as a particularly slutty girl (who shared an extremely similar first name) on a bunch of these online chat lobbies and put up his number soliciting phone sex and sexting. 
We posted it in a number of lobbies that popped up on our Google search. The first hint that is was working was when some guy responded on lobby ""DONT CALL THAT #, SHE SOUNDS LIKE A DUDE!!"" 
Lo and behold the next day he shows up to class looking flustered and annoyed. He immediately starts getting into it about how he's got and still getting ""100's of creepy calls and dick pics from all over the f-ing world."" That golden inner satisfaction kept building and building as he kept ranting. ""I got pics of f-ing big dicks, small dicks, black dicks, asian dicks!! This shit is complete bull!!"" I didn't want to give myself away, but the joy too was fantastic and tangible. Wracking cackles of delicious revenge were had. 
But the capstone moment was after class he gets a call from some of those poor saps. Captain douche puts it on speaker and you hear in a lowww weird sexual voice ""Heyyy is this Douche-a? I'm couldn't stop thinking about calling you after reading your posts... I'm touching myself right now.."" I proceed to fall on the ground laughing in ecstasy as Asshat told him off.
Imagining him getting all those calls and dick pics years ago still makes me crack a smile. I would never do something like that nowadays, but god it felt glorious to get some revenge after years of being subjected to his reign of unholy douche-ary. 

Tdlr= posted asshole's phone number to creepy Internet chat lobbies, hilarity ensues.

1376617219.0,271,self.ProRevenge,1kgkll,Revenge of the Sheikh (or how to escape Saudi Arabia),321,50,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1kgkll/revenge_of_the_sheikh_or_how_to_escape_saudi/,"Note: while some details of this story may seem fantastical, this is completely true, gentleman's honor. 

I have a friend whose job was to teach english in foreign countries. (often to adults) On this particular job, he found himself in Saudi Arabia. He would be teaching english on land owned by a Sheikh, who was a wealthy community leader. 

Before he had come to Saudi Arabia, he heard that this particular Sheikh had hired sixty men from Bangladesh for some sort of manual labor, and had refused to pay them. The men had tolerated this for a time, but eventually decided to strike, nothing violent, just a simple sit-down. However in Saudi Arabia, striking is illegal, so the Sheikh deported all sixty men, getting months of free labor in the process. 

You can imagine that my friend was on his toes when he reached SA. 

He had been teaching for about a month now, and sure enough, his payday had come and gone, without being paid. He had visited the Sheikh with his complaints, but he would just wave them off saying ""inshallah!"" which means ""If god wills it"" (essentially just a way to procrastinate.) 

After several more unfruitful attempts to get his money (keep in mind his paycheck was only 10,000 dollars, and this man was a multi-millionare) he was became fed up. He visited the Sheikhs office, receives the customary ""inshallah"" and hands him a subpoena.  

Turns out my friend had paid a visit to the american embassy and told them what was going on, the embassy was concerned, and set up a court date.  

Now this was especially bad for the Sheikh, who was friends with the higher-ups in the american embassy, and this would severely damage his reputation. But my friend wasn't done there. The Sheikh was a devout Muslim, (most people in that area were) so my friend directly quotes the Qur'an, giving verse and chapter, saying: 

'Pay the worker while the sweat is still wet upon his brow' 

This was a major insult to the man, and he practically screamed my friend out of his office, threatening bloody murder. 

That was phase one 

The trial came and the Sheikh appeared in court, it was a relatively simple case, and my friend got his money. 

This is where it gets interesting 

My friend (I've said that a lot) still had some time left to teach, but things were getting pretty ugly, and a powerful Sheikh is not an enemy you want to have, so he decided to high-tail it back to the land of the free. The catch was that the Sheikh had his passport. When you live on his land, and are paid by him, he essentially owns you, and it was policy to take the persons passport, and only give it back after escorting them to the airport to leave the country. 

So my friend started thinking deviously. He called his wife (safe in America) and asked for one of the families passports. Once he got it, he visited the Sheik's office and talked to his secretary (or whatever he was) The conversation went something like this. 

Friend: you know, you people have cheated me and lied to me, and I bet you don't even have my passport! 

Secretary: Of course we have your passport! 

Friend: so show it to me!  

Secretary: NO! I will not show you! 

Friend: Thats because you don't have it, you liar!  
 
Eventually He got to see his passport, and after much cajoling, managed to hold it. He then proceeds (and I shit you not) to rub it all over his body, and act like he just found a long lost friend, all the while trying to switch it with his daughters passport, which was under his leg. He made the switch successfully, and after having the other passport snatched back with a cry of ""you crazy American!"" left with his passport. 

victory 

But he wasn't out of the woods yet, he drove to the small house he was living in, and packed everything he could into his car, he even bundled up the larger items on the roof rack. He then hopped in, and drove 1000 miles to the nearest airport. 

now comes the kicker  

My friend visited the closest American embassy (thank goodness for those) AND REPORTED A STOLEN PASSPORT! That last part had to be all caps, because of the magnitude of it. Remember he had switched passports, his daughters passport was now in the Sheikhs office, and it had no reason to be there.  

The embassy called the Sheikhs office, and it went down 

(after the formalities)

Embassy: do you have the passport of a Jane Smith? (obviously not real name) 

Sheikh: no, no, we have the passport of a John Smith 

Embassy: could you just check for me real quick? 

Sheikh: (silence...then muffled arabic cursing)  

Gotcha

So not only did my friend tarnish this selfish, stingy bastards name at the embassy, he also framed him for the theft of a passport. And the punishment for theft in Saudi Arabia  is dismemberment.

The revenge was also a bit of happy coincidence, so it doesn't involve the plotting characteristic of the best posts on this sub, but it was one of my more satisfying revenges nonetheless. 

Growing up, I lived in a suburb of the Twin Cities. There were a lot of kids in the neighborhood, and one of them, we'll call him Meany Pants, was a jerk-faced bully. No matter what the game was, he'd always cheat. If he ever didn't get his way, he'd hit the other kids until they cried, and then he'd lie and say other kids did it when we'd tell our parents. He'd always, *always,* steal people's toys, and then run away.

Looking back, he came from ""that house"" in the neighborhood: lawn all fucked up, Christmas lights up all year, never participated in the luminaria thing at Christmas, etc. I'm sure the house was shitty because his parents were deadbeats, which is probably why he was such a butt-head, but I digress. 

Right across the street from my house, there was an ice rink where kids could skate during the winter. It was summer at the time, and we were all playing around climbing back and forth over the hockey rink fence thing. Right as this girl was climbing over, Meany Pants grabs her shoe and pushes up so she falls. She starts crying, so my brother and I yell at Meany Pants and tell him that he can't play with us anymore because he's a stinky head. 

This doesn't sit well, and Meany Pants picks up a big piece of glass and starts chasing me around with it, telling me he's going to stab me. I vividly remember this incident, and can honestly say it was my first experience with terror. I was seriously afraid this crazy-ass kid was going to stab me. Meany Pants was my age, older than my brother, so my brother, in his infinite wisdom, kept his distance, and pelted Meany Pants with rocks until Meany Pants got sick of not catching me, and getting hit with rocks, and gave up. 

Cut to winter time. My brother and I are at the ice rink skating. Hoping we've forgotten the attempted murder, and will be willing to let him play with us, Meany Pants comes up and asks what we're doing. We tell him to go away because he's mean. He says something along the lines of, ""FINE! I only came here to use the bathroom anyway!""

He goes into the port-o-potty they had set up for the skaters, and locks the door behind him. The port-o-potty is hard up against the berm where they put all the snow that they plow off of the parking lot of the park where the ice rink is, so we run over, plant our feet on the berm, and push on the back of the port-o-potty as hard as we can. It tips over, and we hear a scream punctuated by a splash. 

We run away, and end up getting totally busted by our mom because we come in the house laughing hysterically and won't tell her why. She marched us back across the street to help her roll the port-o-potty so the door could open. When he crawls out, Meany Pants is pretty-much covered in blue stuff, and my brother and I can't even laugh because he just looks so miserable and pathetic. My mom's yelling at us and telling us to apologize, which we do. My mom walks Meany Pants home, and when she comes back she's even *more* pissed, because his parents read her the riot act. 

We got in *sooooooooooooo* much trouble. If I remember correctly, we were completely grounded for a month. We didn't think about it as we were running away, but it was explained to us loudly by my mother that we are idiots, and this was actually a dangerous prank, because if my mom hadn't figured out what was going on, Meany Pants would have froze to death. Oops.

One day I'm driving home. It's about 430 in the afternoon so there are a decent amount of people on the road. This particular street I'm driving on is mostly two lanes, but there's a three block section where it widens to three lanes. 
 
   As I'm approaching this section, I notice a large truck in the front spot in my current lane(middle). The third lane is open, so I change lanes to the right, signaling. I pass the line of cars and aforementioned truck, signal left and get over with two blocks to spare. As I'm coming up to where these two lanes merge, I see a Kia Sorento flying up behind me in the now nonexistent third lane. He passes me and cuts me off without using his blinker, puffing on a cigarette. I drive a decent little car with ample power, so naturally I seize an opportunity to change lanes left, pass him, get over, fly the bird out the window, and still make my turn.

   I turn right and he follows me. I can tell he's trying desperately to ride my ass and match my speed. This particular turn is quite difficult because it has some sharp corners that lead into each other. I'm fully focused on maintaining my 50mph around these corners. Nailed it. I'm on the straightaway. I simultaneously look in my rear-view to check on Shithead and hear my GF gasp. 
  
  He's spinning out of control incredibly violently. He spins that little Kia two and a half rotations before screeching to a halt in a cloud of dust. Mind you I still haven't looked forward because this road is extremely straight. I stick my arm out the window and fly him one last triumphant middle finger. I then look back at the road just in time to see a cop go by me towards the cloud of dust which housed said Kia, flip his lights on and pull the guy over.

Added some additional details that I had replied to in the comments in original post. 

Reddit, I am not proud of what I did, and I do feel that karma will get me one day- I am prepared for it. I am embarrassed that a somewhat successful individual such as myself is capable of something so childish and embarrassing (I'm 26). I'll try to make this short.

**Background:** Me and my ex had been together for about 1 year- long distance relationship (he lived about 3 hours away). I find out from his sister that he was talking to other women when we were still together and confrontations with him lead nowhere with him saying that I am the only one on his mind and that he would never do that to me (the usual spiel) and that his sister does not know what she is talking about. I take his side (because i loved him). 

**3 weeks ago,** I find out from a mutual friend that he has been seeing and sleeping with this girl in his town, I confront him about it and he flips everything around on me, saying that its so hard for him to keep his dick in his pants while I am living so far away, that I neglect him (which I don't, I am the one that drives to see him every other weekend when I have the funds, we call, text, skype each other daily), that I don't want him to live with me (which is true because I don't want to take care of a grown ass man and pay his bills). He says he loves me and wants to make it work and drops all contact the next day.

I was heartbroken, I talked to my friends and they said the girl he is hooking up with is an easy slut that has been around and that they are in a relationship the day after me and the ex had the talk- probably even before then. 

**2 weeks ago,** while still hurting, heartbroken, I reactivated my facebook and meticulously combed through my ex and his new ""love's"" profiles. I know I should not have done this but whatever. I did not dwell on their flirty messages but instead, focused on her profile. I read through months of disgusting selfies of her in a dirty dark bathroom with barely there clothes that even a floozy would be embarrassed of being caught in. Then I did it. I made a fake facebook profile of a fine-ass looking man from google that ""used to go to her school."" I befriended all of her friends, made fake posts and befriended her. All of this took less than a day. You would be surprised at how many people would befriend you on facebook just from your looks regardless of if they know you or not. I had about 140 ""friends"" in just 2 hours and at that point, people were requesting to be my friend every few minutes. I dunno who is more pathetic, me or these weirdos (just me probably). I started to chat her up the next day, she was very ""open"" with herself, even sending me new pictures of herself in little clothing to a complete stranger without any in return. Being a woman myself, it was easy to tell her what she wanted to hear. 2-3 days later, she was complaining about my ex to me already. I told her I wanted to meet up and will pick her up and ""show her what its like to be with a real man."" At this point, I had hours of conversations saved, her saying the dirtiest shit that I've ever read - pictures, videos, what have you. It was time.

While all this was going on, my ex started to contact me, saying it was a mistake. I asked him if they had broken up, he says yes (twice) and they were not obviously. This should have broken my heart but it didnt. I knew the truth but told him that yes i love him and that I want him to move in with me. He sounded happy, excited- whatever and said that he was going to give his 2 weeks to his boss that day. He texted me later and told me that he just left them with no notice instead because, ""fuck em."" He was going to start packing and will head out with everything later in the week.

**The Revenge.** I posted all of the conversations up on fake facebook, tagged her in it posted the pictures and videos for my ex's eyes only and sat back and enjoyed the show, before I deactivated the fake acc, I had 53 likes and 82 messages. Her family, friends all saw it. My ex saw it and almost immediately texted me to say how he misses me, he can't wait to be with me and doesn't mention anything about the girl. 

Friday rolls around and he tells me he is on his way to my apt. He does not know where I live because I recently moved. I tell him to meet me at a CVS close by so I direct him on where to go. He tells me he is almost out of gas and that I will have to help him put some in it. I agree and tell him that I will once he gets there. I get a text telling me he's at the CVS and asks where I am. I ignore it. 30 minutes later, he blows up my phone. Calls ignored- I made it a point to let it ring once so that he knows i send it to voicemail. 1 hour later- he calls and leaves me a voicemail that he is worried and if I am ok. I am fan-fucking-tastic. 2 hours later, he says that he is stranded, drove to another CVS thinking I was there but now he has no gas and is stranded at a gas station with his things in the car. Calls ignored. I take an ambien and go to bed.

Saturday morning. I have 37 text messages 28 missed calls and 7 voicemails from him and that he had to call his mom to come pick him up. Since then, I blocked his number and then had to change my number since he would then start calling me from his family's phone and blocked calls. I get a msg on fb from his sister. She tells me he came home crying like a fucking baby and since his mom knows pretty much what happened between me and him, she was not very sympathetic- but pretty upset with me. His sister thought I was a badass and deserved better than his lying, cheating loser of a brother.

I know I acted on impulse on all of this, probably destroyed this girls life. I will probably reactivate fake profile to say sorry or whatever but maybe not. She did knowingly sleep with a man that had a girlfriend- seduced him even. I know this sounds crazy but the feelings I had for my ex are still there. He will never forgive me since he is now unemployed and the whole town knows his business (the girl admitted his dick is tiny). Part of me regrets everything and that I want him back with me. Other part of me is glad I destroyed any type of reconciliation as it was not going to work out in the end. Feels good to let this out. 

**tldr: bf cheated, created fake facebook to lure new gf- worked. Seemingly reconciled with ex but then left him stranded 3 hours away from home.**

**Additional bits of info I copied from comment replies:**
He was a friend for 2 years before asking me to be his gf. I left a lot of details out, such as helping him financially with the car he has as well as food for him and his family because they wouldn't have had anything to eat otherwise. I stuck by this guy through his worst times, the lowest point he was ever in. And he screws around on me with the slut of the town and lies about it many times. Contacts me and gives me false hope and then disappears suddenly without an explanation so he can stick his dick in a dirty whore. I'm rambling. 

She doesn't know it was me, just a random dude that put her shit on blast. I made a point not to share the pictures- only to my ex and even those were sent from fake facebook with face blurred out. The tasteless tats were there though so he knows its her. Nobody has connected the dots yet. I tried to be careful about this. I lost him- yes but I don't want him back. I have also booked a gyno appointment thanks to him.",,False,,t5_2vjvl,False,,,True,t3_1dmfhb,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1dmfhb/xpost_from_confession_exacted_revenge_on_ex/,

It was a fantastic lifestyle and he really had a great time. After about 2 years of happily partying and shagging tourists and having an exceptional time of it things started to go downhill, in the form of a bully. He had two mates and they were picking on my friend and taunting him. The ringleader was a huge Maori (native New Zealander) guy and there was no way he could stand up to them without getting bashed. So... they don't realize he is a pro in revenge (oh the stories I can tell), and he sets his mind to getting his own back. On a Friday night when the Island club is really starting to kick and everyone is there he heads for the kitchen. Armed with a commercial size botlle of fish sauce he then heads back for the head bullies room. He poured it over EVERYTHING! In his bed, over all of his clothes, in his luggage, in his shoes, into his shampoo and closed it again... everything. It kind of dawned on him that he'd better start packing now otherwise he's going to get bashed really badly. But the only problem is, he's on an island. There is one ferry a day that goes back to the mainland in the morning. He went and packed his bags and had a brilliant idea... Shave time. No more beard, nor moustache, no more long hair. 1/2 an hour later he's off and hiding in the bush waiting for the ferry to come. 8 hours later or so the ferry starts boarding and he walks down the jetty towards it. And there stood just at the gangplank is the 2 followers making sure he doesn't leave. One of them points to him and says ""isn't that him?"" to which the other replies, ""no, he's got long hair and a beard""... He walked staright passed them and got on the ferry. Great success!

I was 12 at the time and up the street from my house the power lines ran through the woods and if you don't know already, those trails are really fun to ride your bike down. Maybe a half-mile from where my entrance to these trails are there was another trail through the woods off of that where the local kids (between 15 and 18 years old) had built a bunch of BMX jumps. I frequented this area when I knew the rest of the kids generally weren't around (not really good with jumps, it was mostly for fun).

I was hitting the tabletop one day and two of the kids, I'll call them C and M, showed up. These two kids were the originators of the spot and were there all the time, having built all the jumps themselves 3 years prior and of course, were the best ones there. C and M go about their business hitting the jumps and not causing me any trouble, but I knew they weren't the best of kids.

On this particular day I had put my bike down at the top of the hill used for ""dropping in"" and went off into the woods a good 30 or 40 feet to take a leak. When I got back they were both laughing to themselves and when they saw me get back they left for the day.

I had no idea why they were laughing and I was pretty much done for the day too so I took off back home. Half way back to my house, as I was pedaling quite hard to get up a hill, my left petal came right off and caused me to spin around and hit the back of my head quite hard on the hot top. Thinking back, I probably had a concussion but whatever, I dealt with it. I wasn't sure which one of them loosened up my petal but I knew how to get back at them.

The place where this spot was in the woods was pretty conveniently located. As I mentioned before, I got there through the power lines close to my house but the back entrance just had a short trail to a road. This was the type of place that kids would go and drink beer or smoke and not have to worry about being caught.

It seemed like a more devious plan at the time but all I really did was call in an anonymous tip from a pay-phone to my towns crime line telling them that kids were back there drinking beer and doing drugs. I told them about the back entrance and how to easily get there. What happened was better than I had hoped for.

The cops did show up (although I wasn't there) and found a lot of empty beer cans and other garbage. There was no one there when they arrived so no one got busted but what did happen was since the spot was on town-owned property the cops had decided the jumps were unsafe and could pose the threat of a lawsuit.

What had happened was equally as simple as it was annoying. Her group of friends would be walking by a cluster of upperclassmen, and as a scare tactic they would lean into their faces and bark at them like dogs. They captured the reaction they dreamed of so this sort of bullying happened for many weeks. Not long after, this same ""barking"" bullshit was being used across the school. Girls who got this treatment really lost their shit which just egged the seniors on further. My aunt and her closest friend were the only ones left that stood through the pestering to handle the situation. 
Therefore, the targets on their backs had grown substantially. The final day the girls were approached had been building. Towards the Seniors they strode (each one prepped and determined to get a reaction out of the duo).They chorus of girls leaned in all at once and were just about to bark when-

1373736145.0,235,self.ProRevenge,1i85b3,Worst thing i have ever done...(NSFW),326,91,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1i85b3/worst_thing_i_have_ever_donensfw/,"This story may be a little longer for which i apologize but there is a small back story that is needed to fully explain why i went so far in my revenge. I should also say for those grossed out easily or equally offended easily maybe dont keep reading. (although this seems to be an subreddit of epic revenges so im in the right place)

Some years ago i moved into a small apartment with an old friend when my partner and i fell on hard times. I should also mention that my partner was chronically ill and i was effectively a carer for her while working fulltime to support us and studying fulltime. Needless to say i was stressed. The friend who was also a old high school girlfriend (whom ill refer to as CC for crazy cunt) had accepted that we move in on short notice due to a previous housemate almost killing my partner the week before through negligence. 

There were warning signs i should have spotted on moving in with CC but frankly we were that grateful for a roof over our head that I overlooked them. Thus follows events that occurred that built up the rage that lead to revenge over the following 3 months:

* When moving into the house I personally had done all the lifting and shifting of CC's stuff out of rooms so could move my stuff in then moved in every item of furniture myself. (you might say fair enough as she's letting me in but this is up 3 flights of stairs. fridges, washing machine, couches... u get the idea) not one bit of help even on the small stuff.

* CC was also a crazy cat lady. She had a cat she was not allowed to have. This thing was also fucking feral. If this cat was spotted on the windows or any door was even cracked slightly where the cat could get out (or if she thought it was) she would go fucking ballistic. (**daily occurrence**) but more about the cat later

* Moving in I took over 2/3 of the rent and yet CC intentionally monopolized the only common area/kitchen with her druggie boyfriend at any time she was not at work. In this common room she would play romantic shitty movies at loud volume, yet the tiny offshoot room (see 'wardrobe') i used as a study even listening to something at talking volume was apparently too loud for her and would constantly have a go about it. 

* This cat would attack you at any chance it had. teeth and claws. yet CC thought this was cat just being friendly and would blame us for scaring it. still have scars from that fucking thing.

* CC was the laziest, dirtiest bitch ive ever known. This was shown through two things. The first was that myself and partner took a two week holiday camping at some point. Before we left we had asked her to clean the mass of dishes she had created and take out the single bag of garbage that was starting to smell funny. 2 weeks is enough time right? We got home and opened the door of the apartment and the smell....was...atrocious. The original bag was still there with 2 full bags of rotting junk food and meat. There was also not a clean dish in the house with it all piled up on the sink. Upon getting back she was hungover on the couch with her idiot boyfriend and expected us to clean it up for her. 

* CC had complained non stop about how much of a horrible housemate her previous shared living people had been. All of them. This raised alarm bells but i should have realized how much. CC had vendettas against all of them and intentionally fucked with them and their lives whenever she could. This we found out when my partner borrowed CC's contact solution and it immediately burnt her eyes. A previous tenant had added dishwashing soap to try and get revenge on CC.

* The cat. She never changed the kitty litter and what she fed that damned thing STANK when it came out. This was in a tiny apartment with the litter box in the shared and cramped toilet/shower. Most showers would be spent gagging and dry wretching. Despite repeated requests to fix it CC would carry on like a petulant teenager and rarely do anything about it. also more about this later. 

* The usual stories of shitty housemates of stealing food and clothing items and/or selling them to pay for getting pissed/high on the weekend applied as well. 

So after just under 3 months we had had enough. There was more but those are the easiest to explain, it would probably be double the length if i covered everything. So a plan was formed. We were going to wait for her to go out to work for the day them move out in style. 

As soon as she was gone we pulled the trailer around and started loading up all our furniture. This was also when we started discovering some things. At some point CC had set fire to and burnt all of our tea towels. Strange but thats what we found. As well as that she had not been putting the kitty litter in the bin after all. Instead she had been bagging it and then double bagging it and then pulling it **ALL** in a 40L tub in the same bathroom. Had moved it maybe a metre which explained why the smell never ever left the room let alone the apartment. She had spent a time telling us it was old clothes she was storing...

So first of all we called up CC's rental agency and told them we would be moving out and it turned out she had never informed them we were moving in nor about any of the previous tenants. This was a major breach of her contract which was effectively guaranteed she was going to be evicted no matter what. But we decided to add photos and video of the cat she had and playing with the cat which meant she had broken her contract further meaning she copt a $500 fine to clean and sanitize the apartment following her eviction. It was satisfying knowing that she had been in there for 2 years but this was not where it ended. 

She was fairly randy especially after a weekend at a rave and would flaunt how much she was having with her boyfriend and her fetishes while she knew i barely had time for my girl supporting us. Knowing she had a draw full of sex toys i was...mean. If any of you are familiar with a product called blairs hot sauce you've got an idea of where im going. I used the one known as ultra death. Putting a thin coating over her larger toys that she would brag about often. This stuff was pretty potent. Needless to say she was going to be in for a shock next time it was happy time. 

I wish i could say this was where the story ended. CC tried to get revenge 2 months later by sending pics of a pregnant belly to my girl with personal information as if i had cheated and knocked someone up. Fortunately my girl saw through it immediately. So in return my girl, who worked for major utility company, got CC's power cut at her new address and kept it disabled for 2 weeks caught up in red tape that all seemed totally legitimate.

[x-post /r/PettyRevenge],282,50,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1flscc/im_not_buying_the_cat_xpost_rpettyrevenge/,"I've been in a long distance relationship with a cat for 3 years. The feline in question, Poof, belongs to my boyfriend's roommate - ""Ned"".

Ned is a [douchebag](http://alden-tan.com/wp-content/uploads/douchebag-posing.jpg). Really. Just with less blow-out-hair than the referenced image, and more crappy tribal tattoos. Ned was hired right out of college as a firefighter, and loves leaving his T4 slips around - showing that he makes over 100k a year. Yet despite working 7 days a week (granted, 24h shifts) he fails to give proper care to his dog and cat. 

He'll do things like leave the dog in it's crate for 16+ hours a day, run out of food for the animals then claim they're on diets, hardly walk his dog to the point where it's socially dysfunctional and has overgrown nails.

When my boyfriend and I are at the house he shares with Ned, we do the best we can to take care of the pets. Any attempt to discuss their neglect is blown off by Ned. 

Over the years, Poof and I have become very attached. I take him to the vet, get him groomed, buy him food. The only reason I haven't adopted him is because I'm away from home so much.

Ned told my boyfriend he needed to move out for June 1st. Totally fine. Ned is just as horrible a roommate as he is a human - but BF has stuck around because rent was cheap &amp; the house was nice.  He'd been planning on buying a house - so getting the boot from Ned's place put that plan into motion. I'm not going to leave Poof with Ned, so I ask him one night if I could buy the cat from him. (He'd often bragged about how the cat was a 'good deal' at $50) Ned, who loves his possessions, was unsure and said he'd get back to me. 

Next day, he says I can have Poof... for $350.
I cry. I've paid way more than that in food, vet bills and medication for this creature. I was laid off and have been underemployed so I'm not really in the position to drop that much money on someone who's emotionally already my pet.

*Fast forward three months.*
This weekend, I'm back at Ned's house - helping my partner pack. I haven't been back to the house since Ned's absurd offer of $350 a 9 year old cat with kidney issues. As we're almost done, Ned comes up and says Poof has died. Or, at least, he can't find Poof so he figures he got out the house and died outside. He shrugs it off. Happened about a month ago. 

Once again, I weep. I let loose my years of fury on Ned. Telling him how I feel about his constant drunk driving, abusing women, pathological lying, animal neglect, and horrible narcissistic personality. 

My partner and I get into the rented truck, and drive to his new house. Open the front door and I'm greeted by my beloved Poof - mewing for attention.

Fuck you, Ned. Two weeks after he said I'd have to buy my geriatric cat from him, I came over during the week and took Poof. I wonder how long it look that douchebag to notice Poof was gone. Ned frequently comes home and passes out with the front door wide open - so the cat running away was absurdly plausible.  

Now Poof, myself and my boyfriend have a little house, where Poof can sit on the windowsill and be a happy, heavily loved fluffball. 
I've also reported Ned for animal cruelty for his dog. Wanted to kidnap the little mutt as well, but it wasn't possible. 

**TL;DR** Rule number one: don't be a douchebag.

Here's [my fluffy love monster](http://i.imgur.com/u63B5LQ.jpg), sitting like a gentleman on a car ride.

I crashed some scammers.,271,35,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1h6t92/xpost_from_pettyrevenge_i_crashed_some_scammers/,"Several years back I began to receive the scam emails from Nigeria. I'm sure you are familiar with these so I won't go into a great explanation. Normally, I can just ignore them, but these were coming to an email pertaining to a domain that I owned for my computer repair business.

It started with a few, and then grew to about 20 per day - every single day. It was irritating to get an email notification only to find out that it was one of these BS emails.

I thought...what to do, what to do...then I had an idea.

I went to Angelfire and created a free website with nothing more than a counter on it.

I shelled out to a command prompt and wrote a batch file that when executed erased boot.ini, nrldr, ntdetect.com then launched a browser which loaded the website I had created (I put a pause in it, silently recursing the windows directory just to make sure their PC made it to the website) then it would shut down the PC.

For those of you not in the 'know', this will prevent a computer from booting, stopping at a black screen displaying an error message. A good tech could have it back up and going with not much issue, but I was betting against that - after all, this is Nigeria.

I packaged the file into a password protected zip file and emailed it back to a few scammers stating that 'This was given to me by the bank, and contains my banking and credit card information. It is set to give a false virus warning to stop scammers, the password for the first file is &lt;password&gt;. Please do not steal my information, I trust you'.

Within 2 days, the counter on my website had went from 3 (where I tested it) to over 140.

I have YET to receive another email from scammers at this email address.

From what I understand, they hack each others email in hopes of stealing 'victims' from each other. I hope that the down-time I forced upon them was enough to allow for at least a few people to be educated about this scam.

1367884562.0,212,self.ProRevenge,1dtspb,Professor and class gets their revenge on a delusional art student during the final critique.,265,53,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1dtspb/professor_and_class_gets_their_revenge_on_a/,"So did anyone see the Art Critique freak out video?

http://youtu.be/wBqTng4c2iU

It might be faked but that sort of thing really does happen. I used to be an art student (Computer Graphics) at a stupid expensive art school and I've experienced a freak out much worse than that first hand. 

Art Critique story time if you want it:

Have you all seen the dove commercial? 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpaOjMXyJGk

So to sum that up, the women in that commercial describe themselves as uglier than they really are. The artists draws their description and they leave. Another person comes in and describes the same woman with more accurate detail, usually much prettier than the woman describing herself.

Well there was this girl in my first drawing class who had the opposite problem. She'd draw really well rendered self portraits of herself, much skinnier and better looking. Which is fine normally, but she also distorted major features like eyelashes (the drawing had big thick ones while she had none) and fuller lips (hers were very thin), she looked a lot more like a relative of the Honey Boo Boo family + red hair. Again, it's totally fine if that's how she wants to see herself, no one commented on it for a long time. But the problem with her, she would point out to many other girls ""your cheeks look a bit thin in your drawing, I think you should have drawn your jaw line softer"". Just underhanded and hypocritical remarks. The professor would point out that other people's drawings had less issues than she was pointing out. She kept contradicting him though. I'm still convinced that the prof decided to get his revenge on the final assignment.

The final would be a fully finished self portrait. If the class couldn’t tell who the portrait belonged to, it couldn’t get more than a C(it was 50% of our final grade). Over the class, her portraits had been becoming more and more distorted, not resembling her or anyone that could even be related to her. The final colored portraits were due and they were handed in a pile. The prof picked them up and placed them on the wall. Most of them were easily recognizable except for hers. It was a portrait that looked like Scarlett Johanson. The guy next to me said, “I didn’t know Scarlett Johanson was in the class”. I don’t think anyone honestly even knew it was Honey Boo Boo girl’s portrait. The features had warped so much from her last homework, it was sort of unexpected. So the prof asked, “who’s is this?”. Honey Boo Boo stood up with this shit eating grin to announce it was hers.

He opened the floor to critique and reminded us, for the first time ever, that our participation grade will be impacted based on our ability to critique everyone’s finals. Meaning we had to lay into her or watch our grades suffer. We had to say what he wanted to, but would get in trouble for.  It took the whole class verbally laying into her portrait for 30 minutes before she broke down, started lashing out at some of the more attractive girls in the classroom for putting so much pressure on her(for just existing apparently). Eventually several people started attacking her back, until one person called her fat and she lost it (objectively she was fat). She cried and cried but didn’t want to give up the spotlight. She just stood there sputtering and basking in all the negative attention. Sort of funny to note, the guys in the room backed off as soon as she started crying, I think the girls saw through her bullshit and kept up the defense. The professor just sat there with the best poker face I have ever seen in my life. The professor ended the last class early, since she wouldn't do the sensible thing and just leave. It sort of sucked since I didn't get a critique on my final but it was worth the show. She ended up getting a C in the class I think, despite her portraits all being really well rendered.

**TL;DR - 
Honey Boo Boo keeps drawing herself like a supermodel. She’s difficult with everyone in the class during critiques. Professor gets the class to critique her final self portrait as hard as she's been critiquing everyone else. She explodes when class predictably turns on her.**

They were commenting on her appearance, calling her a slut, basically typical mean girl comments. They were really going after her and a friend who was tried to defend her. Literally an entire thread of insults and hate. The girl who was posting most of the insults (we can call her ""Jess"") was a friend of mine until she did something similar to me.
After watching this barrage of hate unfold for about 2 days, yours truly decided to step in and try to end it. I was moving out of state in a few weeks anyways, so I really wasn't worried how i would be perceived by anyone in my town anyways so i really let all these girls know exactly what I thought of them.
Basically, I called everyone who insulted my friend out on their personality flaws. I went the extra mile with Jess however, telling her she would probably never do anything worthwhile with her life. I told her, ""You will probably end up staying in (my town) for the rest of your life, working the same or some similar crappy job (she was a server) because you don't bring any other value to society other than petty drama."" A little harsh, I know, but I didn't care. It needed to be said.
Fast forward to this weekend when I came to visit some friends. We decided to go out for dinner before we start the night time festivities. When we arrived at the diner, guess who is going to be our server this evening? The look of shame on her face was enough for me to know that karma does exist. I didn't say much to her, certainly nothing mean this time, but she was being very passive-aggressive towards me.

Not from the food server but instead a dismayed observer.
So I'm out to dinner with some friends. And one guy, a friend of a friend, is being a particular prick.
As a side note, he is known as a real penny pincher. A tight ass, so to speak. Always asking for drinks, asking for handouts. And it turns out that this guy has been rorting our country's (Australia) welfare system for years. I only recently found out.
So here we are, at the restaurant table, and he is being racist - talking about Hitler and using fake German accents in this Hungarian restaurant...in front of the friendly young Hungarian waitress...
He is complaining about the menu, and generally being rude to this poor waitress who is obviously new to the job (a backpacker) and just being nice, whilst no doubt earning very little and not being tipped much (we don't tip as much as people in the States)
So I tell him to stop being an asshole, but he won't listen.
He continues... we all, as a group, scold him for being a prick, but he continues.
Time passes, and later, the waitress brings his dinner which consisted of chicken schnitzel and chips. At this point, we are all happy because the food is great, but of course he then decides to complain and ask the poor waitress to put the chips back in the frier because ""they're not cooked enough"". And to get a new soda because ""it is diet, not regular"" (we sip the soda and all agree he is wrong).
I'd had enough. Pissed off at this guys lack of empathy, most likely due to the fact he has never worked in hospitality - in fact he doesn't work at all - he relies on welfare payouts from the government, I decide to seek revenge.
.... SO... As soon as I got home I wrote a long detailed submission to our welfare system 'dob-in' program. It is basically a website where you can anonymously dob in welfare cheats.
He's toast. I wrote everything I know about the guy, including his boasts about rorting money. I wrote his name, his address, his general M. O. (from what I've heard, etc).

1372263363.0,198,self.ProRevenge,1h467b,A slight... conflict... with an idiot teacher,309,111,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1h467b/a_slight_conflict_with_an_idiot_teacher/,"Alright, this story more or less comprises the last two years of my life.    
    
I'm currently a math/compsci (or possibly comp.sec.) major intending on going to a major university on a scholarship. As part of a rather poorly thought out and even more poorly executed plan to *""Improve Standards!""* I had to take junior and senior math from the new teacher. 
    
She was terrible.
    
You see, this particular teacher had absolutely no understanding of math, whatsoever. The school required her class (unofficially. The principal was an even bigger prick than her, but you can't in em all) junior year because of the ACT (you should have seen how scores tanked). This was bad, because beyond being an idiot, she was a self-righteous, proud, whiny bigot.
    
For example, she has a habit of trying to bully students who disagree with her into submission. (Strike one!)    
She also likes multiple choice tests. So do I. The problem is that her tests rarely have the correct answers as an option. (Strike two!)    
She also had no idea how to teach the math. A single simple example problem would take 45 minutes, or until a student figured out how to do it and solved it for her. Otherwise class was just trying different methods to solve a problem over and over again. She loved the phrase ""And that's how you *don't* solve this problem!"" (with a big cheesy grin). We heard that eight or ten times a class. (Strike three)
    
(Turkey)
    
Now, I took her class junior year and muddled through it, bored out of my mind, irritated because she would fail me on the same assignments that my friends had aced (I copied an assignment once just to see what the shift was. She usually dropped my grades by thirty or forty points on average.) I tutored the other students in the class, trying to help them pass, for which I got a detention and a stern talking to. (I also failed the assignment for ""cheating"")
    
**********
Senior year would be different.
**********
First semester of class, I did nothing but cause her pain. I'd gotten a guaranteed full ride from the aforementioned university, so I knew she couldn't touch me.
    
The time she spent trying to solve a problem, I'd solve it in fifteen seconds or so in my head, tell the guy behind me who would then write it down, and then proceed to make sarcastic remarks and making fun of her general stupidity to the other students. Eventually I'd get bored and sleep until the guy behind me woke me up and nodded, meaning that they'd finally solved the problem and I had been right. 
    
She got incredibly desperate towards the end, trying to expel me for insubordination, trying to make me repeat high school by failing me (please, I had eight math credits), to trying to bring the principal in to bully me into agreement.
    
Up until she tried to expel me, I was playing nice. She treated me like crap, I treat her like crap, we can both hate each other. Then this happened. I should note that my mother teaches ***math*** at a local university, and is second or third from the head of the department. About this time she gets involved and starts being an ""observer"", using this as an opportunity to shred the teacher's remaining reputation while we filled out letter after letter to the school board and I threw out via the internet and school board meetings the general incompetency of the teacher. I'm friends with a number of school board members.
    
By second semester, I'd had enough and dropped the class. She relaxed on everyone else, and found out she had been fired. It's hard to come back from that.
    
    
TL;DR: Idiot teacher tries to get pushy, I get her ass fired.
    
    
EDIT: I only managed to drop the class because I was friends with the school board. Many people couldn't drop her class, even though they had the credits and they didn't need it. A lot of people lost scholarships and took huge hits to their GPA due to this teacher's unfairness and bullying.

**THE STORY:** So my aunt's just gotten a new boyfriend, and it looks like he's *the one*. Problem is, he's just like my aunt: bitchy, self-centered(except when it comes to my aunt), and a devout Hindu who hates other religions. I didn't really care about how hateful they were against others because it didn't really affect me in any way.

That was before *it* happened.

Basically, my Christian friend and I were working on a project for our AP World History class. I invited him over to my house, thinking nothing could go wrong.

Boy, was I wrong.

Immediately after he got to the house, my aunt greeted me, and asked what the ""white trash"" was doing here. Throughout his stay, they cursed him in my native language, they stopped him and I from getting snacks, and made sure he felt altogether terrible during his stay.

Now, it got personal. And how perfect a time: they had just set the wedding date.

Over the next few weeks, I told my friends what I was planning to do, and invited one ""foreign""(as in, not Indian) friend over per week. I kept a recorder(not the instrument) in my pocket running at all times. Keep this up for a few weeks, and you've got yourself some amazing incriminating evidence.

Soon, it would be time to unveil my greatest(read: only) evil plan ever. Wedding week rolled around, and soon, it was time. I'd prepared a short paragraph, and then a video showing their wrongdoings.

My turn came to speak, I said my paragraph, and I showed the video to the *entire* family. The video started and ended, and as I saw their jaws drop lower and lower, my grin grew wider and wider. At the end, I maniacally laughed, and my parents took me home. I'm pretty sure they beat the shit outta me once we got home, but I don't really care for that part.

Anywho the next building we have to get is fairly large with three windows facing us one window on each side of the door. No ones pushing on our team so I decide to start it and ask for covering fire and run up to the side of the building (their were no guns shooting out of the windows at the time, this is important later)

So the doors on the far right side of the building I'm on the middle left, I go to clear and shoot the guy in the right window with my shotgun. I move on to the left one and see a kid crouched facing the other way. I shoot him and then a person in the corrner that I dident see shoots me in my plate Carrie with his rifle point blank (20ft engagement for 400fps) alright not too big of a deal, it happens to me a lot because I tend to scare a lot of people do they act on their instinct, I explane that is against the rule to shoot me so close with the rifle. He starts babbling on about how I can shoot people so close but he can't ect.. And how I didn't call my hits when I ran to the building (no one was even shooting when I ran) I tell him that I'll call the hit as long as he does.

He says somthing and turns like he's going to walk away, but in a split second he turns points his rifle at my face and sends 5 rd burst point blank directly to my face.

Then his friends who were a table away from us, started being dicks to my friends and I. So I let the owner know that I wish for him and his friends to never be allowed back.

He didn't say it directly to him, but to his friends and their were many witnesses.

Construction contractors took advantage of the situation going door to door offering their services. Contractors get money, everyone gets free repairs, why not? Whole neighborhoods signed on and work began.

My parents were getting their home repaired and after a time realized the amount they were quoted for was too high so they planned to break the contract and find someone else to do all the repairs AND replace all the shutters and window framing for the same price. While on the phone with the contractor, he tells them they're willing to to do all the extra work for free so my parents stay with the original contractors.

After many many months the work was done and the guys came to collect, except they didn't replace the shutters and window framing. My father withholds the money because they admit to lying about the extra work in order to keep the contract, but refuse to do it because they didn't write up the new contract for my dad to sign so they're not obligated to do it yet wanted our money. This devolved into arguments with them threatening to sue us.

A couple days later after discussing this with the family we have them over for a meeting and agree to pay them extra but discounted amount to do the shutters and framing. They come back and finish the work.

When the time came for them to receive their pay they visit the house and my mother gives them the check. They realize that the amount was for the original work without the additional pay as agreed. They get pissed. My mother snarkily replies to them that since they didn't sign a revised contract she was not obligated to pay them the extra amount. They left without much of a fight.

tl;dr Get it on paper.

I own and operate a delivery service delivery hot tubs, furniture, and pool tables. I've been doing about eleven years or so. Like any job, it has its ups and downs and more than a fair share of conflicts. There were conflicts frequently between me and the stores I delivered for, employees and assistants I've hired, and customers who've hired me through the years.


This is a tale of a bitch. A drugged out, chemically adled bitch.

  
It was four years ago, I was doing a pool table setup near St. Louis, followed by a hot tub delivery between St. Louis and the lakes. As per normal, I had to collect a considerable amount of money from these customers which had to be dropped off at the business that hired me at the Lake of the Ozarks. I finished my last job around 6:30 p.m. and arrived at the business to drop off my collections around 8 p.m.

The store, knowing how accomodating I was toward them, asked if I'd be interested in delivering a really light sofa to a town up the road. They told me it was ten miles away, turned out to be thirty, so I was a little irritated by the delay and it being in a fairly remote area near the lake, I ended up spending extra time trying to locate it after dark. I wasn't happy, considering the fact I still had a two hour drive ahead of me before arriving home.

I end up finding the place. I knock on the door and discover that I've delivered during dinner time for the people. I apologize for how long it took to find them and asked if they'd like the sofa deposited in the living room or the garage. The man tells me neither and informs me that it has to go down stairs in the sun room. He shows me the stairs at which point I inform him that the delivery was a first room of the house or garage delivery (a fact they were informed about before I left the store).

The man is hostile when I tell him this and says he isn't accepting the delivery unless I put it in the sun room. I inform him again that it is a garage or living room delivery, no stairs. I also inform him that it will never fit down the stairs no matter what. It is at this point that he leads me over to the side of his house and tells me that I'll have to carry it down the side or I can take it back to the store.

I'm used to this tactic and any other day it might have worked, but I made a lot of money off my first two deliveries and I wasn't making very much off the sofa delivery so I'm more than happy to take it back to the store.

The side of the hill he wanted me to carry sofa down in the dark was covered in rocks about the size of my head or bigger. An extremely dangerous endeavor I refuse to undertake. 

Here's where it gets ... bizarre. I had already taken the sofa off the truck in anticipation of carrying it into the living room or the garage and it is sitting in the driveway. He thinks I'm bluffing and tells me to take the sofa back to the store. I inform him that's not a problem, but he won't be able to pick it up or return it or exchange it until the delivery fee is paid. He's already told me he wasn't paying.

I reach down to grab the sofa and his wife, the woman who bought it, jumps on my back and starts clawing my face. She's raked my cheek and clawed some pretty deep furrows in the skin. In fact, I still have some faint scarring from these scratches even today. I shrug her off where she lands on the sofa, at which point, her husband threatens to kick my ass for assaulting his wife.

He gets in my face, cursing at me using every curse word combination he can think of and at this point, the red neck in me moves to the forefront of brain and I stand my ground and promise them that i will plant the next person to touch me in the ground. I'm pissed beyond being professional, but still, i represent the store in this delivery so I ""politely"" ask him to have his wife get off the soda. 

By the light of the street lamp, I can see that the woman is high as a freaking kite. Her eyes are glassy, her nose is red, and I can smell the pot on her and the wine she'd been drinking. She is out of it for the most part. He removes his wife from the sofa, and I reach down to grab the sofa again. I warn him to control his wife if he cares about her, and he calls me a few choice names in reply.

I mentioned that the sofa was really light, so I usually just pick this model up and throw it on my shoulder and carry it where it needs to go. This time was no different except for the crazy chick. I reached down to grab it again and the woman tried to jump on my back again much to the protest of her husband. I had anticipated her doing this again and quickly snatched the sofa the driveway and quick-stepped over to the truck. She missed me completely and landed face first on the pavement fucking up her grill horribly. I mean she messed herself up horribly. She didn't stop her self with her hands before she hit. She just plowed into the pavement like she was leaping into a pool.

The man gets pissed and takes a swing at me. I step back from him and move toward the front of my truck. I do this two more times with his swings going wide each time. I didn't want to fight if I could help it, so I just kept backing out of range and in doing so, I was stepping into frame for the driving cam i used to have in the cab of my truck. He tried hitting me about six more times until his wife's crying forced him to abandon his attempt at assault.

I secured the sofa why he tended to his wife. I was parked on the street because his driveway was pretty steep and I had a hot tub trailer attached. He told me I better not try using his driveway to turn around or he'd drag me out of my truck and beat my ass. I inform him that the sofa, because of the late hour will be taken back to my shop and would not be released until to the store or him until the delivery fee was paid.

He told me he'd be filing assault charges against me for what I did to his wife. I showed him my camera and said please do, because I had it on film. (I didn't. Realized on the ride home that the camera hadn't been on.)

As i was backing up the street (because they lived on a dead end street), my trailer jack-knifed into a dead snag. After pulling forward and back several times, I was able to back it up the hill and around the curve into the regular street again. It was at this point that I noticed that part of one of the limbs in the dead snagged had broken lose and landed on the shoulder of the road, which gave me an idea. i back the trailer into the dead snag a couple of times and the top of the tree broke off and blocked about two thirds of the street. I got out and with a little grunting and grubbing, I was able to pull the tree top across the street enough to block their exiting their block. It cost me a tail-light on the trailer but it was worth it.

The sweet justice in this was that my shop that I was storing the sofa in was two hours away in Springfield. When they finally contacted the store and I explained everything to them, the store backed me up and returned their money minus the money for the two hour delivery I charged for taking it to Springfield with me.

Well, that was my tale of red-neck revenge. Hope you liked it.

During my off time, I got a phone call from a guy I knew a few years earlier. Kind of a good-for-nothing, but generally harmless. He told me he'd started a painting business, and had a huge contract, and could use any help he could get, fast, and knew I was off and might want some work. He was based out of a city about 70 miles away, so he said I could stay with him if I wanted, he's got room. So I took him up on it.

I get there, and the guy doesn't have a truck, and asks if we can use mine. His is ""in the shop"" - total bs, he didn't even have one, but I didn't know that yet.

We go to the first house to paint(he really did have a contract to paint several houses), and he points me to where he'd like me to start. I have painting experience and he knows it, so I don't need a lot of supervision. But I don't notice him doing anything at all. Just going to the bathroom every 15 minutes or so.

Well it becomes obvious pretty fast, guy's got himself a coke problem. To the point where he can't do any work, just gotta inhale powder all day. Now I don't begrudge a man his substances, coke, weed, acid, alcohol, whatever, as long as you're meeting your responsibilities, and not dragging down others around you.

Over the next couple of weeks he hired a couple more people who came and went, and didn't get paid for their short stints. But both those people were, to be fair, absolutely terrible, and caused more damage than they were worth, so not paying them was reasonable.

Over those couple of weeks, when he'd get good and high, he'd get talkative(as blow tends to do to a person), and he'd let slip how he can't have any utilities in his name, cause he owes them all hundreds or even thousands of dollars - phone, internet, electricity, water, gas, even car insurance somehow - the works. He's got a Good Girl Gina at home, who's pretty sick of this shit, but is too nice and trying to fix him instead of helping herself. So everything's in her name.

So a couple of weeks go by, I do my work impeccably every day, and it's time to get paid. There's no money to pay me. He's making excuses about how he didn't get some money the customer had promised, like I'm too stupid to see where the money really went. Anyway, I had nothing else to do, so I worked another week, listening to his promises that I'd be paid the next friday(the end of 3 weeks or work). Sure enough, friday came and there's no money to pay me(but there's been blow every day for 3 weeks now).

So, I leave. I'm not working for free. And for revenge on getting 3 weeks of work out of me for free, I sent an anonymous letter to every utility he owed money to, telling them where to find him. He immediately had collectors on his doorstep, filing summonses against him, for thousands of dollars. Plus, with me not doing any work, the customers went from being impatient with how slowly work was being done, to firing him for breach of contract. Good Girl Gina had enough and dumped him.

He had to leave town pretty much immediately. He had no vehicle either, so packed a bag and hitch hiked out of town. Last I heard, he was in and out of rehab, still a junkie(about 10 years later), and still going from town to town burning bridges and only concerned about his next high.",,False,,t5_2vjvl,1370122806.0,,,True,t3_1fhfs3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1fhfs3/spend_my_paycheque_on_blow_will_you_xpost_from/,

As any normal person, I dealt with some bullying coming through elementary and middle school. In high school this intensified as I was relatively new to the area. 

I remember one upperclassmen, Kyle, made it his duty to torment me. He would trip me in the hallway, tease me, and he even defaced my posters when I ran for student council. 

This bullying culminated one day when he threatened me with a BB gun. He stupidly brought it to school and busied himself with shooting the walls in one of the regular student hang outs. At the time I had thought nothing of it. Eventually he began aiming the gun at students and firing so BB's would bounce of the walls and hit them. Soon enough he targeted me. 

I was not having it that day. I had just lost the election and I placed my student council loss on him and his upperclassmen friends. I asked him to stop but he continued to fire BB's near my legs. Things escalated quickly as I literally stood up to him. One of my friend's tried to pull me back saying, ""He's just an asshole man, let's just go."" I couldn't deal. I *told* him to stop. He paused for a moment then aimed the gun at my face. He had a female friend beside him. She tried to settle him down and pleaded with him to stop, ""He didn't do anything Kyle, stop it."" 

I remember his smug face in detail as he held that BB gun on me. He asked me, ""Why don't you make me?"" I had no good response. I thought to myself, ""You messed up man, here was your moment to stand up to him and you've got nothing."" At the last second, I said, ""Why don't you shoot me then pussy?"" He smiled as a I stood there and raised the BB gun back on me. I didn't even think about moving. Then, *nothing*. He chickened out. His female companion got up to leave and he followed. I had won this round. 

**The Revenge**

It was a few weeks on when my Dad &amp; I pulled into our local gas station to fuel up. Dad twisted off the fuel cap, grabbed the pump handle, and squeezed to begin filling but nothing came-out (these were days when we transitioned from post-pay to pre-pay). Then I heard a familiar voice over the gas station PA system, ""Hey guys, that's not how it works anymore, you have to come in."" This was said in perhaps the smuggest tone I have ever heard in my life so far. As we walk in, I see that it is Kyle and I immediately formulated a plan. 

That night I went to a 24/7 Walmart and bought spray paint and gloves with some cash. I don't even know why they let that slide. I was still under 18 at the time. I dressed in a black outfit when I got home and slinked over to the gas station. It was closed. All over the clean white paint of the building I wrote Kyle's name. Not just his first name, his full name. First, middle, and last. I wrote it on the front of the building, the back of the building, and the sides. I wrote it in cursive and in regular script. *It was beautiful*. I felt some regret about it when I had got home but I stopped worrying when I thought of who I retaliated against. 

**The Conclusion**

Kyle lost his job. We were even. He didn't even bother me anymore. I don't think he ever suspected me. A couple days later my spray paint art was covered with some whitewash. 

**Epilogue**

Things got better as high school went on. I made a bunch of friends and was elected to student council the next year. I guess you need to prove your mettle when you move to a small town. 

**Edit: In the future, I will be mindful of others when plotting revenge. In the end I think my act caused very little collateral damage. A gallon of white exterior paint costs ~20$. I'd just hope that they got Kyle to paint over my handiwork himself before they let him go.** ",,False,,t5_2vjvl,1375776901.0,,,True,t3_1io13z,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1io13z/high_school_shenanigans/,

I was in HS and was going with some close girlfriends to a very close guy friends house for New Years.

Needless to say, lots of drinks, and for a 110lb HS kid a whole bottle of Jack put me out. My then, very close male friend 'Ryan' told me I could pass out in his room.  All was good as 'Ryan' had always been straight with me, or so I thought. So, I went into his room alone, and closed the door. I was enveloped with quiet and darkness, the perfect mix to sleep off the over consumption of alcohol.

Skip ahead an undetermined amount of hours. I start come around to the sound of our mutual friend 'Cory' yelling through the door. ""Dude, don't do this. You know this is fucked up. Just stop, you know it's wrong"". I look up to see what I thought was a close friend, 'Ryan'. I freaked, and pushed him off. I tried to pretend it never happened, like I do all my problems.

A few weeks later I find out that 'Ryan' really liked me, and it wasn't just taking advantage of a drunk girl thing for him. That is when I got my plan for revenge, however I never would have thought it would be so great.

'Ryan' actually had the nerve to ask me out, I said yes. I went out with him, I laughed at his jokes. My friends wondered wtf I was doing, I never told any of them that it was all in my plan. 

One day I heard from 'Cory's' Girlfriend (who was my best friend) that 'Ryan' had told him he was in love with me. That was my que. The next night me and 'Ryan' had plans to go out and I had my ultimate revenge ready.

'Ryan' shows up, to go out. I say nothing as I get into the car. In the pause he starts crying, and says his mom just found out she has 6 months to live, that her cancer was far more advanced then they thought. I think to myself, no fucking way this could play out any better. So I look him in the face, with no emotion, and tell him ""I never even liked you, we're done"".

I figured this would cause at most some minor HS heartbreak and several months of pain. It wasn't until 15 yrs later that I seen how deep I had cut him. We ended up working at the same place, and I came to find out he married a girl, that looks like me, talks like me and has my same name. Normally the name thing wouldn't be a big deal if I had a name like Amanda or Brittney, but I have a ver unusual name.

Teacher was a pain in the ass.  She was about 70, maybe 80, her marriage had failed, she began drinking immediately after class and was hungover most days.  On top of it all, she would lower your grade by a full letter if your phone range in class.  I tried to explain to her that doing so was probably illegal but she didn't seem to understand.  Other actions included doing an example problem that took over 2 hours and then realizing that she did the wrong one.  She would then say ""oh well, read the book, it's on the test anyways"" and not know how to help us when we asked questions about it.  If someone was talking in class she would yell over them to ""SHUT THE HELL UP!"" which was actually kinda funny the first time, but she was way too rude about it.  After a while, if anyone asked a question that she didn't feel like answering, she would insult the student with something like ""well, they always say there are no stupid questions, but I guess you just proved everyone wrong...""  and continue on with whatever she was doing.  I managed to get a high B in the class, which was apparently the only grade above a C that she gave that year, mostly because we were allowed to use a full 8 x 11 piece of paper to write notes on for the final, and I managed to fit every formula in the book on that thing.

For Physics 2, all 13 of these guys were in her class.  There was also one other student.  The ""other"" student got a C, and EVERYONE else flunked the class.

The students all confronted her in her office, offering her to make it right and let them retake the final, with proper instruction and another teacher to grade the work, so that they could fix their grades.  She went on what we think was a drunken yelling spree.

Petitions were signed, lawyers were contacted, and one guy's dad was friends with the president of the school (and also a lawyer as well).  The president confronted the teacher.  Don't know exactly how that meeting went, as it was private, but she didn't budge and she doesn't work there anymore.  I'm pretty sure she didn't even get retirement.

She has always had it out for me for as long as I can remember... I have two younger siblings (17 f and 15 m) who she tolerates and for the most part gets along with. 
For example, she used to yell at me for going in the car with my mom to pick her up from places when she was in middle school/high school, on vacations with my cousins we all slept in the same bed and she would pinch me to the point of tears and whisper cruel things to me (she was around 15-17), when I was about 12 she threw scissors at me for being on the computer and not getting off when she wanted....I could go on forever but these are a few of the more minor things she's done.

She has no remorse and cares only about herself and things that will benefit her, regardless of who she hurts. She is extremely territorial as well. After doing a bit of growing up I thought we were past this and able to tolerate each other, but tonight proved otherwise.

I got a text from my younger sister telling me that my older sister was yelling and screaming that I had taken things from her room while she was away for the night.. I raced home (knowing what she is capable of in this type of mood) to find her screaming ""YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID F*** YOU"" etc...  She couldnt tell me exactly what i took from her but she knew *something* was missing...

                In third grade I went to work with my father for the day. After work he took me over to his friends restaurant in the seaport and we hung out there for a bit. I remember him giving me a little bit of money and his friends girlfriend (now wife) took  me into the south street seaport mall where I picked out the cutest, softest stuffed animal i could find. We went back into the restaurant and started brainstorming names.. We finally decided on Jereca.... a combination of  my name, her name and the waitresses name (who I always thought was the coolest girl) From then on, Jereca pretty much became my best friend in a way... He always provided me with comfort.. So when i walked in to see her do **that** over something that she was imagining killed me... 

I don't know what to do with myself..I'm hurt, angry and sad about this whole situation... Any questions, comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated..

I have been reading through quite a few of these /ProRevenge stories today and I must say I am inspired to share.

I am going to flip a few names for anonymity and to avoid further humiliation of my former roommate.

A few years back shortly after high school I acquired my first apartment living with two room mates. Both of them I had considered close enough friends to occupy a space with. Little did I know that living with people is incredibly complex due to the absolute lack of fucks given during your early 20's. Shortly I will get to one of the highlights of this hellish rollercoaster into eviction.

Room mate Brett had some sort of sick fascination with eating all of my food. Didn't matter what it was or who it belonged to...He would demolish it. Namely...My Reese's Puffs.

I had tried multiple methods of reasoning with him. Marking my name on the items, hiding them, even heated confrontation. He persisted and it was time to extract vengeance.

A little background on my situation in order to provide clarity to the story.
I had been convicted of a crime and ended up having to endure a shit load of community service hours working on an animal ranch owned by a non profit organization that rescued abandoned animals. There was a plethora of random ass animals ranging from Peacocks to Potbelly Pigs that took residence within this sanctuary. All of them less than desirable to work with and clean up after. But none of them could exceed the absolute nightmare cleverly disguised as a pack of Llama's. These were mean little bastards who would find any way to torment you. Be it spitting, shitting, chasing, staring, or shouting. They had it out for me from the get go. FUN fact that most would not know is that Llamas like to all congregate and shit in one giant pile...This is like some form of sacred place for them and they DO NOT like it being disturbed. None the less I was responsible for hauling shovel after shovel of the precious little nuggets into large containers and hauling them off the property.

Here is where it gets interesting...I had this sort of epiphany as I dug the shovel into the almighty giant pile of Llama love. It had an interesting pellet shape and was relatively light and airy. It also had different shades of browns ranging from a creamy peanut butter color to an earthy dark chocolate tone.

 It looked....A LOT like Reese's Puffs.

There was no time to waste and no hesitation. The son of a bitch had just devoured the rest of my cereal and it was time to give him a lesson in apartment living. I bought a brand new box on the way home and replaced the contents of the bag with Llama shit that I had collected earlier that day in a Ziploc freezer bag. Even thought I would purchase a chip clip and neatly roll it closed as if I had already enjoyed my morning bowl before placing it back on the top of the fridge. The trap was set...

He rolled out of bed at the usual time around 10pm and enjoyed a quick wake and bake before he gorged himself on whatever delicious treats he could get his hands on. 

The sound of his barefeet on the kitchen floor. I awaited anxiously in my bedroom awaiting the sound of the plastic cereal bag unraveling. He was going for it! I heard the fridge open for some milk and the drawer open for a spoon! I heard him step over to the couch and sit down... Complete silence before the almighty crunch crunch of victory echoed through the apartment.

And then... He turned the TV on? 

And there was another crunch crunch....

then chuckling....

WTF?

How can you not realize you are eating Llama SHIT!?

I told him on the 30th day of our eviction.....

TLDR: Fooled my shithead roommate into eating Llama shit.

After a mutual ""friend"" of a number of my friends ended up knowingly and with malice screwed a couple of us out of 1000$ each, we decided it was time mount a pay back campaign.

Not sure if it is still an option, but remember how the little magazine subsciption inserts that always fell out used to say ""bill me later"" next to the credit card info? Well we spread out a individually amassed and filled out a pile of the raunchiest magazines we could find, then moved onto all the kid mags we could find, then on and on till we had a massive pile that he would have to slowly deal with for years to come. 

Not satisfied yet, we moved onto to browsing the internet for as many sign ups as we could find starting with a NAMBLA mailing list, NA, AA, and various organ failure support groups akin to fight club, and so on... the list goes on and on... all calling his phone to remind him of the next meeting.

Second, some of my memories of this event is a bit hazy, if there is any questions about how things were I'll try to explain them.

The entire event took place in a month, but my revenge happened over a weekend. This was in the autum of 09, I think.
I was born 95 and my brother 94. But since he had skipped a year in elementary school to be with his friends, we were in the same age group altough we went to the same school we never were the same class.




It all began in high-school. Anyhow, facebook had made its great entrance among minors so both of us had facebook accounts. 

At that time I was a social recluse, a anxious anime nerd who had a few friends and a perfect target for practical jokes, which my brother knew. Thus I was ""faceraped"" (for those of you who are unfamiliar with facerapes it's when someone posts statuses on another persons account, its often quite silly and obvious).

This was not much of a big deal, I ""faceraped"" him back so to teach him a lesson, but he didn't learn much from it as I found myself ""faceraped"" once again.

This was enough I thought. Time to end this silliness, but only how?
That's when Death Note makes its appearance. It's an anime, in great simplification, about two people locked in a battle of wits. 

As I watched it, all became clear for me. I now knew how I was going to get my revenge. I was going to out wit him so greatly that he would not dare to mess with my facebook again.

The first step in the plan was to get access to my brothers facebook account, so I was in need of his e-mail and his password. I got the perfect opportunity for this when we, one friday, were at our grandparents place, he wanted to check his facebook on their computer so I simply axelsurfed his password, easy.

His e-mail would need some wit. I asked him if he could help me install the e-mail feature in my iPod, after some arguing I got him to use his e-mail to unlock it (apparently my e-mail ""didn't work"")

Now for the detailes. I asked my brother for a good movie to download, he happily adviced me to se the movie X and he also included the websites Y where I could download it. Now I had everything I needed.

As soon as I were alone I logged into his facebook form my ipod, good thing they had WiFi there. There I wrote something like this:

""Hello Monsieur [last name]. Thank you for downloading movie X from website Y. I am now in full controll of your computer.

Love from France.""

This was not the actual message but I made some deliberate spelling and grammar mistakes to make the frenchman more realistic.

After I wrote this on my iPod, I logged him out and logged into facebook with my own account. I scrolled down to my own message, made a poorly acted chuckle and showed it to my brother.

Needles to say he was freaked out.

He instantly went onto the computer and deleted the message, sadly. The good thing was that he didn't change the password, he decided that he would do that when we came home.

Since I still could acces his account I kept my poor pokerface and let a half hour go by. Then I wrote something like this:

""Monsieur [last name] why would you remove my last message? I just want to get along! You really hurt my feelings, do you really have to be this mean?""

Waited and showed him. He got stressed and deleted the message and told our mom that we should go home asap. Two birds with one stone.

Once at home my brother immediately changed the password, which I had feared.

This was his great misstake, the password he now had was quite strange, so strange that he wrote it on a paper to remember it, a paper I definatly could take a peek at.

My brother searched for viruses, defragmented the computer and other stuff as well as he fiddled with his account. I locked myself inside my room, this was ordinary practice for me and my family allowed a teenager have that privacy.

In my room I could barely contain my excitement. I wasted no time to create a fake frenchman. The name of the man would obviously be Jaquille (there's not a single more french name then that!) I then checked for normal surnames. I decided with Dubois, the third most normal surname, in case my brother would search for this man. Then I looked for pictures of french men, as usually I took several steps to make him more realistic.

Meanwhile some of my brothers classmates had picked up what was happening to my brother and asked things like:

""Hey, frenchy, you there?"" on my brothers profile. I was quite close to dying in my attempts to not tell anyone who the frenchman really were.

Later that night I snuck into my brothers room and got the password, this was when the turd would hit the fan. I changed his entire profile, where Jaquille lived, where he went to school, changed his profile picture and so on. Oh, and Jaquille was furious:

""Mr [last name] I have had enought of you! Do you really think that defragmenting, searching for viruses and changing the password will stop me?! I am greatly insulted by you! I only sought to be your friend, and you treat me like this! You really ought to be ashamed of yourself!

No love 
- Jaquille Dubois""

I also replied to his classmates, to their great joy.

Forward to the morning and all hell broke loose. My brother when compleatly nuts on his computer, he changed admin, the passwords to the profiles, deleted all his movies anything to get rid of Jaquille, which I mocked him for publicly.

This went on the entire day, he made somewhat desperat attempts to get rid of Jaquille, and got his attempts ridiculed publicly. Luckily he didn't try to change his password again, I guess he thought Jaquille would found it out anyway.

Next day, Sunday, was when the bubble would pop. I had to pop it. My brother had decided to reformat his computer, he would lose everything on it. I thought it would no longer be just about revenge then.

I revealed myself on my brothers account, to everyones joy.

My family all burst out laughing when I exposed the truth, even my brother was quite amused by it.

But the greatest thing was how I was received by my school on the monday. People whom I didn't even know shouted encouraging things me, which was quite of the contrast to my usual day in school. 

The legacy of Jaquille still lives on. From that monday no one dared to mess with me and whenever my brother threatens to do something to me I calmly reminds him of ""The frenchman""",,False,,t5_2vjvl,False,,,True,t3_1j5q4k,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1j5q4k/a_brother_a_wall_of_text_death_note_facebook_a/,

He would do the most underhanded shit, talk behind everyone's back. Hit on our girlfriends, never buy a round of drinks. Just a typical dirtbag, but ofcourse yea we smoked out with him. Go figure. Anyway heres the revenge story:

He took allot of pride in his appearance, too much cologne, and his parents always gave him money so he could buy fresh gear. All of us were having a simple conversation that turned to talking about teeth whitener. 

He started cracking way too many cold jokes about me and my roommates bad breath in front of these ladies that we just met. 

That night, girls ditch us because of his shit talk about some other stuff you just dont say to woman you are interested in,  a total cockblock. It was time for revenge.

This what we did. 
One night that he was confirmed out of his apartment,
we smashed the back window of his apartment one night. 

He told us about it, and that he thinks someone tried breaking into his place but nothing was stolen. He was a bit paranoid and talking all this shit about how he has a gun and will shoot a motherf'r. Etc. He is like 90 pounds wet, no muscles. 

The seed was planted. About a week later, he tells us that he went his mailbox and there was an envelope in his box with just a picture of a toothbrush and with magic marker ""Remember the date: 5/17/97"" .
Please Note I changed the date, it was a date in the future 2 weeks, basically.""  

He made a big deal about this at parties and stuff when we would start a conversation during a smokeout session about weird events, or sightings. 

He would get thrilled to tell everyone this story.

A week later, we put another two pictures in his mailbox: it was a pic of his bathroom, with his toothbrush clearly seen hanging there. 

The next pic is the toothbrush handle hanging out the rear end of someone's very hairy buttcheeks.  

Yes, for two weeks straight we would hang with him: play video games or whatever.. go off and take a piss. Shove his toothbrush up our asses. He never found out who did it. Nor did he ever ask.

During a smokeout session, we brought up our favorite conversation weird things that we seen, heard, etc. It's his turn to speak up... since he is not saying anything. So we ask him if he has anything to contribute to the conversation? He's like ""Naa, man I ain't got nothing.""  
giggles, all around. My friend almost lost his shit laughing.. but blamed it on the weed.

Long story short, the estate agents didn't own one of the fridges, the seven tenants of the house just 'sold' it on to the next set of tenants for £50 each year, and this year the 7 welsh lads moving in flat out refused to pay.

Since making the post, one of my housemates heard them talking about 'scoring a free fridge', so that confirmed my suspicion they were just calling our bluff and trying to get it for free, rather than just not caring..


I *tried* to donate it somewhere, no one offered to take it from Gumtree before we left, and the local places either charged £20 or so collection fee, wouldn't take an old fridge, or would only take it if *I* could get it to the place, and the problem in the first place was that I had no way of moving it myself.

So sadly, no one benefited from a fridge, however I have hopefully made sure the new tenants can use it as nothing but decor.

Based on the suggestions in my original thread, the day I left I turned everything off and cleaned it all out nice and neatly. Then took absolutely everything that could be removed from it. The fridge/freezer now has no shelves in the main part or the door.

Because they could still just use it to refrigerate beer or something I slit the rubber band sealing thing in a dozen or so places, I have no idea if it'll do anything, but fingers crossed it'll make it leak cold constantly.

The girl who moved in first out of us said it was still full of junk when she moved in, which means the estate agents don't look inside, which is great, because I lined both doors with half a tube of superglue that we'd used to fix a chair.

Finally, even though people said it would be too easy to fix, I cut the power cord almost completely through, left a little wiring still attached, right up near the base of the fridge, hopefully they won't even notice until they manage to pry open the door.


TL:DR

* New Tenants refused to pay for a fridge as per everyone else had done; also found out they were in fact calling our bluff and expecting to get it for free.
* Cut the power cable near the base, it's not noticeable and is still attached, but should burn out after a little use.
* Removed all the shelves and containery things inside, there is nothing but the floor of the fridge and freezer compartment to put stuff on
* Cut the rubber seal on the door all over the place.
* Superglued the door shut.

So this is something i do whenever i get one of those ""im out of town, my assistant is going to send you a check/money order"" scams.

If you dont know how this scam works, they send you a fraudulent check or money order and you deposit into your bank hoping that you will give them the item that day, when it usually takes a bank a few days to catch that its fraudulent.

I accept that i will take the check/money order. and have them send it to a certain address (see images for address). 9/10 times they send it, and ive been contacted by the FBI looking for more information.

Because it was my lunch, i was strapped for time.  I was speeding (not excessively) on the freeway, about 10 MPH over and right as I am passing a big rig, he **(the asshole, not the big rig)** cuts me off doing 5 MPH under the speed limit. 

He proceeds to tap his brakes just to be an asshole so I go around him and get in front of him.  Doing this somehow upset the man and he decided to follow me.  Me, being the nice guy that I am, waited until we were on the junction between two freeways to break check him to the point where he had to skid to stop in time.  Me and my girlfriend let out a chuckle and continued to go to her work.

She works at a restaurant right across from the mall in our town.  So not wanting this crazy to know where she works; I take her to the closest spot near her work and tell her to walk straight across the 6 lane intersection and I will ditch this dude.  

She does this, and at this point he caught up to me, and rolls down his window yelling at me trying to get me to get out of my car.  I simply don't have time for this fuck-head so I plan to lose him through the city (my hometown) before heading back onto the freeway and going back to work.

Tommy was in a bar in the United States about 10 years ago to watch a college football game with a bunch of business partners. The bar was very crowded and while outside smoking, a fight broke out nearby. The overzealous bouncers started tossing people around and Tommy, who was just standing there innocently, got tossed. Literally tossed. He fell over a railing, onto concrete about 6 feet down. He gashed his face, broke his hand, and when he tried to get back in to get his possessions, was told to fuck off before he was arrested. His friend tried to get his jacket from their table inside, but it was gone. I don't know if he pursued legal/police action, but I assume he did and was unsuccessful. Otherwise the following tale would not have occurred.

Fast forward 3 years. Hand/face healed (after a few EXPENSIVE surgeries) and new jacket purchased, but Tommy still harbors a burning desire for revenge deep inside. He finds out he will be going back to the area for business (he lived elsewhere). Just so happens that the Super Bowl will be occurring this same weekend. 

So Tommy starts to plan. And what he comes up with is perfect. On Super Bowl Sunday, following a week of successful business, he shows up at the bar. It is near the end of the first half, game very close, with a bag containing his supplies at his side. Everyone is captivated by the intensity of the game and he slinks off to the mens room. It's a ghost town. Inside, he quickly dons dish gloves and starts plugging up the sinks and overflowing them. He shoves tennis balls inside the toilets and jams them all the way inside and flushes them to overflow as well. I am not exactly sure the extent of work that went on beyond this, but he did something to make the water flow continuously and was difficult to stop. Soon there is an overflow of watery piss/shit dumping onto the floors. Work complete, he exits the bathroom and takes up a vantage point nearby. 

Halftime whistle blows and everyone rushes for the bathroom with the intensity of Adrian Peterson blasting through tackles. Bladders are full and must be emptied. He could only speculate on what occurred inside, but its quite apparent that it's cluster fuck. Guys come running out, shoes wet and squishing, flagging down staff/looking for other places to piss. There are staff running around trying to stop the overflows and get the toilets operational, WHILE still serving the packed bar, but it is too late. The scene becomes more chaotic and Tommy, proud and satisfied with himself, slinks away. 

I believe they had to shut down the bar for the night after that. There was a lot of water damage and revenue lost. I don't know if there is a moral to this story, maybe keep your dogs on a leash, or never callously fuck over a paying patron. I do know that Tommy is a cold, calculating mother fucker and he takes great pride in this. Either way, I know who I am consulting if I ever need to exact revenge.

I decided this had some weight so ill put it here first but like there later on. This happened to me only this week so its nice and fresh in my mind. 

**Backstory:** In need of work i asked around to my friends and then found out through a good friend of a mine that there was a place opening up ideal location and industry for me. I had lengthy chats with the owner of this new franchise that was opening up.  I had more business experience than him so i brought them up to speed and went above and beyond helping him out before i was even employed by them as long as i was guaranteed a job. This was a franchise job that was based around commissions i would earn based on clients i would pull in. The job was supposed to start at the beginning of June. 

I had other commitments but i started shuffling all of them to fit around this job because at least situation wise it was perfect even if the wage was average. June comes around and im still waiting to hear from the owner. **Nothing**. I chase him up and get told the franchise is not going ahead. 

3 days later its suddenly going ahead again and so its all stations go from the end of July. Fair enough delays can happen with new businesses. Owner is worried about leaving his high paying job to take over secondary job in the franchise to help out as i would be only employee so i help out and reach out to friends with same skill set as myself so they can take his position and he gets to keep his high paying job. Lets call owner D for douche and my friends G1 and G2. 

**Current story:** Myself and G1 get hired (no contract yet, important) to start advertising and walking around with flyers to advertise the new franchise. G1 quits their other job because of assurances of shifts/money/work with the franchise. During this advertising we get asked by the local council to move on as its illegal under those laws to do what we were doing but with a permit it would be legal. Pass this onto D and move on from the area. 

G2 was interviewed and promised a job and work that myself and G1 were already doing. They were waiting on schedules and contracts to start but D was delaying and not answering phone calls. 

After the first venture to advertise i find out from G1 that D has decided to replace her (3 years of study and 4 years of experience) with a 18 year old girl (3 weeks study and no experience) and D has also been ducking my calls about this and the council. This being a job that G1 had left her only source of income for that fell totally down because D likes young **dumb** things (G1 was young and attractive but smart). Activate anger stage 1. 

G2 was not contacted at all for weeks until the same afternoon that G1 was let go. Telling her after guaranteeing a job, that she would not be able to work for them after all and apparently D was relying on me to fill shifts with the young dumb thing. All of this he was doing behind my back after i had gone out of my way so many times to help him including getting these girls on board and us putting many things on hold to help him. Anger stage 2.

Before i had found out what he had done to G1 and G2 D had tried to get me to do the exact same thing with the flyers in a close region. I had protested as i had already been asked to leave the area before and D responded with 
&gt; whats the worst they could do? send me a letter?

He was pushing very hard so i went and looked up the law. I found out going back there especially after a warning i could be fined $5000 if not be criminally prosecuted. I told D of this and he attempted to force me to still do this work but of course would not do it himself. Kaioken x10

Finally, i find out about all above situations and then also notice that he has been out working for his franchise. D, knowing im supporting a sick partner and struggling financially and even after going out of my way for months to help his business out and him as an individual (with no pay) he had decided to take every shift where a client could sign up and get commission which of course went straight into his pocket when he was already well off from his other job and refused to let me on board to do these other shifts. (cutting me out of hundreds of dollars) Super Saiyan.

So for the revenge. 

* With the work he had tried to force me into i have all the copies of D's marketing materials he would use to encourage business for the future weeks.  Instead of blasting him about his unprofessional ism and general doucheyness i decided to email him i got a better job with better benefits and that i would be passing all marketing material onto G1 so she could keep encouraging business for him. (of course i 'dont know' at this stage he's been a horrible douche to G1 and go rid of her) He's faced with the choice of either having to personally confront her face to face after being a major dick to her or he looses thousands of dollars of marketing flyers and material. 

* I am a member of a close knit community within my industry and immediately put out an APB that this owner was a dick and noone should work for him in any fashion and should in fact encourage others to stay away from him. (community is well respected and known within industry) Also should put out a notice to any potential clients or recent sign ups that they are likely to get messed around and treated poorly by said owner despite staffs best intentions. Last thing you need right as your trying to get a franchise off the ground end to even break even (which i do know D was having trouble doing)

* My favorite part of the revenge. The friend i heard about this job from attends the same religious community that D does. I took great satisfaction in informing this friend of every single one of D's antics and attitude including screencaps of him encouraging me to perform illegal activities and him not caring about me being fined etc. This friend is highly respected within his religious community and took it upon himself to inform the 'elders' of the community of how D is not acting within any of the guidelines of the community and will be severely reprimanded, if not excommunicated. This is also his entire network of personal friends who now get to find out just how poorly he treats those he would be responsible for. 

I would i have liked to do more but at least for now it will suffice.

TL:DR Franchise owner fucks me and my friends around after hours of unpaid work and so i go out of my way to ruin his reputation within the industry as well as within his personal reputation within his church community.",,False,,t5_2vjvl,1373741568.0,,,True,t3_1i8b3g,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1i8b3g/mess_with_myself_or_my_friends_and_i_will_ruin/,

***Tl;dr.*** *Bitch threw bleach on my clothes in the dryer and she got what was coming to her.*

I joined the Air Force in 2010 and went to my first duty station in 2011. I was stationed at Osan Air Base. Anyway, between joining and getting to Osan, Tech Schoolers usually spend much more on nice things then they probably should. I, too, fell into this trap. I had been poor for the last few years, so having a steady income was great. I purchased neat shirts with a bunch of Air Force and Career Field regalia on it.

Well I settled in nicely to my first duty station, made some friends and even had a girlfriend. Things were pretty good. Girls, sometimes very catty, end up in petty disputes. My girlfriend was not immune to this. This girl, we'll call her **B**, was passively fighting with my girlfriend **L**.

One day, someone stole **B**'s fleece jacket out of the dryer while she was away from her laundry. This wasn't uncommon; people left their laundry in the community laundry room and accomplished errands on their day off. Unfortunately, because of the fighting between my **L** and **B**, my girlfriend was probably first to be blamed.

I can attest that she never had her fleece because, 1) she had her own, and 2) I never saw a third fleece around either my room or hers.

Anyway, sometime in the early spring of 2012, **B** decided to get back at **L** for [not] stealing her fleece jacket. **L** decided to get some of my laundry done and because she was a night shift worker she did her laundry overnight. Like a great girlfriend, she threw in some of my things too, including my uniforms and pricey, tech school t-shirts. When **L** joined me in bed for a bit, before I woke up early in the morning (this is when she planned to pull my laundry out and give me a fresh sand-tee to wear to work), **B** threw bleach in the dryer on (mostly) my clothes, ruining it all.

I suppose it could have been anyone. **L** said she had seen her up and about while **L** was doing stuff and hanging out with other night-shifters. Later on we did catch wind from one of her fickle friends that gave us some circumstantial evidence to further our assumption, nothing concrete however.

My clothes were ruined. **L** lost some stuff too, unfortunately it was mostly my stuff. There wasn't much room for recourse because I didn't have any concrete proof, and my First Sergeant (the sympathetic uncle in the military family, if you will, who has some pull between family members) was unwilling to do much about it.

______________

Fast forward to about an hour ago (10:00a.m. CST), my (now) ex-girlfriend **L**, who is still on good terms with me, messages me out of the blue. They're currently deployed together somewhere in the desert. She had this to say to me:

""hey just wanted to tell u what happened to me today...**B** is deployed with me and someone was doing laundry today...just letting u know when she walked away i kinda maybe spilled a little bleach in her washing machine. thought that would make ya smile. l8r""

He had some anger issues and whatnot and since he was 9 years older than me he thought he was allowed to run the show. He would lock me out of the house when he was supposed to be babysitting me, he would do ""fun"" things like pinning me down and tapping me in one spot on the head which he called ""Chinese water torture,"" he told me I was 1/2 alien when I was 5 because we're only 1/2 siblings and I couldn't figure out what the other half was, and he was just a shitty person all around.

(Bonus revenge: One time when he was playing the lock-sdh59-out-of-the-house game I snagged the phone and called 911, cried into the receiver, and hung up. Then I put the phone down and ran like hell. Turns out they called back and my brother couldn't answer (because the phone was locked outside with me) so they sent police cars out. My brother had fun explaining that one to my parents.)

Well, one day I had enough. He had all these gaming consoles and stuff that were considered hot shit at the time (~2000). He never let me play with them and I thought that was rude, so I planned my revenge.

One summer he went away *all* summer long and left his car in our barn. He also left all his little plastic game save things (I don't know what they're called. They're little cards that you would save your game to and each card was a different game.) in his room. 

Well, I went into his room and took ALL the cards I could see and buried them around the property. But did I stop there? Noooo. He had a glorious car in the garage that was just *begging* to be messed with. So what did I do? I took a jar of pickles and I dumped the whole thing in the back of his car. 

Now, keep in mind that it gets hotter than a billy goat's ass in a pepper patch during the summer. By the time he got back his car smelled **terrible,** but that's not even the best part. He was moving across country after that summer to go live in Arizona and he had no choice but to take the car that smelled like death and sweet, sweet revenge. 

**TL;DR** Be nice to your little siblings.

Edit: A lot of you are getting butthurt over this. I told him about it a few years ago and he punched me on the arm and laughed. He said the car smelled horrible and he hated that trip and he never even knew the memory cards (thanks /u/Jay2TheMellow) were missing. Chillax, peeps.

When we moved in, we 'bought' a fridge off the previous tenants. Apparently some group bought it six years ago or so, and each year the new tenants simply paid £50 to them to keep the fridge, since it doesn't belong to the estate agents. It's been done exactly the same for 6 years or so.


Our year is very nearly up (this sunday) and we showed the new tenants around a week or so ago. Apparently they flat out refused to pay up for the fridge.


Said fridge is *very* large, and easily doubles the space for food, and with 7 people, it's pretty much necessary. It's a fair bet they (7 welsh 'lads', stereotypical dicks you met in school) are expecting to get it for free, since none of us can just take it with us.


I do not intend to let them have this pleasure. Why here and not pettyrevenge? I don't *want* petty revenge. I want absolute full revenge that denies them a free fridge, not to just leave it all filthy (in part because I doubt they'll care)

My current plan is to simply break the plug some how. Cut the power cable in half or just snap off the plug prong things.

Opinions? Ideas? Best plan gets used.

Only rule is it can't be overly 'visible'. Like, I cant leave the fridge full of rotten food. Yes it's *technically* our property, we paid for it and the estate agents told us it's none of their business at the start of the year, but still, I'm hesitant to just ram it with cheese and leave for fear that they might keep some deposit.

My friend is all dressed up and ready for a night at the club. Pre-drinks at the pub have been done and the whole group is feeling super happy and looking forward to a night of dancing and more. Everyone gets to the club, usual cue and wait to get in. They let the girls go in first together and the the guys go to follow. One of the bouncers 'decides' that my friend is 'too drunk' to go in and even though all the girls and the other guys that just went in in front of him were fine, he can't go in. So it's too late and everyone else has already paid to get in and he's left in the cold out in the street. Not taking a kicking lying down my friend devises a plan. He heads around the back of the club, down the alleyway, and jumps the fence into the back area. It is closed up and dark but he soon finds what he's looking for. Using a bit of wood lying around he smashes the lock handle of the electricity breaker box and opens it up... Then he turned off all of the power switches for the whole building in seconds! He said the screaming that came from inside the club was insane. Quickly he jumped the fence and headed back down the alley to the front of the club. By this time people are streaming out and he milled around with them until he met up with his friends. They headed off for a different club and had a great time. I don't know if he told the people he was with what he did that night, but it really wouldn't surprise me if he never said a word.

Well, it is not mine to give.",91,87,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/15jfbl/so_you_needed_that_info_after_all_well_it_is_not/,"I had this job several years ago where I was the support staff for several Human Resources reps who handled employment issues for a state agency. That involved hiring and selection of candidates. Once they had the paperwork ready, they handed that to me for data entry and archival.  If one of the new hires had ever (and I mean, ever) worked for a state agency in the past (they filled out a form where they indicated the dates and agency), I had to fax that agency a verification form.

Not long after I myself was hired, another person, with whom I will share an office later, was hired, too.  She was, and still is a really nice person.  I cannot recall what the issue was, but there was a payroll problem and one of the accountants called her and was generally unprofessional to her, including asking her whether they ""trained you all over there.""  My co-worker told her supervisor what had happened (spoke to her while crying, and also via e-mail) and it all made it up to the HR Director.  She felt really bad, but everyone else in Human Resources was supportive of her yet angry at the accountant.  The accountant ended up leaving for another agency not long after that.

Now, I mentioned before that I had to send out verification forms for other agencies to complete.  By the same token, I had to provide the same for all the other agencies that sent them to me.  I could only vouch for the dates of the agency I worked for, but I also included all the other prior dates I had in the personnel system as an FYI and also out of courtesy because the more time you showed as having worked for the state, the more money you got paid, but it had to be verified before they could give you credit (and $$$) for that.  

So one day several years later, I got a request from this former accountant for employment dates on someone who had gone to work for her agency.  I recognized her name, but I did not want to be petty.  That was/is not me and I also thought of the professionalism showed by my co-workers, so I filled it out and faxed it back the same way I did with everyone else's.  The next day she calls me and asks me why I had sent her some dates for a different agency.  I explained to her I sent her what I had, mostly as a reference so she can ask that agency for that info.  Well, she got all indignant about providing certification on information belonging to other agencies; that I should not be doing that, etc, etc, etc.  OK.  Fine.  I told her I would re-fax it again sans the other info.  But, alas! she was soon to fall on her own sword.

Fast forward to a few months later  There was an employee who had retired from our agency and then gone to work for that other one.  He had worked there before, but for only a few months and back in the late 60's, early 70's.  Of course, those dates were difficult to track down, so sometimes you had to rely on other agencies' records (paper, computer printouts, prior completed verifications) to give credit to the employee. I think this retiree had worked only for them and then for us, so it was either us or nothing.  So she faxed me a verification and I dutifully filled it out with OUR employment dates only and faxed it back.  Not even five minutes later, she calls me asking about the other dates and why I had not provided those, apparently having forgotten our conversation the only other time I had spoken to her.  The only words that came out my mouth during that phone call were ""Those are not our dates.""  I did not say I will not provide them, and if she had asked me, I would have, but she said nothing.  After a few moments of silence, she hung up.  I never got a phone call from her again.",,False,,t5_2vjvl,False,,,True,t3_15jfbl,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/15jfbl/so_you_needed_that_info_after_all_well_it_is_not/,

It was the end of lunchtime and i was heading inside for assembly with some of my friends. The kid was behind the door holding it open. The doors are quite heavy and require a bit of a push to get it moving. most of my friends passed through and it was my turn.

As im walking through, minding my on business, he thrusts the door into me with all his strength. I was furious. I hold him up against the wall and pondered my options. I decided that hitting him was a bit extreme so i decided to spit on him.

I look him dead in the eyes and gather up the spit in my mouth. I throw my head forward and release the spit. It elegantly flies through the air and lands directly at the bottom left corner of his eye, making it look like he was crying spit.

I then walk off feeling rather pleased. He chases me down and pushes me, i push back and release a torrent of abuse. Resulting in him backing down and walking off.
 
 looking back it does seem a bit overkill, however it was definitely worth it

This continues for like 1/8 mile because this merge was quite long, and I try to maintain being in front of her, she without warning starts to merge left onto my lane with me there knowing that I was there so I had no choice but to go into the center lane (left turning lane) until this dumb bitch passed me and I could merge back in (I had a smaller car so she would have won the fight). Kicker is when I merged back in she flipped me the finger and shit was going to go down because I felt I was being generous to not have our sides fucked up. As we passed the construction and the road went back into 3 lanes she immediately goes back to the middle lane and I gunned it passed her and cut her off as close as possible (as soon as my front tires overtook the front of her car since I was driving faster than her). I then slammed on my brakes all the way to 0 mph, flipped her off. As I felt triumphant, I started to accelerate but wasn't really ready to let her off just yet. She switched lanes again thinking this is over and that civility would restore. WRONG! I did it again. Now she honks at me and tries to escape by switching lanes again. WRONG! Third times a charm. Now she is probably freaked out, me as well because normally I would leave it at flipping them off as a drove past, freaking blood rush. She pulls into the nearest parking lot on the right and I go on my merry way feeling quite accomplished. Again, I acknowledge that I have road rage issues.

1370428833.0,0,self.ProRevenge,1fppcu,A guy who was cheated on has a 7 week plan of revenge unfold perfectly....,64,68,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1fppcu/a_guy_who_was_cheated_on_has_a_7_week_plan_of/,"Just a bit of background

I was going out with this girl, everything seemed fine. I was happy in love and thinking long term. I was looking up flight to Budapest when I found out.  A mutual friend tells me that O (the girl) said to her when she was drunk that she had kissed E (my former best friend). I was in her bed and she was in the other room when it happened.

We had a huge row, I cut him out of my life and I screamed at her for three days. After the three days she came to my house. I was planning on just ending it and leaving it there. But she revealed that she had cheated on me before with some random guy she met when she was out of town. She claims both times she was black out drunk and said, “It was a mistake, so I thought you would be happier not knowing. I felt you didn’t deserve to be hurt like that so I wanted to take the guilt as my punishment”.

I snapped and told her to leave. I then proceeded to write half of this email. I was going to take her back for a couple of weeks and basically sleep around and not even be that discreet and when she eventually hurt me again, I would have all this to throw in her face.

Well, seven weeks on it finally arrived. It was my time to shine. A gang of lads have moved into the house next to hers and they have all been hanging out loads. I am currently back at home about two hours away for the summer, as I am finished college.

I went down to visit her on Saturday and she is being weird with me. We went out and all those lads were there too. She is being weird with me in the nightclub and I ask her what is wrong. She proceeds to tell me that she has fallen out of love with me because I’m not at hers as much now. She wants to go on a break, so she has time to miss me.

I casually ask her, how long does she want to have the break for. She says a month. I ask so it’s no contact for a while but we are still committed to each other right….

And she responds, “Well, we won’t tell the other what we are doing, so it won’t matter.” Translation: She wants a month of riding, as she lives in a city and I am in a very rural area with no chance of random hook ups. It was time for my plan to unfold.


I said we were through and the last words I said to her were, “I wish you had some foresight”. I had been playing the long game for 7 weeks, building up a portfolio of revenge. I sent her the following email detailing what I had done along with 6 photos of the best girls that I had had sex with.

I hope you enjoy.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi O, 

I'm not really sure how I am at the minute. I'm glad that you are out of my life but at the same time I'm sad that it had to be this way. I'm sad because part of me misses the time when I was happy with you. Some of this may be unpleasant to read but for your own sake, I would read through it all.

There was a time when I truly loved you and thought that I was happy. I AM A VERY FOOLISH MAN.

When I first heard about you kissing E (one of my best friends), my initial reaction was hurt. I wanted to cry. I wanted to just fall apart but I made a little vow in my own head that I wasn't going to let that happen. I was going to come out of this the bigger person. After my initial rage and giving out, I was going to calmly talk things out with you and see was there anything in this relationship to be salvaged.

Maybe, it was just a drunken mistake. Maybe, it was just pure reckless drunkenness. Maybe, she loves me as much as she says she does. I wanted to believe all these things and I felt like this was my first ""adult"" relationship.

Then, you told me that actually this had happened before. R (some random guy she met when she was out of town) or whatever his name is. Then, I realised I was being a fool. I cheated on people before but I always regretted it. One half of why I did it was that I just had this hole where my morals were and I filled it with the attention of other girls. But I filled in that hole when I started going out with you. It was a stupid thing to do. The other half of the reason why I cheated is because I wanted to have something to throw back in their face if they cheated on me.

For the first time in my life, the situation that I have always prepared for, the situation that has given me nightmares. The situation that I have always feared was here in front of me and I had nothing. I had nothing to throw back at you and you were telling me about cheating a second time.

But, I'm glad that I had nothing to throw back at you. I'm a good person. We all do good and bad things but on the whole, I am a decent human being. You are not. I am a good person but everyone has their breaking points and you cheating on me was mine. I knew taking you back meant I was basically setting myself up for more hurt. Leopards don't lose their spots and I knew that you are a bad person and you were going to do what bad people do. 

So, I was going to prepare myself. You haven't watched Mad Men (I suggest you do, it is a fantastic show), but I went into full-on Don Draper mode. I was shifting (what we call French kissing in Ireland) and riding every night I went out. I've attached photos of some of the girls for your viewing pleasure. I've only got pics of the ones I rode. I didn't get the names of the women I was shifting. I'm too busy for that craic.

Some of the sex was great, some of it wasn't too hectic. Some of the girls, I told them about what I was doing and what the situation was. They all thought I was some sort of psychotic genius. But that's not for me to say that's for other people to say. Actually, one of the girls up there in the pics was cool with me not using a condom. So, I got a blowjob off you a few hours afterwards and I didn't even wash my knob. She had been cheated on before, it was her idea. I think it was quiet clever.

You say to me that you fell out of love with me that hurt so much, well it would have if I had anything other than contempt for you. You are the barometer that I will judge bad girlfriends against. You always referred to A (my ex) or S (a girl she knows I was hooking up with) as ""that slut"". Neither one of them were sluts, A would never have cheated on me. She had a temper and at the end of it, it was more fighting than having sex but she never would have cheated on me. I didn't know S that well but she seemed like an honest enough sort of girl with some crazy sexual desires and the skills to match. I said that you were the best sex I ever had. You weren't. It just felt like the appropriate thing to say when you were telling me how good I was. You are the least flexible woman I have ever been with. 

M (my actual best friend) and R (my model roommate/female best friend) were both bewildered by the fact that I was taking you back, as was my dad. I didn't tell anything to the other two but I told my dad what I was planning. He just smiled and told me a few stories about people he took his revenge out on. We laughed, really brought us closer together.

The evening I went over to you and told you it was over. You were crying and asking did I enjoy torturing you. I did. You tried to make out to me that we were even. Me breaking up with you = you cheating on me with my best friend. That doesn't add up on any calculator. You said, ""well, you've had your revenge now, L (me). I'm heart broken."" O, you haven't got a heart. That comment really, really, really insulted me. My revenge wasn't going to be something as banal and puerile as that. This is my revenge.

I wanted you to know that you have stolen and squandered all my time since November. Choosing to go out with you will remain the most foolish mistake that I have ever made. My slut radar was going wild but I ignored it. Foolish. 

Now after you have read this, you will be thinking, ""what an asshole, I'm going to get the ride to spite him"". You riding anyone is of no consequence to me. I do not care about you. I haven't since you cheated. I've acted and pretended, knowing that this day when I would have to write this email would come. After this, I am the winner. You can go next door or into town and ride whoever. But in the end you will still be the same stupid, immoral, petulant, repugnant, vile, pathetic, wormy, dumpster slut.

I wish you nothing but hardship and pain. I can't wait for the day when you truly love someone and they do to you, what you did to me. After this email, I want no further contact with you. To me, you don't exist. Your biggest concern in life is ""I don't want people to think I'm a slut"". Correction, you don't want people to know that you are in fact a slut. Call me childish and immature for doing what I did, and I'm sure you will denounce it as such but I am a nice person to everyone I meet and you pushed me into doing this. You are corrosive and evil.

I wish you nothing but misery.

Regards,

The man who deserves better than a worm like you

PS

Yes, R (my roommate/female best friend who O absolutely hates) and I hooked up on a night out at the start of the year, I never told you. We didn't have sex. However, after the cheating, I was down there a lot more and yes, we were doing it. We used to joke about it in front of your face. Anytime we mentioned our ""Game of Thrones nights"" that was code for the fact that we were sleeping together.

You may be tempted into some form of retaliation. While, you are not a very bright or creative girl, you are an evil one, so I am giving you this warning. The last words I said to you leaving the house were: ""I wish you had some foresight"". This wasn't some quasi way of making you realise that I was the right person for you. This was me telling you that I have foresight and knew this would be coming and I have a rather saucy collection of photos of you in uncompromising positions. When you cheated on me and I decided on what I was going to do, I knew I would need an insurance policy. 

So, I took loads of nude pics of you. If you try to retaliate or throw something new in my face (which I'm sure there is something) then I will be forced to use them. Otherwise nothing will be done with them. I'll some up my warning with a line from Game of Thrones, it's a quote about Lord Baelish. ""He would burn down the Seven Kingdoms, so long as he could be king of the ashes"". I think it applies to me in this situation. I have no problem ruining my life, so long as I get to ruin yours.

There was a time when I doubted what I was doing. Was I going too far, did you really deserve this? Then I was talking to N (her housemate) about the situation and he told me that you had said to him (this was when I was deciding should we get back together) ""I wish he would just make up his mind, at least if he broke up with me I could have a few weeks of fun for the last bit of college"". You are a despicable slut.

And finally, the threesome that I had wasn't with S (a girl she knows that I whooked up with in the past) and her friend. It was with A (her female housemate) and J( A’s friend and O’s archnemisis) and it happened in the room above yours.

I was recently working this one telecommuting contracting job making decent money.  We had an opening and I'm trying to come up with people who would actually be good for the position and would stay long term.  I talk to a person who I used to work with at another company who I find out is actually looking for a new job, lives in the middle of nowhere, and has turned his life around from being a big time drug user to being a born again Christian.  Because of his born again status and because I knew he had the skill set we need, I help get him hired.  All I ask in return is that he gives me a gift certificate at Amazon, because he can't buy me lunch anytime soon, living in nowheresville.

Well, 2 years have past.  I left for another job that had full benefits.  He was promoted to supervisor at the old job.  

It's been interesting watching him on FB:

1.  He's thrown away all his secular music.  Not donate it, **thrown it away.**
2.  He's gotten heavily into guns and buys/trades them regularly.
3.  He's gotten into buying various pairs of sneakers.

Yet no gift certificate, even though I've gently reminded him about it once or twice. 

Unfortunately the contract he was working on has recently ended and now he's looking for a new job.  My company have plenty of job openings, and he even asked me to help float his resume along.   I said to him,""Remember how I helped you get the last job?  Remember that gift certificate you kept promising me you send me?  Exactly why should I help you now?""

This happened a couple of years ago. In the area I live in it's not uncommon to see Amercan flags in front of businesses, 
especially car dealerships. It's also common here to see the Amercian flag hung alongside Mexican flags and I've even 
seen it buried in a whole array of flags from South America. While it's great for a car dealership to display their pride in 
multiculturalism I feel displaying our flag this way degrades it's importance. So on my way to work one day I was delighted
to see a car dealership that had American flags clipped to every car and hanging on the fence in front were two larger flags
and not a foreign flag to be seen. It was a mom and pop place with a dirt parking lot with a trailer office in the back and
about 10 or 15 used cars on the lot. I'll call the owner Dealership Guy (DG).

My excitement was misplaced because as over the next few weeks I would drive by and sometimes either one or both of the larger
flags had come off of the poles and were lying on the ground or had been pushed down on the poles so that they were flying half 
mast or at the bottom of the poles but they were usually fixed rather quickly so I just blew it off.

 
One morning I was driving by with my wife and as usual, my eyes went to the flags and I shouted, ""**WHY IS THAT FLAG HANGING 
UPSIDE DOWN?!!!**"". My wife told me to calm down and either email or call them when I get to work and ask them to fix it.
When I got to work I found the dealership's website and an email address to which I sent the following email:

When I didn't get reply and I figured the guy was probably just embarrassed and would go out an fix it right away so
no big deal. But on the way home I saw the the flag was still upside down. The next day I stopped on my way home and 
[took pictures](http://imgur.com/a/PTyEk)
 being very careful to say on the easement ouside of the business and not to touch the flag as that could 
be seen as trespassing and possibly get me thrown in jail. Over the next couple of days I talked to the local police, 
emailed the local VFW and American Legion. I more or less learned that its within his right to display the flags in 
whatever manner he wants no matter how offensive it may be. That started me thinking, He may have the right to mistreat 
the flag and hang it upside down but I have the right to call attention to it as loudly as I can.

His website didn't have a comment section or one of those rating meters so that was out. It was hosted on one of those places
that lets you set up your own website for free so the closest I could get to his website was to create my own. I created
a web page called ""Dealership Guy Motors is un-American"". I posted the pictures of the flags with a story about what was going 
on and I set up a counter of the number of days that the flag remained upside down and a daily blog to update the story that went
something like: ""Drove by there this morning, flag still upside down."" ""Drove by this evening, flag still upside down, the other 
one is at half mast."" ""3 days and still no reply from Dealership Guy.""

Then I went to every forum I could think of that was appropriate and posted ""Dealership_guy Motors is un-American"" 
with the story and pictures of the flags. I emailed the local radio stations and TV stations. To top it off I joined a couple 
of online biker groups and posted in there...those guys love their flag.
 
After waiting a couple of days I did a google search and sure enough all of those posts, my website and a few cross posts popped
up at the very top of the search. A search on yahoo gave me the same results. I took screenshots of the search pages and 
sent them to Dealership Guy, I included the URLs of the google and yahoo search pages and the URL of my web page I personalized it
with a very sweet *""Have a nice day :)""*.

After several days of silence and being ignored I got a reply within minutes. I could bore you with a whole tale about implied
physical threats and threats of a lawsuit or how the local media came this close to getting involved but to make a long story
short he took the flags down completely immediately after I sent him the email. Not exactly what I wanted but no flag at all 
is better than a mistreated one.

Pranking was par for the course. However, it should be said, we were quite good at pranking. Usually it wasn't malicious; more so simply creative and funny. But this one time, a rival fraternity took it a little to far with us, so we were forced to whip out a trump card prank, (allegedly)....this is what what went down.

We had security cameras outside of our fraternity house. Right after school let out around the beginning of June, a rival fraternity stole our letters. And they took a shit in the drivers seat of my personal vehicle. We saw what fraternity was responsible. And thus, there would be hell to pay.

We threw a party that weekend and padlocked out bathroom doors shut. All peeing and shitting via all patrons, was to be done into plastic five gallon buckets in plywood ""stalls"" we built on several porches of our triple decker. We capped 16 buckets of fucking awful, &amp; let these ferment for like a week and a half in unrelenting 90 degree heat.

One of our brother's fathers owns a pyrotechnics company that sets off 90% of the fireworks in the Northeast U.S.....so we got some of his equipment, some detonation wires, a detonator, and 16 quarter sticks of dynamite.

That Sunday night, 4 in the morning, we take 2 rented, nondescript vans (with cardboard over the plates) and take the seats out from them, load 16 buckets of fermented shit &amp; piss into them with 10 of my fraternity brothers. Each of these buckets is capped, with a hole drilled in the top. Inside each bucket is a quarter stick, wired up to some det wire, wired up to a panel detonator (one where you just hit a single switch and it will set off multiple charges simultaneously).

We rolled up to their house just prior to the asscrack of dawn, cardboard over the licence plates, ski masks, all black gear, and unloaded the buckets onto their lawn and had one brother go try and pick the lock. The douche bags LEFT THE DOOR OPEN. So everyone took one or two buckets a piece and hurriedly but quietly proceeded into the house, and put at least one in every room on the ground floor. After this was done (which took all of 10 seconds, as we had lined up the buckets in the order they were wired on the lawn prior to making our entry and just kind of circled them around the ground floor.....) We went outside and emptied the gas out of an airhorn. The lights go on. We wait five seconds or so, till we hear the first, ""What the fuck...""

BANG! Every window on the ground floor of the house blows out. And everything is coated in a fine mist of fermented fecal matter, piss and wet nasty TP. We see a lone brother of theirs, stagger out the door, and fall to his knees screaming, ""I can't hear, what happened....FUCK!"" Covered head to toe in shitspray so dank he had changed races. We peeled out laughing our asses off. Shit in my car? Fuck all y'all, in the ass, with a Sequoia shaft, sideways, with no lube.

""WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?! YOU'RE GONNA HURT SOMEBODY""

""Chill out man, it was an accident""

""NO, IT WASN'T. YOU TWO ARE BEING FREAKING IDIOTS AND ARE GONNA HURT SOMEONE""

I look over at my friend, a scrawny 5'3 17 yr old kid who couldn't do shit if he tried and me, a 5'8 kid who literally just tapped a minigolf ball up the hill. We looked at each other questioning if this was really happening and if this guy was serious. 

""YOU IDIOTS STOP MESSING AROUND AND DONT HURL YOUR BALLS IN THE AIR"" he starts stomping off.

""But I didn't mean to""

He looks back at me stomping off with rage face. Turns out he was just playing with his kid. My friend and I go to the next hole.

""Hey MC2157, the dudes glaring at you."" ""Just ignore him."" We played the hole.

Next hole I saw he was doing it *again.* I had enough and knew he was fucked if he laid a hand on me, so I waved at him and yelled with a smile ""How you doing?"" The guy ragefaced in shock.

The problem was my friend did that to him everytime we got to a new hole. I told him to stop but I stopped caring. At the second to last hole, rageface finally responded ""GOOD!"" and stomped back up to us and stood right next to *me* as I putted. I began to purposefully miss my ball and knock it into the wall next to him.

""OOPS!"" I did it around 10 times and finally sunk it, when he finally walked away. I looked at my Indian friend and told him ""Alright, the gauntlet is thrown. Follow my lead, keep your shades on and no matter what happens don't. Fucking. Laugh.""

That friend was a real racist. I stopped hanging out with him because of it but I used it to his advantage.

I should mention this was the spring after 9/11.

We went to the cashier and talked to the manager. With my most pathetic, soft voice I began to tell her what happened to my friend and I. How the guy approached us and yelled, how he harassed us, and how he targeted my friend.

""You know, we come here to have a safe, fun time and this guy...this guy was so racist. He...he called my friend an f'ing Arab!"" My friends face immediately turned red trying to contain his laughter. I could tell his eyes were bulging behind his shades.

""I mean look at him! He's clearly embarrassed and turning red! He's not even Arab, he's Indian! And he blamed him for 9/11!""

The manager looked crushed

""Boys, I'm gonna talk to him right now, wait here""

""No, look we had enough today, we'll come back another time. We don't want him to yell at us anymore.""

We left the building and I told my friend DON'T laugh till we got in my car. The split second before he closed his car door, we heard rageface yell ""WHAT?!!"" and we lost it. We drove off into the sunset. Victorious.

TLDR; Dude fucked with my minigolf. I called him racist. Hilarity ensued.",,False,,t5_2vjvl,1371562971.0,,,True,t3_1gkz0g,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1gkz0g/the_minigolf_story/,

I got that *****.,22,28,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1gcqux/neighbor_has_been_stealing_some_of_my_vegetables/,"So let's start with some backstory. As a recreational hobby, I plant a LOT of vegetables in my backyard. Probably around 30-40 types of vegetables. My garden/backyard has a lot of space, so I'm sure my neighbor felt justified in taking 3-8 vegetables from my garden each day, since I'd ""never noticed."" 

But luckily I have a fancy security system outside and caught him in the act. This bastard was done. Instead of confronting him directly, I wanted to see him burn.

So I scout out his backyard and decide to fuck around with him. I steal his water hose, grill, basketball goal, potted flowers, outdoor table set, etc. I put them all in my pickup truck while he was out of town one day and drove the fuck off and dumped them into the forest.

1371823554.0,0,self.ProRevenge,1gslsz,10 room inspections in a month? Time to make the RC quit.,29,41,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1gslsz/10_room_inspections_in_a_month_time_to_make_the/,"This is long, but I think a little back story is important. I went to a small, private, liberal arts, all-women’s college. We lived in a bubble – picture classes where most every sentence that comes out of someone’s mouth starts with the two words “I feel…” So we had Residence Coordinators, who were generally students who had graduated the year previous and were – in exchange for free housing, free classes, and a small spending stipend – housed with the students to keep order, help in emergencies, run house meetings, wipe noses, etc. etc. Better than the traditional “house mom,” but not by much.

In the bigger houses on campus, there were triples on the first floor for first years. My girlfriend and I managed to get it as a double her second year (thus freeing up two singles), so we had a living room, bathroom, and bedroom to ourselves – essentially our own 700sqft apartment in a dorm house. And our living room wall was up against the RC’s living room wall. This wouldn’t have been a big deal, if not for a few fun facts about our RC that year:

* She was finishing up classes required for her master’s degree program and was constantly studying 
* She was very noise sensitive
* She was a petty little bitch

Fun facts about me and my girlfriend:

* We never had classes before lunch because we were both night owls
* We always had a lot of friends over, and parties every weekend 
* We had two cats, one of which (hers) was a Siamese that never shut up, and a dog.

Same as most any other college, pets were not allowed. The dog was co-owned with another friend so it sometimes lived with us, and sometimes lived off-campus. Needless to say, our pets were the WORST kept secrets on campus. My cat and the dog were brought to my tennis matches – on leash and harness of course – as well as rugby matches, and walked around campus daily. So she KNEW we had the pets – but it wasn't until we annoyed her one too many times that she decided to make it her life’s mission to PROVE we had the pets (thus getting us fined $150/pet per month until pets were gone).

Thanks to the fact it was a VERY LIBERAL liberal arts college, she could not just do a random room inspection – she had to give us 24 hours notice, which gave us plenty of time to get the animals out of the room (though one time we forgot, and ended up hiding both cats in the window seats in the hallway between the living room and bedroom – litter box was hidden in our bedroom closet – we refused to turn the music down because the Siamese wouldn’t shut up the whole time he was in there). After about 10 room inspections in a month, I was fed up. She was being petty because we were ""noisy,"" and though we did try to keep it down late at night, we annoyed her no matter what time of day it was.

Edit for clarity: She was that girl in the dorm who told EVERYONE to shut up she's studying. Someone walking down the fucking hall ""too loud"" got bitched at by her. And she had a complete other room to study in that wasn't sharing a wall with us, so I had no sympathy. She complained to the girl above her that she was ""stomping around constantly"" and the girl - who was very sensitive about her weight - ended up moving out of our house very upset. She wrote up 90% of our house for noise violations, THAT is why we wanted to get her to quit.

So I decided I would prank her until she quit. Or cried. Or quit, while crying.

She had a car and a reserved parking spot right behind the house, next to the handicap spot.  So one weekend I borrowed my dad’s truck (RWD to tow a boat), and too damn early for a Monday morning backed up to her bumper (it was a Jetta) until just touching, and slowly pushed her car into the handicap spot. She only used her car on the weekend, so chances were she wouldn’t notice the car was moved until it was too late. 

Monday she received a parking ticket ($15)

Tuesday she received a parking ticket ($15).

Wednesday, she received a parking ticket ($15).

Thing is, after three tickets, your car is booted. Thursday, her car was booted ($35).

At this point, public safety called her and told her to get her car out of the fucking handicap spot.

I was walking down the hall past her room and the door was open that evening, and she was talking to some other housemates, insisting “I swear I put the parking brake on! I don’t know how it ended up in that spot!”

One look from me and everyone knew who was responsible. And that was just the beginning of months of horrible &amp; petty pranks I pulled on that poor woman in my quest to get her to quit.",,False,,t5_2vjvl,1371825733.0,,,True,t3_1gslsz,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1gslsz/10_room_inspections_in_a_month_time_to_make_the/,
