However, the academy recognized that this film is a much better one, and gave it the foreign film academy award, winning over del Toro's film. This movie, set in post-WWII Soviet controlled East Germany, is one of the most well acted, well written, well directed, and emotionally powerful tragedies I have ever seen, period. Worth a watch to all appreciators of foreign film and film in general, as it is one of my all time favorites, though way too intense to watch on a regular basis. Here's a trailer:

&gt;**Mood Indigo Trailer: Just Michel Gondry and His Underwater Wedding and Olfactory Piano**

&gt;*By Jesse David Fox* ^[Vulture.com_26/1/2013](http://www.vulture.com/2013/01/watch-the-trailer-for-michel-gondrys-next-film.html) 
   
&gt;If you were looking for a whimsical way to kick off the weekend, Michel Gondry is here for you with the first trailer for his upcoming film, Mood Indigo. Based on the 1947 novel L'Ecume des Jours by Boris Vian, the film tells the story of a wealthy young inventor of an olfactory-musical instrument (the pianocktail) whose wife develops an illness that can only be treated by surrounding her with flowers. Yep, it doesn't get much more Gondry than that. The film stars Romain Duris (The Beat That My Heart Skipped) and Audrey Tautou (Amelie) as the predictably adorable leads. The film opens on April 24 in France with a Stateside release to follow after. The trailer is stunning; however, just a heads-up, the whole thing is in French, save the Lumineers' ""Hey Ho"" playing in the background — because even in France, ""Hey Ho"" must be used in all trailers and advertisements.

Really really enjoyed it. Non-linear plot combined with racist me having a hard time telling Japanese people apart makes it a little hard to follow but it ties itself together really nicely in the end. Tells the story of how a early Japanese punk band wrote a song that wound up saving the world. (don't worry, its not too heavy on the punk motifs. There is a punk song, and its heavily featured/played throughout the film but that's about it).

But yeah, if you are looking for a mentally stimulating feel-good story I'd certainly recommend a watch. It might be a *little* predictable, but as long as you sit back and enjoy the movie and not spent every second analyzing why each part happened as they happen I think you'll enjoy it.

I saw a few similar posts where people have been able to identify the movie the OP is asking about. I will try to give as much detail of the movie as I remember. My estimate is that it was probably filmed on the late 80s.

About 10 years ago I watched a movie playing on regular tv (before the cable menus that give you names). It was a French movie, and was subtitled. The movie was about a girl (early teenager) living with her mother and baby brother. Their relationship is sort of rocky, and later in the movie the mother's brother shows up. There is a strange almost incest-like relationship between the mother and uncle. The girl meets a young guy and falls in love with him. She spends a lot of time with him, and he gives her a pair of boots. Fast-forward to the end of the movie, the girl is taken to a mental institution after an incident with her baby brother. There it is known that the young guy the girl thought of as her boyfriend was actually a member of The Police (band), and she carries a photo of the blond guy with her. So the boyfriend was imaginary.

Both of them were incredible.  I don't know how ""Of Gods and Men"" is NOT nominated for an Oscar.  

I know we have talked a bit about this year's Oscar nominees but I thought I would give you guys a bit of a review on both.  I just want to say I'm thankful that I live in Toronto, where these kinds of films can find a theatre screen to be shown.  It helps also that the Toronto International Film Festival Group has their own building now, called the TIFF Bell Lightbox, with 5 theatres.  These are the kinds of films they show all the time.  No, I don't work for them but just that I was there today for one of the films.  Incendies isn't really a ""foreign"" film to me since I am from Canada but sometimes Quebec/French films have difficulty finding an audience outside that province.  

Anyway, to the reviews

""Incendies"" is about these Canadian brother and sister twins whose mother has just died. In her Will she asks them to deliver letters to a brother they didn't know they had and to their father who they thought was dead. It sends them on this journey through the Middle East, as they uncover their mother's past in an effort to find the father and brother. It's pretty graphic, it's during one of the Middle East wars during the '70's. There are many tense moments during flashbacks of the mother's life.  The lies the mother tells to get out of often what looks to be deadly situations, she gets thrown in jail, a very bloody scene on a bus that she's riding, trying to get out.  As the pieces are uncovered, it all leads up to an ending that was a bit of a shock, when they figured it all out.  When your brain starts to put these pieces together itself and when the daughter learns of the truth, kind of gave me that ripple of goosebumps when you have that chilling moment of realization.  Amazing film and definitely deserves the nomination it received at the Oscars.  There's a good chance it's going to win it tomorrow.

""Of Gods and Men"" takes place in Algeria, during the war in 1996. 7 French monks served this small village in the hills. The defied the pressure from the government and the violence to flee back to France. They decided to stay for the community and for their ""calling"" here at this monastery. Their faith and religion is tested as the violence gets closer and the situation becomes increasingly tense. They are eventually kidnapped, held for ransom and when the French government doesn't give in, they are killed. Nobody knows what actually happened to them. It's based on a real story of exactly this.  The acting is all absolutely superb.  There is this feel of authenticity and compassion that emanates from the 7 men that you can only get from life experience.  The actor that plays the main leader is the same guy that played the Merovingian villain character.  What a contrast.

It's a quiet film, on sort of a slow build towards the inevitable.  There are many moments of just sheer silent beauty as the monks are contemplating what their actions should be.  There is a moment when a helicopter is circling around the monastery and they just begin to sing.  The whirling sound of the helicopter, juxtaposed with the singing is brilliant.  The helicopter leaves and it basically makes you feel that their peace, humility and faith willed the violence away.  The scene which is essentially their last meal before they're kidnapped is incredibly powerful. They know what's coming so they share a simple, beautiful indulgence that involves wine and the beautiful theme song from Swan Lake. I don't want to give to much away, but it's a very emotional film. 

It's about testing your faith, religion, martyrdom, brotherhood, community in the face of violence, terrorism and extremism.  It's about remembering the good you have done with your time while you were alive and being accepting of your fate by not giving into violence and extremism.  I'm not ashamed to say that I cried watching this one, several times.  It's a haunting film, the ending will stay with you.  I'm not a religious person but I didn't find this heavy handed.  This kind of religious faith, being dedicated to your community, doing good things to improve the lives around you, brotherhood, I don't really have a problem with.  These monks actually lived and co-existed peacefully in a Muslim village.  It shows how these two can get along.

My feeling was that both these films really force you to examine the violence, chaos, extremism and war that religion can cause.  You see the flip side of that though in ""Of Gods"", you see the goodness that can be done.

My recommendation, absolutely see both of these films if you ever get the chance.  I doubt you'll be disappointed.

The title says it all, really. I'd like to see a few Russian films made during the soviet era; I'm interested in the government-approved nature of the films, perhaps ones that resolutely broadcast messages about how great Russia, but also films that despite the constraints managed to stand on their own as excellent films too.

A soviet cinema 101, basically. Right now, I've seen only Potemkin and Solaris. I don't really know where else to go, apart from Stalker and Come and See.

1. [Headhunters (Hodejegerne)](http://imdb.com/title/tt1614989/) - It certainly delivered in being very entertaining and easy to watch. It reminded me a little bit of Taken in the premise of escalation towards a resolution through more and more hardships. The plot development was equally entertaining, though I did not feel the film quite managed to grip me with the psychological depth of the characters, but nonetheless very entertaining and full of energy.

2. [Las Acacias (Las Acacias)](http://imdb.com/title/tt1754078/) I knew would be a change of pace and much slower. But I enjoyed it particularly as I am a learner of Spanish (though the Argentinian Spanish sounds quite challenging) and it's the sort of film that brings you down to earth again; especially if you have experienced the loneliness of travelling along foreign highways and the small stories of people's lives you might catch a glimpse of. There's also a lot of a sense of the loss/missing of family and how that effects the sense of one's self. It was slow but very worthwhile if you are in the right mood.

3. [Couscous (La Graine Et Le Mulet)](http://imdb.com/title/tt0487419/) I had previously started watching this and been distracted from finishing it so I knew what to expect. If you are looking for a film with lots of convivial conversation and sense of community, then this French-speaking film is a good choice: Eating and talking and how different lives are entwined with the shifting fortunes of those close to us but all connected by culture and collaboration. Very life affirming about the ordinary lives of people.

4. [A Royal Affair (En Kongelig Affære)](http://imdb.com/title/tt1276419/) The film critic Mark Kermode waxed lyrical about this film, so I decided to give what looks like a typical period piece drama a whirl and it's an interesting story from history with great acting: A film that rewards some learning from watching it as well as solid entertainment. Inspiring.

I'm including a segment that comments on how some of these movies seems to include the ""character"" of its own country. What a lot of these movies do is provide the director's own perspective of his/her country/city through the plot.

I'm allowed to demonstrate YouTube clips from films that I think would support the arguments above. So far, I've decided on ""Amèlie"" (it's a must?), ""La Vita è Bella"" (changing POV of WWII), maybe ""Volver"". I definitely want French, Spanish, Italian, possibly Japanese (Miyazaki? Too obvious?), and something Nordic/Germanic.

Sorry a lot of these are mainstream foreign films, but that's why I'd like your help. I want to know if there's anything else I can add or remove, and I'd love to hear your opinions and suggestions so that I can present a wider perspective of this cinema genre that isn't biased by my own :) 

(Sorry if my English isn't perfect! Thank you very much!!)

-----------------------------

**EDIT:** WOW I did not expect so many responses! I'm a bit of a loss here at which to pick lol but I've complied a list of all the titles:

**France**: Vivre sa Vie (Godard Movies), Enter the Void, Jules et Jim, 400 Blows, La Haine (+2), District 13 (""current economic/social politics of urban France."" --faswich), Breathless, Une Prophet

**Italy**: Cinema Paradiso (+2), L'Aventura, 8 1/2, La Strada

**Germany**: The Lives of Others (+3), ""Run Lola, Run"", Gegen die Wand, Der weiße Band, Nirgendwo in Afrika, The State I am In (Die innere Sicherheit)

**Spain**: ""Y Tú Mamá También"", Amores Perros (+2)


**Finland**: (Aki Kaurismäki movies: ""whose works are very distinct and emphasize silent communication."" --Golding)

**Norway**: Trollhunter (""Scandinavian traditions and ideals in the proper setting"" --faswich), Max Manus (rejection of Fascism), Dead Snow

**Sweden**: The Seventh Seal, Let the Right One In, Show Me Love (Fucking Amal)


**Austria**: (Haneke's Movies) ""71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance"", ""Benny's Video"", 

**Georgia**: 13 Tzameti

**Hungary**: Kontroll, (Tarr Béla films: hungarian social realism), 

**Romania**: ""4 luni 3 saptamani 2 zile"",  ""Amintiri din epoca de aur"" (""Romania is pretty strong in showing what it was like to live in that country in the 80s"" --signalN)

**Serbia**: Cabaret Balkan

**Yugoslavia**: Underground



**Hong Kong: Chungking Express, In the Mood for Love (+2), Fist of Fury (China vs. Japan), Ip Man, Overheard (HK surveilance) 

**Iran**: Taste of Cherry, Salaam Cinema (+2), Close-Up

**Japan**: The Taste of Tea, Seven Samurai (+2), Millenium Actress

**Korean**: Sympathy for Lady Vengeance (+3), Oldboy(+3.5), (Kim Ki-Duk movies; ""idiosyncratic"" --Golding) 


So I'll take a look at ""Sympathy for Lady Vengeance"", ""Oldboy"", ""Seven Samurai"", ""Salaam Cinema"", ""In the Mood for Love"", ""Amores Perros"", ""Cinema Paradiso"", and ""La Haine"" :) These are all that have been the most recommended, and therefore possibly the most generally-accepted movies that represent what foreign films are.

The film's basic plot was that two adult male drifters somehow fell in with a teenage girl. The girl's father was a member of some armed force - police or possibly military - and he behaved abusively towards her.

The girl decides to run away with her drifter friends, who are traveling around with plans to drop by with an old girlfriend (in Westphalia maybe?). They do end up at the old girlfriend's place with the teenage girl, but her father has tracked her down. During a violent confrontation, the drifters accidentally injure the father fatally, but I cannot remember how. The rest of the movie is a fugitive flick, as the drifters try to get the girl to safety while the police hunt them. In the end the two drifters succeed in getting the girl to an airport and the police surround them and eventually gun them down. 

Scenes I remember:

* The girl jokes with the two drifters, saying ""Hey! Faggots!"" and then laughing at them when they both turn around, claiming that this confirms her suspicions that they're both gay.
* There was one scene where the girl's dad scolds her about something trivial, and then sprays her with freezing water from a showerhead.
* When the drifters take the girl cross country to their old girlfriend's place, one guy makes love to the girlfriend while she's on the phone.
* The final scene of the movie, as I recall, is the two drifters bleeding to death after being gunned down by police. Overhead they see the girl's airplane take off and fly away, vindicating their sacrifice.

Werner Herzog and Michael Mann are apparently big fans. I have to agree. I think the critics got it wrong on this one.

Seen on French tv in 2003.,12,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeignMovies/comments/pxsbk/can_you_help_me_find_this_movie_seen_on_french_tv/,"So I saw this movie on French television, a regular broadcast channel. I believe it was either Polish or one of the Scandinavian countries. I can remember the entire damn plot, but not the title.
The movie is about the relationship between a young (late teens/early 20's) working class boy and a prostitute who works near his home. The whole film is set in the wintertime. They start dating, he gets a job, things go okay until his dog gets in a fight and needs emergency care. The boy then gets either a new or second job working nights at a dump, but then seriously injures his hand/arm on some sheet metal. The girlfriend goes back to work as a prostitute, and her BF becomes her pimp. There's some semi-comic bits where the guy becomes friends with a cab driver, who ends up visiting the GF as a client. BF also has acquired a gun, and there's a scene where he fires the gun in a tiny bathroom, and is choking on the smoke and bursts into the room where GF has a client. 
Eventually a local gangster, who looks like a bodybuilder, comes by to run them out of his territory. He rapes the GF and breaks the BF's arm. The movie ends with them driving to a city (I think Paris). They either run out of gas on the way there or stop because they're tired; break into a boarded up beach house, and are burning their liquor to help keep warm. Over all it's a pretty dark film.

*Edit from Wikipedia: Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom (Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma), commonly referred to as Salò, is a controversial 1975 Italian drama film written and directed by Italian director Pier Paolo Pasolini. It is based on the book The 120 Days of Sodom by the Marquis de Sade. Because of its scenes depicting intensely graphic violence, sadism, and sexual depravity, the movie was extremely controversial upon its release, and **remains banned in several countries to this day.** It was Pasolini's last film; he was murdered shortly before Salò was released. **The film focuses on four wealthy, corrupted fascist libertines in Benito Mussolini's Italy in 1944 who kidnap a total of eighteen teenage boys and girls and subject them to four months of extreme violence, sadism, sexual and mental torture.** The film is noted for exploring the themes of political corruption, abuse of power, sadism, perversion, sexuality, and fascism. **Although it remains a controversial film to this day, it has been praised by various film historians and critics.***",,False,,t5_2rii5,False,,,True,t3_f14fh,http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeignMovies/comments/f14fh/has_anyone_dared_to_watch_salò_or_the_120_days_of/,

Hi everyone. 


I only got to see the last 20 minutes of that movie when I walked in to a friends room. He was streaming it from the internet and so I joined watching it to the end. 

Sadly, I forgot how the movie was called. I thought it was something along ""assasins"". But I couldn't find any more information, neither could my friend. It seems it was removed from the streaming site. 

Anyway. The last 20 minutes of this movie were kind of a show down. A western actor with curly blonde/red hair got shot and killed, two asian characters are fighting each other very dramatically. And the one guy got tied up on a chair at some point. 

The final were a few slow motion scenes, dramatic music and after the main character defeats his Rival he returns home to a very scared woman (probably the wife) and says, **he never was afraid at all.**  

The entire movie (according to my friend) took place in this one Set, a Hotel Appartment room in Hong Kong (asian furniture and stuff). And the credits said it was entirely filmed in Hong Kong. By Hong Kong films. Which is frustrating, because None of the lists of Hong Kong films note anything about this movie. 

 
I know my description is very bold, and blurry. But I was kind of high when watching it.

I hope any of you know what movie I'm talking about! It's really worth finding it. I need to get this on DVD.

All i know is that the movie is probably from Europe (sounded Italian, Spanish or Portuguese or something) The main protagonist is a young man who seems to find himself in a series of strange situations.

Its not an old movie itself, but set some time in the late 70s, 80s or early 90s (the cars didn't look that old)

I remember it was shown at in or around the same time as Rashomon (1950) on RTE 2 a few years ago if that helps.

Some notable scenes i remember:

2 men play a game of Frisbee with circular saw outdoors, and end up inadvertently killing an (annoying?) husband when the main character disrupts their game... the main character is then implicated in the man's death and is interviewed by police.

The main character is in a phone booth, and calls a captain of a ship, he fires a pistol into the receiver end of the phone, and the guy on the other end of the line gets shot..

A car stops suddenly on a road, and the car behind it does not crash into it, it ""overlaps"" / merges into the car in front - a woman in the car is distressed, while the male driver casually exclaims ""relax, i've got virtual drive"" or something similar ""virtual drive"" was definitely in the subtitles.

A flashback of the main character's mother's untimely death features her dancing in a quarry or building site, then being hit with a bulldozer or digger. (a narrator explains the details).

The main character's fat girlfriend, dramatically thins through sheer willpower when the two find themselves being chased and need to squeeze through a narrow gap..

I've seen this movie 6 years ago on TV, forgot the tile, and have been trying to track it down ever since.

When you think about films and Sweden, you may just at some point think about Ingmar Bergman, this giant of a filmmaker who still has an enormous and somewhat toxic influence over Swedish cinema. Toxic in as there were and still are quite a lot of directors in Sweden trying to be Bergman who are not up to snuff, resulting in stilted performances that films feels more like theatre than cinema. However not everyone shares the same filmmaking ideals as Bergman and most prominent of those opposing the perceived stuffiness of Bergman was Bo Widerberg.



Bo Widerberg was a man with a vision, a vision where people in flims actually talked like people, a vision where films dared venture outside of the safety of the soundstage, a vision where films felt alive and he articulated this vision in his 1962 book *Visionen i svensk film*|*A Vision of Swedish Cinema*.


Born the 8th of July 1930 in Malmö, son of artist Arvid Widerberg, Bo Widerberg was to Swedish cinema what François Truffaut or Jean-Luc Godard was to French cinema.


Starting his career as a writer he made his debut with *Hösttermin*|*Fall Semster* in 1952, he then went on to write several books and short stories as well as critique and journalism. The same year as he published *Visionen i svensk film* he got the opportunity to put his vision to celluloid with his debutfilm *Barnvagnen*|*The Baby Carriage* (1963). Later the same year he got his major breakthrough and first Oscar nomination with *Kvarteret Korpen*|*Raven's End*.


The international breakthrough came with the 1967 film *Elvira Madigan* gaining several awards and nominations (including BAFTA, Cannes and Golden Globes). Building on the success of Elvira Madigan he went on to make a string of successful films including a biopic focusing on Swedish-American labour activist Joe Hill (*Joe Hill*|1971), *the* Swedish crime thriller (*Mannen på Taket*|*The Man on the Roof*|1976) and a terrific political thriller (*Mannen från Mallorca*|*The Man from Majorca*|1984).


Towards the end of the seventies Widerberg moved from feature filmmaking to TV-production and theatre due to various reasons including his mounting problems with funding despite his acclaim.


Bo Widerberg was a political filmmaker who wanted to tell stories about ordinary people and also show the beauty and wonder that exists in the world often letting his characters experience a piece of music or a painting. Not being afraid to use a lot of film stock Widerberg would do retake after retake just to get that slight, unanticipated movement from an actor.


Likely suffering from bipolar disorder, the environment on set was chaotic and his lack of planning, frequently using various bits of paper for script, caused several issues. The most extreme example of which has to be the 1974 film *Fimpen*|*The Butt*, where he pushed the sound engineers to constantly redo the mix, causing one of them to go to hospital for heart problems. The soundmix took so long to complete that when the curtains were hoisted on the première the mix wasn't finished; the final scenes were still being worked on. The film started as the finalised reels were rushed from the studio escorted by police to the projectionist, however it worked, the reels made it in time and the audience didn't notice a thing.


In 1996 he founded *Lilla filmfestivalen*|*The small filmfestival* a more intimate filmfestival that takes places in one cinema, Bio Scala in Båstad, that focuses on arthouse films, seminars and dialogues with invited guests.


On the 1st of May 1997 Bo Widerberg died of abdominal cancer, leaving behind 14 films, 17 theatre productions, several books and four children.



**Further Reading/Main source**: *Höggradigt jävla excentrisk - en biografi över Bo Widerberg*|*Highly fucking eccentric - a biography of Bo Widerberg* - Mårten Blomkvist (2011); unfortunately an English release seems unlikely. However you can bug [the author on twitter](https://twitter.com/Filmdoktorn) if you want to.





### **Notable Works**



**Kvartert Korpen | Raven's End** (1963|[IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057237/)|[WIKI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven's_End))


Drawing on his own childhood experiences Widerberg tells the story of an aspiring working-class writer in Malmö, featuring some terrific performances, a moving story and great cinematography, it's easy to see why some regard this as the greatest Swedish film of all time.


**Elvira Madigan** (1967|[IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061620/)|[WIKI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\Elvira_Madigan_(film\)))



Based on the real life of Danish tightrope walker Elvira Madigan and her affair with Swedish cavalry officer Sixten Sparre, the film is pretty oh so very pretty. Grim, but pretty. Terrific performances all round and a great use of Mozart in the soundtrack.



**Ådalen 31**(1969|[IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065261/)|[WIKI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adalen_31))


Also based on real events Ådalen 31 takes place in the Swedish district of Ådalen during a major strike in 1931, focusing on a family and their life during a key moment in Swedish history. With the usual excellent cinematography, great acting and directing that Widerberg consistently delivered.



**Mannen på Taket | The Man on the Roof** (1976|[IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074857/)|[WIKI]
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_on_the_Roof))


This is the granddaddy of Swedish crime-thrillers and it has yet to be surpassed, ambitious, beautifully shot, well acted and with an intriguing (if straightforward) plot. However it's the characters who makes this adaption of the novel *The Abominable Man* by Sjöwall and Wahlöö stand out; they truly feel like distinct persons with their own ideas and motivations.



**Availability**: To the best of my knowledge only Elvira Madigan and Mannen på Taket have received English editions (and in the case of Mannen på Taket, it also being in English is not well communicated), however bitching nicely to Svensk Filmindustri [here](http://svenskfilmindustri.com/contact/) or [here](http://www.sfinternational.se/about/contact) about releasing a limited run of an international version of the DVD box set *Bo Widerberg - En filmografi* might work.


### **His legacy**


Despite leaving quite the mark on Swedish cinema Widerbergs influence pales to that of Bergman, he has his followers for sure (most notable of which at the moment is [Mikael Marcimain](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0545729/)) and he provided a much needed injection of energy into the industry. His Elvira Madigan was quite influential in its day and a lot of its imagery and even more so its use of music is now used to the point of it being clichéd.

And to some degree the tremendous success of Mannen på Taket is to blame for the 30+ films based on the same characters (most of which have been utterly awful), and god knows how many other subpar crime-thrillers that this cold nation of ours have produced.


However *Lilla filmfestivalen*|*The small filmfestival* instituted the Bo Widerberg Fellowship in 1997 and it has been given to some of the most vibrant and exciting talent that Sweden can muster. So with some luck we may soon have another eccentric giving another injection of the much needed energy that a lot of Swedish films lack.


Also, it doesn't feel right to conclude this post without posting [this wondrous interview from 1963](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkNSPnZJSVY) where he talks about using improvisation whilst his daughter is less than impressed and totally steals the show.

It is yet another South Korean vengeance film made in a similar fashion with Chan Wook-Park's vengeance trilogy. Starring Byung-Hun Lee (G.I. Joe) and Min Sik-Choi (Oldboy, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance) this film centers on the lengths that a special agent will go to exact vengeance for the homicide of his fiancé.

I thought this film was particularly interesting in that it came from the perspective of a special agent. A character who has many gadgets and tools at his disposal along with a knowledge of how to put those tools to use. Like other films of this vengeance drama, the events within the film are brutal. It is not for the squeamish, the actions of both the murderer and the special agent are relentless as they attempt to predict each other's next move.

With that I do recommend this film. It is not as ingenious as Oldboy, but it's a really cool film and if you have a theater that is playing it near you. I urge you to go.

""Mafioso,"" ""Parenti serpenti,"" and, more recently, Wertmuller's ""Too Much Romance"" all come to mind. Even ""L'ultimo bacio"" starts with a family dinner scene. The stereotypical Italian family yelling and shouting at the dinner table is one thing, but I'm starting to notice conspicuous gaps in dialogue filled in with everyone eating in silence. These often strike me as suggestive of parental disapproval, the generational ""gap,"" and in some cases family secrets to be revealed in the rest of the film.

This is what I remember about it.

_It was most likely released sometime in the past 10 years

-The movie was set in the future.  
-Primary characters were a male and a female. Male died at the end.

-Female had a baby. Think it was the guy's baby.  End scene showed her in a park after the baby was born, baby was in a stroller.

-The city reminded me of a 'cleaner' take on the city that the first half of ""the Fifth Element"" took place in.  Flying vehicles.  tall towers. etc.

-There was a scene outside of the city limits where there was a barrier that killed someone that tried to cross it.  Part of this scene involved the primary characters making it past this barrier.  Alsso it was snowing outside of the city.

I'm pretty sure the movie was french, but I dont want to say that was for certian.

I know it's not much to go on, but any help is appreciated.

I did not think Alejandro González Iñárritu and Javier Bardem would bring their best works to the table at the same time. The storyline is linear, surprisingly, yet in typical Iñárritu fashion, the each scene is so critical and can be interpreted in many ways. The movie is dark, yet the theme of the movie is about parent and child. Javier Bardem is what makes this movie so great. The emotions he draws as a dad and husband just connect to the viewer. Barden should win the best actor at the Academy Awards already. Another great thing is that the music is not overplayed. It is in the background and is kept minimal but at the same time have a great effect. The only backdraw,imo, for the movie was that it was kinda physically draining to watch.

I would watch those that were recommended to me, but was often disappointed. So I decided to get into one film-making country at a time, and create top lists, using IMDB, to motivate me to watch enough movies so that I would defenitely find and see the good ones. 

Here is a link to my IMDB profile:

And after a year of doing this I feel like I've hit another stop. I rarely find those really great movies anymore. I've looked into other countries as well, especially Brazil and India, but haven't found enough good movies to go deep into those countries cinema.

I prefer Chinese horror or action movies than the more arthouse movies. My favourite Chinese movie of all time has to be Once Upon a Time in China directed by Tsui Hark. It's got some pretty memorable sequences such as the fight scene in the American barricade, [the awesome opening sequence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN_hCJMVaAk) with the recognisable Wong Fei Hung theme, among others.

I think the movie was French, probably made around 1975 - 1982 (i don't know for sure)
The setting of the movie was the nineteenth century (Napoleon period)
The costumes of the actors where very beautiful.
The story is about young adolescents, four girls and four boys that were determined to have sex for the first time.
But when the four girls and the four boys had made a appointment,
they were all very nervous and when the moment was there something went wrong....
so nothing happens.
I can remember a scene with a fat boy that ate too much and therefore he couldn't do it.

Does anybody know the title of this movie?
I have looked everywhere but I never found this movie again.

I remember distinctly seeing a few trailers that looked interesting to me, and I just started thinking about them again, but can't find these two movies.  

One was about a this guy's mom who's forced to give guys handjobs in this club or something to earn money.  I think it was called like Madame Palms or something, only its not that, because that search turned up nothing.  At one point she says a line like, ""They say I have the best hands in ..."" or something like that.  I swear I'm not describing a porno!  I thought it was funny, and I've brought it up to friends before, but they think I'm making it up.

The second one was about this guy's mom who was in a coma or something, and then wakes up after this big historical event, like the Berlin wall coming down, maybe.  She still thinks it's the same way of life as before she fell into the coma, and her son doesn't want to tell her the truth, because she might get a heart attack and die from excitement?  So he tries to make it seem like she's living in the past.

I don't know if those descriptions are very clear at all, or if I'm even remembering them completely right.  I know the second one is foreign, and although I think the first one is in English, I don't think it's U.S. made.  Any help at all would be greatly appreciated!

It was a teenage(?) girl really dressed up, like she's going to prom or something. She is with a rugged looking guy who is older and they seem to be in a hotel lobby or something?  The movie is shot really griddy so the color is really yellow/green/blackish in tones.  

I believe it is raining outside, the girl makes a phone call and is very cheerful.  The other guy seems like they're going on a date or something as they exit the hotel.  I think he goes outside and she waits inside after handing the guy the phone.  Later another guy pulls up on his scooter.  He looks.. uh, kinda poor and younger like the girl is and the girl is excited to see him so she gets on.

It has action and almost seems like a romance erotica of a sort... I've only seen snippets of it and the plot is something like:

**Main Characters**

Three main characters, 2 guys and 1 girl. One guy is a police and the girl is his wife. The other guy is a criminal that just broke out of the jail.

**General Plot**

The criminal guy kidnaps the police's wife and the police goes on a chase to find him. The criminal guy continuously rapes the wife, and the wife begins to fall for him. Then the police finds them and engages in a fight with the criminal. They killed each other and the wife shoots herself.

**Some scenes I remembered**

1. When the criminal just got out of the jail, he runs into a restaurant and starts eating food this woman orders then proceeds to rape her in front of the whole restaurant. No one comes to help.

2. I think one of the sex scene between the criminal and the wife happened in an abandoned bus.

3. I think one of the sex scene between the criminal and the wife happens in some random house owned by a pair of newly weds. The wife of the newly weds tries to seduce the criminal (no idea what's going on).

4. The first building the criminal runs into after kidnapping the wife is some apartment house owned by an elderly couple.

5. The criminal and the wife goes to a small grocery store and the criminal robs the store, then proceeds to pay with the money he just robbed for stuff.

A boy explores an empty house or building, walks down the stairs, and then sees a large open window framing the sunny landscape outside. He smiles and runs toward the window; the camera tracks behind him, builds speed, and overtakes the boy on his way through the window.

I found a blurry DIVX copy of this a year ago and watched it twice. totally blew my mind. I have been waiting ever since then for the DVD to come out. This is an Indian film, and it is BANNED in India! A German DVD was issued earlier in the year, and then it was announced that a new company, Artsploitation, would be releasing it in the US. I watched it last night. I watch a lot of films and am always looking for cool, interesting, cutting-edge, mind-blowing stuff, which of course is rare. I can't think of anything as mind-blowing as this film. There is a behind-the-scenes feature on the DVD in which the German woman who produced it says ""Gandu is going to change things."" Trust me, you have never seen anything like this. Gandu is a low-budget indie film about a young man living in the slums of Kolkata. He is a bit frustrated with his dead-end life and dreams of becoming a famous rapper. There is a lot of music in the film. He meets a guy named Rickshaw, who drives a bicycle rickshaw and is obsessed with Bruce Lee. Later he wins big in the lottery and Rickshaw tells him he needs to find a girl, since he is a virgin. This leads to a very explicit sex scene (which is why the movie is controversial and banned in India), and the film switches from black and white to color. Very fast editing, intense film from start to finish. There is also a trip scene when they take some dhatura. And I haven't really covered everything - this film is loaded. Most highly recommended! And this new company Artsploitation has about 7 more films lined up to release soon, each from a different country.
