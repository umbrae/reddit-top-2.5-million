1360504711.0,426,self.SilkRoad,188vdw,My 10+ gram package with MDMA was intercepted at customs and I was called in for questioning by the police. AMA,482,56,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/188vdw/my_10_gram_package_with_mdma_was_intercepted_at/,"So I ordered a 10g+ package with MDMA from Silk Road that never arrived. I had ordered multiple packages from SR before, all of whom had arrived with no issues. I live in Scandinavia and ordered international as always. Usually a package would take about one week to arrive from this particular vendor so when it approached two weeks I started getting worried about the package being lost or intercepted. Luckily, I had done my homework thoroughly and was pretty confident that I was not in any legal trouble even in worst case scenario.

One month went without any news regarding the package. Then two months. I figured I had just lost the money and was a bit sad about this fact. This was by far my biggest order and I thought of it as an investement that would last for a LONG time onwards. (I had none intention of selling it, me and my friends just wanted to have a steady supply for the foreseeable future. I'm not sure if I'd be able to convince a jury the same thing though..)

This is not to say I wasn't paranoid. Indeed, I very much was. I did not talk about drugs on the phone ever. I never have, but now I made sure all my friends was painfully aware of this. I'd always played it safe on SR, not keeping any incriminated information on my computer or at my residence. Obviously, I didn't make any new orders either. It is hard to describe how much this fact helped me later on. Even though I only talked to the police - they never searched my computer or my residence, and probably didn't listen in on my phone calls either - knowing this gave me the necessary peace of mind to confidently deny any knowledge of the package.

About the two month mark I received a note by mail from the police, telling me that I was being summoned to come in for questioning in regards to a criminal investigation. No specific information. I was pretty sure it had to do about my missing package, but given how long they must had kept the package without contacting me and that the summoning was so vague that it could be about literally anything made me a bit uncertain nevertheless.

Turns out, it was about the package. They presented me with a photo of the intercepted package and told me it was drugs and that I would have to explain it to them. I told them I didn't know anything about it. I did not try to act surprised or anything, I told myself I couldn't beat them at this game, I just had to deny it and be confident that they had no real evidence. I really wasn't. Mentally, I had gone through everything I've ever done on SR and figured I was pretty safe, but I couldn't be absolutely sure. It was very nerve wrecking to say the least.

The police officer questioning me probably saw this. I tried to avoid eye contact and just looking down to the floor telling him I didn't know anything about it. He pressed me on it, told me which address it was sent from and if I knew the location or if I've been there recently. He asked if I used to order stuff online and what that would be and if I shared the mailbox with anyone.

There weren't to many questions. He told me that if I admitted to the crime early on, it would really make things easier later. When I made a statement denying knowledge about the package, he would write it down and exaggerate the statement tremendously and asked if this was correct (I had to say yes). I knew that if I was later to be found guilty, the police had really cornered me in this interview and in a way forced me to lie as much as possible.

They did also want information about my bank account. I granted them access (they asked for a specific time frame) and thought to myself that if they had some sort of vague evidence, my cooperation could be argued to show that I had nothing to hide. I did this because my bank account had none incriminating information and could only strengthen my defense. If they had any real evidence, they might just test my cooperation and get access nevertheless. Looking back I don't know if this was the right call, but luckily for me it turned out okay. I was let ago after maybe 15-20 minutes.

Again a surprisingly long time passed without hearing any news. I continued to lay low and just doing what I'd normally do. Then I received a new note in the mail telling me the case was dropped because of the state of the evidence. Unfortunately, I have not found a way to make any new orders that I'm comfortable about yet.

I wanted to share this story with the SR communtiy and I'm also proud of the system and of myself for playing it right and not getting caught. I have learned to be more concious about my privacy in other aspects of life and started to protect and encrypt my stuff on the computer just because ever since. Originally I wanted to post this on the official SR forum, but I'm to lazy to overcome the 50 post barrier, so /r/silkroad is a good no. 2. :)

##New buyers##

As a new member your immediate goals should be:

* Download PGP (Windows users should use Gpg4win) and visit a thread on [/r/Silkroad](http://www.reddit.com/r/silkroad) or on the Silkroad Forum to practice using it.

* Sign up for an account on [the forum](http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/) and start posting in the *Newbie* section to get your post count up to 50 so you can post elsewhere. There are usually threads in there dedicated to posting over and over to get your post count up.

* Get familiar with the *Rumor Mill* section so you can browse vendor reviews by type of drug or DoC (Drug of Choice) and you can also search at the top of that section to find a specific vendor.

* Get bitcoins transferred into your wallet so you can start ordering (discussed soon).

* Vendor feedback can be faked and is **NOT** to be trusted. ONLY order from reputable vendors in the forum from people with enough posts. This will take longer but it is how I've had nothing but 100% successful orders even when I was brand new. Don't give up!

* Vendors who have been there for more than 6 months and have over 100 transactions are very likely to be reputable, but still check the forums and DON'T FE!!!

##Things I wish I had known at first##

* Some vendors will ask you to **FE** (**F**inalize **E**arly) but you should **NEVER** under *ANY CIRCUMSTANCES* do this unless you are willing to part with your money. It doesn't matter how reputable the vendor is. In fact, the more reputable and the more transactions they have, then the easier it would be for them to rip you off, get away with it, and barely have their feedback affected!

* Go into your account settings and have it display amounts in US dollars instead of BTC (bitcoins); the prices become much more obvious.

* Use vendors that use the escrow system. That's why it's there! This can be easier said than done and it can be difficult to find a vendor that doesn't require FE but don't give up! So far I haven't had to FE once!

* Don't bother buying a bunch of small/cheap things to get your transaction count up. Vendors can see how much you've spent and scammers do this as well. It will do nothing but waste your time and money.

* When browsing drugs or other products, there is a checkbox at the top for ""domestic only""; check this! And you can also sort by relevance, vendor feedback, new vendors, etc.

* You cannot FE if the vendor is brand new. Vendors have to go through a process before they can sell on SR (I once heard they have to pay $500 or something, someone can chime in here). So if you have some BTC (bitcoins) to spare then you can try one of them also and if they never deliver, then just never finalize so your bitcoins go back into YOUR wallet. I'd recommend a reputable vendor first though personally.

* Once you place an order, **you cannot cancel it for 4 days.** So check to make sure the vendor is alive and active by looking at their feedback and it wouldn't hurt to send them a private message to guage their response time.

* Clicking the vendor's name takes you to their profile where you can see ALL of their listings and it shows you when they were last active.

##Getting bitcoins##

This is probably the most popular topic. There are places like Mt. Gox (mtgox) and other bitcoin exchanges to buy and sell bitcoins but I personally prefer *bitinstant*. Basically, it lets you buy bitcoins with MoneyGram (the blue slip) at a WalMart, CVS, 7-11, etc. Visit their website and take a look. It took me just a couple of hours to go from cash to real, usable bitcoins in my SR account.

##Security considerations##

As safe as Tor and SR is, you need to realize that the DEA and other agencies have been well-aware of SR for quite some time now. There is no telling what resources they may put into cracking down on it and contrary to popular belief, it is *not* impossible to be busted on SR. Please take all necessary security precautions to stay safe.

* Addresses you send get deleted but your information is only as safe as your vendor is! And if SR were to ever be discovered and raided, or *hacked* by a 3rd-party, any information could become publicly available and exist on the Internet forever. This is *very* unlikely to occur but it's at least worth mentioning. ALWAYS use PGP or Privnote!!!

* Do not be worried about buying bitcoins. It is not illegal and plenty of legitimate online stores take bitcoin payments. If you are already under investigation, it could raise further suspicion but at that point, it wouldn't be the bitcoins you should be worried about!

* Use your real name and address on orders and do not order to a vacant house and I would personally recommend *against* a PO box. You can never be 100% sure how well the vendor will package your drugs and if it's something like weed then having the cops there waiting for you to pick up your mail so they can bust you would probably cause a few problems in your life.

* Vendors **sell their accounts** sometimes when they are done. Another reason to never FE. Also, who knows if they got busted and law enforcement wants to fish for their customer base. (Very unlikely and probably not worth mentioning, but might as well).

A few weeks ago, I was staying with a friend who brought up silk road and was browsing the site.  We were discussing some of the things for sale like bud or psychedelics and truly I never really thought much of it after that.  I do have to say that I was a little concerned because my friend has been off heroin for nearly a year.  But he never said anything about heroin at the time and I thought he was ok.  When I got him off heroin the last time, it took a few weeks of constantly staying on his case and making sure he didn't have the time to use.  It was pretty easy because we worked together and lived maybe 5 mins away from each other so I was able to keep an eye on things.  He ended up moving to another town 3 hours away about six months ago and he was completely off heroin at the time. He had a great group of friends there and was going to shows and festivals like Waka, just enjoying life.   Little did I know that after I left, he ended up ordering some heroin and somehow managed to receive a double shipment of his order.  In secrecy he started using again and it seems to have gotten the best of him.  I don't think the H he bought was bad, I think that it was too pure and not what he was entirely expecting.  Ultimately, he ended up dying from an accidental overdose on Monday.  Today, in what seems to be the worst moment in my life, I have to bury my best friend.  I don't condone the use of hard drugs and I am not here to tell you what to do.  But if there is one piece of advice I can offer, just please be careful with what you are doing and how much you are using because this is the hardest day I have ever faced and I don't want you or any of your friends &amp; family to have to go through this.

It only takes a few idiots posting specific details of a sellers packaging methods to get a sellers shipments marked and hunted by the DEA/USPS and with the rapidity of this subreddit I'm sure it could happen before the seller even knows things were posted. The really ridiculous thing is the entirety of the conversation on this subreddit could be done on SR forums and that location is way more heavily moderated and controlled(I'm sure the mods here do what they can it's just ridiculous to even try on a clearnet public forum).

I've been ordering acid and mj from SR for about 4 months now, though mainly mj. I started off with 7g to try it out, after that I ordered 14g two times, this was my 4th purchase of mj and i became overconfident and ordered a QP, since 4/20 is coming up and i got my friends to pitch in so we would not run out, and maybe even make a little profit on the side. I should mention all orders were done from the same vendor, he is one of the best vendors on the SR and I don't blame him for what happened, I just got too cocky and shouldn't have ordered such a large package.

Now, I live in a uni apartment, and get all my shit mailed to my uni address. This means I have to pick up all my packages from the apt. office, sign and show my student ID. When we get a package we get a little notification from the uni saying ""you have a package, please come pick it up"", etc. Risky and maybe stupid I know, but I did my research, keep our entire apartment clean of any and all evidence, ordered from the stealthiest vendors, and hoped for the best. All my purchases usually took 3-4 days to arrive, but this QP was taking longer and I started to get suspicious. 

What do you know, on the 8th day I get a knock on our apartment door, a mailman in USPS uniform waving a pretty big box in my face asking me to sign. All sorts of alarms go off in my head and I'm about to panic, so I just sort of take it from him and hold it in my hands, looking at it. I paused for maybe 15 seconds (I honestly don't know, time stood still at that point) just staring at the box in my hands like an idiot, but then it suddenly hit me that yes, this is a controlled delivery and if you don't get your shit together your life will be ruined (i have an internship with a big government contractor, parents know nothing, etc.). So I feign suspicion and ask him ""Who are you? Is this some sort of scam?"" and he just looks at me and seems kind of lost and mumbles something about signing for the package. I gained a little confidence so I started pressuring him, ""We get all of our packages delivered to the university mailroom. No one ever goes directly to the address, regular postman would know that. I don't know who [sender's name that vendor used] is. Who are you? What is in this package? You are acting very suspicious. I am going to call the police and show them this package"", etc. And just like that I take the package inside and close the door on him lol (I do realize I should have just given it back to him and closed the door, but I wasn't about to let a QP go so easily, and foolishly thought maybe they'd let it go since I never actually signed anything) He knocked on the door once after that but I really didn't give a shit, as I'm pumped on adrenaline, can hear my heart beating in my ears, and am generally scared shitless. My roommate was looking out the window through the blinds (he smokes with me and when he heard me talking at the door assumed the worst) and later told me the guy just stood at our door for like 3 minutes looking helpless, then just left. 

We inspected the package thoroughly and thought it MIGHT have been opened, but I honestly couldn't tell for sure, and we sure as hell weren't going to open it after what just happened. ~15 minutes later I get a knock on my door and what do you know, guy in a blue jacket and a university cop behind him. He tells me he is a federal postal inspection agent, yadda yadda, and starts trying to intimidate me, saying they know i had drugs shipped to me, and they will get a warrant to search the premises if I don't give them back the package, etc., real bully tone and clearly much more ""in charge"" than the USPS worker (or whoever that was). At that point we still hadn't opened the box or tampered with it in any way, so I just took it and said ""please take it officer, I don't know who this sender is and this package does not belong to me"", and told them to have a nice day. 

It's been a week and so far no one has knocked the door down, so I'm assuming it's all over.

Tor is still solid (or as solid as it ever was).  What the recent Javascript exploits should really teach you is that security is a *process* and a *mindset*, and that downloading the Tor Browser Bundle on your main system (without understanding how anything is working underneath the hood) is really **NOT** enough to keep you safe.  

The maintainers of the Browser Bundle, for instance, leave Javascript globally enabled by default.  If you don't know why that's a bad idea (for the purposes of conducting illicit activities), just be satisfied with the knowledge that it's a really bad idea.

The point is, if you want to avoid being a victim to exploits like the ones we've recently seen, you need to think just a bit smarter and get a tiny bit more comprehensive with your OPSEC.

Compartmentalization is the name of the game.  Particularly if you use Windows or Mac OS X as your primary operating system (or even if you use Linux or whatever else, really),  I'd recommend installing [Liberté Linux](http://dee.su/liberte) to a USB flash drive and booting from that for browsing and purchasing from Silk Road (along with any other illicit activities you may participate in).  Yes, it is slightly inconvenient to wait a couple seconds for your computer to reboot, but I'd still take those few seconds every so often over a couple years in prison.  Do some push-ups while it boots.  You don't gotta stare at the screen.

If you simply do that ^ you can keep your spyware-ridden Windows 7 installation to play video games on if you want.  Keep it squeaky-clean of anything incriminating and you're golden.

It's really that simple (for now).  Just that one extra step will exponentially increase your security, and you don't need to bother with Tor or anything on your main system.  Javascript will not be enabled by default on your live-USB system so you won't even have to click twice to disable it.

Do consider it at least, if you're at all worried about recent happenings and don't already know what you're doing.

Stay safe, everyone!  A little inconvenience up front trumps potential future incarceration.  And don't hesitate to learn more about how the technologies keeping you safe actually work, if you're interested!

- bitcoins

purchasing bitcoins is LEGAL. it's surprising how few people know this- while it's true that btc are used for guns and drugs, it's accepted tender worldwide and even has central bank integration. 

you can buy bitcoins using your real name, address, bank details, etc. 

the transition from wherever you purchased coins to the silk road cannot be traced either. silk road tumbles your coins, sending them through so many transactions it's impossible to know where they ended up (hence why it takes so long). the coins WILL get there 

the legality and tumbling makes everything safe and anonymous- you really don't need to complicate the process.

after asking r/sr, keeping btc in your silk road account is safe but they're safer in your pc wallet.

- purchases

while purchasing IS illegal it is unlikely to be monitored or traced back to you.

try to buy things in small quantities that fit in envelopes, not crate packaging. attract little attention and make it clear you're a consumer, not a re-seller (the law goes after the distributors)

cocaine, heroin and prescription pills will likely always be expensive on the road; mdma and designer drugs will stay cheap. **check the forums before buying anything** for reviews, warnings and alternatives. seriously the message boards will be your biggest time + money saver and will put you on the right path.

- messaging / finalizing

yes, things take ages on the silk road- but if your experience is like mine, drugs are unfortunately just as slow in real life. vendors can and will take 24 hours to process orders or message you, don't start worrying until it's been more than a few days.

don't bother vendors with small questions or ask for constant updates. they're busy people. message them when they ask you to message back (for finalizing or confirming you're alive, say)

finalizing early means you immediately release bitcoins to the vendor before receiving the product (a sign of trust on your end or distrust on theirs). finalizing early is the most likely way to make sure your product doesn't get to your doorstep. please, please look at review threads, forum posts and ratings before choosing a vendor who will make you FE. some vendors are worth FE'ing for, but they are few and far between. 

- shipping

use your real name and real address. as torrrr points out, go to your post office/online and ask how to officially write your address (nothing suspicious about this) to accelerate sorting.

always use PGP. if they don't have PGP you shouldn't be ordering from them, but privnote will do.

don't bother with a PO box- they are not worth the hassle or cost and establish a more direct link to you and your drug purchases. 

order domestic to expedite shipping- many offer next day delivery because there are no customs. 

give it 3-4 days domestically before asking questions and AT LEAST a week/two weeks if internationally. stuff really does get lost or takes time to process. 

- receiving

it's usually very safe to sign for your stuff or receive it in person. most dealers will, weight allowing, ship in an envelope that fits in your slot. just make sure your postman looks like your postman and should you be fine.

___________________________________________

I hope that helps! Remember, while it is possible to be busted, following these tips should prevent anything bad from happening. 

You are most likely experiencing delays or have gotten FE scammed.

It's looking more and more like a restructuring of the tor software or even the tor network will be required to mitigate the kind of attack we are under.  If this can be solved by modifying the tor client software running the silk road .onion, then it will be a matter of patching and redeploying the hidden service.  If it is a network issue, it will require the cooperation of the Tor developers, or running a new network of nodes.  I haven't given up hope for a faster solution, but if one can not be found, then we will move to a semi private scheme where users will be given access through many private URLs.  I'll keep everyone updated on how we will move forward, but please be prepared for a few more days at the least of no access.""

Before I begin, let me just say that I know nothing about international shipments, or what the legal risks are in other countries.  This guide only applies to domestic orders within the US.

**Precautionary Measures**

 - Always use your real name and a real address.  Shipping to an abandoned house, or some other place that doesn't normally get mail with that name on it will raise red flags.  Remember, your local mail carrier knows where he delivers mail every day, and who he delivers it to.  If all the sudden he has a package going to an abandoned house, that's going to raise suspicions.

 - Don't order multiple different substances at the same time.  It's a lot easier for LE to make an argument for drug trafficking if you're importing multiple different substances.  Stick to one at a time.

 - Don't accept the mail directly from the mailman.  Just wait until he puts it in your mailbox and leaves, give it a few hours, just to make sure you're not getting a controlled delivery.  Your drugs aren't going anywhere, so make sure you give it time before opening it so you know you're safe.

**What are the chances of being caught?**

I forget where I read this, so take it with a grain of salt, but I believe Silk Roads overall success rate for packages is somewhere around 96%.  So to be safe, let's say your package has a 6% chance of being detected.  Now if that does happen, then they have to decide what to do about it.  The vast majority of the time, if it's personal use amounts and they don't have any other evidence, they will likely just send you a ""love letter"".  This is just a letter saying they intercepted a package with illicit materials in it.  If you get a love letter, consider that address ""burned"".  Never order anything illegal to it again, because it will likely be under more scrutiny.  If they have more evidence against you, or want to flip you for your seller, or just decide to go after you for whatever reason, you could get what's called a Controlled Delivery.

**Controlled Delivery**

1.) Postal Inspector finds your package and determines it to contain illicit material.

2.) A warrant is acquired, your package is opened, the illicit material taken out, and replaced with an inert look-alike material.  They seal it back up in a way that you can't tell they ever opened it.

3.) Surveillance and research is conducted on you and your house.  This phase can often last as much as a week.

4.) Police surround and contain your house.  Undercover cops will cover all possible routes of escape.  A postal inspector posing as a postal worker will come to your door, and ask you to sign for your package (assuming they have no other evidence, if they do, they might not need you to sign to arrest you).  They have a search warrant that is conditional on you accepting the package.  If you sign for it and accept it, the postal inspector will leave, and they will give you a few minutes to open the package to increase your guilt.  Then they will raid the house, finding any other illegal stuff, and arresting you.

**What to do if you get a Controlled Delivery**

Well, first of all, hope to god they have no other evidence against you.  If they can prove that you ordered the shipment, they no longer need you to sign for it.  They can just arrest you and raid your house.

If the only evidence they have is this package being sent to your house, then more then likely they will only be able to get a conditional search warrant conditional on you accepting the package.

What this means for you, is that no matter what you **DO NOT SIGN FOR ANYTHING**.  If anyone asks you to sign for a package that you think might be from SR, just say you didn't order anything, and you don't want to accept delivery when you don't know what it is.  There is nothing illegal about receiving drugs in the mail, as long as you didn't order them.  Anyone can put your name on a package and ship it out.

Your chances of getting a controlled delivery with personal use quantities is very low, but in the off chance you do get one, just don't sign for anything, and the vast majority of the time you'll make it out OK.

**Potential Criminal Charges**

 - Unlawful Shipping / Misuse of Mail System - It's a Felony to use the mail system to send or receive drugs.

 - Possession (possibly with intent to sell) - This generally depends on the quantity and number of different materials that you're caught with.  Could be a misdemeanor or a felony, depending on weight and number of different substances.

 - Drug Trafficking - If the package crosses state lines, this is a fairly easy case to make, again, assuming they can prove that you ordered it.  This is also a felony.

It is not crazy to think that if caught you could easily be facing multiple felony charges, and multiple years in prison.

Receiving drugs in the mail carries a stronger punishment then buying them from a local dealer.  It's important to know the potential risks if you're going to engage in something illegal.

My packers fucked up. The facility where I ship in Thailand ships for a number of people, and so far about four people (but I'm suspecting the number to come in at around a dozen) have either gotten something they hadn't ordered or their tracking number never worked at all. 

I am doing my best to fix this situation ASAP. People affected by this will be receiving double their order as an apology from me. 

IF YOU NEVER RECEIVED: contact me immediately with your zip code so I can look up your tracking number. If there isn't anything tracking, I will ask you to PGP your mailing address to me and I will get your order out to you by next Tuesday, along with a tracking number and (if you'd like), photographic proof that I am shipping out to you (which will be on a TOR-based site &amp; will be deleted as soon as you tell me you have seen it).

IF YOU RECEIVED SOMETHING OTHER THAN WHAT YOU ORDERED: Same as above, only instead of telling me your zip code, tell me what was in the box. I ask this because I know what was in it, and I need to weed out scammers (not that any of you would scam me).

Please let me fix this before you trash my account. If you already HAVE written a bad review,  please change it so that I can stay in business, and so that my ability to weed out who has and hasn't received won't be compromised. If you must leave a 1/5 &amp; a detailed review, this offer will unfortunately not extend to you.

Unfortunately I cannot offer refunds as I do not keep BTC on my SR account, and BTC is almost impossible to acquire here since it is illegal in Thailand.

I love you all, and I'm really sorry this is happening. Please let me make things right.

So here goes:  
  
1. Go to www.bitinstant.com  
  
2. Select cash to bitcoin address  
  
3. On your SR account, under ""account"" (on the top bar beside messages and orders) there should be a BTC address in green characters. Copy and paste that as the bitcoin address to send your BTC to on bitinstant.  
  
4. For your notification email they ask for on the bitinstant website form, use a tormail account for anonymity. This is free and super easy to set up. I use squirrel mail as it is the most basic. sign up here: http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/  and for the other info (name and DOB) make it up. but use the same fake info when you actually deposit the cash. I used my fake ID's info (I have a PA ID that I got from ID chief before he was shut down, so i use that info) 

5. After you fill that out, it will send you to zipzap. Follow the basic instructions there and use your real zipcode to find places close to you that will allow you to do this transaction. I chose CVS.  
  
6. follow the rest of their instructions and make sure you print out the pdf with all the information (account number and code and such). take this form with you to CVS.  
  
7. Go to the customer service department (or photo department lol this is where the moneygram stuff was when I went). Just pick up the red phone and listen. You will be asked an address, name, and phone number. SAY YOURE PAYING A BILL. I think they say ""press 2 for bill payment"". Press that. Then just follow the instructions on the phone and such. About the address and shit: Just give them any address and zipcode, same bullshit with the name. Any name will do (try and make sure it matches the fake one you originally used on bitinstant though just in case), and say you chose not to give your phone number.  
  
8. They will eventually tell you ""you are paying a company (zip zap) please go to the counter and tell them your name and that you are paying a company""  
  
9. go to the cashier and tell them you are so and so paying a bill/company with moneygram and they will confirm the amount of cash.  
  
10. after you give them the cash, you will be on your way! :) It should take a bit for the BTC to be confirmed.  

  
  
GENERAL INFO:  
Bitinstant will give you a specific amount. i.e. $242.97 and you MUST have exact change when you pay.  
  
Make sure you have enough. There is a 4% fee plus zip zap takes like $3.99. So to be safe, deposit 10% more than you need. I made this mistake yesterday lol. For example: you want $250 in your SR account. Deposit $250 + 10% ($25) so you'll deposit $275.  
  
If you go home and would like to see where your BTC currently are, take your SR address (or the address you sent to) and search it on www.blockchain.info and when that address has anywhere from 7-10 confirmations, it should appear in your SR account!  
  
It should take about an hour or two from depositing until the time when you have BTC in your account. Happy shopping :)

The first few weeks of browsing SR I made a mental list of all the things I wanted to try. I wanted some coke, a little molly, some 'shrooms, LSD, maybe some adderoll and a few valium just in case I get too crazy. I even ordered some of the stuff on my list. 

What I found out, though, is that once the veil of secrecy is lifted and the drugs lose their mystique they're just not that exciting. Sure I can snort a crushed up adderoll and feel jittery as fuck for a couple hours. That just doesn't do it for me. A big part of the attraction to the drugs in the first place was their forbidden nature. 

So, now even though I have the know-how and ability to order some of the most powerful mind altering drugs on the planet. I can have the postman deliver some of the most illegal shit you can get, I'm not all that interested.

Hey      l, (or is it James?)
For a guy who acts so smart and is so quick to ridicule anyone over in the SR sub, you've certainly acted pretty stupid (dat dxm!)with respect to your personal security.
As the subject line states, you've been doxxed. A smart guy like you knows that means we've combed through your history looking for clues to identify you. We've found all kinds of good stuff like your profile on dating sites. Lying about your age to fuck younger chicks, pretty clever. We've got the membership to the bestiality website from a few years back, which makes us kinda wonder what really happened to your poor dog. And of course we have all the drug posts from all the different forums.
We've come to the point in the process where we have the vital clue that will positively identify you. In this case, it's just a paid search away. We'll leave you guessing as to what the key piece of evidence is, but it's info easily looked up by the law enforcement or postal inspectors in *location* / *location*.
Here's the deal. Because of your general attitude (racist, homophobic, arrogant, shitty taste in music) and stupidity (let yourself be compromised endangering the community), you've been assessed a fine of 3 BTC. Because we're reasonable and you're not rich, we have a payment plan where you can pay .25 BTC per week until you can scrape together the 3 BTC to make a lump some payment.
Deposits must be made to this wallet by the end of Friday each week (starting tomorrow): 16cH1GigX3GCNUvwyTs5mqrBvU8CniG22T
If you fail to make the payment, we will identify you and send the info to your local LE and postal inspectors. At the same time, orders will be placed from SR to your name &amp; address with tipoffs. The fine goes up to 10 BTC (.5 / week) plus expenses (the funds lost in escrow when your account is banned for being a scammer). Still won't cooperate? Stage 2 involves dark content from the dark web; we call it the reputation wrecker. Get the picture?
Rules * Do not reply, we'll get a hold of you if needed * Do not discuss in forums or IRL, SR world small enough that forums can be monitored. *Weekly payment not credited towards fine, think of it as interest. *Fine must be paid in 1 lump sum payment. *Information file deleted automatically upon payment *Keep this reddit account active.
TIPS: *Delete your old comments *Use different usernames for different sites. *Take a break from drugs and get your shit together *Stop listening to that awful Horse the band *Stop being a dick on the forums
Hope you'll learn a lesson from all of this. That wallet one more time is:
16cH1GigX3GCNUvwyTs5mqrBvU8CniG22T
Remember, payment due tomorrow.


All of this information is publicly available, but these whack-jobs took the time to put it all together.  I'm not sure if I pissed somebody off and this is their way of ""revenge"", or what.

Lets put an end to this.,141,27,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1h2bja/supertrips_is_selling_fentanyl_as_heroin_for_over/,"I'm sure many of you are familiar with the vendor supertrips. A few months ago my friend ordered a gram of ""supertrips #4 heroin"" from UGS a domestic reseller of supertrips products. We split that gram and after a couple of days of using it we were both thoroughly convinced we had not been sold heroin but some other potent short acting opiate. We however were inexperienced with H at the time so we didnt bother to msg UGS. Over the next two months I began to see reports on the SR forums and in supertrips feedback that he was selling fentanyl as h. I assumed it was just a couple bad batches and decided to order a gram of supertrips ""afghan #4 heroin"" around the end of may to see for myself because supertrips was offering a g at a ridiculous price. Well a couple days ago I received it and immediately marquis reagent tested the product. To my dismay the test was negative for diacetylmorphine (heroin), monoacetylmorphine, and morphine. That's right there wasn't a single molecule of actual heroin in the gram of powder I was sold. Clearly supertrips has been scamming people for over 4 months and he STILL has ""afghan #4 heroin"" listings. 

I cant post on the SR forums or I would have already made a post warning others. If someone could make a post that would be awesome. I've already reported supertrips using the ""report vendor"" feature on his vendor page,and opened a ticket but I thought I'd ask you guys to also take a second and report supertrips for scamming. If anyone wants I can post photos of the marquis reagent test results. Lets keep SR an honest place we can't have huge vendors like supertrips scamming freely so I ask all of you to take action against him by visiting his vendor page and reporting him. If you don't believe me check supertrips feedback there are multiple people who have complained about this issue.

IX) ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS

-------------------------------------------------

I) INTRODUCTION

First of all, I'm no security expert. The following guide will be nothing but technical instructions to securing your machine to make digital information storage and transmission secure.

Your security is divided in 3 parts. Also remember your security (as in lowering chances to  get caught) is only as strong and your weakest link. Those 3 parts are : 


a) Money

You can (and will) get caught if you aren't careful with how you move money. Banks and LE work hand-in-hand to trace money. I won't cover that aspect but you need a bulletproof way of buying (if you are a buyer) and/or selling (if you are a seller) your bitcoins.


b) Drugs

Yes, you'll get caught if you don't handle drugs in a secure fashion, ldo. It includes shipping, stealthing, receiving packages, storing. You get the idea.


c) Information

Here is the part I'll develop in this guide. How to handle information (mostly digital information) to not get caught and be as stealthy as possible.

II) SOFTWARES USED AND LINKS

All the following softwares are :

1) Free - you don't have (and shouldn't, as sad as it sounds for security reasons) to pay anything to fully use them

2) Open source - Anyone with knowledge can see what the programs are made of. Def a security plus.

We will need (In order of use) :


a) a good anti-virus

Before even starting the job, we need to make sure we're working in a safe environnement. If you have a keylogger installed on your computer then all futur steps will be for NOTHING. So if you don't have an updated AV installed yet, get one.
I personally use AVG. Here is the link but it's recommended you search it yourself using google, after all, I could be a hacker myself.

http://free.avg.com/

b) a password manager

You'll need to save at least 5 complex passwords. I strongly recommend using a password manager (with passwords creation) such as KeePass. It's multi plateform (windows/linux/android).

http://keepass.info/

c) TrueCrypt

Very powerful piece of software which allows you to encrypt files/folder or even full system partition using bulletproof algorythm such as AES.

http://www.truecrypt.org/

d) VirtualBox

Very powerful software which allows you to run a completely autonom virtual machine inside your physical machine.

https://www.virtualbox.org

e) Ubuntu 13.04

Free OS. Very safe. Not so user friendly but you'll only use it to browse SilkRoad and use PGP (more on that later).

http://www.ubuntu.com/

d) Tor Browser Bundle (TBB)

A package of pre-configured software to use TOR. Awesome.

https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en



III) ENCRYPTION USING TRUECRYPT

I assume you already installed the antivirus and ran a minutious scan on your system. Your system was clean already ? Great, you can read what's next.

So first, we want to create an encrypted folder so that we can install a complete different OS in it. It'll be 100% safe and impossible (without the passphrase ldo) to know what it is you are putting in the folder.

a) Click on ""Create Volume""

b) Select ""Create an encrypted file container""

c) Select ""Standard TrueCrypt volume""

note : Do your research on which option you want to use.

d) For Volume Location, select where you want to save the file. Type in a random name and click ""save"" then ""Next""
!! Note : You can select a USB pendrive (with at least 10GB and USB 3.0 strongly recommended) so that you have a portable, encrypted OS. Very useful since that you can physically hide it from LE in case of a search at your place) !!

e) Encryption Options

I advise to use AES. The technology is old which, in security, is a good thing since it means it has been tested by many security experts.
I don't know about Hash Algorithm. I think I use RIPEMD-160 but it's up to you to do your godamn research on which option you want to use.

f) Volume Size

Pick at least 10gb, (no more than 15GB really).
Note : TrueCrypt will encrypt the whole 10GB no matter what it is you put in, even empty space. So consider the number you type in (10GB here) as gone once you click ""Next"".

g) Volume Password

Open KeePass (!!!!!!!! with a strong masterpassword !!!!!!!!) and generate a random passphrase using at least 15 (25+ advised) characters (with lowercase, uppercase, numbers, symbols, space everything checked). Save it carefully, and copy paste it twice in TryeCrypt.

h) Large Files

Select ""Yes""

i) Volume Format

Move your mouse randomly (to create randomness in the Key) a few seconds then click ""Format"", wait.

Congratulation, you now are the owner of an encrypted file container.

IV) CREATION OF A VIRTUAL MACHINE USING VIRTUALBOX

First, you need to mount the encrypted folder you just created. For this, open TrueCrypt, and click on random letter (remember it and always use the same to avoid corruption). I personally use R: (don't ask me why, I guess I used it the first time and it stuck).
Then, click on ""Select File"" and browse to your newly created folder, click on ""Open"".
Then, click on ""Mount"", it'll ask for your passphrase. Open it with KeePass and copy past it. Click ""OK"". If everything went well, you can know access your encrypted folder using Windows Explorer in computer. Truecrypt created a virtual partition.

Okay, so now, off to creating a Virtual Machine. You must have downloaded Ubuntu 13.04 (700MO or so). Good, save the .iso file somwhere.

a) Open VirtualBox, click on ""New"". In name, type in Ubuntu, it'll automatically select the type and version needed. Click ""Next"".

b) Memory Size. 
It's the amount of RAM you want to allocate to your virtual machine. I personally have 12GB of RAM and I allocated 4096MO to my VM (virtual machine).
Note : Consider that the amount of RAM you give to your VM gone from your physical machine. Even if you don't run anything on your VM, the amount given (4096MO) won't be usable by your physical machine until you shutdown your VM.
Click ""Next"".

c) Hard-Drive.
Select ""Create a virtual hard drive now"", click ""Create"".

d) Type of hard drive file
Select ""VDI (Image disk VirtualBox)""
Click ""Next"".

e) Select ""Fixed Size"", click ""Next"".

f) File location and size
For location, click the yellow folder and go to the letter you mounted the file in TrueCrypt (for me R:\the-name-of-your-VM.vdi)
In size, pick whatever the amount of GB you allocated to the crypted folder MINUS 1.5GB.
!! Note : very important. For exemple, if your crypted folder is 10GB, you must pick 8,50 Gio. !!
Click ""Create"" and wait a minute or two for VBox to create your VM.

V) TWEAKS TO VBOX

Here are the settings I use for my SilkRoad Machine.

To access settings, in VirtualBox, select your newly created VM and click ""Configuration"".
Go to the onglet ""System"" =&gt; ""Proc"", select a reasonnable Value (where the green and red meets is generally ok). Type in 90% in allocated ressources.
Go to the onglet ""Display"" =&gt; ""Video"", select a reasonnable Value (where the green and red meets is generally ok).  Number of screen, 1 by default. You can use more screens if you have more than one. Vbox supports it beautifully. 
Click ""OK"".


VI) INSTALLING AND SETTING UP LINUX

a) Open VBox, select your virtual machine in the left and click ""Start"" at the top. You now are running your virtual machine.

Now you must install Linux on it. A window will pop up and ask you to select a booting disk. Click the yellow folder and browse to the Ubuntu.iso file you previously downloaded. Click on ""Start"".

You VM will now boot using Ubuntu. Install it, check ""Download updated while installing"", leave everything else as is.

Select ""Erase disk and install Ubuntu"". File in the settings needed. In name, type whatever you want (note : I usually just type in the same letter I used to mount the folder with TrueCrypt). Pick a password (a new fresh password, that one isn't necessarily important but make sure you remember it). Select ""Require my password to log in"", you don't mind extra lawyers of security. Click ""Continue"". Now, wait, the installation can take up to an hour or two. 

When done, click on ""Restart Now"". When rebooting, you will be asked to if you want to boot using the installation, DON'T anything and wait. Now you have a beautiful orange/purple page asking you for your password. Type in the password you wrote during the installation process and press Enter.
Welcome to Ubuntu.

b) You need to setup a few things.

First, you can go fullscreen pressing Right CTRL + F (the CTRL next to the arrows on the right of your keyboard). Better, right ?

You'll notice those black borders onto the sides. That's ugly and bad for your eyes. To remediate, you need to install a pack of drivers especially made for Virtual machines. 

To do so, put your cursor to the very bottom center of your screen (if you are in fullscreen mode, else you have access to the options at the very top of the window). Click on ""Peripheric"", Click on ""Install Guest Additions"". An autorun window will open up, select ""Run Software"" and click ""OK"". Enter your Ubuntu password. Click ""Authenticate"". An ugly purple window will open with ugly white characters, it's the terminal. We'll use it later for different stuff. Wait a minute or two until you have the terminal says this ""Press Return to close this window..."". Press Return on your keyboard (above Enter) to close the window, ldo.

Reboot the virtual machine by going to the very top right of your screen.
Now to go the options, on the left, you'll see a dock of icons, click the Gear with the Red hammer or whatever you call it in english (I know it's not a hammer). Double click on ""Displays"",  pick your favorite resolution. Click ""Apply"" then ""Keep that resolution"". Much better, cierto ?

You will notice the OS seems slow and laggy, even more so if you installed your VM on a USB pendrive. To remediate, follow those steps.

Run the terminal (push ALT + F2 and type in ""Terminal"", double click to open it.
Copy past that command :

/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p

The following should appear :

Not software rendered:    no

Not blacklisted:          yes

GLX fbconfig:             yes

GLX texture from pixmap:  yes

GL npot or rect textures: yes

GL vertex program:        yes

GL fragment program:      yes

GL vertex buffer object:  yes

GL framebuffer object:    yes

GL version is 1.4+:       yes

Unity 3D supported:       no


As you can see, 3D acceleration isn't activated. To activate it, return to terminal and copy past that command, enter password when asked. When ""asked to continue [Y/n] ?"", type in Y then press enter.


sudo bash -c 'echo vboxvideo &gt;&gt; /etc/modules'

Shutdown the virtual machine (you can do it manually inside the VM or press Right CTRL + Q and select ""Send extinction signal"".

Go back to VirtualBox and go to configuration =&gt; display. Check Activate 3D acceleration.

Boot your VM, open terminal and type

/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p

You should now see that Unity 3D is supported and your OS is fluid. Don't expect native performances tho, it's still an emulated OS.

VII) INSTALLING TOR

Run your VM. Open a firefox window and go to https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en

Select the Linux version and download it. Close Firefox. We want to use that machine on the clearweb as little as possible.

Unpack (or drag&amp;drop) the tor-browser_en-US folder in the folder ""Home"" or desktop or whervere you want.

Open the folder and double click on ""start-tor-browser"". It will open a weird text editor with gibberish stuff in it. Close it. We need to activate an option first.

Push ALT, in that window, type ""dconf-editor"" and press Enter.
In dconfg-editor go to: org =&gt; gnome =&gt; nautilus =&gt;preferences
Click on ""executable-text-activation"" and from drop down menu select:
""launch: to launch scripts as programs.""
Close dconf-editor.

You can now launch TOR. and browse anonymously the road.
I strongly advise you to install KeePass for linux by going to Ubuntu Software Center to save passwords for Silkroad as well as your PGP passphrase.


VIII) SHORT INTRODUCTION TO PGP VIA THE LINUX TERMINAL


PGP is a powerful protocal that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages and files. It has been used for over 15 years and is the standard all over the world for industry and governement communications.

So first, we must create our own set of keys.

A) Creating your own keys

To do so, open the terminal and type GPG.  It will reply :

gpg: Go ahead and type your message ...

Ok, you've got GPG installed already, perfect.

To create your key, type :

gpg --gen-key

Type 1 then hit Enter

You'll be asked to chose between 1024 and 4096 bits. Chose 4096 (the most secure), hit Enter.

Next window, type 0, press Enter, then type Y, press Enter.

You are now asked to enter your name, it's important you don't type in your Real Name obviously but it's also important to chose something that identifies you. I chose my Silkroad name so that my contacts know the key is mine.

Email adress : a@a.a or whatever you want, shouldn't be real.

Comment : none, press Enter

Type in ""O"" to confirm, press Enter

Enter passphrase, very important to chose something very secure. As usual, open up KeePass and generate a strong passphrase, there is no limitation AFAIK.

Then you'll be asked to do random stuff on your computer to generate bytes to ensure randomness in your key pool. Do stuff, open a random file and type in stuff for exemple. Once it's done (it can take a few minutes), you now have your own set of keys.

What we want to do know is to export the public key so that you can share it with your sellers/buyers.

Type :

gpg --armor --export your-email-adress-used-before

Copy paste the public key in a .txt file on your desktop and share it whenever you buy/sell.

B) Importing a public key

To send a message to someone, you must important its key. To do so, create a document and copy paste the key there, close &amp; save it.

Now, open seahorse (hit ALT and type in Seahorse, open the program called ""Passwords and keys"".

Put your cursor in the very top left of your screen and click file =&gt; import, select the file you saved the key in. Done.

C) Encrypting a message

Open the terminal and type :

gpg -ear name-or-email-of-your-contact &lt;&lt;end

Press Enter
Type your message

Press Enter, finish by typing ""end"" and press Enter again.

You'll have your encrypted message. Something that looks like that :

-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----

-----END PGP MESSAGE-----

You can now send the encrypted message to your contact.

D) Decrypting messages

Open the terminal and type :

gpg -da &lt;&lt;end

Press enter, then copy paste the message you received.
Press Enter, finish by tiping end then press Enter again.

You will be asked to enter the passphrase to decrypt it. Open KeePass and copy paste it. The result will be like this :

You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: ""abcd &lt;a@a.a&gt;""
4096-bit RSA key, ID xx, created 2013-05-08 (main key ID xxx)

gpg: encrypted with 4096-bit RSA key, ID xxx, created 2013-05-08
      ""abcd &lt;a@a.a&gt;""
ENCRYPTED MESSAGE TO THE SILK ROAD HERE 

You can now safely converse with your vendors.

IX) ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS

I hope everything worked well. Finally, the most important security advice someone can give is to use your brain. Don't do anything stupid and you should be fine.

Feel free to discuss issues you may have encontered here or by PM, I'll gladly help you getting setup.

Remember also that your security is only as good as your contacts security. For exemple, if your seller is stupid and keeps detailed informations of his buyers on file, then there isn't much you can do in case he gets caught.

I could have sold this tutorial but I chose not to because my personnal security is guaranteed only if yours is aswell. You get my point.

Post your question - stupid or otherwise - here to get an answer. Anyone can post a question and the community as a whole is invited and encouraged to provide an answer. Many questions get submitted late each week that don't get a lot of action, so if your question didn't get answered before, feel free to post it again.

I do ask that you refrain from abusing noobs in this thread. Feel free to link to guides, wikis, forums, other subreddits (particularly /r/bitcoin and /r/drugs [though many on the Bitcoin subreddit don't take real kindly to SR]), or the FAQ, though.

Link semi-related:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aeukmFc3sU

Also, I wanted to mention that scam attempts are ongoing in this subreddit. It's mostly the same guy, probably from China (based on the domain registrar) posting links to a fake Bitcoin exchange with a similar name to a legitimate bitcoin ecommerce site. The site claims to accept Paypal and debit/credit cards for Bitcoin, which no legitimate Bitcoin exchange does directly. He's using a rotating array of obscure URL shorteners to evade the automatic sitewide spam algorithm. His usernames are usually, but not always, gibberish, and usually, but not always, only used to post one comment or link. Some of you report it when you see it, and I'm thankful for that. Downvotes don't put things in the moderation queue, so please always report it when you see it. I delete and ban it when I see it and I know other mods do as well. There are other scams, but that's by far and away the most common one. 

Another thing I want to mention is that you should never use onion.to for SR-related tasks. You lose all anonymity by going that route. Your ISP and/or your university IT department can tell exactly what you're looking at if you use it. Even if you visit onion.to using Tor, malicious Tor exist nodes could be used to compromise your anonymity. The Tor Browser Bundle is a seriously easy thing to install and use, and Orweb/Orbot is not much worse.

5/2:


I am not selling poison anymore.


Try to imagine what it is to risk everything to accumulate more than $500,000 worth of product, only to realize how wrong it is, and to flush all that time and effort down the toilet.


If you knew what I know you would not be taking poison anymore. If a poisoner like me can get clean through the grace of God, anyone can. If you think you have done bad things, I have done worse.


I have raped and murdered.


Yet when I bit out the flesh of my own wrists and threw myself into a secluded, frozen river, God brought me back from death.


My body was 33 degrees when I was brought unconscious into the hospital.


God has shown me in an unequivocal way that we can be freed from sin and born again through the Son. If you are like I have been, and not among the faithful or the observant, all you need do is pray and God will answer.


I will conclude by saying that you cannot imagine how much better you will feel to be sober. If you are using you are walking a thin line between life and death and your Judgement Day may be close at hand.


Believe me when I say that you do not want to lift up that veil to the other side when your house is not in order. Make haste now so that you may yet learn of true happiness and joy, which is the love and compassion God has for us all.


Hail Mary, full of grace.
Our Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women,
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

To make matters worse there was still 3 packages in *transit*. And they were all going to a flagged PO box.

They also must assume risk if it backfires and something like this happens. This is NOT the way to do business, and it says a lot about vendors who do shit like this.

**This post covers US law, particularly CA law, but anything I say in here should still be relevant to your state.**

First let me start off with this:

This is a picture of my Drug Offender Registration card.  That's right, I'm a registered idiot.

http://i.imgur.com/uDdxNBq.jpg

This is a picture of court paperwork from my two drug cases.

Now that we got that out of the way, I'd like to type out some of the things that I have learned since my arrest, and how they relate to SR.

EDIT: Let me just add that my arrest was NOT related to my use of SilkRoad.


**""Mom... I'm in jail...""**

It seems to me that the majority of SR users have never been through the legal system, and don't have a firm grasp of how it works.  Here is what happens when you are arrested for drug possession:

1. An officer pulls you over, or searches you, and finds drugs on your person.

2. You will be transported to the county jail, or possibly a smaller substation until they move you to county.

3. You'll get to county and be booked by a booking officer.  This means fingerprints, DNA SWAB (They will now have your DNA on file) and they will set a bail amount based on your charges.

4. You'll be interviewed, given the opportunity to snitch (more on this later), and then held in a holding cell until you either decide to bail out, or be ""housed"" in jail with the other inmates.  Forget everything you've seen on TV about jail.  If you ever end up here, just know that everyone in there is ready to fight at a moments notice, but they don't actually want to.  Be respectful, DO NOT touch anyone's stuff without asking first, don't even sit on someone else's bed without asking for their permission.  YOU ARE A GUEST HERE, ACT LIKE IT.

5. If mommy and daddy haven't bailed you out yet, the county now has 72 hours (BUSINESS DAYS, Weekends don't count) to arraign you.  At an arraignment you will be read your charges, and then appointed a public defender if you can't afford a real attorney.  If the judge determines that you can afford a real attorney, then it's your responsibility to find one and sort that out.  (Keep in mind you can only make collect calls from jail)

6.  At this time the judge will set your bail again.  If you don't have a record, and you have a stable place of residence (that is in the county you were arrested in) you will be most likely released on your Own Recognizance (OR'd).  An OR Release is basically just a promise to come back to court, without you having to post bail.  They need to free up space in the jails, so they release nerdy white kids like us to make room for others (mostly violent offenders, and those on probation holds that aren't eligible for an OR release.)

7.  If for some reason you aren't OR'd, you're fucked.  You'll be in jail until you either bail out, or are released from jail after having served your sentence.  During this point in time you will be shitting your pants because, A) You will have limited contact with family and friends and B) You don't get to just ""talk to your lawyer.""  Unless you can afford a private attorney (trust me, you probably can't,) you won't talk to your attorney until you go to court, and all he will do is tell you how fucked you are.

Notes on Jail Reality VS Movie Jail:  The cops are going to ask you where you got the drugs.  They might even tell you that they can ""ask the judge to go easy on you,"" or make other promises.  If you have come this far, THE COPS CAN NOT HELP YOU.  TALKING TO THE COPS CAN NOT HELP YOU.  Be polite, be respectful, but **do not be a snitch.**  The police have already arrested you, even if they wanted to, they can't just ""drop charges"" or ""let you walk.""  They are now legally bound to due process law, meaning that they have to get you in front of a judge within 3 business days.  You can only dig your hole deeper at this point by talking to the police, I mean it!  The cop might even seem like a nice guy, he probably feels for you, you're just a dumb kid who made a mistake, you don't even really do drugs!  You don't belong in jail!  You go to a university!  Too bad, doesn't matter.  

More about talking to police:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkZf6_jK3Zs  This is an AWESOME lecture about police interaction, about the process that they go through, and more relevant stuff.  It has some pretty funny parts too, it's not as boring as it sounds.


*Now,* people on the SR subreddit seem to think that every case is like they see on Law &amp; Order.  ""Well I can argue plausible deniability!"" ""Well they have to prove that I ordered the drugs!""  Sure, the burden of proof is on them, IF IT GOES TO A JURY TRIAL.  The process of taking a case to trial is MONTHS down the road, and if you haven't bailed out by now, you will be sitting in jail for months waiting for this to happen.  Over 90% of cases never make it to trial.  After your initial arraignment, you'll appear in court several more times (I went to court 12 times over the course of three months before I was released from jail) and every time, you are at their mercy.  You don't get to argue your case, until it actually goes to trial, in fact there is VERY little interaction that happens between you and a judge, most of it is between you and a lawyer, and the majority of it is just you waiving your rights.  

Keep in mind that during this time you are missing classes, work, and everything else you had planned. (And if you have kids you are REALLY FUCKED.  *CPS FUCKED.*) Can you afford to get dropped from a class, or lose your job?  Think about this!

**So how does this relate to SR?**

You get caught having drugs delivered to your house.  You are in possession of drugs.  Whether it is through a controlled delivery, a raid after they get a tip from the post office, is irrelevant at this point.  You will be charged with drug possession, and you will spend AT LEAST three days in jail before ANY decisions are made (if you don't bail out, which will cost you 10% of your actual bail amount (In my case this was about $5,000) that you will never get back, do you have $5,000 on hand?  I don't either.)  All the cops have to prove is that you have drugs in your hand/pocket/car/house/body in order to take you to jail, anything else is not their job.  If you have a public defender representing you, he is not going to have this big elaborate case made out for you.  He is going to tell you to accept the first deal they give you (this part varies from state to state, in some states you can go to prison for having a joint on you, I am fortunate enough to live in CA where drug laws are extremely lax and focused more on rehabilitation to make room for all of our real criminals in our overcrowded prison system) so that he can move onto the next case.  

**About taking your case to trial:**

""Ok,"" you're thinking, ""So what?  I'll take it to trial and explain to them that I had no idea the drugs were being shipped to my house! Anyone could have done it!"" (Yeah... right... explain to a jury of 12 soccer moms that the 4 foot bong you have sitting in your room is unrelated... sure.)

Sure, you could take it to trial.  Here's the issue with that, by taking it to trial you have given up your ability to plea bargain and accept a lesser punishment for your crime.  Now, if they do win at trial, they are going to really ream you for wasting the county's time and money in the court system.  So now, since you passed up their offer of 90 days in jail and 120 hours of community service w/ 2 years probation, they are gonna give you the low term on a felony charge that carries 6 months/1 year/3 years!  Shit!  Do you want to risk that in a court room?  I sure don't. 


So that's some of what you are looking forward to on the post-arrest side of things, let's look at pre-arrest:

**""Fuck, we're getting pulled over!""**

You've got a couple girlies in your car, on the way to a show, and you have some weed and maybe some of Nawlin's 25i-NBOME. *""BUT NBOME ISN'T A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE I KNOW MY RIGHTS!""  Lawl, you're still fucked.  They'll arrest you on suspicion of LSD possession, and they aren't gonna drop that charge until your drugs come back from the lab and they know what they are, and guess what, the lab is backed up for at least a month!*  Anyways, you're cruisin' and you get pulled over, FUCK!  Now what?

Be polite, be respectful, make the officer feel safe and like you have nothing to hide.  This is not the time to run your smart ass mouth about how ""I know my rights you pig, and you better have reasonable cause because YouTube told me I don't have to tell you shit!""  This is the time to sit down, shut the fuck up, and do what the cop says.  UNTIL HE ASKS YOU, ""Do you mind if I take a look in your car?""

If the cop feels the need to search your car, he will.  And if he asks you this, you're already fucked.  DO NOT CONSENT TO A SEARCH.  It might be intimidating telling a cop ""No, you do not have my permission to search my car,"" but it is a HUNDRED times better than saying ""Sure go ahead,"" thinking that he won't find your stash.  Because when he does find it (and he will!) you just buried yourself.  I have been pulled over, told the cop ""Go ahead man, search away, I've got nothing to hide!"" and ended up in jail because I did have shit in the car.  I have also been pulled over TWICE that I DID NOT consent to a search, and they didn't search my car and sent me on my way.  Particularly if it is late at night, they might have trouble getting a warrant, and they **hate** getting warrants and then not finding anything, so there is a very good chance they will just not bother with the warrant, tell you to go home and have a safe night, and keep going.  Consenting to a search though is just opening the door for them to find your shit.

**Do you have anything in the car I need to know about?**

NO.

I know you think being honest with the cop and telling him ""Well, I have a little bit of coke in my pocket,"" is going to get you off the hook, but it isn't.  Cops only ask this question to make their jobs easier when dumb-ass kids actually admit to it.  You're going to jail either way, make him earn his paycheck by looking for your shit (heck, maybe he won't find it!)

**Possession W/ Intent To Sell**

The difference between going to jail on a possession charge, and going to jail on a sales charge is HUGE.  The court system hates drug users, but it hates drug dealers even more.  *Don't EVER bag up separate doses of the same drug.*  A cop can catch you with an ounce of something and it can still be for personal use.  If he catches you with 28 little baggies weighed out to a gram each, you're fucked.  Because that's all it takes to show that you had an intent to distribute those. All of your cash will be taken as evidence.  Bag up your shit when you hit your destination, not beforehand!  Some states even have extra penalties for transporting drugs with intent to sell!  *IF YOU DON'T NEED YOUR SCALE, LEAVE IT AT HOME*  If you have a backpack with a scale, baggies, and a big bag of something, you're asking for trouble.  In the law's eyes, only drug dealers carry scales.  ""BUT SCALES ARE LEGAL TO POSSESS, I KNOW MY RI-"" Nope, stfu right there.  Bongs are legal to possess too, but if you get popped with weed, now that bong is drug paraphernalia. 

Be super careful when transporting drugs!  Traffic stops are where most drugs are found!

**Who's name do I put on the package?**

In my opinion, the name that the drugs are ordered to is irrelevant in most situations.  I think you're much more likely to get busted OUTSIDE of a mail delivery setting (like getting stopped with drugs on you, while high, etc), than to actually get a ""controlled delivery.""  Use your real name, mainly to draw less attention to the envelope in the first place, and also because when the cops knock on your door, they don't give a fuck who's name is on the envelope if it's in your hand.  Sure if you take it to trial a few months later you can argue that someone else sent you the drugs etc, but that point goes out the window if the envelope has been opened.  If it was addressed to John Doe, but you opened it and did the drugs inside, all that proves is that you open other people's mail.

One thing I can tell you about this is: Don't put someone else's name on it (who actually exists) without their permission, or you are a fucking dirtbag.  I've read several different people talking about how they used their parents names, or their grandmas name (because obviously she wouldn't order drugs and they'd never arrest her!  Bullshit.) If you can't own up to your own shit, you shouldn't be doing drugs.  IMO, using someone else as your fall-person is the SR equivalent of snitching.  Don't do it, it will not help you, and it could GREATLY fuck up someone's life.  Maybe in the end you'd beat the case, but do you really want to send your own mom to jail for three days potentially?  I've been to jail, several times, and I wouldn't want my mom spending *3 SECONDS* in that place.

This scam's site is called emocoe (also bitswing and bitcoinestore [not to be confused with the legitimate bitcoinstore]), and they are doing the same thing: claiming to offer bitcoin for far under market value in exchange for Paypal or debit or whatever. No legitimate exchange does this. Please report it when you see it. Your reports make deleting it much easier, and train reddit's spam filter to start catching the URL shorteners.

The owners, one of whom I know personally, have been bragging about being Silk Road vendors at dance parties and pissed off more than a couple of people. GHB in small town USA is a big deal. I messaged Gspot (and their buyer account) about the fact that one of the people they pissed off being a fucking cop's kid, and they took down their listings and (stupidly, I thought) their Facebook accounts.

1373243667.0,97,self.SilkRoad,1htzcy,Just found an awesome thread on the forums. Noobs listen up!,116,19,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1htzcy/just_found_an_awesome_thread_on_the_forums_noobs/," Frequently Asked Questions / F*cking Asinine Questions
 
So, I've just finished scanning through 2,260 threads in this subforum. Hooray for free time.
 
About 80% of the threads focus on the following questions. I'm going to provide the typical answers.
 
 **1.) My package hasn't arrived, what should I do?** 
There are a couple of possibilities:
   
   a) Your package is on its way, keep waiting

   b) Your package has disappeared. LE may have got it, postal service may have lost it. It got sent but it's not going to arrive.

   c) The seller didn't send it (and I'll bet you finalized early)

   d) LE has it, and what happens next depends on the size of the         order and the workload of your LEOs.
 
In all of the above situations, it's reasonable to:
   
   a) Contact your seller politely and see if they can shed any light on  the problem

   b) Clean house. Make sure you have no paraphernalia or drugs in your shipping address.

   c) Go on with your life as usual; if you are in some way compromised any unusual activity will be incriminating. Remember, you know nothing about the drugs coming to you in the mail.
 
If you've been through all of these steps, a reasonable amount of time (normal shipping + 5 business days) has passed, and still no package by all means start a forum topic asking for further advice.
 
 **2.) What do I do if LE come to my door?** 
Deny any knowledge of the illegal contents of your package. Don't go into detail, don't make up stories, DON'T SAY ANYTHING apart from 'I don't know what you're talking about'. Politely decline any requests to enter your address or accompany LE anywhere. If you're arrested (and your country allows this right) USE YOUR RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT. Politely decline to answer any questions and ask for legal representation.
 
Providing that you maintain a clean house (no drugs in the house, no paraphernalia, no other illegal material) and a clean computer, you should have very little to worry about in most cases. 
 
Unless, you've moving large amounts and LEO have been building a case. Then you might be in trouble. But, the above response remains the best.
 
 **3.) Should I use my own name and address?** 
It depends. Yes with a but, no with an if.
 
Yes, if you are buying small amounts and can maintain a clean house (no drugs in the house, no paraphernalia, no other illegal material) then it is most likely OK to use your name and address. The key point to this is to maintain 'plausible deniability'. You should have no criminal history, a clean house, and be smart enough to follow the advice in #2 above should things go sour. The benefit of using your address and name is reliability, and plausible deniability. You are much more likely to be able to claim innocence signing for a package at your own door than you are showing up to a PO box in a fake name at 3am.
 
Variations on this theme are sending mail to your current address under a different name. In some countries this can work, others it will cause problems. The way to find out if it'll work for you is to send test letters to your intended address. If they make it, odds are the package will (excepting LEO interference). A potential spanner in these works is the delivery that unexpectedly requires a signature... Consider that carefully before choosing to go with this method. This option may also affect plausible deniability (easier to claim no knowledge of drugs in your own mail, than drugs in another person's mail that you have kept or opened).
 
If you're moving large amounts, or if you for whatever reason can't maintain a clean house, you should probably have something RELIABLE set up that isn't your name and address. It's on you to figure out how, mister Escobar.
 
 **4.) Should I sign for deliveries?** 
You should choose a seller who does not require signing for deliveries.
 
In the event that you're unexpectedly asked to sign, weigh up the situation:
How much did you order? Do you have a criminal history or history of seized packages? Did you use a reputable seller? Did you use your real name and shipping address 
 
If, for example you ordered 500g of cocaine, have a conviction for trafficking cocaine, have had several cocaine shipments not arrive, ordered from a vendor in Colombia with crappy feedback and had it shipped to a fake address; then you would be clearly making a mistake by signing for that package.
 
If on the other hand you ordered a 3 blotters of LSD, are squeaky-clean, have nothing illegal in your house, ordered from a reputable vendor and had it shipped to your house in your name then it would actually be more suspicious if you DIDN'T sign for the package.
 
Most cases will be somewhere in the middle. Weigh up the above factors and see where you sit; it's a good idea to have this decision made ahead of time for all orders you make, to avoid being caught out if the unexpected happens.
 
 **5.) I'm Australian, and...** 
Good for you. Stop posting the same questions over and over, you're not doing yourself any favors. Anyone would think that Australians make up the majority of SR users from the amount of posts on here regarding Aus.
 
The general consensus from what I've read:
95% of international shipments make it through Aus customs
Aus customs DO NOT appear to routinely send love letters for illegal drugs, there is only one instance on this board of that happening. Generally they just go missing.
You're much safer to buy domestic. If you don't like the prices, by all means buy internationally but know that you are taking a risk.
 
 **6.) How long does shipping from X to Z take?** 
Google it. Honestly...
 
If you must know specifics, PM your intended vendor.

 **7.) Some packages failed to arrive, is it safe to keep using this address?** 
Short answer, no. It may just be unlucky that you didn't get your packages (see #1 above), but the key word is SAFE. No, it is not SAFE. You can continue to use it, but at increased risk.
 
It's not impossible to get a new receiving address. This would be a good prompt to explore your options.
 
 **8.) I got a letter from LE, what do I do?**
If you got a letter, three things are likely true:
   
   a) Your receiving address is no longer safe

   b) The package that was intercepted was not, on it's own, worth arresting you or raiding your house

   C) You can do yourself no good by saying ANYTHING
 
Shred the letter, clean your house, go on with your life. Take a month or two off, and get a new receiving address if you choose to come back. If LE show up at your house, follow the advice in #2
 
==========================
 
So, hopefully this post will be useful to some people and cut down on the same questions being asked over, and over again.

Holy fuck those green bulls are nice. While they may be a little more expensive than powder, these green bulls are potent and convenient, and you can easily dose without a scale. Also has fast shipping. Very strongly recommend. I used his green bulls for both my candyflip and my hippyflip; the stories can be found at the bottom of the reviews.

**curiosity1**: When I bought from this vendor, he was fairly new, and had a small sample amount of DMT available. Never having done DMT before, I was intrigued, and bought a tenth of a gram. The package arrived and a friend and I set about smoking it. However, we really didn't have any pieces good for DMT, and we were too impatient to create or buy one, so our experience is fairly limited, as we wasted a lot of the powder on trying to pull GBs but having the powder fall through. However, the GB hit I took definitely was DMT, as it was similar to how I felt on following DMT trips. I can't fault the vendor for what was our fault and make assumptions about the strength of his product, when it was definitely DMT. 

**nawlins**: I purchased 3 of his 2CB capsules. They arrived and some of my friends bought them from me. The friends said they tripped balls off these capsules, with one of my friends saying the bodyload was a bit too much for his liking. However, that's more drug-specific than vendor-specific, so overall this vendor is a good choice.

**NiceDeal**: I bought 2 of his Cheeba Chews, and they arrived in a timely manner still in the packaging the store sold them in. These bitches will get you fucked up. Would recommend.

**knicknack**: This man had THC pills. I placed an order and it was marked in transit, but never came. I was able to get a 100% refund because the vendor never replied to any messages and there was a large number of buyers saying they didn't get anything. He has been in stealth mode since then.

**rogerpete**: From rogerpete I purchased some DMT. Once it arrived, I took a GB alone at home to test it. While not a breakthrough experience, I got a lot of visuals and just stared at my ceiling for a good bit of time. Later, I went to a friend's house and we smoked a bunch more of it. While, due to our inexperience again, we were never able to breakthrough completely, one of my friends said he did see us as green alien-like beings. So definitely a legit item.

**HollandOnline**: I spent a good while browsing for a good LSD vendor, and eventually settled on HollandOnline, as they had a listing for 20 100mcg hits for about $120. There were was negative feedback about this vendor than most of the ones I'd bought from before, but I figured it's just people complaining. So, weeks go by, my product never comes. I spent some time on the forums, and around the time I placed my order, a significant amount of people in the US (where I am) were saying they weren't getting their packages from him. As a result, he stopped selling the United States, and I got a 50% refund. Personally, my guess is he decided to stop selling to the US for some reason, and decided to pull some bullshit to get a little extra cash. I can't really prove it, but I really can't recommend him to buy from.

**Maggots**: From Maggots I ordered weed cookies. They came fairly quickly, and were definitely some dank ass cookies. The only (very minor) problem is they were kind of stuck together, but one just has to get a knife and separate them. I would definitely recommend these if you want some nice weed cookies. These cookies are involved in my hippyflipping story at the very end.

**NewFavoriteVendor**: From this vendor I purchased shrooms. These came pretty fast, and the vendor was helpful with my questions. Prior to taking these, I'd only had one shroom experience, with a sixteenth of an ounce I'd bought off the street. While I definitely tripped from that experience, the eigth of NewFavoriteVendor's shrooms took me into hyperspace. Words cannot describe what happened. Definitely recommend. These shrooms are involved in my hippyflipping story at the end.

**jesusofrave**: Fairly upset about my previous experience buying acid, I spent a lot of time reading through tons of reviews for different vendors, eventually buying 100 hits from jesusofrave. These arrived in about a week I believe, and I distributed them to a good number of people, the vast majority of which liked what they got. They do taste kind of bad I thought, but they are definitely acid. Would recommend.

**theDankBank**: theDankBank sold me a DABR pen. For those unaware, this is used similar to an e-cig to smoke small amounts of THC wax. The product arrived fairly quickly. However, I did not receive the free gram mentioned in the listing. The vendor quickly sent me one to make up for his mistake. The pen was sweet, and I gave the wax to a friend, so I can't comment on that, but overall this dude had good stuff.

**hackthegibson**: On a Wednesday afternoon, a friend asked if I'd be able to get him two grams of molly before he went on vacation that Saturday. With only two mailing days between the dates, I made a bold decision. I purchased 2g from three different vendors, figuring at least one would make the deadline. And make the deadline this man did. With his fast shipping, my friend was able to get it in time for his trip, and my friend was happy enough with this purchase he gave me money to buy him another seven grams. Overall, a good vendor.

**NewAmerica**: NewAmerica was another of the vendors I purchased two grams from that day. However, his came a day later, and I sold his product to a friend, who said it was good stuff.

**Tryptonite**: Typtonite was the other vendor I bought from that Wednesday, and I sold what I got from his to another friend. The friend never told me about it, but he would have said something if he didn't like it, so it's safe to say this is good shit.

**BigBill6778**: A friend came to my house to browse the site, looking to buy THC wax. He settled on this vendor, as the vendor had pretty cheap prices. I wasn't very confident, as the vendor had about 85% rating I believe and a lot of comments about long shipping times. My friend didn't care, as his product was cheap enough that he didn't mind. So the purchase was marked in transit fairly quickly. As the time for finalizing drew near, the package did not arrive. I placed a week extension, and the vendor agreed. As the time extension ran out, I proposed another, as many commenters said it took around a month to arrive, and the vendor first proposed a 50% refund, saying he had sent it twice, but then he accepted the extension. When that extension ended, I agreed to the 50%. Not at all a good vendor in my opinion. I found it odd that he said in the resolution center he'd sent it twice, but had not mentioned that fact to me, but honestly it was not even that big of a purchase that I cared enough to contest it. 



Stories


**Candyflipping**- I had 2 hits of acid from a friend, and I knew these two hits to be legit. I also had .2g of molly in the form of kwikEmart's green bulls, and 1.5g of weed I'd got from a friend. So the day of the flip, I took the LSD at around 1:30 PM and the 2 green bulls not too long after, as I figured they'd have a shorter come-up. At around two, a friend came to pick me up, and he also took 2 hits of both acid and green bulls. Then we went to a another friend's house. There, one of our friends was day-drinking, and the other had taken 2CB I'd bought from Nawlins. We went on the back porch and hit a couple GBs until the pizza they'd ordered arrived. This was maybe forty five minutes after the first ingestion, and the drugs were starting to give me odd feelings. There was an extreme amount of sensation running through my stomach, and I found it difficult to eat the pizza. We continued to take GBs, but then it started snowing, and we went inside. Inside, we started to watch some Dragon Ball Z. My friend of 2CB was tripping fairly hard, my drunk friend was having a good time, I was starting to come up pretty heavily, and my other candyflipping friend hadn't really started feeling it yet.
	Maybe around 2:30ish, some serious recalibrations started occurring in my head. The acid was hitting me harder than the molly, and at some points I could feel sudden shifts in my thought process. For a little bit, I started to worry that I was getting fucked up too fast, as I still had a decent amount of time until the peak hit. Then, the molly started to kick in. Hoooooooooooooooooly fuck. I started talking my ass off about everything. I tried pretty hard to understand what was happening on Dragon Ball Z, but it was just beyond me. I felt euphoria like never before. A little after three, another sober friend came over for a little bit. He took me and my friend on 2CB for a short drive around the neighborhood. It was snowing on and off, so in his car he put the heat all the way up and blasted some Shpongle. The music is what really set it off. I remember just talking nonstop about crazy shit and watching everything around me go crazy. If you put every previous happy moment of my life on a scale where 100 was the happiest event, the candyflip would be high up in the tens of thousands. After the car ride, we went back and watched more Dragon Ball Z and played N64 games. Then we went to a park and walked around. This part kind of sucked, as the molly had mostly worn off and it was fucking cold as hell and I was very underdressed. The moral of the story is that candyflipping is sweet as shit.



**Hippyflipping**- So a friend and I went to his house for a night of crazy shit. I brought a fourth ounce of shrooms from NewFavoriteVendor, 2 green bulls from kwikEmart, and a weed cookie from Maggots, along with some weed. So we each ate half of the cookie and took a green bull, and then ate an eighth of the mushrooms about fifteen minutes later, so as to half them all kick in at around the same time. Then we went outside and smoked a few GBs. We only managed to take a few before our lighter died, so we went back inside and tried to play some Xbox. However, it got real hard to focus, so we put on Planet Earth (a very high definition nature documentary series). 
	While watching this hour long movie about the rainforests, shit got crazy as hell. Raw euphoria poured over us, and the beauty of nature was simply overwhelming. At one point, there were animals scurrying across the screen, and I told my friend that it was getting too intense and I needed to sit down. He looked at me, laughed, and informed me I was already sitting down. I was absolutely stunned when I looked down and saw that I was in fact sitting in a chair. As the film progressed and the drugs kicked in more and more, reality got beyond real. Both of us experienced ego death, and we agreed on many different points over the night: that we'd beaten life and were now in some sort of afterlife, that nothing existed at all, that we were simply the universe, that there was no point trying to express the raw beauty of this world through words. After the movie ended, somehow my friend was able to put the movie Hot Rod on. I really don't remember any of this movie, as I busy being time and space. We had some extremely deep conversations (to us at least, they were probably complete gibberish in actuality) about how everyone is just imagining themselves and the fact that we're all one being so words are pointless as the one being that is us knows everything. Slowly, reality started to come back, but not after a long night of heavy thoughts. The moral of this story is that hippyflipping is sweet as hell.

Simply put, buying bitcoins is not illegal. Bitcoins can be used to buy so many more things OTHER than drugs. Some vendors will accept bitcoins as a form of payment in real life as well. Heck, you can even buy reddit gold with bitcoins. 


So enough with the paranoia around buying bitcoins. You're only giving people a reason to believe you're up to no good when you act all sketchy. It IS safe to connect your bank account to purchase bitcoins.


Furthermore, SR tumbles all your coins, which is why it takes so long to appear in your wallet. This way, your coins you purchased can NOT be traced back to what you use them to purchase. 


Honestly, if you're scared to buy bitcoins still, I don't think you're ready for SR. You're more likely to get busted by your own mistakes than to be busted through tracing your purchases from bitcoins. You are receiving drugs in the mail. That's the illegal part in this whole scheme, not the precursors.",,False,,t5_2sidu,False,,,True,t3_1ecd2o,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1ecd2o/pa_buying_bitcoins_is_not_illegal/,

He wrote back and told me all he could do was send me a free list of hidden Tor links. WTF??? I don't need or care about that. I'm about to start my own vendor account and just give out all his links for free.

Anyway, long rant, sorry. My point is, he scams selectively apparently Do not buy from him.

**EDIT 2** Hey, guys, I know some of you disagree with what I am doing and think I should ""get over it."" And should not have FE. I know that but I took a chance for a trusted seller and learned my lesson. As far as getting over it, okay, but please, help yourself to these links anyway! For those criticizing me for not knowing dosages... that is untrue I am well aware that the tabs were only 80 mics is which is why I took more than one. That said, I still felt no effects.

If you are ever questioned by police, of course, don't tell them anything. But after a recent Supreme Court ruling, simply remaining silent is not enough. You must now say aloud to the questioner: ""I invoke my right to remain silent,"" or, ""I invoke my 5th Amendment right to not answer any questions."" If you remain silent in response to a question, prosecutors are free to comment on that fact and use it as proof that you are guilty.

Without even asking they offered to send it to me again, but this time for free. Who can turn that down? To my amazement the package arrived saturday afternoon. It had the kief I ordered, an edible, and a samlpe of trainwreck. I forgot to weigh it, but I would guess it was a few grams or so.

&gt; Yes, we are having some technical difficulties. We have been making some serious overhauls and changes to the system, server, and website. While I cannot tell you exactly what is wrong today, I can assure you that we will fix it and have it back up soon. By soon, I mean I would be shocked if we didn't have it back up by Monday.

&gt; Our beloved captain Roberts will be online and addressing you guys sometime in the next 48 hours to explain whats been going on and what has and is being done to fix it. Please be patient and rest assured that all will be well soon.

When I originally posted on here I NEVER expected to blow up like I did and get so many fans and orders and everything. You guys rock, this never would have happened without you. When I first posted I ran out of samples pretty fast and said that we'll have to see how SR responds to having me and based on that I'd do another giveaway or something. Well, SR responded, and crazy style. I'm sure you've been aware that business is booming and demand is through the roof. So I guess that means I need to do another giveaway or whatever. Well here ya go:


Every week I'm going to post a question or request and whoever I deem has the best entry will win a 1g sample with free shipping and everything in return for a review on here. If business continues to go well I will do two giveaways; one to whoever I like the best and one to whoever reddit likes the best and if it's the same that person wins 2g. The only problem with this plan is I need ideas people. I'll give you some time to prepare for the first four weeks as I have some already in mind. 


Week 1: Best smoke story(I would win this one by the way. I'll share mine in the thread.)

Week 2: Best smokespot

Week 3: Best smoking piece

Week 4: Best smoking collection. 

Requirements:

Any photo must have something proving it was taken by you(if there's proof that it's for me that's bonus points.)

All writing should be done using correct grammar, punctuation, and spelling. This will give you bonus points. However, if you have the best smoke story ever and can't write for shit, you might still win. If you lie on your story, think about what you're doing. You're lying to win a gram of marijuana; is that really necessary? I have no way to verify stories so I just have to believe in you /r/silkroad. 

By winning my sample you agree to my terms as laid out in my vendor profile. The only part that really matters is ""Don't be a dick."" If you lie, that's being a dick. If you photoshop, that's being a dick. If you're a dick, that's being a dick. Any of this will get you disqualified and I will write you a very angry letter, full of big and terrifying words sure to make you quake in fear. 

Yesterday I posted a trivia question in return for a sample and that got me thinking. I hate the stigma of stoners being idiots and so I want to incorporate an intelligence or trivia facet into this giveaway but have yet to find a good way to do it so give me some ideas.

I was visiting Vancouver last summer and when we were driving south over the border, I learned that my nephew had a highly illegal product in his possession [Kinder Surprise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinder_Surprise)!

And that gave me an idea:

I'm going to make myself a silk road account and I'm going to be a cartel baron making millions! Forget the mexican Zetas, the Medellín, whatever. I have found a big drug market gap! Based on this ridiculous experience, this must be a serious drug with a huge demand.

Forget heroin and cocaine, this is absolutely more highly addictive. I'm going to flood the american market. I have no scrupels, I'll advertise directly to children. I'll build U-boats running from Vancouver down the coast and bring tons of the stuff to the USA. There will be noone stopping me. Soon enough there will be no schoolyard without my product. A huge network of smaller dealers will bring a scourge on this country. Believe me, after I'm done there will be a totally new branch of addiction clinics with a huge staff of dentists, parents will cry over the chocolate covered corpses of the children!

Who is with me?

Please remember that the escrow service is there for a good reason guys so make sure you take full advantage of it. I would also like to share some of the potential warning signs to look out for if you are new to the game.

1: Seller has some bullshit excuse to why you are required to finalize early otherwise he won't do business with you. Fuck them just move on since there are countless other vendors who don't require this to be done. I can name you heaps of vendors who even state ""*New buyers welcome, no need to FE*"" Those are the ones you should deal with guys. 


2: Vendors feedback mainly consists of alot of brief feedback eg: ""FE early trusted seller 5/5"" in a very short amount of time.


3:The description of product is very brief and eg: ""TOP QUALITY HYDRO BUDS"" with no other knowledge of the product itself. 


4:The prices are unbelievably cheaper than the majority of the market for the same product.

*But the most important is obviously point number 1*

People may not agree with me but Australian users will be aware of sellers such as ""EnterTheMatrix"" who was one of the most trusted sellers in the business who made off with thousands and more recently ""SmoothSailing"" who deleted his account yesterday also making off with thousands. Anyways carry on and enjoy the service but always remember to stay on the ball guys. Thanks for reading

&gt;
&gt;There has been quite a bit of discussion about the commission that is charged to vendors on Silk Road and I'd like to do my best to put some misunderstandings to rest.  Many things were changed in a recent update to accommodate displaying and pegging prices to many currencies.  One of those changes was the way the commission is calculated.  This change had virtually no effect on the vast majority of sales on Silk Road that occur in the less than $1000 range.  The commission did rise on larger volume orders.  I've always felt that the 2% or so that was being charged on high priced orders was kind of low and decided to make the minimum commission 4%.  I intended to inform our vendors of this through a message, but for some reason the message did not go through.  I don't know if this was human error, or a technical error of some kind, but despite what some of you might think I am a normal human being and capable of error.  In any case, the warning of the commission change did not make it to the vendors, so when they realized the commission had been raised by about two percentage points on high priced orders without warning, they we're rightfully upset.
&gt;
&gt;However, this soon spiraled out of control with people making unfounded claims that the commission had doubled or tripled across the board, causing further outrage.  I attempted to respond within the thread where this was being discussed, but multiple threads have been started now and the misconception has even spread to other websites.  Hopefully this post will put the matter to rest.
&gt;
&gt;As I've said all along, the commission that is charged is subject to change at any time, but because it is such a hot topic I am more than happy to reveal the commission schedule as it stands at this very moment.  Keep in mind, this is subject to change at any time, and vendors have been equipped to handle changes in the commission without being warned ahead of time.
&gt;
&gt;The percent commission charged at this point can be found with the following formula:
&gt;
&gt;6.7 x e^(-p/6) + 4
&gt;
&gt;where p is the price of the listing in Bitcoins.  So, for example, a 10 btc listing has a total commission of 5.27%, or 0.5265 btc.
&gt;
&gt;To give a little more perspective, at the current exchange rate of $75 per btc, a $1000 item under the former schedule now costs $1007.26.  A $2000 item now costs $2028.07.  And as said before, lower priced items are virtually unchanged.  I think we can all agree that the service being provided by Silk Road to bring together a multitude of buyers and sellers and provide a safe platform for multi-thousand dollar deals is more than worth an extra 28 bucks.
&gt;
&gt;That being said, I take full responsibility for any and all misunderstandings up to this point.  I didn't deliver the forewarning as I had intended and I am sure none of this would have been necessary had my message been delivered.  I'm sorry for wasting everyone's time with all of this and I hope you can forgive me this slip up.
&gt;
&gt;Yours always,
&gt;Dread Pirate Roberts

Straight from the mouth(or fingers) of Dread Pirate Roberts(http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=168353.msg1200106#msg1200106):


""It's been over two years and Silk Road is still here.  We've had setbacks here and there, but I'm happy to say that mostly we've thrived.  Everyone who's taken their security seriously, and many who haven't remain free and prosperous despite the wishes of the powerful law enforcement agencies that target us.  It is easy to start feeling confident, invincible, even cocky.


I encourage you to look for this in yourself and refrain from acting on it.  A thread was recently started in this forum publishing the personal information of LE agents that users had a particular grudge with.  Let me make this abundantly clear:


We are not strong enough to attack our enemies directly! 


If we start organizing attacks from this forum against LE agents, it will become exponentially harder to resist their attacks and keep Silk Road alive.  This task is hard enough as it is, please don't make it any harder!""



I'm going to repeat something:

""This task is hard enough as it is, please don't make it any harder!""

That is the exact opposite of the ""we've made it this far"" attitude from the man who set up everything that has made this possible. You might say, ""Well, attacking LE agents isn't the same as advertising on Youtube"" or whatever, but it shares the same principle; We're not strong enough to resist the full power of the world's governments. So stop with that shit. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Many people say that encryption is where our safety comes in. According to Atlantis only 15% of users use encryption. And the real kicker:

""Encryption works. Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few things that you can rely on. Unfortunately, endpoint security is so terrifically weak that NSA can frequently find ways around it.""

Wanna know who said that? Edward Snowden. As to what he means ""The consensus is that while encryption such as PGP works, the NSA will have a much easier time simply hacking into a computer once the message has been decrypted."" I doubt many of you are using tails to defend against this. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Last but not definitely not least. This has been confirmed by Astor on the SRF that it is indeed a legitimate threat:

Tldr; don't be lazy, read it.

So, everyone, we can't be so penisey. Being paranoid isn't bad; it leads to better security. Get rid of this ""We haven't been shut down yet so it can't happen"" attitude. It's fucking idiotic to no end. Stop that shit.

1372611269.0,66,self.SilkRoad,1hddwq,OGBRYAN Review - 1oz OG Kush,91,25,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1hddwq/ogbryan_review_1oz_og_kush/,"Good morning and thanks for reading.  This is going to be a comprehensive review on my experience ordering 1oz of OG Kush from ogbryan via the Silk Road.  

Prior to ordering I took the time to read through his vendor page.  I saw that he ships three times per week (Mon, Wed, Fri) and it is shipped from the west coast (CA).  I PGP encrypted my address and placed an order for 1 oz of OG Kush around 9PM central time on a Monday night with the expectation of the package being shipped Wednesday.  On Wednesday afternoon I logged into SR and saw that the vendor updated the status to show the package was in transit.  On Friday morning (2 days later) when I got home from work I found the package was delivered (USPS priority). 

I was quite impressed with the speed of the delivery and as well as the packaging technique used.  It's obvious that ogbryan took the time to package the contents in a way to eliminate any traces of odor via multiple layers of vacuum sealed bags, but the package was also double packaged.
I've read that smart vendors double package in the instance that the box/envelope is destroyed and needs to be re-packaged, in which the postal worker would not be able to see the contents upon repackaging.  

Now, I previously grew cannabis for approximately 4.5 years and I ordered all my seeds from breeders via online seed banks.  One of the strains that I grew on two occasions was OG Kush #18 from Reserva Privada Seed Co.  IMO, OG Kush has a very distinctive odor and bud structure compared to other strains.  It is so distinct in fact,  that if asked, I could  easily identify this strain by scent alone within in a lineup of dozens of other strains.

As soon as I broke open the bag I knew 100% this was top notch OG Kush.  The smell permeated throughout the room as I gazed in awe at the beautiful herbage that I just received in the mail. The bud was properly grown, dried, as well as properly cured.  I give extreme kudos to the grower (whether it's ogbryan or somebody else), because OG Kush was one of the most difficult strains I have grown, and this stuff was perfect.  The buds were all pretty close to the same size with the average bud weighing between 1-2 grams.  There was no popcorn buds, shake, or leaves in the bag.  The vacuum seal was done in a way to avoid crushing or compressing the buds.

I decided to weigh the sack before putting it in a glass storage container.  It came out to 28.2 grams, nice.  I pulled out a small bud to grind up and toke with my freshly cleaned Sheldon Black glass bong.  I had thoroughly cleaned this bong the night before so I could taste the flavor of this cannabis by itself.  

The flavor of this smoke was absolutely delicious. It burned completely white which tells me that zero organic compounds remained inside the plant when it was chopped.  Typically if growers continue to provide a high-strength dosage of nutrients late into the flowering period, it increases the probability of the plant not being able to expel those compounds and causing them to be retained inside the plant when harvesting begins.  It's very obvious to me that this plant was properly tended to throughout the entirety of the flowering and harvesting stages.  

All in all I rate my experience with ogbryan as a very enjoyable one.  He was prompt and discreet when it came to shipping, and he provided me with some of the best herb available on the market.  I will definitely be purchasing from him again.  Instead of giving me a hard time for not have ""x"" amount of transactions and being new to SR (like some vendors do), he promptly sent me dank herbs and earned himself this positive review and a repeat customer.  That my friends is how to properly do business.

1369001891.0,67,self.SilkRoad,1enmxo,"Three Reviews: Northwest Direct, NorCalKing, and Californication",80,13,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1enmxo/three_reviews_northwest_direct_norcalking_and/,"**Northwest Direct**
Strain: Sweet Skunk
Scores: Shipping/Stealth: A+, Weed: B+; Value: A-

Communication: No communication attempts made on either side, and really, none was needed.

Shipping: I ordered on a Thursday, shipped on a Thursday, and made it across the country for Saturday delivery. I've heard lots of complaints on the SR forums about NWD, but I had a great experience. The weed weighed a little heavy. Awesome. I don't know what happened to the guys who are upset, but whatever it was, it didn't happen to me.

Also worth noting – NWD's shipping methods were easily the best of the three. Without revealing too much, everything was packed so the buds looked like they had been freshly cured, but nothing made the package look like “this is weed.” No squishing, just good bud.

Stealth: Very good, with multiple vacuum seals. Would not have any qualms about sending this anywhere, under any circumstances.

Cost: NWD is charging approx $260 USD for an ounce w/ shipping. Cheaper than average.

Buds: Definitely on the small side. I bought enough to justify getting some large buds, but didn't get many. Most were the size of a quarter to a 50 cent piece. They came quit sticky, though, and had a light smattering of hairs which leave trichomes on your fingers.

Picture: http://i.imgur.com/13MKOeS.jpg 

In fairness, there were 2 or 3 big buds, but most of the package was as pictured.

Smoking: I hadn't had any previous experience with the strain, but Leafly says the Sweet Skunk is a sativa-heavy hybrid common to Vancouver. Given that NWD represents that he is out of the Seattle-area, this sounds about right. 

It's not a ridiculously potent strain, making it a great day-to-early evening weed. It gives the user a solid – but not overwhelming – head high very quickly, and a weak secondary body high sets in after you've been smoking a while. This won't give anyone couch-lock, and instead produces a surprisingly functional functional high – the most functional of the three. In short, it's a good afternoon or for a group party smokeout, but isn't the best strain for a Friday night when you want to get blazed. You'd have to smoke a boatload of this to get dysfunctional. For what it's worth, it's a very smooth smoke; you get a bit of sweet aftertaste as you exhale.

Value: NWD gets you a boatload of solid weed really fast. Tops in value, but not the guy to go to if you want some super-premium buds. Also, if you're looking for big “look at me” buds rather than something to pack your grinder, this is not the vender for you.

**NorCalKing**
Strain: Sour Diesel
Scores: Shipping/Stealth: A-, Weed: B, Value: B-

Communication: No communication attempts made, and none was needed.

Shipping: Shipped fast; 4 days between order and delivery for somewhere nowhere near Northern California. Weighed a tad light (0.2 grams), but absolutely not worth complaining about. 

Stealth: Good stealth. Didn't smell anything until passed the last vacuum seal, but the weed got squished a tad bit. NCK could use something to protect the buds from the vacuum sealer, but this is just nitpicking on my part.

Cost: NCK doesn't sell many strains in bulk on his public listings, which is unfortunate. His 1/4 oz premium strains go for a little over $130 with shipping. This is the most expensive guy of the three.

Buds: Good bud size. Noticeably dry compared to the other two, and average sized. Not that sticky, few hairs, but well manicured. 

Picture: http://i.imgur.com/2iqeBig.jpg 

Smoking: I've had several Sour Diesels, and this one was above average but not a standout. It gives you the almost-jittery awake feeling that is common with daytime sativas, meaning that it won't make you sleepy at all. 

NCK's Sour Diesel is almost a purely a head high. NCK says that his is a 90/10 Sativa/Indica hybrid, but I didn't notice any indica at all in the appearance or the high. In other words, there is no heavy body feeling whatsoever. The jittery, dreamy feeling does also produce some anxiety. I'm not a guy who gets anxious when smoking, but I have friends who did get a little tweak-ish after smoking this. If you get paranoid or “tweaky,” buy something else.

Sour Diesel smokes just like it sounds. It has a pungent, nasty diesel smell with  a sour citrus taste as you smoke it. It's a bit of an acquired taste, and between the taste and the effect it may not be the best weed for new smokers. It is great, however, for daytime smoking. It doesn't make you sleepy or lazy at all, and so you can still be plenty productive after smoking at any time of the day. 

The complaint here is the potency. Whether it's a result of less-than-sticky weed, or whatever reason, it took a lot of smoking to get the “up in the air” dream-like head high. Again, it would be nice if there were more affordable quantities greater than 1/4 oz. There was nothing wrong with the high, just that you'd need to spend some cash to get it.

Value: When you consider that NCK is charging for a 1/4 oz what others charge for 1/2, it might be nicer if he offered more bang for the buck. It's not a bad weed, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the guy if you want a solid sativa. But you're buying a B/B+ sativa at A/A+ prices.

**Californication**
Strain: OG Kush
Scores: Shipping: B-/Stealth: A+, Weed: A+, Value: A

Communication: I was too high when I ordered and mucked up the PGP. Californication was super nice about my mistake and we got the situation resolved within a day. He followed up with shipping information, which was nice.

Shipping: I got it in 4 days, which was great. He promised 3 day delivery, but I'm nowhere near California, so I'm not about to fault the guy for being a day off. The big complaint here is that his vacuum squishes the buds more than necessary, which is kinda annoying, since he sends MASSIVE BUDS. Why bother sending super premium buds if you're going to squish them?

Stealth: Best stealth out there. I won't go into details, but this guy had more than 5 layers of packaging. It was almost annoying how long it took to get it unpacked and into my bong. I can't imagine this would set off even the most sensitive dog. 

Cost: $325/oz shipped. About average for SR premium weeds.

Buds: By far the biggest. These are the smallest buds I got. I think the picture speaks for itself: 
http://i.imgur.com/ibOuhtz.jpg 

The other buds in the package were bigger, but more squished. These are some compact buds with tons of crystallization. I think that they would have been pretty hairy, too, if they hadn't been so tightly packed in shipping.

Smoking: There is some debate in the SR forums about who is selling real OG Kush and who's selling knockoffs. I don't really care about that; all that matters to me is how it smokes and the high you get. And holy shit, this stuff gets you high. 

{Well, I fucked something here as pointed out below. Let's just say I was educated}

One puff and you want to sit down, eat something delicious, and watch TV. It's an evening/nighttime weed for sure. You get a full body high that reaches from your head to your toes, munchies, and a fair amount of euphoria. This stuff gave me the first case of “giggles” I've had in months. 

What I'm saying is this is really, really potent. Whereas it took me about 0.20 gram of Sweet Skunk to get a general high feeling and 0.30 gram of Sour Diesel to get a head high, 0.10 gram of the OG Kush had me on my couch craving pizza and a Planet Earth episode. It creates a huge lazy effect, too – so be sure not to smoke any OG Kush when there is anything else to be done, because you're probably not doing it. 

Value: Very good value. The price is about average for an ounce on SR, and man, this stuff is potent.

**About the reviewer:**

I'm an average pothead in an average town nowhere near the west coast. I've been smoking for long enough that I think I can speak to what people are looking for in upscale weed in urban areas which don't have lots of MMJ dispensaries like Cali and Washington. 

As for the pictures and reviewing methodology: I'm a natural asshole, so I tried to take pictures of *below average* weed and focus on what went wrong. I don't see the point in fellating an anonymous vender by focusing only on the highlights; nobody saw “Eyes Wide Shut” and gave it a good review because the movie had some sweet titty scenes. I'm not about to do any random vender a favor by mincing words or showing off the one good bud that he sent me. I thoroughly enjoy calling spades by their name.

These are the only orders i have ever placed. Today I have been told by my housemate that police were at the door earlier saying that they have caught someone who has been dispatching drugs ordered over the internet and have a list of addresses, including ours, and that they would like to talk to the person involved for them to give a statement. Apparently they said that they are not interested in prosecuting but simply want information, and left a number to call. 

Now i have no drugs of any description in my posession or in my house, so I am fairly sure that i am in no danger of prosecution, however i am concerned as to my best course of action. Can anyone help me with information as to what my rights are in this scenario? Can i simply say i do not wish to give a statement and leave it at that? I rather do not want to be involved in any of this if i can avoid it.

In addition has anyone else received a visit in the last day or so?

Sorry if this is not the kind of thing that we want to see on /r/silkroad but i am getting rather worried about this and some second opinions from some fellow redditors would be greatly valued.

Create a CoinBase account (USA only). Confirm back account wiring. Since buying BitCoins is legal, I see no problem with this. Coins can be ordered through CoinBase at a 1% fee. Once the account is set up the transactions take 3-5 business days to be confirmed. Small fee, longer wait time than BitInstant.



I would like to know more methods of transfer and how they work. I also signed up for a Dwolla account, but would have to go through BitInstant (I believe). I feel like this would be massively beneficial to the community! I am also looking for a method that could be done within a day, preferably use bank transfer, and have a percentage loss at about 2% or less. Lets hear the methods and get a permanent working source going!

One measurement of a friend is how he acts when the chips are down. In the dark days of last november we saw this subreddit as an easily accessible, and at some points, exclusive source of information.  Even when the SR forums were restored r/SilkRoad remained a very valuable resource - primarily for its reasoning and the positivity that characterizes reddit itself.

Today this community continues to serve a larger Silk Road, often as a vanguard probing the dangers and opportunities of its growing popularity.  The discussion of vendors, once seen as a taboo is now commonplace and none are worse off for it.  While the old guard deserves an enormous amount of respect and admiration - their accomplishment is what we enjoy today - new thinking is vital to SR and its clear this is a place we can all find it.

So today we wish to join your conversation, and start here with this expression of gratitude.  The Muskabuzz are at your service.

1368299607.0,57,self.SilkRoad,1e54uq,PSA: The chemistry underlying the purity of substances,75,18,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1e54uq/psa_the_chemistry_underlying_the_purity_of/,"Often times, you'll see percentages of purity for certain substances.  Purity is simply a measurement of abundance of a target compound relative to the other compounds in a mixture.  But don't be mislead, because a relatively ""low"" purity could actually indicate a very pure compound.

**Salts**

First, most of the substances and medications you buy and consume exist as **salts**.  A **salt** is an ionic compound that is the result of a neutralization reaction via either an acid or a base.

Go take a look at your medicine cabinet.  Some of your prescriptions or OTC medications might say ""&lt;name&gt; HCl (hydrochloride)"" or ""&lt;name&gt; HBr"" (hydrobromide).  These are salts!

Chemists like to use these acids to produce salts of compounds for many reasons, but other compounds are also used to make salts (e.g., aspartate, succinate, tartrate, etc).  You can look these up on Wikipedia for more information.

**The case for salts**

In their pure organic form, most organic compounds are greasy liquids or thick and waxy solids.  In their salt form, most organic compounds are solid crystals.  As such, chemists vastly prefer to work with salts rather than pure organics.

For example, weigh out 1 g of petroleum jelly and then weigh out 1 g of NaCl (table salt).  Which was easier to handle?

Salts are awesome because they...

1. are easy to handle
2. are (mostly) water-soluble
3. are more bioavailable than their organic counterparts
4. are readily purifiable via recrystallization
5. (mostly) do not lose their respective organic functionality

There are also other reasons, but you can read about them elsewhere.

**MDMA as a salt**

Everyone seems to like MDMA, so I'll use it as an example.

MDMA-HCl (3,4-methylenedioxy-*N*-methylamphetamine hydrochloride) is practically the only form of MDMA that exists.

When the chemist has MDMA in his flask, he'll drop in an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl).  The lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen of MDMA's secondary amine will snatch the proton from HCl.  The lone negatively charged chloride ion will then coordinate non-covalently with the now positively charged secondary amine, thus generating the salt MDMA-HCl.

[Here's an image of what I explained above.](http://i.imgur.com/YYWtzgJ.png)  MDMA is on the left, HCl is in the middle, and MDMA-HCl is on the right.

If you did this to 100% pure MDMA, you would end up with ~84% pure MDMA-HCl.  But why is this the case?

We need to consider the masses of the compounds!

          MDMA: 193.25 g/mol
    +      HCl:  36.46 g/mol
    ------------------------
    = MDMA-HCl: 229.71 g/mol

The 84% simply refers to the fact that MDMA-HCl contains 84% of MDMA and 16% HCl *by weight*.

           MDMA: 193.25 g/mol
    /  MDMA-HCl: 229.71 g/mol
    -------------------------
    = by weight: 84.3 %

You can apply this logic to any salt under the sun!

**In conclusion**

Make sure to check the ""maximal"" purity of a substance before you spend money on it.  If someone tries to sell you a substance that exceeds the ""maximal"" purity of that substance's salt, be very skeptical!  Educate yourself so you don't get ripped off! :D

I have been a SR member for almost 2 years, spent triple digit amounts of Bitcoins and have received packages from all over the world. No problems at all, all vendors where nice and it worked every single time.

Now I ordered some weed off budsupplies. Their rating where top notch and they are shipping from Germany, so it is domestic for me. That means 2-3 days shipping time, no customs and one of the most reliable post services in the world.

Well, after 5 days of waiting I wrote them a message. First they told me they sent it a day later, 2 days after putting it as ""in transit"" which is kinda strange. But OK. Then another 3 days are gone and I ask again, they tell me they had this a few times now, that their package takes way longer than usual. I never heard of this before, this is domestic German shipping, but OK.

Now, 2 weeks later it never arrived. I asked for a partial reship (50%) as I don't care about the money but they said no and now they want 50% off my money for nothing.

I know their reviews are good but it is very strange that I don't get the product within Germany and that they tell me BS to make we wait longer. And afterwards they are rude ""no, you won't get any reship, you won't get more than 50%!"".

I am pretty sure they either made a labeling error or forgot to send it at all. The actual chance that the German post office loses a correctly labeled domestic shipment is closer to 0.001%.

I'm not angry about the lost package, that would have been OK if they even remotely tried to make it up. Their stuff is expensive (like $15/g) and I expect to be treated as a customer, especially with my buying stats. But they just behave like dicks.

So I wouldn't recommend buying from budsupplies as they are not interested in a good customer relation and just scammed me off 50% of my money.

Some tips for people:

Best mail to receive is small regular sized letters, these are automatically sorted by machines and don't touch any persons hands much. Everyone already knows this though.

Best place to receive mail is at a community mail box (the brown ones at the end of streets) because they are locked, nobody can see your mail other than the postal worker and your self. Also, having packages delivered to a community mail box means no possibility for a controlled delivery so long as the package is small enough to fit (most of them are) and is not registered / signature required (those MUST be delivered to the door, along with over sized packages)

I will update constantly as I find useful information.

EDIT: Hey all, just found out recently that **there are never dogs brought in randomly to sniff packages** the only reason a dog would be brought in to sniff packages would be if there was already suspicion against someone's package.

I found a vendor that had good reviews on the forums, high quality product, and good prices.  I ended up finding a half ounce of AK-47 for a little over what I would pay for a quarter of decent dank locally. I just wanted to share my story and offer any advice to those new guys hesitant to make a purchase.


**The Beginning Research**


Being obsessed with computers at a young age, I've always tried to stay fairly current and informed on technology and such, so I had heard of Bitcoins a few years ago.  Back then, however, I didn't take the time to research too much into it until I heard about the prices going up to $200, I mean who wouldn't be intrigued? I had also done some Deep Web exploring over the years and of course had found Silk Road.  I would pour through it and think to myself ""damn, I wish I had some Bitcoins and could buy something."" 

Flash forward to this month, I was able to obtain a few Bitcoins through mining and purchases, and decided to do some more research into using and ordering from the Silk Road.  I quickly found this subreddit, reading every guide from learning how to utilize PGP encryption to sorting out reviews on the product page vs. reviews from reputable posters on the forums.  I was confident I was ready to make a purchase.


**The Purchase**

I started with three tabs open in my Tor browser: Silk Road category for cannabis, the Silk Road forums with a search box ready, and a thread on the forum with written up reviews and grades for several cannabis vendors.  While I did want to get as much as I could for the amount of BTC I had, I also wanted a vendor with good quality product and free shipping without requiring me to FE.  


Not too far into my search, I found NorCalChronic so I decided to research some reviews for him.  I found numerous posters on the forums praising his fast delivery within the US, stealth, and generosity (I mean, a pre-roll that is packed to the brim, really?).  I noticed one bad review that was quickly followed by a few customers of his coming in to discredit the bad review.  I saw that he had free shipping without requiring me to FE.  I read his vendor page at least 5 times to make sure I wasn't missing anything and wouldn't make a stupid error.  I was sure I had found my vendor, so I got my Bitcoins, loaded them into Silk Road and was ready to go.  


PGP encryption was a breeze using Kleopatra and the PGP Guide on this subreddit.  I had my coins cleared, address encrypted, and order ready to submit on Thursday night.  I just checked my mail an hour ago, and there it was, in all its glory.  I quickly rushed home, opened up the extremely stealth, odorless package, and gleaned with excitement as I found its contents and breathed in what had been previously masked.

**Final Thoughts/TL;DR VERSION**

After satisfying all of my questions through diligent research, I had absolutely no fear or worries about my purchase. I wasn't worried I would get caught or mess up my encryption and lose my money.  I was confident in my research and the safety I would have by following the right steps.  If you take the time to find out exactly what you are doing at each step along the way, YOU WILL BE FINE!

Months ago, November 5th to be exact. I made an order with AfterHour for 25G of his BAD ASS MDMA. I should've known not to order from him from the way he spoke to me. But I had a couple of successful orders with him before, and before him Pfandleiher who vouched for him. For some reason he could not decrypt my address multiple times, when I was sure I was encrypting it to him properly as I had done multiple tests and encrypted to other vendors before. After sending him my address encrypted a few times and him not being able to decrypt it, he went on to say I was 'an annoying idiot'. Despite his rudeness for something that I clearly was not doing wrong, I stuck it out with him and he eventually got my shipping address. My product shipped (or did it?) on November 18th, with NO FE, with tracking provided in case of dispute. A while later he sent out a message to all his clients that he was planning to take a break for Christmas and wanted to re supply one last time before then, so he was asking willing customers to FE. This is where I fucked up. After being scammed by Tony76 I was a bit skeptical of FE'ing. But having had success in the past with this vendor, I gave it a shot. I mean what the heck, it was Holiday season. A day or two before autofinalize, December 5th. I finalized for him, because the package would be arriving within the next couple days anyways right? Wrong. 30 days passed and I asked him for the tracking number because I hadn't received the package. He said he would look for it. I waited a few days and with no response, sent him another message. He asked for my order details which I provided, then he said he would look for the tracking again. Another week later and no messages back. I ask him again, if he found my tracking # or if he'll provide a reship/refund when he restocks, he again asked for the order info and said he would restock soon. So again I waited, a week past then I messaged him asking again if he found the tracking or if he'd refund / reship, hIs exact words were ""If I reship you will get listed, you need to know whats is more important for you. A reship or a buy again"" I decided that I couldn't trust that he would send out the package this time so instead I asked for a refund rather than reship. I waited two weeks and got no reply, then asked again. No reply again. Then I contacted SR Support to let them know what happened. They said they couldn't help me since I FE'd. Which I had already figured. I just wanted to let them know what happened. Now I come to you guys. Not to ask for your sympathy. But to tell you to be careful with vendors as big as AfterHour, its easy for them to not ship a package and say they did, and then conveniently 'lose' the tracking. NEVER FE. FOR ANYONE. NOT EVEN THE MOST TRUSTED VENDORS. I trusted AH and he fucked me over. I have high reason to believe he never shipped my package at all. Trust no one but yourself, and sometimes not even yourself.

I have been a customer on SR for about a half year and almost exclusively purchase bulk weed and cannabis products. I purchase a couple LB's weekly and resell locally so I am always looking for low prices on high quality bulk product. Recently I have been purchasing a few LB's of caliconnect's weed because of how low his prices are. Indoor for 2800/lb. I got a few pounds of really frosty, almost white Blue Dream that looked dank and had a decent but not loud smell. A few weeks later some customers call me and say they think that the weed is sprinkled with baking soda or a similar white powder to make it look more frosty. I was taken aback at first, because the weed smokes pretty well but for sure looked TOO frosty. I took a second look through the entire pound and saw a few buds with clumps of white powder, the size of a pea about, stuck between the calyxes (clumps that weren't ground fine enough to look like THC). The clumps are pure white and look like baking soda and crumble with your fingers, definitely NOT anything organic OR healthy. Also I rolled a few joints and the joints literally sizzle the entire time they burn, which I have never experienced and definitely signals that something weird is in the bud. What i'm saying is I think this guy contaminates his indoor weed to make it look more visually appealing. I have yet to contact him, just waiting to see if anyone else can confirm that his indoor is sprinkled with powder.

Why do you guys think the joints and blunts sizzle and crackle the entire time they burn? Why would there be a clumps of white powder between the buds? Please let me know if I am just tweaking or if I might be onto a dishonest vendor.

EDIT: The bowls that I smoke burn completely black and leave no light-colored ash. The plant is definitely not flushed well or at all, in addition to whatever it might be contaminated with. I will try to look through the buds again to see if I can get any pictures of the white powder I am talking about. Don't have much of it left, but will try. Ive bought a few pounds of this bud and I'm pissed that I might have sold my friends bad, unhealthy product. It doesn't weigh well on my conscious.

I'm very excited however there's a couple things that are making me a little nervous. First thing is along with the package came one of those ""Sorry we missed you"" notes where they want me to come to the post office to pick up the package. This is odd because I HAVE the package. It was delivered. And I'm not expecting anything else in the mail. Would it be okay to go and try to pick something up or should I just stay away? (edit: forgot to add that it says I can't come pick it up from the post office until tomorrow.)

Secondly, and this is what is really kinda freaking me out, is that it was shipped in one of those envelopes like they always do but it looks like it had been opened and someone used tape to reseal it. It's kinda sketch and am not sure what to make of it. What do you guys think? 

I have not actually opened the package yet and I already wrote ""return to sender"" in red ink on the front just in case LE does come knocking on my door.

Edit: Opened the package late last night. Everything was in there as expected, though the packaging from the vendor was definitely subpar. Bubble wrap was all torn up but the goods themselves were still sealed as they should have been.

Edit 2: Went to the post office this morning and all went well. It was simply another letter for me. I feel rather silly now for creating such a big fuss over nothing haha. But in my defense, I had no idea anything was on it's way (and I usually do not receive mail) so it was kind of a coincidence two things would arrive on the same day.

The Chinese scammer is still doing his thing here. They'll be using a rotating array of URL shorteners to evade reddit's spam filters. This scam's site is called emocoe (also bitswing and bitcoinestore [not to be confused with the legitimate bitcoinstore]), and they are doing the same thing: claiming to offer bitcoin for far under market value in exchange for Paypal or debit or whatever. No legitimate exchange does this. Please report it when you see it. Your reports make deleting it much easier, and train reddit's spam filter to start catching the URL shorteners.

Essentially I believe we (the people who use black markets) have more in common than we have differences and to keep the dark web united it would be nice to have just a little more openness and clarity between us.
To be honest it surprises us too that many people have such strong opinions one way or another when fundamentally we see ourselves as only doing a solid and offering choice (as well as a backup) to the black marketplace. 

It kind of reminds me of two people after a breakup trying to keep face but I feel to just let our guard down a  bit and just engage you guys for a while if you feel like it.

~~EDIT2: MAYBE NOT~~


UPDATE (07/02/2013 1700 UTC): Forgot to mention another change that's coming with this update.  Now that MtGox is losing market share, we'll be pulling from multiple markets to get the ""official"" exchange rate for pricing and hedging.  It will also be more closely weighted to the preset instead of equally weighting all prices over the past 24-hours.  This part is a bit of an experiment and we may revert back if there are any problems with it.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

This coming Tuesday we'll be rolling out some changes that should be welcome to our members who are used to using currencies other than the US Dollar.  Support for 34 new fiat currencies plus gold and silver will be added.  You will be able to view the prices in the market along with your account balance in these currencies, and vendors will be able to peg their prices to these currencies as well.

So for example, if you live in Australia and view prices in the Aussie Dollar, and you shop with domestic suppliers who peg their prices to the Aussie Dollar, you will see more or less steady prices across the market even as the exchange rates fluctuate.

As an added bonus, we've added 2 decimal places to Bitcoin prices for a total of 4.  This can easily be expanded or contracted as necessary if the Bitcoin exchange rate changes dramatically in the future.

The site will be taken offline around 1900 UTC on July 2nd while the update is deployed and tested.  We've done our best to catch any bugs that might crop up, but please message support with any that you find asap when we come back online.

In case it is asked, hedging is completely unaffected by this.  The only options are still Bitcoins and US Dollars.",,False,,t5_2sidu,1372836358.0,,,True,t3_1hilgs,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1hilgs/silk_road_closed_shortly_today_message_from_dpr/,

Below is a list of the vendors I've personally tried, all vendors are within the United States:

**ballervision**. Deals with 30mg IR Roxycodone and high grade MJ. First off this is the absolute best vendor on SR that I've used. Every order goes out day of (if put in by or before 9:30am est) and a tracking number is sent within hours after your order. Very professional person, some of the best 'customer service' one could ask for. Shipping is extremely stealth and discrete, with packaging in the form of a business label that looks entirely legit. If anyone is looking for Roxy's or High Grade MJ, I cannot recommend him enough.



**PartOfTheDance**: Deals in shrooms. Insanely good quality, discrete packaging, and very fast shipping. No tracking number with him, but I received my package within 2 or 3 days (sent from East Coast to East Coast). He was my first vendor I used for shrooms and I absolutely will not go else ware, as I'm very happy with his product and service.



**supremesmoke**: Deals in high quality china white. Probably the fastest shipment I've received on the road. Order placed Thursday night, was at my door Saturday morning. No tracking number used, and the packaging was stealthy enough to get the job done (I only purchased 1/8th of a gram, so extreme measures weren't really needed to package such a small amount). Quality is grade A, best I've ever had, and while his prices are a little expensive, it's worth every penny based on the quality he offers.


That's all I've got for now. I have a few more orders pending, which I'll update on once everything is finalized.

Context: Multiple new buyers claiming mysterious no-shows within a few weeks span of time.

&gt;Coming to the forums adds credibility to everyone else's eyes so we are ""fooled"" into thinking that the package didn't arrive in hopes of earning themselves with a false sense of trust. Most of these people that are pulling these scams are quick and 'clever' college kids looking to earn an extra dime on top of their quarter since the refund check they got from [insert overly priced private school paid for by Mommy and Daddy] wasn't enough play money. Those that typically lie for their personal advantage and come from such a background will try to fabricate a relatively detailed story. What do these quick and 'clever' kids think? ""Oh hey, I received my package, but WAIT! I can garner the attention of people on the message boards, act heartfelt with 'day updates (""day 10, still waiting..."")' and other common concerns/thoughts (""I'm sure I'm just being impatient and it'll be here tomorrow lol can't wait to try!""), pretend I never got the package and get a full refund because I'm an asshole.""

&gt;With that said, do I believe maybe ONE of those packages didn't arrive? Most definitely. It's the mail system and shit does get lost, or even confiscated, but 4-5 individuals in a few week span? Nope, nuh-uh, sorry but I'm not believing that one damn bit. The raw fact of the matter is this and it's been echoed over and over again: lucky is not here to fuck anyone over. He employs phenomenal stealth unlike most of the Dutch equivalents for he and his customer's protection (MBB, anyone?), ships within the same continent, provides a far superior product, and doesn't bullshit you with fluff or nonsense. Have you noticed his prices are slightly higher? Yeah, because you have to pay the fee for a premium service. Don't expect to get HBO in HD by paying for nothing beyond the electricity that runs your shiny new flatscreen television.

&gt;Gatillac, I apologize if your package legitimately hasn't arrived (in which case, I honestly hope it finds its way to you) and I typically keep it cool and positive with these things, but I've absolutely had enough with this shit throughout SR in its entirety. These conniving little thieves need to stop toying around like little high school prima donnas so the adults can continue having fun. It's the fuckheads kids like that that ruin this game and need to sod off with their bullshit antics already. Maybe if they stopped rolling/drinking/doning every damn weekend, took the time to thoroughly research the drugs they're taking beforehand, and learn to completely respect the substances, then they wouldn't have to result to petty thievery.

&gt;Or they should just take LSD and they'll learn the errors of their ways themselves. After all, at the end of the day they have to ask themselves this: ""Am I good a person or am I a thieving little bitch?""

1367247277.0,44,self.SilkRoad,1dc9bu,Hypothetical - how to create a Silk Road Honeypot trap,63,19,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1dc9bu/hypothetical_how_to_create_a_silk_road_honeypot/,"So, I've been having a think about what would be required for a government to create an effective honeytrap for intelligence gathering with a view to raiding SR vendors/bulk buyers and gathering information on the flow of narcotics through the darknet websites.

Now, it seems to me that the basic issues in creating a viable honeytrap are these:

1-There isn't a good reason for major vendors to move away from the Silk Road.

2-Most vendors and bulk buyers insist on using encrypted communications, so even if a honeytrap were in place the sort of intelligence that could be gathered would be very limited.


If I were in the position of being tasked with creating such a site then, what I would propose would be to create a new silk road clone, but to add some kind of internal encryption system to discourage the use of independently encrypted messaging. 


Once this was in place I would propose that SR be attacked so as to encourage targets to switch over to the new honeytrap site. I would also seek to limit access to other hidden messaging services such as tormail, in order that buyers and sellers be forced to communicate using the market's own internal messaging system.


I know I'm not the only one who finds recent events somewhat suspicious, so the lessons should be:


1-Always use PGP for important info, and use a secure key/password size.

2-Tumble your coins outside of drug markets - don't let them be traced back to you even by the administrators of those sites.


The point is, even if recent events were entirely coincidental, trusting the admins of illegal markets is foolish in the extreme, and nobody should be ignoring basic safety protocols because one of the markets says it's a viable thing to do.

1364361262.0,48,self.SilkRoad,1b3f90,Using Statistics to help Noobs make the first purchase :),58,10,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1b3f90/using_statistics_to_help_noobs_make_the_first/,"I'm going to be using the data found in this thread here for this:http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=85359.0. I used excel as well to make sure I added correctly.

So I'm gonna use the knowledge I learned in my Stats class to figure out what the true probability is that a random person ordering would receive a package from Silk Road from the data received. Keep in mind that the probability that I get is going to include the following: Domestic packages, International packages, Scams (vendor never sends a package), and Intercepts. This fits binomial probability conditions and, as well, also fits the Central Limit Theorem (if you don't understand this, just know it makes the math a lot easier). Now I realize the probability will be biased because this is not a true random sample (this is only an online forum, but it is random enough for real world limitations). It is also an independent sample. Anyways, I did the best of my ability from this data to deduce the number of total packages sent to the number of successes received. Taking n = total number of packages and k = the number of successes (number of received packages), I got n = 1258 (packages in total sent) and k = 1231 (packages received). This meant that there was a probability of 0.9785 (1231/1258) of receiving a package from this study. But we want to find out what the overall probability for all packages in the world, not just of this study. To do this, I applied the Central Limit Theorem and I am 95% confident (standard deviation = 0.004086 and to get 95% confidence, multiply by 2 and add to the study probability) that the true probability of receiving a package lies between (0.9867, 0.9704). I went even further to help newbies have the confidence of ordering by figuring out with the binomial formula what the probability of your first order being scammed/intercepted would be. I'm not gonna post the math (if you want me to, I can) but I got a probability of 0.0215 (which means for your first purchase, you have a 2.15% chance of it being intercepted). If you order only domestically from top rated vendors (check the forums for good 99-100 vendors and don't finalize early), this probability percentage of 2.15% goes way down even further.

Now I'm off for a beer. Cheers everyone!

tl;dr: Probability of successfully receiving a package from Silk Road including domestic, international, scams, and intercepts put together: 97.85%

Going only domestic, using your real name and address, getting personal amounts only, and using top rated vendors raises this success probability percentage drastically.",,False,,t5_2sidu,False,,,True,t3_1b3f90,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1b3f90/using_statistics_to_help_noobs_make_the_first/,

First off, I would like to apologize again to anyone that received sub-par quality product from 420Connections. Second, I would like to thank /u/Natyskillz for bringing it to my attention!

In the last several days we have gotten rid of our previous bud supplier due to a shipment of lower quality weed and we are in the process of hammering out the last details in our new supplier, who has proven to us that he grows some absolute fire. Those listing should be up around Tuesdayish.

I would also like to thank /u/namrebat for the excellent tips for improving out BHO quality. Our man in charge of BHO has been shown his post and link and also confessed to running the butane through about 5-6 times and has been instructed to drop that number significantly. Guess I can't really blame him for wanting to get the extra yield, but I will not accept lowering the quality of our product just for a couple extra grams of chlorophyll/plant wax!



Now that the unpleasant part of this post is out of the way, I would like to thank the users of reddit, and the rest of the SR by announcing a week long, Customer Appreciation Sale! I'm currently editing our listing down to 20% off, both as an apology for the last batch of oil, and as a thank you for bringing it to our attention! It's really hard to fix that which you don't know is broken :)

As an added bonus, if you ordered from us and received sub-par BHO, mention it in your next order, and after I cross reference your username to our past orders, I'll make sure you get hooked up extra fat :)


Thanks again Reddit, I just celebrated my second cake day on here on my main acct, and I really do appreciate the community here. I was kind of pissed when I first logged on to see 420Connections blowing up in an extremely negative light, but quickly realized that you guys wouldn't be bitching over nothing and that you had exposed a weakness that should have been fixed before it was a problem!


Thanks as always,

This subreddit is about the discussion of SR, it offers great resources on the sidebar to help people that want to learn and there are a number of people that answer almost every question in this sub or in the Moronic Monday threads. This subreddit is packed with information, as it should be.

Where I am struggling to understand is the constant questions that have been asked over and over again and answered over and over again. On top of that the lack of moderating that this sub has is unsettling because all that needs to be done is to delete these threads that clog up the subreddit. I remember back around when I joined, a mod saying that he/she was becoming fed up with these threads that clog the subreddit and he/she was going to start deleting them and sending the OP a message to his answer within the subreddit. This has yet to happen and this subreddit has lost some credibility because of it because when one comes to the front page of this subreddit, they are met with the first 10 posts being ""How do I get bitcoins now that bitinstant isnt working"" or ""Help!

&gt;hi folks, wow I am incredibly sorry about this.  last week we were &gt;having login issues and we had to rewrite the entire system that &gt;handles logins and sessions to get the bugs out.  We overlooked &gt;one thing that lead to this mistake.  Basically it was checking &gt;weather a large random string of characters was unique.  The &gt;odds were so low for what is called a collision that it was &gt;overlooked, but indeed a collision occurred in this case.  The &gt;chances of it happening were about 1 in 10e^26.  That's 10 with &gt;26 zeros.  Anyway, forensics showed it was the only incidence &gt;and we've added a uniqueness check that will prevent this from &gt;happening again.  I was actually suspicious when we had a bug &gt;free release of the new system!

&gt;Thankfully moopydog was honest and didn't do anything wrong, &gt;and the user that was compromised didn't seem to mind much.

I ended up starting a vendors account on Atlantis and have quickly become the #1 vendor there. I have 100% delivery rate and my packages arrive in 2-4 business days. 

I really want to get on Silk Road, but all my profits have gone straight to rent, bills and restocking. So I want to offer a special deal to /r/SilkRoad users, where all the profits will go to my SilkRoad vendor account fee. I am offering a home made strain called Snow White Kush for $45 an 1/8th (I also have ounces for $250, QP's for $850, and HP for $1650). I'm not selling 1/8ths of this strain except through this special, I just wanted to make sure people could try it in smaller quantities if they wanted to. I have created a stealth listing that can only be accessed through the link at the bottom.

So if you've wanted to try out Atlantis or just want to help me get a vendors account on Silk Road here's your chance. I plan on offering budget weed to AAA+ to bulk. Here's the link.

""
On April 26,2013 the Humboldt County Drug Task Force was contacted by an Agent with the Homeland Security Investigation Unit (H.S.I.U.) regarding a package that they had intercepted.
 
The Agent with H.S.I.U. relayed that the package was being shipped from China through the United States Postal Service to a residence located in the 4900 block of Airstream Avenue, Arcata. The package contained 106 grams of MDMA also known as Ecstasy.
 
On Friday, May 3 at about 10:30 a.m., the Humboldt County Sheriff’s Office assisted by the Drug Task Force and H.S.I.U. conducted a controlled delivery of the 106 grams of MDMA to the residence located in the 4900 block of Airstream Avenue, Arcata. After the delivery of the MDMA, Officers served a search warrant at the residence.
 
Officers detained five suspects at the residence. During their investigation officers learned that Bradley C. Remington, age 20, who was one of the five subjects detained was the suspect that had ordered the narcotics from China. Remington was on felony probation for assault with a deadly weapon with a search and seizure clause.
 
Officers learned through their investigation that Remington’s residence was located in the 4900 block of Valley East Blvd, Arcata. Officers then went to Remington’s residence to conduct a probation search.
 
Officers located 10 pounds of processed marijuana in Remington’s residence. Officers placed Remington under arrest for possession for sales of a controlled substance (MDMA), possession of marijuana for sales and for violation of probation. Remington was booked into the Humboldt County Correctional Facility.  The other four suspects at the residence were released at the scene.
 
This case is still under investigation by the Humboldt County Sheriff’s Office and Homeland Security Investigation Unit

1) Is there anything besides drugs for sale on Silk Road? If not, are there other popular websites to sell items anonymously?

2) What's the process I'd have to go through in order to become a seller? How's the consumer rating system work?

3) Anybody interested in homemade venison jerky or other venison products? (Yes, it is illegal to sell wild deer meat without gov't permission which I'm certainly not interested it obtaining)

When: April 8, 2013

Where: New Jersey

Who: A bunch of guys in professional jobs who clearly didn't know each other, scattered around the state, who received drugs through the mail.

Method of bust: Unknown. Unlikely that they all received controlled deliveries on the same day. Unlikely that they all received drugs in the mail on the same day. They must have been being watched for quite some time.

1362237430.0,36,self.SilkRoad,19ivpk,The state of SR according to /r/silkroad and my opinions.,68,32,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/19ivpk/the_state_of_sr_according_to_rsilkroad_and_my/,"This is just pretty much an opinion piece, I don't think I am either 100% correct or 100% wrong, juts some observations and things that are bugging me, hopefully this spurs some discussion on the subjects I touch on. If not, well, I'm bored anyway. 

*full disclosure, this is coming from someone who is a vendor as well as a customer, so outlook may differ from your own.

*FE: this is the biggest and more pressing issue it seems to mist of you here. As a customer I have FE'd for a couple people, and not for a couple people, using my own judgement (one guy requested (Oliver), so I obliged knowing his reputation). Another, I was just in a good mood and it wasn't a crazy large order. So, obviously, it's your call. FE, don't FE whichever. But, please try and see this from a vendors perspective. New customer accounts cost $0, as they should. I have and have personally know a few other vendors who have gotten burned by ""new customers"" as I'm sure it wasn't their first account, by claiming the package wasn't received or the product was fake. As a vendor there's not much you can do about this besides providing a tracking number and pray, when this happens a 50/50 resolution isn't unheard of. You just lost 50% of your sale and the customer got all his product. Then  you blacklist the customer and they just open another account. What is one to do? Cost of doing business? maybe. I think unfair, I have instituted a $300/5 transaction minimum for customers for not FEing, I find it fair, but in the end if someone finds that unreasonable from a vendor with 100% feedback and hundreds of transactions, don't order from me I guess. Once again, this I do not find unreasonable for the risk I take. International orders, I think FE is somewhat reasonable as long as the vendor guarantees delivery, 3 weeks is a long time to have no cash from drugs you already sent out.

*""Bunk"" drugs: This makes me laugh, sure this happens sometimes, it sucks, fuck those people. But hey, this isn't fucking Amazon with guarantees and customer satisfaction surveys and recourse for everything, you are dealing with illegal substances dealt on a black market, sometimes that shit is gonna happen. You have ZERO right to be all up in arms about it, you are taking a risk by (once again) ordering FUCKING DRUGS from DRUG DEALERS. Shits gonna happen, don't be shocked. You aren't entitled to an explanation and a refund, you got ripped off, mistakenly or not. Just inform the vendor and see what he/she says, you aren't entitled to shit. 

*TOR/SR: Hey, ITS FUCKING TOR, no SR is not down (unless it's down), it's most likely flooded or you're on a bad tor tunnel, have patience and retry, it takes time, this isn't clearnet.

*Buying Coins: BST seems to be your best option by all the feedback, the worst (in my opinion) is MT Gox. Use Bitinstant (if it ever works again) or ZIGGAP. Don't expect exact market rate from any of these but do your research and be happy you can do this shit at least semi-anonymously.

*Cashing out: If you're a vendor or the such and need to cash out, don't fucking expect market rate or even close to it, you are effectively laundering money, that shit ain't free, don't buy Moneypacks and load them into your PayPal, that shit is easily traced if someone wants to. You're paying for anonymity.

*Signing for shit: Check with vendor before ordering, if he requires signature (for example if it's shipped EMS or the such), judge THEN if you wanna sign for shit. When it comes, and you need to sign for it, don't get all rattled, you knew you had to sign, unless the package is all fucked up or unsealed then resealed you really have nothing to worry about. Just sign for the fucking thing and enjoy. If the vendor doesn't require a signature and you're asked to, then a red flag should pop up. This whole bullshit I see here about ""NEVER sign for a package"" is total bullshit, check with the vendor.

*Impatience: Come on, 3 days later you're bitching your shit wasn't shipped yet when you ordered on a Friday night and it's Monday morning? Chill the fuck out, vendors have lives and hey, the Post Office has very short hours Saturday and CLOSED an Sunday. Explain to me how your vendor could have shipped your shit? Calm down and wait for it, once again, it's not Amazon.

In short, chill out, don't panic, don't FE if you don't want but understand why its done, chill the fuck out and enjoy your drugs

In addition, if you're that guy who spams peoples mailbox for ""free samples""... fuck you, buy your own drugs, you don't need samples of a fucking drug that comes from the pharmacy.

1367202019.0,39,self.SilkRoad,1db7vc,PGPClub and a critique of Atlantis. Also Pine AMA! :),54,15,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1db7vc/pgpclub_and_a_critique_of_atlantis_also_pine_ama/,"  I thought it would be appropriate to comment on why using PGP is important.  
    

  I get the same vibe from Atlantis promotional material as I do with the relentless Privnote endorsements. The admin of BlackMarketReloaded, backopy, has competed with SR for some time, and I have no problem with that whatsoever. So this isn't a ""Get off my Lawn"" comment:  
    

  Secure communications cannot and should not be automated because of the security illusion it creates. If it was an easy problem, it would have been solved by the cipherpunks 10 or 15 years ago. You cannot automate message encryption because you cannot outsource your security. Or rather you can, and then you can crash and burn. It's a similar principal to hiring mercenaries or putting all your trade secrets unencrypted in the cloud. It works great and you think yourself a cost saving genius until it turns on you. In the case of a Darknet Market, the consequences are much worse than simply having a busted business model, it's time to Go To Jail, Do Not Collect $200.  
    

    
  LEA [law enforcement agency] hate PGP because it makes hacking a darknet market's servers a very messy process indeed. They can capture everybody who enters a plaintext address (by being a passive adversary, eavesdropping over time), but they cannot do anything about the customers and vendors using PGP encryption. Those are the customers and vendors who are most likely to survive to fight another day and so they realize that A Big Raid only produces a game of high tech Whack-A-Mole. Indeed the only reason why LEA would take down SR's servers, assuming they are rational, is to make a political point. Otherwise they shall listen passively, trying to accumulate as much data to deanonymize vendors as possible.  
    

  This environment leads to SR customers and vendors assuming that SR is already compromised, that all communications are logged, that Private Messaging is really public as any post on a forum. This makes for a permeable network. Infiltration is simply irrelevant to adept SR users. Admittedly we're not all there yet. Probably 5% - 10% of SR's customers use PGP. But it is important nonetheless, since black markets must have some element of Pareto efficiency to them, most of  the professionals with larger volumes are certain to be using PGP.  
    

  The best that LE agents can hope for is a critical mass of vendors being too naive to understand why they should use PGP encryption, so they can achieve A Big Raid and follow up with a campaign of psychological warfare to undermine trust in the network's ability to function properly. This is why, as I'm sure Gwern will appreciate, an Eternal September is one of the biggest threats to a Darknet Market. It is also why education is the key to SR's survival.  
    
    
    
  If they are LEA then my hypothesis is that they are using the same strategy as the Thugs.  
    
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuggee
    
  &gt;""Thuggee is described as a cult of people engaged in mass murder. The modus operandi was to join a caravan and become accepted as bona-fide travellers themselves. The Thugs would need to delay any attack until their fellow travellers had dropped the initial wariness of the newcomers and had been lulled into a false sense of security, gaining their trust. Once the travellers had allowed the Thugs to join them and disperse amongst them - a task which might sometimes, depending on the size of the target group, require accompaniment for hundreds of miles - the Thugs would wait for a suitable place and time before killing and robbing them.""  
    
  By having sufficient numbers of people not using encryption, or encouraging 3rd party services such as Privnote, or relying the strength of serverside encryption solutions, LE ""Thugs"" could slyly disable the immunization effects of PGP encryption over time, using the acidic blend of stupidity, laziness and ignorance to erode people's commonsense.    
    
  I do not know whether Atlantis is made out of LE agents or merely just a bit naive about how their approach to encryption is being perceived, but I do know the use of secure encryption for communications is going to be absolutely pivotal to obstructing LE efforts. It seems an extraordinary coincidence that Altantis starts astroturfing at the same time SR came under attack. That I would like a comment on by the Atlantis administrators.  
    
  As others have pointed out on SRF, there remains the possibility that Atlantis did the DOS on SR in order to manipulate the cryptocurrency markets. It is also possible they are innocent and this was unfortunate timing for an ill conceived advertising campaign.  
    
    
  Either way, their approach to encryption concerns me. I don't think they really get it. Having a secure system is important, but it's all a castle on a cloud unless they have a sizable percentage of their customers and most of their vendors using PGP without the use of server side 'help'. It's not a computer network security problem, it's a human information security problem. If they did build up to SR's size without pervasive use of independently used PGP then they will only have succeeded in becoming the juiciest of the low hanging fruit.  
    
  There are ways to improve on SR's security model and business model, but so far the inhabitants of Atlantis just don't think in the right way about these things. Dare I point out that poaching customers from SR isn't the most productive use of a competitor's time when there is infinitely more ground to cover in encouraging new darknet market users to come online?  
    
  Note: if you haven't already, read the Atlantis ""Forum Registration Agreement"". To say the least, it's weird. Here are some quotes:  
    
&gt;""You agree, through your use of this forum, that you will not post any material which is ... stuff ... or otherwise in violation of any International or United States Federal law.""
    
&gt;""The owners of this forum also reserve the right to reveal your identity (or any other related information collected on this service) in the event of a formal complaint or legal action arising from any situation caused by your use of this forum.""

  HUH?!  
    
  Either they didn't read it themselves or something much weirder is going on.

They don't send out domestic seizure letters unless it's cash.,107,72,187,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1kfzdh/thurgood_is_a_liar_spoke_with_postmaster_in_idaho/,"Please read before you down vote this. I know everyone here loves TJ. Lets get down to the facts.

I spoke with the postmaster Daniel Corral of Boise. I claimed I was a student doing a paper. Very nice guy who you could not get to stop talking. I threw a few bullshit questions at him, and allowed myself to build up to the seizure related stuff. I will highlight the main responses he gave me.

*You can use whatever return address you want on when sending registered mail. Even if its out of state from where you are mailing.

*The only time a seizure letter is sent, is when the postal inspector seizes cash. I should of asked him why cash would be seized, but didn't

*Opening a package is a serious thing needing the permission of a judge. They are not customs and can't just randomly open packages hoping to find drugs. When a package is opened its because they know that it will 100% contain some kind of narcotic. In the event that even the smallest amount of a controlled substance is found, the postal inspector will contact a postal inspector in the receiving state to attempt a investigation and arrest. He said a postal inspector will without doubt knock on a door.

*In his many years working for USPS, he has never heard of, or seen, a seizure letter for narcotics for domestic packages being sent. ""Someone always gets handcuffs if a domestic package contains drugs.""

The 5 people who were sent the letters, were they fe? If they were escrow thurgood may have done that because he has no supply to send.

TJ might be setting up for his final act, where he is arrested and taken away to jail. In reality he's just screwing everyone who FE'd over.

Many people from over 3 weeks ago have received nothing.

Got a slip from Parcelforce (this is in Leeds, UK), to pick it up. Went to pick it up. Go to the guy at the counter. He looks disinterested. 5 minutes before closing time. I give him the slip. He goes to get it.

He looks at the screen. He writes some stuff on some form. He looks back at the screen. I see that his eyes are widened now. He focuses very intently on not fucking up what he's writing down. He asks me for my ID. I give it to him nonchalantly and I notice surprise in his eyes. He writes down my passport ID. He asks me to sign. I sign it. Less surprise this time but I notice a WTF look on his face. He finishes with me and is clearly agitated ...... I realise now I should not have signed ... Going to pick it up instead of having it redelivered was stupid.

The package looks like it has been opened. It took about 14 days from India, which is a tad longer than I would expect. So at this point I'm fairly confident that customs have noticed it, and have my name &amp; address down. It was only a small-ish amount of benzos so I don't think they'll bust my door down, however out of paranoia I've completely cleared house. 

My question is now:

I have the package at home, unopened, hoping that I'll be able to deny wtf it is. Should I throw it away? Bring it to the post office to try and return it to its sender?

Other than that I also have another (domestic) shipment coming unfortunately that I cannot cancel ... what should I do with this stuff when it comes in ~5 days? How does UK law enforcement work? What are my risks here?

I got in on MDUKs new vendor special for 2x of his 110mg Molly right before he ran out, I forget exactly the price but it was a great deal so I didnt hesitate to order

It got here pretty quick from UK to US. Can't say the exact date it arrived because I was out of town for about 10 day. Our mailroom held my packages over that time and I got 3 orders in today. These were actually my first three SR drug purchases, and they were all waiting for me.

Stealth- 5/5 really good and the pills were well disguised. i was very impressed.

Communication: 5/5 Really cool guy and really understanding, was totally chill that I couldnt get the package the day it arrived.

-------------
Alright so last night I just went to bed halfway through the review just because it was taking so long to get the words from my head onto the computer haha. So here's my review of the product

PRODUCT: 5/5; I'll start my report out by saying I've only rolled twice before yesterday, and both times they were at a rave. I had wanted to just take molly by myself and just hangout this time, because the last two times I could never actually tell if the molly was effecting me or if it was just the music and lights that were making the rave enjoyable. I wanted to see what rolling was like on its own.

So I went on a whim, and about an hour after I got the packages, I decided I wanted to roll, so I took one of the 110mg capsules, at around 4:20. I wasn't sure if two was going to be too much, so I saved it for later in case I wanted it. After I took the first one, me and a buddy of mine took a bike ride to the beach to find the spot where he had hidden some of his wax before break. When we got there, we decided to walk around a bit and enjoy the view of the beach and the lagoon. I was starting to feel the come up about 50 minutes in, but it wasn't too overwhelming and I wasn't sure if I was rolling yet. But I did feel pretty good. So we went to a really cool spot on campus and i climbed down to the water's edge, and took the second one about 70 minutes in. 

About 10-15 minutes after that, things started to get REALLY fun. I could definitely feel it at that point, and as we were riding back, i would close my eyes and feel the cool breeze around me, and it felt fantastic. He wanted a coffee on the way, so we stopped in a coffee shop. As he ordered I was looking at some really cool paintings they had up and the colors were just so vivid. It was really incredible and that's when I knew it was gonna be a good couple of hours. I turned to my friend, gave him a big smile and a thumbs up. He knew what was up.

We went into another buddy of mine's dorm so they could smoke. I just felt like enjoying the roll by itself at that point so i decided not to join. We hung for about 30-45 minutes, listened to some music, and enjoyed ourselves. After that they went to another room and I decided to go back to my room.

When I got back one of my roommates was in, and he knew I was rolling. I felt REALLY conversative, and I had a real nice long talk with him just about life, being roommates, and girls. It was a really fun conversation and then I put on some deep house on the speakers and just grooved for a bit. We continued to talk and I felt like we grew closer. I told him how thankful I was to have a roommate like him, yadda yadda yadda. Looking back now a lot of the things i was talking about seems pretty childish and silly, especially when I look back at the 2 or 3 messages I sent MDUK while I was rolling. But I mean I was rolling HARD. I felt like a young child, I was so giddy and the world around me looked so beautiful and vivid. He left for the gym, and right around then my other roommate walked in. We talked as well, just not as much since he's not as much of a talker. Again though I told him that I was grateful to have him as a roommate. I listened to some music over headphones, and it was just beautiful. I was having so much fun.

Throughout this whole time, my jaw was clenching up like a motherfucker. Seriously I think I sent MDUK a message saying like ""If my roll were a movie it'd be called JAWS"". It was just going absolutely nuts, and I went through like 10 pieces of gum in 2 hours. I was definitely peaking in my room and it was just so beautiful. I had been worrying and thinking before this that maybe MDMA just doesn't really effect me, but I definitely felt it yesterday.

When I was starting to come down, it was about 3 and a half hours after I had popped the second one. But this isn't to say I had stopped rolling, I was still going pretty strong. At that point I decided I wanted to smoke. So I hit up the guys I was with before, and headed up to their room to smoke some. I bought 2 Grams and smoked a good amount up there.

Smoking brought me RIGHT back up. I was back into heavy rolling about 15 minutes after my first bowl, and was so happy. We played some more music, and I was going pretty crazy to the music. My friends were laughing pretty hard. My friend tried to ask if I was down to go to his room to play some zombies but I literally could not understand the words coming out of his mouth. It literally sounded like gibberish. I finally understood, and went over. I stood in the back and listened to headphones as they played zombies, it was pretty great.

I decided i wanted to be alone then, and went back to my room. Chilled for a bit, smoked some more and just enjoyed the rest of the roll. In all it lasted a good 7 hours or so total; I was still a bit loopy when i went to bed at 12:30 but it wasn't difficult at all to fall asleep. I was pretty worn out at that point. 

The comedown was sooooo easy, literally felt great the whole way. My jaw was still going the whole time, which got annoying towards the end but it was worth it. 

All in all, the roll absolutely fucking fantastic. I had so much fun, but looking back I can't really describe what rolling really ""felt"" like. I absolutely knew I was rolling, but I just couldn't really put it into words other than ""I'm having fun"" haha. But anyways, thank you SO much MDUK I'll definitely be in contact in the future for further orders, as I've got a bunch of concerts coming up in the area.

If any of you guys have any questions about my experience just let me know, I'll be happy to answer them!

EDIT: I forgot to mention how clear-headed I was throughout the whole thing. The roll was just SO clean and I was able to process thoughts at a pretty normal level. I was having so much fun but like didn't feel ""fucked up"" like some drugs make me feel. Again only my 3rd time rolling so I can't say if it's the best out there but it was really fun. Also, every 30 seconds or so my eyes would like shake up and make things unreadable and I'd have to recalibrate haha it was crazy.

You first find out about Silk Road, and you think to yourself, ""There's no way this all could possibly be real."" So you do a bit of digging, you research how it all works, how Bitcoins and their transactions work, how PGP works, how we use the USPS system to work AGAINST the powers that be, and you read up on the vendors you think would be a suitable choice to make your first purchase. Do they have great feedback? Do they have obviously fake feedback that is used solely to ""boost"" their ratings and have plausibility? Have you checked the forums about this vendor yet? Have you searched for MULTIPLE threads about the vendor? Did you message the vendor before placing an order? Did you try to get a feel for their work ethic before you blindly bought from their store? Are they customer service oriented, or will they just do what they think you want to see in order to get paid, without really providing any kind of customer service at all (Looking at you NorthWestDirect). If it all checks out and you feel comfortable, you will then go ahead and place your order. Now comes the part where your order is processing for the 4 day period before you have the option to cancel. Do they act right away? When was the last time the vendor was active? Was it today? Usually on their page they will have some information about processing times and shipping estimates. I don't know about you, but by now I generally know how long mail takes to arrive depending on where it is coming from. Mail, on average, will not take more than 4 business days to reach me no matter where it is coming from. Once the vendor marks the item in transit, all you can do from this point on is wait for it to arrive. Did they wait until 1 hour before you could cancel to mark it ""In Transit?"" Chances are, that item isn't being shipped yet and the vendor was just covering their own ass. In the future, do not do business with them unless they provide you with a VALID excuse as to why this happened. I know that if an item is marked in transit and it does not arrive within 4 days domestically, that vendor blatantly lied to me. To me, there is nothing worse than expecting a package to arrive one day only to find out that it didn't. So, my actual question to you all is this:

Edit: This is disturbing.

Meiklejohn and fellow researcher Damon McCoy, an assistant professor of computer science at George Mason University, have been mapping out a network of bitcoin wallets that are used exclusively by the curators of the Silk Road. If you wish to transact with merchants on the Silk Road, you need to fund your account with bitcoins. The act of adding credits appears to be handled by a small number of bitcoin purses.

“All Silk Road purchases are handled internally by Silk Road, which means money trades hands from the Silk Road account of the buyer to the Silk Road account of the seller,” explained Meiklejohn, author of the paper, A Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among Men with No Names, to be released in October 2013 at the ACM Internet Measurement Conference in Barcelona, Spain.

 Some of you will recognize me from SR, but let's ignore that. I want to appeal to your intelligence and nothing else.

Vendors who jumped ship after three days of downtime to a very new and untestest service is putting themselves and therefore their buyers at unecessary risk. 

The following reasons are why I believe this in no particular order:

Atlantis front page makes many claims, most importantly that they are more secure than the Silk Road. Much of their public image hinges on how much they are better. Upon investigation they are a pretty clone that simply does not have all the features of their predecessor. So they are lying to everyone on their front page and throughout their site.

On their forums and on their site their administrators spend a massive amount of time talking about silk road in a negative fashion and how much better they are. If they really were better wouldn't they be adding new features to the idea instead of just playing catch up? Atlantis did not even launch with auto-finalization, they had not even thought of that when they made their site public. This and many other features are still being rolled out.

Their staff encourage you to share your connect your identity back to Silk Road which increases a vendors attack surface. It allows for security vulnerabilities at atlantis to affect the customers of SR. By doing this the vendor is taking alot of risk admitting their identity to a very new site. 

Atlantis encrypts messages locally on the server side, which is reckless and not secure. Either they care very little about your security, believe you should really trust them or simply don't know that it is bad practice. Any of these should make you wary. 

I'm not suggesting Atlantis is DEA or some government entity, what I am saying is that they require you to give them a lot of trust. It is built in a way that if it was comprimised it could do a lot of damage to the community.

My first set of orders was around a month ago and wanted a chance to test as many products as I could before I reviewed them.  

1) Tessellated- 10 strip of LSD.

* Communication (5/5)- I ordered around the time he did his AMA here, and his response time was still pretty quick.  Exactly what I expected from a top vendor.

* Shipping/Stealth (6/5)-  Shipping to US took a little more than a week.  This was my first order, and I knew the stealth would be great.  I got frustrated because I couldn't find anything!  Man, I was blown away.  

*  Product (?/5)-  Unable to test it, but I have no doubts about the quality.  It is safely stored away until then.

2) Silo-  100 x 25c-NBOMe

* Communication (10/5)-  He answered all my questions within an hour.  He had shipping issues and kept me informed the whole time.  We even had a nice chat about his products and what he hopes to have in stock for the future (LSD).  Really awesome dude.

* Shipping/Stealth (5/5)- Shipping was around a week over a holiday and weekend.  Steath was just fine for domestic orders.

* Product(5/5)-  His tabs are potent as advertised (1000ug).  One made for an excellent night out with friends.  

3)  Chem4Coin- 10 x Etizolam

* Communication (N/A)

* Shipping/Stealth (5/5)- Package took 6 days to arrive over a weekend.  Blended in nicely with all my other mail.  I thought it was something else I had ordered off the internet.

* Product (?/5)- I had some spare change and thought it would be a good idea to have benzos on hand.  Waiting for a bad trip or a lazy day to try it.    

4)  MUSHBUD- 10g Powder Sample

* Communication  (5/5)-  Fast and friendly replies.  

*  Shipping/Stealth (4/5)-  Shipping time was slightly over a week.  The only issue I had was the lack of return address, which made it different than the rest of my mail.  He now includes one for international orders, which is nice.

*  Product (5/5)-  I got his second batch, which some people had issues with potency with the first few orders he sent out.  This was my first time with shrooms and I was worried that I got the weak batch.  I lemon tek'd 2g and had a great trip.  Relaxing on my couch listening to Pink Floyd enjoying the visuals and body high.  Almost had a bad trip when I heard very loud smashing noises, but laughed it off when I realized it was just the music.  It was intense!

5)  GrandWizardsLair- 2 x 5mg DOM tabs

* Communication (N/A)

* Shipping/Stealth (5/5)-  I ordered priority shipping, received 3 days later.  Stealth was simple and effective.

* Product (?/5)- Have not tested yet, but look forward to the long trip soon.  He even threw in an extra tab!

6)  Hallucinating Horse - 1g MDMA rocks

* Communication (5/5)- He replied in a few hours and was kind when answering my questions.

* Shipping/Stealth (6/5)- I ordered the ""Where the hell is it?"" steath, and was not dissapointed.  Took 3 days and shipped out a few hours after placing the order.  Package was completely inconspicuous.  You have to work to find it.  More than enough for a domestic order. 

*  Product(5/5)-  I felt comfortable ordering at this point, and went with a new vendor.  I reagent tested it, and it is legit MDMA.  Nice rocks, no powder.  I have never tried MDMA before, but look forward to taking at an upcoming concert with friends.

&gt; The Drug Enforcement Administration posted an Official Notification that Bitcoin (i.e. property) belonging to Eric Daniel Hughes was seized for forfeiture pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 881, because the property was used or acquired as a result of a violation of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. §§ 801 et seq.)
&gt;
&gt; ...The Bitcoin address referenced in the complaint received a transaction for 11.02btc at 17:10:36 Blockchain time on the date noted as “seized”.
&gt;
&gt; The honeypot scenario seems more likely as the sender-address was not emptied into the “DEA” account.   There is one other transaction in the referenced account, for 17.24btc which entered 5/22/13 and is transferred out 5/28/13 - It moves through one intermediary account, is then combined into a block of 200btc and moves through an account that transacts only in 100 or 200btc blocks totaling 10,100btc.  Following any one of those 200btc blocks leads you to apparent “mixer” transactions, small amounts of value peeling off of the larger amount at each hop.    Taint analysis reveals that nearly 10% of those bitcoins eventually pass through an address responsible for transacting more than 419,000btc since 2012

I'm wondering what you guys think of Atlantis, and why you use it or don't use it. It's great that prices are in dollars instead of bitcoins so you know exactly how much you're paying without having to calculate each transaction. There's also a much smaller chance of getting scammed, especially since Atlantis now has a vendor leader board which lets you see the most trustworthy vendors.

Anyways, flash forward and I get a message from EMonkey, asking me to lie and say my package got here and he would give me some BTC for my troubles.  Created a throwaway, because I said I would do it, but then my morals got the best of me so I'm saying something on here.

He somehow shipped massive quantities of weak tabs to people without knowing it, even though he laid it himself. Either he's fucking incompetent or just doesn't give a shit.

I also wouldn't be surprised if he can't buy enough of his product to meet the demand for it. And even if he can, why not take the easy road and just cash out now/come back as a new vendor in a couple months?

Now i have made a thread on SR forum 20 views no replies.

From checking one message i have got a tracking code which revealed his full ADDRESS, after this i closed tor and got a new identity.

I mean this is serious right? (yes i have screen shots off the account for SR Admins/DPR).

but what if someone logs onto your account and finalizes your orders. (in this case 500+ dollars of orders)

I will message SR support/DPR and await instructions...

Ok an EDIT: I OPENED UP TOR BROWSER, (a new ID a new control panel from start as you do.) I WENT TO SR I WASN'T GREETED WITH A LOGIN PAGE I WAS INSTEAD ALREADY LOGGED INTO AN ACCOUNT (SAID DETAILS ABOVE) i have messaged SR support from he account, so when the owner logs in he can verify to SR that he didn't send said message.

Im getting called a fake etc, when all i have done is open up tor gone to SR and been logged into an account that's to me worrying, downvote do what you see fit but when i get a reply/response from SR confirming what happened. ill be back.


Confirmed been shown to DPR by a SR admin, Reddit once again proving what a totally up there own ass community they are.

**hi folks, wow I am incredibly sorry about this.  last week we were having login issues and we had to rewrite the entire system that handles logins and sessions to get the bugs out.  We overlooked one thing that lead to this mistake.  Basically it was checking weather a large random string of characters was unique.  The odds were so low for what is called a collision that it was overlooked, but indeed a collision occurred in this case.  The chances of it happening were about 1 in 10e^26.  That's 10 with 26 zeros.  Anyway, forensics showed it was the only incidence and we've added a uniqueness check that will prevent this from happening again.  I was actually suspicious when we had a bug free release of the new system!**

My last post is ancient now. This post is continuation of the introduction sale I was promoting on Reddit almost 2 months ago. You can find my SR listing here:

http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/99b619e6a9

In my original post I had promised Reddit another 250 before ending the sale, I've made that instead 300 for a show of gratitude.

I'm offering 10 Grams for $25 + $5 shipping.  I am now able to include a Return Address for all International orders.  I am also including some dressing to my stealth that may help deceive a Customs agent should the pack be opened.

I have a Quantity of 300 on this sale.  Once this Quantity sells out I will be introducing my regular price, and don't intend to have another sale until perhaps Xmas.

I appreciate the support, It's been an experience with ups and downs on Reddit.  I've taken my lumps and hoping that I've satisfied everyone's expectations.  I have some big future plans to help increase stealth and potency, I look forward to implementing them and serving the SR Community (until SR is no more, or I'm put in a cage ;)

EDIT: I also wanted to help promote a great subreddit that you may or may not be aware of. You can find links to my specials and other SR Vendor deals here:

Hi all,

It has come to our attention that some users on Silk Road believe the following;

1.  That I am a scammer and was involved in a Ponzi scam on Silk Road.
2.  The moderators at Atlantis market are deleting user comments.
3.  Our forums term of use policy is aimed to arrest people and record information.
4.  That we are DDoS'ing Silk Road.
5.  Our PGP system is crackable.

I'd like to take the time to address each point and if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reply to this thread. The staff members at Atlantis and I are happy to address your questions.

1) This belief has come into existence as 'Vladimir' was a scammer on Silk Road and thus people thought I was the same person as him. Unfortunately without knowing Vladimir's past history, this is my name and the one I have chosen to use. Hypothetically if I was Vladimir, why would I use a scammers alias at a market place which deals directly with user funds? It wouldn't help build trust in our market place and doesn't make any sense at all. Its the equivalent of pirateat40 creating a new Bitcoin Savings and Trust scheme and asking people to re-invest in it. We're proud to say that in our 7 weeks of operation, we have suffered no down time, no users have lost funds and security concerns have been addressed promptly (like increasing PGP key support up to 16Kbits).

2) We have deleted posts only related to spam, posts involving unfounded claims or accusations (FUD) and have deleted no posts in which people have given us criticism, bug reports or requests about improving security. You can check the relevant forum sections to find examples of this. We actively encourage this feedback as it helps us create a better market place. We are here to help users and are happy to reply to any security concerns or criticism you have. We have also created a sticky topic in the general forums for people to post whatever conspiracy theories they like. We will not be moderating this thread however the other forum rules still apply.

3) We used the default term of service which comes with the forum software. You can find an exact replica when you download and install the SMF software. This has now been updated. 

4) We believe competition is healthy and believe that Dead Pirate Roberts is a great leader. We also need to shed the light that Silk Road has had technical issues in the past, even when we weren't around. Things like item listing image hijacking, denial of service attacks, site upgrades and switching hosting providers all caused down time. Although it would assist in us gaining more market share if our largest competitor is down, we have no desire to resort to dodgy tactics. We believe that what goes around comes around.

5) The auto-encryption service only works IF the user or vendors uploads their PGP public key (we support key sizes of 1024 - 16384 bits). However, Atlantis also supports manual encryption outside of Atlantis in which users can use a PGP client to encrypt their message. Atlantis administrators and law enforcement could not decipher the encrypted message without the users private key. With all this said, the security comes down to the end user. If they don't trust the auto-encryption service, they can STILL manually encrypt the message outside of Atlantis and thus there is absolutely no risk of anyone being able to decipher the message. To this day, PGP with large key sizes (&gt;= 4096bits) is still uncrackable, you can find more information about it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#Security_quality. Noting: 'there is no known method which will allow a person or group to break PGP encryption by cryptographic or computational means.'

As stated earlier, if you have any concerns please don't hesitate to reply to this thread. Lastly, we'd like to thank all the people who have put their trust in Atlantis and believe in where we are heading. The ride is only just starting and we're glad to have you as part of Atlantis

NEVER FE. The only reason SR works is because of the escrow system. Outside of it you have NO recourse in the situation you get scammed.  

MP/WU/Vanilla Reloadedit to MPs ARE NOT PROTECTED BY ESCROW!!! DON'T DO IT.  Even if the vendor in question has tons of great reviews means nothing. They could either be selective scamming or creating the accounts themselves to leave the reviews giving you a false sense of security.  Unfortunately, SR has not implemented an escrow for these services yet. You are completely at the mercy of the vendors honesty (or dishonesty).

**2)** ....your [Blockchain.info](http://blockchain.info) wallet you made before the transaction (easy as shit to sign up for and use)

**3)** Use your blockchain wallet to siphon (and subsequently tumble) funds to SR. You honestly don't *need* anymore anonymity than that. Quit worrying about the most secure part of this way of buying drugs, and concentrate on the riskier aspect: from the dealer's house to your hopefully non-incriminating destination address.

**4)** I'd recommend using mtgox as a holding area for funds even though you sign up using real info, because you can hold USD there, and it also gives you an easy and sometimes kinda profitable way to speculate at BTC trading.

**5)** Quit worrying that the FBI is phishing YOU, the newbie, to find your tiny potential SR drug purchases. If you were a big fish, you wouldn't be asking a clearnet silkroad forum how this all works.


Any more questions, please dear god head over to /r/bitcoin. There is an entire subreddit dedicated this stuff.

**Bonus #6)** It behooves you to use SilkRoad's actual forum site. Use this sub casually, but note all the dumb questions asked over and over and over again here. Not only will you find more/better answers on the SR forums, bonus security as it's a Tor site. Sure it's slow, but so are years in prison the more clearnet crap you have attached to your IP address.

That's all I got.


**Edit** Their [bitinstant's] twitter feed was saying they still were having problems doing direct transfers to mtgox accounts. You can select the big yellow funding options aarow then select bitcoin from the dropdown menu, and they give you a temporary bit coin address. That might work better than depositing directly to mtgox account numbers.

[bitinstanthelp](https://twitter.com/bitinstanthelp) is bitinstant's twitter support feed. If your bitinstant transfer lags or seems like its stuck/not going through, *immediately* log a support email and include all your info from your transaction in it using bitinstant's support page. It's a vague, simple support email and feels like its going to go nowhere, but finally after 7 days (from the big mishap) i got an email asking me for more info, and within the hour it was fixed.

Then he messages me saying he'll blacklist me for this review and if I change it he'll reship it on monday (this was on the weekend). Monday came and he didn't ship it and when I asked him today he asked me for my address again and said he ship me double tomorrow. Honestly it feels like this guy is just trying to fuck me over and keep his stats good with the threat of a black list. 

Anyways, what should I do about this situation and do you guys think its fair for vendors to blacklist people for leaving bad reviews?",,False,,t5_2sidu,False,,,True,t3_1etfg2,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1etfg2/mjimm_blacklisting_for_bad_review/,
1367499878.0,33,self.SilkRoad,1djqsh,Vendor Review: MDUK,43,10,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1djqsh/vendor_review_mduk/,"A few weeks ago I decided to order half a gram of his acetone washed MDMA. It was my second order from SR and was shipped from the UK to the Netherlands. The reason I went with MDUK instead of domestic suppliers was his presence in this subreddit and his promise of a very pure product. 

This was my second time using MDMA. The first time I used  I took half a pill (they were around 180mg) after which I redosed several times over the course of the night and ended up taking almost 300 mg total. Not very smart in hindsight! It was a great night but the body load was pretty bad and I ended up having a sore jaw for days.

For this second time I stated by parachuting 120mg. The really weird was that for the first 45 minutes I didn't feel anything. I was starting to get disappointed. Now I knew they weren't bunk because I had them reagent tested and it was fine. I decided to wait some more.
And what do you know, about 5 minutes later, my hands start becoming sweaty and I'm getting warm all over. Withing another 5 I was getting waves of warmth and euphoria and I knew it was good! 


I ended up not going out that night but just staying at home chilling with my girlfriend, another friend (who was also using) and some nice techno beats. It was an awesome night. Throughout I felt very chill, warm and euphoric. The high was much cleaner than the first time and not anywhere as much stomach cramps and muscle clenching. The hangover next day was also very bearable. Only some tiredness from the lack of sleep.

Communication 5/5- 1 or 2 days after I had placed my order I got a message that he had some problems with the washing process and that he basically messed up a batch. He said it would take him a few days to send and that if I didn't want to wait he would cancel my order without a problem. Messaging was very fast and professional 

Shipping- I cant say much about shipping times since he had a delay with his batch. However, once it was marked in transit it arrived within a few days (dont remember exactly)

Stealth 5/5- The stealth was excellent. From the outside you wouldn't be able to guess the contents. It did stand out a little from my normal mail but nothing that would seriously raise suspicion. He also uses MBB's which I like. I would say it was a little less creative than Interways stealth(which is the only thing I have to compare to) but it was more than adequate.

TLDR: Excellent vendor, great communication, fantastic product. Will order again in the near future.",,False,,t5_2sidu,False,,,True,t3_1djqsh,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1djqsh/vendor_review_mduk/,

Communication: 5/5. Fantastic considering the ddos and what not.  Also, the note/label on the packaging is straight up class.

I recently ran into an issue where I was a couple BTC short for a big order and didn't have time to use bitinstant again. I live in a small town and the closest moneygram place I can use is like 20 minutes away. Instead, I did some research and found 2 sites/ways to get a couple BTC with credit card. You may be able to buy much more, but I was only looking for a few so I'm not sure how easy it is to buy bulk BTC and the prices are slightly higher so you probably wouldn't want to.

1. VirWox - This is an interesting way to get them. This website is a currency trader for Second Life money. Second Life is a sandbox mmo type game which has become a hangout spot for furries and other creepy fetish-type groups. 

VirWox allows you to buy Linden (SL currency) then convert the Linden into BTC and withdrawal from there. Here are the fees for depositing money (can use credit/debit/many other sources):

https://www.virwox.com/deposit.php

Cons- It can take 48 hours to process BTC withdrawal due to security reasons. This to me makes it less than ideal for most purposes. It is still, however, a real way to get BTC using credit/debit.

Here is a decent guide I found on how to get BTC via VirWox:

http://www.scribd.com/doc/110005258/Buy-Bitcoin-via-Paypal-Paysafecard-Credit-Card-Ukash

2. BTCQuick.com - This website allows you to buy 'private keys' and 'Mt Gox redeemable codes.' Both of these can be redeemed on Mt. Gox. I went the private key route and am currently waiting for the confirmations to go through so it'll show up on my Mt. Gox account. Everything worked without a hitch. 

The downside: To use this website you will have to purchase a bronze membership. This costs $1. Not a big deal. You also have to upload a valid ID or utility bill showing you live at your billing address. I just took an iphone picture of my CA driver's license and uploaded it around noon PST. I was verified in &lt;20 minutes. As soon as I was verified a link to my private keys was emailed to me. Pretty painless and quick.

It's basically instant even with the verification. I think the business is so small that the owner can confirm you pretty quickly.

Price: Currently bitcoins are valued at $19.13. I paid $20.62
 on BTCQuick. Not bad at all. 7.78%. They advertised 7.5% over Mt. Gox prices.

So hopefully this guide will help some of you if and when you need to buy BTC with credit card. Overall I would recommend btcQuick over VirWox due to it being faster, but both work well. Let me know if you have any questions.

I should note that I still haven't received my BTC from VirWox since the withdrawal is waiting to be approved. I will let you guys know when it goes through though.",,False,,t5_2sidu,1359498290.0,,,True,t3_17itaf,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/17itaf/2_good_sources_for_buying_btc_with_a_credit_card/,

I remembered reading about it back in grade school when I would read TiHKaL and PiHKaL from erowid's website. Being one of the rarest psychedelics available, and one of Shulgin's favorites himself, I had to put my hands on this stuff to see if it was real.

**Shipping**

Took a matter of 3 days domestic US. Outstandingly fast and it doesn't seem that it has degraded at all. Stealth was as you would expect. **5/5.**

**Quality/Price**

Absolutely a +++ in my book. I would much rather take this than LSD on any given day, and I have taken LSD many times before. I have taken one tab and it took about an hour to onset. There is a very clean and pure feeling to the trip, a small bit of eroticism, and a lot of euphoria. Hardly any body load whatsoever. The visuals are pretty parallel with LSD. Not as controlling as LSD either, I feel almost sober in my cognitive potential. I have no anxieties, went on a blissful bike ride earlier at 1 AM and didn't experience any paranoia. I feel as if I could sleep right now as well. And the best part is that it was cheaper than most of the certified LSD. **One of my favorite substances ever. 10/10.**

I would definitely recommend trying this while it is on the road! If you want to see more molecules like this one, support these vendors!

My landlord's wife then says that LE insisted they enter the residence for suspicion of animal abuse. I asked her if they had a warrant and she told me she didn't know so im assuming no? She opened the door and she said the cops immediately searched my room and im assuming ignored the animals all together. Anyone know if anything they did here is a violation of my rights?

&gt;Using carBAMazepine and ALPRAZolam together may alter the effectiveness of ALPRAZolam. If you take both medications together, tell your doctor if ALPRAZOLAM IS NOT EFFECTIVE. You may need a dose adjustment if you take both medications. It is important to tell your doctor about all other medications you use, including vitamins and herbs. Do not stop using any medications without first talking to your doctor.

We wish to become your EAST COAST suppliers of TOP quality cannabis wares! If you're on the East Coast, you benefit from fast shipping times!
We 100% believe in the Escrow system established on SR and since BTC is volatile, we always hedge your purchases.


--=As of April 17th ALL of our orders are sent securely through using Moisture Barrier Bags (MBBs)=--

We also ship USPS Priority mail ONLY so delivery times are typically between 2-4 days after you order. Our goal is to ship out our orders every day so you can
get yours fast. As buyers, we hated waiting for our orders to come in, so quick turn around on processing orders is one of our top priorities.

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
Why we do this:

We aim to be the most honest vendor on Silk Road. To that extent allow us to open up as to WHY we've decided to take this next step and become a vendor here in the first place.

1. It beats peddling our wares on the street level. (where there's the most risk of getting caught and ending up in jail)

2. We can afford to sell at a lower prices than you could normally get on the street level. BTC is here to stay and we're also active day traders so we leverage our BTC for higher profits on our end!

3. We have dull computer day jobs that don't pay nearly as much as SR. We also don't believe in the war on drugs. We're nerdy rebels with lots of access to cannabis! So with that spirit in mind, we are committed to being successful and proving top quality wares to all our customers.

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
Our Promise:

I have been using SR for over a year now to supply my customers with wares I am unable to source on my own. However, we have many sources for Cannabis and other wares. This allows us to be picky and only purchase the HIGHEST quality cannabis available from the numerous suppliers we work with. We pass up on 2 out of every 4 or so offers we receive when buying bulk. This means our customers only get the best possible quality available.


Check us out and if you have any questions for us, feel free to post in the official SR forums or through SR messaging system.

Thank you all and happy toking!

I'm simply a guy who likes good weed. This is also a throwaway account.

Everybody who lives in Norway knows that the weed market can dry up quick and connections can wither and disappear quickly. That is of course where SR comes in.

I bought 25g of Mogwa Jack (a mix of Jack Herer and White Widow) from a vendor named Hogstandard, and I must say I'm really impressed.

The package was vacuum sealed and there was no noticeable smell. The package was also delivered within 24h by mail. 
I ended up paying just about 160 Norwegian kroner per gram, so it right in the range of street price.

The vendor sells both weed and hash, and in sizes of 5g, 25g or 50g. If you buy in bulk you get the best price per gram.

I ordered a quarter which thurgood was nice enough to split into an 1/8th of the Purple Kush and 1/8th of the Cherry Diesel.

Communication 5/5: Thurgood has the best communication and response time Ive ever seen. He literally responds to messages over the road faster than my friends respond to text messages. You can also contact him through reddit, the forums, and his tormail account which makes it even easier. Thurgood is also the friendliest dude around yet polite and professional at the same time.

Shipping 5/5: Thurgood shipped it Monday and I received it Wednesday to the Midwest. 

Appearance 5/5: My buddy has his green card so Ive been around the block with medical bud and this bud competes at the top. The cherry diesel came in 2 huge dense buds and the purple kush came in about 4-5 medium-large sized buds none of which were compressed at all. All of the bud is beautifully trimmed with perfect moisture content. Both strains are literally covered in trichomes and it is gorgeous! Im almost too scared to touch it because I don't want any to stick to my fingers.

Stealth 5/5: Packaging can't get much better than this. Multiple layers of protection ensures top-notch stealth.

Smell 5/5:  Wow! When I got to the last layer of protection the smell hit me like a truck! I literally had to go outside to transfer the bud into my jars because it was so loud. It's an awesome sweet-fruity smell too. To quote Dale Denton from Pineapple Express I just want to shove it up my nose and have that smell all day. No wonder why Thurgood uses so many layers of protection. 

The High ?/5: Ill be vaping some of it later tonight but lets me honest this bud won't disappoint.

Overall 5/5: Thurgood will be go-to vendor for bud from now. You can't get much better than this.

I only had enough for the unwashed but thought it would still be decent coke

I recieved the coke on saturday and proceeded to rail about a quarter of it. I felt nothing at all.
I then said ""Fuck it"" and did the rest of it, doing the whole gram in less than 30 minutes.
Immediately after doing that gram of coke i went and played poker with 4 of my best friends. I still felt nothing, and I did not tell my friends i did coke, and they didnt ask. They always know when i am on drugs, but didnt even question me. With no tolerance after a gram of coke i should be talking up a storm and wanting to conquoer the world.

This coke did absolutely nothing and I was very very very upset.
I messaged the seller to ask what went wrong, and he said no one else has complained about that batch and i find that impossible to believe. It was shitty coke. I have no reason to lie after 30+ other successful purchases in 4 months. I cant speak on his washed coke, but if he advertises his unwashed ever again DO NOT BUY IT. 

I also just saw a post about someone complaining about LLoysbrothers coke which is also in the top vendors by the cocaine avengers. Maybe cocaine avengers are rigged, or maybe once they have been rated high for a while they begin to cut their shit. I do not know but you have been warned. I can persoanlly vounch for 10toes if you want to take advice from someone thats been ripped off.

1.  If it really were a government honeypot, they certainly wouldn't have made the tactical blunder of initially making the site litecoin only.  I mean, think about it.  If you were the DEA, and wanted to attract as many people to your honeypot as possible, would you use some obscure, scarcely-used e-currency as your *only* means of commerce, or would you immediately use the most common and well-known e-currency?  It does not seem like the government would do it this way.

2.  The default TOS on the forums screams ""amateur.""  There is no way an presumably well-funded DEA sting operation would go to all the effort to create a fake SR-style site (a damn good one at that), and overlook the part were it talks about handing over IP addresses to authorities.  The much more likely (and less sinister) explanation is that the creators of Atlantis are enterprising people wanting to cash in on the clear demand for online black markets that perform better than the increasingly unreliable Silk Road.  It is probably their first ever attempt at creating an online black market (hence the silly mistakes).  That's the way the internet has always worked: one company comes up with a great concept, and another company greatly improves upon it.  How many of you still use Alta Vista as your search engine?  Or AOL as your ISP?  Let's face it, SR has *lots* of room for improvement.

My point is, while you guys keep on debating the merits of Atlantis and whether or not it's a honeypot, I'm just going to keep on using it.  The lack of traffic is just fine by me, since I can complete an entire transaction on Atlantis in the time it takes me just to *log on* to SR (an that's when the site is running well).

I suspect once it is well-understood by the majority of the general public, policy makers and law enforcement how extremely difficult it would be to try and shut down SR, the only way they are going to have any chance is by scrutinizing mail.

SR is already pretty popular but when the popularity and the user-friendliness (accessibility) both peak and everyone is able to use it effortlessly, I just see *something* happening and I'm trying to figure out what that will be.

They will of course name the bill after a ""child"" that ordered drugs off the Internet and died (like that ""Ryan ___ Act"" or whatever it is called).

I understand this is speculation but I can't help but see it coming. If they can even approve and try and pass bills like CISPA then I can see something like this going through. What logical reason would these pitchfork-carrying parents have to disagree with such a provision?

* How feasible would it be for them to scrutinize mail to high-enough of a degree to be effective? Could computers/visual-learning machines + x-rays or other devices be used to sort all packages containing pill shapes or other suspicious things and have them all sniffed by drug dogs en masse?

I placed a large order (~$400) with SuperTrips a little less than a month ago and didn't realize he required FE until the order was set to auto-finalize in 5 days. I was kinda upset that he didn't message to remind me of the requirement and when I messaged him asking whether or not he shipped the package and what I should do, I didn't get a response for 3 days and even then it was from ""SuperTrips Support."" All he was able to tell me was that he may have sent the package and that there was no way of really knowing and that he would have to check with ST.

As the auto-finalize date drew to mere hours, I put the order in the resolution center for an extension of 7 days. ST did not accept nor deny that resolution and this was right around when his rep was dropping significantly so I sketched out a little bit. I proposed a full refund to which I got no response so I eventually got my money back.

At this point, I though I had avoided a scam and called myself stupidly lucky. But then, ST messaged me kinda pissed that I gave him a 1/5 while I got a full refund. This was entirely unexpected, why would a scammer go out of his way to message me after I had already got a full refund and he didn't ship the package (it was up to around 20-25 days)? The conversation played out as follows:

""I gave a 1/5 because you didn't ship the package and didn't tell me, took 6 days for your assistant to to give no information, and a lack of response in the resolution center. I got a 100% refund because it was a one sided resolution""

""That's not what he said. in any case, you can read on my profile that Confirmed = accepted. He did not say it was not shipped.

It would've been nice to resolve your order and extend it for a while to remain in escrow.""

So here is what I think happened: ST started the FE policy to protect himself from scammers and when he got severely backed up for a few days, everyone cried wolf and it blew up in ST's face. His rep has dropped a full 10 points but I do not believe he is scamming people. I have ordered from him before without a problem and I know this is just one person's story but I wouldn't jump to conclusions about ST.

So, there's a new heroin vendor who is offering what could be a pretty good deal-50 stamps for $366. Since stamps usually go for 10 bucks each, this could be a savings of about $150.

He is adamant about using PGP for ordering, so I sent him a quick message saying ""hey bud, I have a couple of questions about your product, and I was wondering if I need to PGP encrypt or if I can just fire away.""

His response-""Just look at the picture. What you see is what you get.""

Um, no, dick. The picture is of a generic, blank stamp with no dope visible. How would I be able to gauge:

-How much cut is used?
-How potent the dope is?
-How it compares with other products on SR?
This one is EXTRA important:
-HOW MUCH IS IN EACH STAMP?

A lot of vendors are offering stamps these days;  some of them have 100mg+ of product in them, some of them barely have 20mg of product in them.  When you're getting 50 stamps, that's a huge difference:

50x100mg=5 grams, at $366 that's a BARGAIN.
5x50mg=2.50 grams-still a pretty decent price, but not quite so cheap
5x20mg=1 gram-not a good deal at all

I'm just trying to understand why a vendor who is brand new, has no sales and no feedback, would feel entitled to treat customers like shit.

When you're on the street cold copping, whatever thug approaches your car is probably your only option, so they can (and usually will) be rude and obnoxious, and they know you're still gonna buy.  Even most of my phone connects were short to the point of rudeness-if I had to ask the name of the street we were gonna meet on more than once, they typically lost their shit and accused me of being retarded.

But on SR, you have dozens of vendors to choose from for almost every product imaginable. I know if I was a vendor, I would strive to make each and every customer feel valuable.

This was mostly just a rant, but I'd love to hear other stories, either of vendors being asshats like this one, or vendors going out of their way to answer any questions you might have.

Edit: I think it's only fair to mention that he has come around a bit since our first contact.  What I was able to get out of him: he claims he has sampled all of the other stamp vendors on the road, and swears his stuff beats all of them.  I also asked if he could ballpark estimate the quantity of his whole shabang...was it more or less than 200mg? He said ""for sure more than 2 man."" So, not very specific, but we'll see. I believe what I'm going to is order a gram from gotsitall, and use my left over BTC to buy a few stamps from him to see what's up.  If it's good and not too light, I will give him a try.

This time we're going with a name you don't hear very often. FreeWay! 


Every post/review on here seemed to be about problems people had or something. I don't know what others went through but this is my personal experience:


Order: 500mgs of his #4 H. 

----------------------------

Communication 5/5: Prompt communication. He addressed every worry I had and was very chill about everything. What more can you say or ask for?

----------------------------

Stealth/Shipping 4.6/5: Ordered express late monday night, shipped on tuesday (at least this is what he told me. however, it didn't actually arrive until today. Thats a long time for express even though it never comes overnight because of my area. Still I expected it yesterday. On the label he printed the ship date as the 25th but on the stamp it says ""purchase date 26th"". I'm not sure what to think or believe but, it all worked out. I just needed to have it by friday. Would have preferred it on thursday though) and received on friday. This was a little bit longer than I would have liked but by no means anything unprofessional or unsatisfactory. 


Now for his stealth, it was very nice. No one would question twice what they saw if they opened the package. The only thing is that the vac bag should have been secured better or maybe have had one more layer of packaging because the vac sealed bag itself could have easily slipped out of what it was in. And if it slipped out it would have been sitting in the outmost layer of packaging so that if someone peeked in they would have instantly saw it.

------------------------

Quality 5/5!: This was very surprising to me. I expected something good but, not this good. Its a beautiful golden color with lots of little pebbles. He advertises it as ""raw/uncut"" which is a hyperbole and marketing but, this shit is fire nonetheless. Honestly, I find it to be better than the last shit I had from gotsitall. On par with the shit I got from SUBSRGOOD if you can believe that. The only difference is the legs are slightly shorter but, that might be a testament to my current tolerance more than anything. Quantity is good. I don't have a scale but I wouldn't be surprised if it weighed fat. It looked to my (admittedly with these small quantities, not expert) eye to be around 100mgs fat. 

----------------------------

Overall with subsrgood being gone for now and gotsitall only selling grams I'd say FreeWay is a *very* viable alternative. He deserves a lot more positive press/attention. He doesn't get his fair share on here or on the forums. I'm very happy with my experience and will be back for more. 

9.8/10! 

As always, I hope this helps you guys. Stay safe out there and keep it real.

With dealers, sure you can ask what they have and chances are they don't have everything SR has to offer or the quality that SR can guarantee.  Most of them probably haven't even heard of a lot of the stuff on SR.  Has it fueled your habit?

Not a single one of them has caused a problem or messed up an order, but one vendor has stood out above the rest: **Hatter26**

**Product Quality**  
Hatter is really known for his cold-shoot BTH, a product that has earned him a reputation not only for the fire, but also for being very much involved with harm-reduction on the road.  For example, his two lowest variations of his cold-shoot BTH include packs of orange needles as well as sterile water.

However, I'm not an IV user, so I've not purchased his flagship product.  I have, however, placed several orders of his pure oxymorphone.  This product arrives and seems so underwhelming.  But you take a little nick and snort it, had me nodding a bit and all energized, so i went for one of the nicest evening bike rides in awhile.

I also recently ordered his NEW fentanyl nasal spray (50 variety). With my tolerance, this product had me nodding at like 15 sprays over the course of 2 hours. Best of all, it's a clean solution and was prepared in perfect conditions, and hatter even offers links to the lab tests performed on the raw materials.  amazing!

**Service/Shipping and Stealth**  
Prior to this week, hatter would ship monday through saturday, but since becoming a heavyweight, has since toned that down and pretty much only ships mon-thurs, putting orders from friday morning out as well sometimes (see his page for more details on this). Not a big deal if you keep this in mind when ordering. Anyway, on the days he ships, he is prompt and doesn't delay.  Your stuff goes out pretty damn fast.

One of my favorite things about hatter is his stealth.  I won't speak to it specifically, as you'll have to order to see it for yourself.  But I will say that it is flawless and you have nothing to fear. As roald dahl would say, ""scrumdiddlyumptious.""

**Communication**  
Because I found PGP easy and all that, there was never a *need* to communicate with hatter.  But I did have an idea about a way to administer his oxymorphone so I sent him a quick message.  Fearing he might be too busy or just didn't want to be bothered with unnecessary messages, I let him know he could ignore me if necessary. To my surprise, he wrote back eagerly, even putting in some of his own feedback. He was more than willing to discuss his products and best practices as well as harm reduction.  A total class act when it comes to customer service. 

**Final Rating**^1  
Hatter26 is without a doubt a 5 star vendor (more on this below) and I thoroughly recommend him to all potential buyers.  You really can't go wrong for all the reasons mentioned above. He doesn't pressure you for FE or any such nonsense and the experience is comfortable and easy from start to finish. I will be back for more, join me!

*^1  As I plan to do this for more vendors, I'll establish a rating system that's easily understandable: 5 stars, with 1 being ""no not even once"", 2 being ""avoid unless you're about to w/d"", 3 being ""meh, maybe if the price is right"", 4 being ""solid but needs work"", and 5 being ""perfect.""* ",,False,,t5_2sidu,False,,,True,t3_19m510,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/19m510/vendor_review_if_youre_looking_for_a_decently/,

Each and every single one of them went impossibly smoothly - so I felt that these fine individuals deserved some praise. As a somewhat intermittent user of the road, I've seen vendors come and go. Even when you know what you're doing, when you read their reviews and skim the forums, you always have to wonder if you're gonna get screwed. With extreme pleasure, I give my seal of approval to these three.

Tessellated's LSD is downright amazing. Shipped easily within 12 hrs, arrived within 5 days to the states. His product brought me my first experience with the substance, prompting me to put in a second order. The man's stealth is crazy good - if you ain't expecting anything and scrutinizing it closely, you'd toss it in the trash without a second glance. Please order from this man, and please, please, please make sure you look closely. Not to mention, he's got a constant forum presence and is as friendly as they come.

Natasha had me a little worried at first - there's not much of a recent forum presence for her. But sure enough, my order was processed and arrived just promptly and stealthily. Nothing crushed, everything potent. If only I hadn't eaten it all so quickly. :(

Pharmacare as well, shipped within 24 hrs. Easily the cheapest prices on the road for certain goodies. Had the product within 3 day's time, stealthy as hell. Not to mention how creatively he communicated his appreciation. I know for a fact I will be placing another order - though hopefully not too soon. Can't be stokin' TOO hard of a habit.

There is a newish vendor (although after just a month, they now have almost 300 transactions, and a 99.99% positive feedback).  

Where do I start.  Let me start with why I am writing this.  When I placed my first order with them a few weeks ago - they were brand new on SR and had less than 100 feedbacks and transactions.  However, it was all positive, and they guaranteed delivery in 48 hours - no delivery costs, if you FE.  So I FE'd, I figured I would get a quarter and see what happens.  I ordered a quarter of Sour Diesel on Sunday night, so I was guaranteed delivery by Wednesday.

Wednesday came and it wasn't here.  I wrote them, received a prompt reply and a sincere apology and them also saying it **would** be here the very next day.  It was.  So, even though they were delayed  (and gave me very good reason) it was only delayed 24 hours, so I only waited 72 hours - not bad.  Now, what makes this awesome, is that today in the mail, I had another package from them.  They sent me another one, for free - just because they failed to live up to their original promise of a Wednesday delivery.

At this point, I am blown away.  I wont ever to business with another cannabis dealer(that's all I use, no other drugs) on SR - and hopefully they dont go anywhere.

Yes, this is a throw-away account, for good reason.  If you question my need to post this under a throwaway using TOR, then you are doomed as an SR user.  Also, **no** I am not Green Oven Door.  I go by iHeart420 on both SR and the Forums(although I haven't made my first post there yet, maybe after this) and I am very active as a regular user on /r/trees and /r/silkroad, with my normal user account.

Are my standards too high?,36,14,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1dqo25/disappointing_cocaine_from_a_reputable_vendor_are/,"First, it's worth mentioning that my only other experience of cocaine was a wrap bought on the street. It was extremely expensive and there wasn’t much of it, but it was extremely strong and the high was everything I’d hoped cocaine would be: clear-headed, minimal anxiety and a smooth comedown. 

A few months later I started shopping on the Silk Road and noticed various vendors selling “high quality” cocaine. I figured that since I’d bought my first wrap from a random guy, it was probably cut and coke from the Road would be appreciably better. 

The vendor in question (Lloydsbrothers) is one of the most highly rated, but when the packet came through I was in for a surprise. The product was far, far weaker than the “steet” coke I’d previously tried. There was almost no head high and it had a jittery aftertaste. The comedown, too, was dreadful, full of anxiety and depressed mood for hours afterward. 

So my question is this: if Lloydsbrothers product is cut, why do people rate it so highly. If it isn't, what on earth did I get on my first time from the street vendor? With my first wrap, the consistency was flaky like fishscale, so it’s possible I just happened upon some really, really good coke first time out. However, why would coke bought from the Road be so noticeably different? 

I’m not looking to unjustly give the vendor a bad name. I'm not even particularly angry. I'm just curious. For the first time the Road disappointed me and I’d like to know why.

**Wehkampf**

* no communication needed so far
* quick delivery from Belgium, usually takes 3 to 4 days to arrive

* ""Weekly Skunk"", ""Medication Weed"": both a bit more expensive, around 14€ and 20€ per g, but both worth it; if you want something stronger, go to Wehkampf",,False,,t5_2sidu,False,,,True,t3_1ati5n,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1ati5n/several_vendor_reviews_weed_in_germany/,

Here to report on Tess's new WoW. I'll try to keep this short and sweet. Man does Tessellated need some applause. I just came out of a beautiful journey, all thanks to him/her/them.

I've been interested in SR for a few months now. I lurked and did plenty of research, poured over the Avengers forum, and watched Tess really gain some ground along the way. I bought some bitcoins, and I waited to spend on the perfect first purchase - and I'm happy I did because they nearly doubled in value and I got to buy twice what I originally hoped to! Toward the end when it came time to finally buy, it was between Tess and LD, and I'm incredibly happy with what I chose.

It shipped incredibly fast. I ordered on a Friday night, Tess marked in In Transit on Monday, and it was in my hands (Midwest US) the following Monday (10 days from the click of my mouse). Stealth was incredible.

I set aside a Friday afternoon for the trip. Prepped everything in advance, had a lengthy list of things to keep me preoccupied and happy. This was the first time my life partner would be experiencing/sitting for me in a full trip, but we had discussed in length what was going to be happening. After heroically overcoming anxiety, they were an incredibly wonderful sitter to have. They are another half to me I have come to appreciate beyond this existence, and sharing this experience with them was powerful.

But now to the good stuff! I took ONE TAB. Just one little tab! And shit got bonkers fast.

I started my trip at about 3:15PM by watching Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World and coloring with crayons on my bed. That movie is a trip in and of itself, so while tripping it was an incredibly fun experience. About an hour in was when I started getting some visuals and that good ole' steely jaw feeling.

The first visuals came exactly an hour in at 4:15PM. There were drastic color changes in the blanket I was sitting on, and the stained wood patterns on the bedroom dresser began to morph wildly. I became very euphoric and laughed at pretty much every small joke in the movie. Coloring and watching the movie became increasingly difficult to do simultaneously, so I opted to finish the movie.

My partner came into the room and asked if I was ready for dinner. I was nearing the end of the movie (the last hour had flown by, it was roughly 5:15PM now), so I thought that sounded like a logical conclusion. Your body becomes a little difficult to read while on acid, but I was pretty certain the sensation in my gut area was in fact hunger. I ate two clementines during the movie, and while they were an incredible experience to eat, they hadn't filled me up.

My partner began to make us veggie tacos in the kitchen. While the movie was wrapping up, I became very aware that my senses were very heightened as I was nearing the peak of the trip. I could hear every noise perfectly from the kitchen - the clattering of pots and the cutting of knives on the chopping board. The noises were so clear I could precisely pin-point the location of my partner in the kitchen, as if the wall between us wasn't there.

The movie finished, and I walked out to the kitchen. I was able to coherently converse with my partner, but attempting to follow along with the recipe was beyond me. In retrospect, I was like a child with ADHD. My partner asked me to grab a few ingredients, of which I found one or two and then moved on to another task, I believe washing dishes. I ambled around the kitchen as my partner flew around me: chopping, stirring, and pouring in a fast flurry - or so it felt. I succumbed to simply stirring the sautéing vegetables. Man, did being over that pan smell fucking great. I stupidly stirred the vegetable as the pan underneath shrunk and grew and shrunk and grew. My partner put on the soundtrack for the video game FEZ, and it sounded glorious.

Eventually we were situated at the dinner table; the plateau of my trip was in full swing by this point. Eating the tacos was an experience out of this world. Every sense was stimulated as I chewed away. It was incredibly spicy, but that seemed like a foreign sensation to me; I merely was aware of a feeling in my mouth, which was a room of its own. Our cat sat on top of a shelf near by watching over us as we ate. In my mind, he was the wise old king of our apartment, overseeing his the people of his land.

Within an instant the dishes were done, and I was absolute terrible help with it all. But I tried, haha. I moved to the living and played with our cat for probably a half hour, simply listening to my headphones and staring out the window at the trees and planes flying overhead.

I could tell that I was starting to come down around 7PM, and began to contemplate many things. Those of you who have tripped know this stage well; at first during the plateau you just hang on for the ride, but starting with the comedown is when your brain really starts to mull over every single thought in existence at once. It's the time during the trip where you feel like a dried up piece of driftwood, bleaching in the sun after begin tossed at sea for eternity. You simply bask in the duality of all things, completely saturated and entirely wrung out all at once.

My partner wrapped up some work and I ended my music session. They started to play Mass Effect, and I simply laid on the couch and watched, continuing to contemplate things, most notably space given the game they were playing.

After an hour or so my partner offered to have sex, which I of course obliged, and proceeded to have an incredibly intimate bonding experience with them. Afterward, we spoke in depth about how our existence as humans on this earth were incredibly fulfilling with one another, and looked forward to millennia in the future when perhaps our energy will join together in another star or planet unknown to us now.

The night waned, and I began to feel at peace. The electricity in my jaw, teeth, and muscles remained, but I was easily able to fall asleep around 12AM. 

It was a wonderful night all in all, and I look forward to the other hits I have! Sometime in the near future, I'd love to try 3, and really lay out on the beach of the universe. Thank you very much Tessellated for your work, time, and effort placed into this venture.

I ordered 7g of his Northern Lights and 2x quantity of 4g of Chemdawg (lower unit price.)

I ordered on the Sunday night of Presidents Day Weekend, so USPS was closed on Monday. I received the product in a regular USPS box on Wednesday. 

He had each baggie labelled:

* 1/2 - 7g NL
* 2/2 - 4g CD

Uh oh! Looks like I'm missing 4g. Seems like a simple enough mistake. I'm sure a lot of people would've just ordered the 7g of Chemdawg, and he just missed the extra quantity.

I messaged TheBudFather about the issue, and he got back to me within a couple of hours. He was extremely courteous and apologized for the mistake. He offered me either a full refund, or I could resend him my address (**as he does not save addresses**) and he will send me the missing products, plus some extra.

Lo and behold, my second package arrived within a couple days of resending my address, and wow, all I'll say is that he really hooked me up! :) 

In terms of product quality, both the Northern Lights and the Chemdawg gave me quite possibly the best, most relaxing and euphoric highs I've experienced.

This was an issue for me because I was getting paid at midnight friday, and didn't know if I would be able to get my coins sorted by then.   I had to call upon SugarMama to do me a solid.  It's not something she really likes doing, but she knew I was gonna be putting in a big order later in the day, so she ended up sliding me $100 worth within an hour.  

Anyway, I didn't really expect her to actually come through, but she did.  So I attempted to get to SS's listing but SR or TOR was being a salad made of dicks, so i relaunched it.  Ended up getting the order in at 9:45am.  I knew it was close, so I was skeptical on if it would have made it in time for overnight delivery.  Well, I waited at my delivery spot all morning.  The post lady was killing me by doing every street near me first, but she came through and had a nice little package for me!  I had my order within 26 hours of putting in the order.  That is insane!  

So anyway, I'm blabbing a bit from the blow, but wanted to let everyone know that if you want something fast, SS is your guy.  i don't mess with H anymore because of problems (currently on subx) but the blow is awesome!  Although, I have to admit, it's been a while since I've had any.

Who's to say he's not saving your address as well?  Are you simply going to take his word for it despite how immature and irrational he's shown he can be?


To prove my point, take a look at these screenshots.  Twice he made the accusation that CloudSurfer is blackmailing him in some way or has contacted him privately **YET** he makes no effort to provide proof.  

http://imgur.com/a/KjveL



If he's so innocent, why is he so hesitant to provide proof?  If he has no proof of it, why is he making it up?  If he's so innocent what is the need to bring up false accusations against CloudSurfer.  I'm not saying he's guilty of anything, just that an innocent person does not act like this.

*Product*: [Organic Spanish Skunk \(Grown outdoors\)](http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/a3db4c52b9) and Morrocan Blonde Hashish.

*Shipping time*: 4/5. First order took exactly one week after being marked as in transit. The second order took 20 days, but this was over the period where SR was attacked, and JoR kept updating his situation on the forums.

*Stealth*: 6/5. Out of this world stealth. Best stealth I have seen so far. Both orders had very different stealth. Both looked like professionel business letters with decoy letter. No vacuum packs, but packed in sealed aluminium. No smell, no visible content and you couldn't feel the product from outside the letter.

*Quality*: 3/5. - Hash is a little dryer than I had hoped for, and the weed had seeds and didn't smell that powerful. Both smoked nice though, and did the job very well, even though it wasn't very potent.

*Picture*: https://i.imgur.com/QdaeWDi.jpg (No picture of hash, sorry.)

*Comments*: JoR resigned as vendor, sadly, but I wanted to put his review anyways. I also had to ask him what strain the weed was, because the product page didn't say. (Silver Haze) The hash was exact weight, weed was 5% overweight (measured with seeds).

*Product*: [Super Skunk](http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2a5edea98b)

*Shipping time*: 5/5. Was sent friday, I had it monday. 

*Stealth*: 1/5. No return adress, and only one layer of food grade vacuum sealing. When I opened the package, I could smell the weed. No decoy letter, no visual blocker, and you could actually feel the product from outside the letter.

*Quality*: 5/5. Best weed I've had. It really is very dry, and the high is amazing. Weed is quite potent.

*Picture*: https://i.imgur.com/Qbju9pR.jpg

*Comments*: I would love to order more, but since the stealth was so disappointing, I won't. Vendor also required FE, which I will never do again, no matter how cheap the weed is.

I asked him if this was a mistake, and he said nope! Just a little bonus for the longer ship time. So I take a few give a few, and the tabs were weak! felt around 70ug ish. I contacted him about this not even asking for a reship, (IK IM A DICK) and he said no man il have another 20 sent first thing tomorrow, Sorry about that. No questions asked. I first felt sorry for the man, but hell, I don't get customer service like that at Wal-Mart! Anyway, the new batch was DEFINATELY at LEAST 150ug. Two hits and i was gone. Clean as fuck too.

Anyways, I received a sample of MDUK's acetone washed MDMA a few weeks ago and boy oh boy am I grateful I did. I've rolled a fair amount of times, sometimes on decent product and sometimes on product that should have it's dealers jumped for. It wasn't until I came to Silk Road that I finally learned what true MDMA was, and I made sure to do my due diligence and research vendors that I knew would deliver ""the goods"". My first order was a gram from the vendor KarmaPharm, which was fantastic product; but that's not why I'm here. I'm here to spread the news of the Godsend MDUK.

The shipping took roughly a week or a week and a half; I don't remember the exact dates but I do remember opening my mailbox and finding the package only to question what in the hell it could be because I didn't think there was any way on Earth the product could have arrived to the US so fast. But lo and behold there it was, safely nestled in it's packing. The packaging itself was the best I have seen thus far; and while I haven't had an exorbitant number of transactions, I can say that there is nothing any buyer should be worried about (after all it did make it through customs, right ;) ). I found myself smiling from ear to ear as I unwrapped it and looked for my treasure buried within; I even took a picture to commemorate the moment.

The product itself left me speechless... literally. Never have I ever rolled so hard in my life. Only a small dose was needed of the beautiful white powder, to get me lifted off the face of Earth. A sensation of pure joy and ecstasy pulsated through my body as the magical drug did it's job. I was at a concert so the effects were multiplied by a million. I could feel the music, I was one with it. I was happy that the bodies around me were pushing and shoving because with each nudge and touch, a new tingle was introduced and an appreciation for the chaos overcame me. I closed my eyes and let the euphoria take me away as I danced into the night with strangers surrounding me. I loved them, and they loved me, and it was magical. And I owe this amazing experience to MDUK.

This guy is the real deal; he's hands down one of the friendliest vendors I have ever had the pleasure of doing business with and his presence on Reddit made things even better and made me much more comfortable and trusting. He's extremely knowledgeable on his product and the on the business he does. I hope he plans on sticking around for awhile as I will be a returning customer. International, domestic, hell, I don't care if you're from another planet, MDUK is the way to go for quality service and product. It will make it to you, and you will shit yourself with joy.

I did receive my order from greendaddy888 after it being in transit for almost a week. I believe that this package was marked in transit before he actually posted it.    

Quality: 1/5 Looks correct, slight imperfections can be observed, but as far as actual oxycodone there is little to none. My ROA was insuffilation and oral, one each method, and did feel slightly different, but different is the most generous description I can give. I also provided samples for two friends who's ROA was IV, and they both reported feeling a very weak something, while they both said that they were able to feel something it was not anything they would pay any amount of money for. They didn't have any interest in purchasing them for $5    

Quantity: 5/5 The vendor included the correct quantity of the product ordered, and did include 2 subs, and 2 endos which were not ordered, but both items were bunk as well. I was expecting one more ""brand"" of the 30s, while I realize that these are bootlegged the vendor stated that they had 3 different types, and only 2 were included 7 of the K 9, and 3 of the V- 48 12, non of the a-215's.    

Stealth: 1/5 Down right unsafe! With out providing any details that would make the situation an more unsafe, the packaging was not disguised at all. Any even minor inspection of the package would have reveled its contents, and further more the vendor sent the package with a private courier that could open any package with out a search warrant.    

Speed: 4/5 Paid for priority, received my package 6 days after my order.
I have not released the funds yet, as I would like to discuss this with the vendors, and possibly Silkroad staff before I do. I will be seeking at least a partial refund, as the package did arrive, but the product was not as described.
    

TL;DR: Do not order, unless your intention is to rip someone else off.

What would you do if you were me? Would you simply finalize and chalk it up to experience, or try to negotiate a  partial refund? If I ended up taking it to resolution, any ideas on how SR admins would feel about this?

OK just wrote a report on my transaction with this vendor.  I've been wanting to write about my experience for a while.  I took 1 Gandalf last night (reported by vendor at 150mcg, untested).  

I have been seeking a certain altered state for a long time now.  I'd been filling this craving with weed and alcohol, the only substances that were accessible due to the short-sighted U.S. drug policy.  I always found these substances dulling and even poisonous (alcohol, not weed).  

Since finding SR I had some trouble finding a good domestic LSD vendor, so I started with other psychedelics (MDA &amp; 2CB).  These were ok but I was left unsure if it was what I was looking for.  I didn't take high doses since I wanted to be safe, but I was left wondering if I needed to take more, or if maybe I was looking for something that psychedelics weren't going to give me.  

Finally took the plunge and ordered a 25 strip from JC.  I wanted to take one the day I got them I was so excited, but I knew I wasn't in the right mood.  The following day again I was unsure if I was up to it.  I was a little nervous, I was doing this alone and didnt want a bad trip.  But at around 5 pm I said fuck it and placed one tab under my tongue.  I then let the little molecules make their way into my circulation while I cleaned my apartment and ran some errands around town.  

At about 5:45 I was at home depot when I knew I felt different.  Not quite tripping, but colors were vibrant, ambient noises were crisp and my mind was able to observe these things around me.  I felt good.

Finally got home.  Then started tripping.  Looked at the clock, it was 6.  So it took about an hour to really get going.  I was on no other substances for a good while because I really wanted to see where one of these would take me.  I would sometimes worry that i hadnt taken enough and would consider smoking a bowl, but would reconsider as I didnt want to pollute the experience.  There was a lot of this through the night, thinking about doing something, then changing my mind, then just being wrapped up in thought for a minute.

When I really started coming up at about 6:30, there were intermittant moments of fear and anxiety.  I have anxiety issues already and had had a few bad experiences on LSD as a youth and was afraid of something similar happening.  Sometimes a depressing song would come on and I would get intensely sad for a minute.  But the funny thing, it was remarkably easy for me to get over it.  I just made the decision not to spend my trip being unhappy, and boom, I was happy.  I put on some Adventure Time and let me say that show is so great on acid.  Laughed for a long time.

At around this time I took my dogs on a walk around the hood.  The day was a little gloomy with rain but the walk was still fun.  Wasn't anxious or weird, stopped and chatted with strangers.  Felt completely in control.

I think the first peak was about 2 hours in.  I had gotten home and was sitting watching Adventure Time and I knew I was full on tripping.  There were some key things I recalled from LSD as a youth, usually the bad side effects like muscle tension, mucus production, dirty feeling, weird taste/smell.  I kept looking for these as I almost thought these should be indicative of good acid.  But now I realize that those are indicative of lesser quality acid.  I had none or very little of these symptoms, but the quality of my visuals and mood were stellar, better than the stuff I had had before.  This was definitely some quality clean stuff.

It got very intense at some points.  Especially when I decided to try doing some yoga.  I put on a yoga video I do often.  I noticed that the video looked all blurry like the colors were bleeding together.  It literally looked like something was wrong with the screen.  I highly recommend yoga or some type of physical activity with this.  I think it got my blood going, and at times I would have to stop a pose and lay down with my eyes closed, and thats when the visuals would just explode in my head.  

Let me talk about the visuals.  I always hear people rave about it, but I never really saw shit.  But man I definitely saw stuff last night.  There were times during yoga that I was laying down eyes closed and I was just watching strange figures take shape.  The overarching visual pattern were kaleidoscopic and floral spinning patterns made mostly of a vibrant red and blue.  But durnig the peaks I would begin to see faces, objects, I cant really recall in vivid detail.  Not that they looked like they were really there, it was more like I was watching my imagination summon up these things, but it was incredibly interesting to just sit and watch.  

These figures would then morph into rippling patterns that would spin together, then stop, then ""lock"" into place and shift like some strange mechanism, then spin again.  It was awesome.

Staring at adventure time on my big screen was mind numbing.  At moments I realized I was just staring wide eyed and slack jawed with a big grin at the colors on the screen.

Spent some time writing in a journal.  Started heading down very interesting avenues of thought that then folded back upon themselves, honestly felt like I was going somewhere interesting, will have to revisit these ideas again.  At many times I felt like my brain was operating on multiple ""levels"" at once, like there was the base thought process, then a metaphysical thought process, and a self-conscious one, etc, all kind of flowing together.  I kept telling myself to write more so I would remember, I felt an urgency to remember these things I was thinking.  

Man, it was just great.  I don't want to make this any longer.  I never read long trip reports.  I took it early in the afternoon thinking it would last about 8 hours and I would get to sleep by 2, but I was still wide awake at 6.  I did start smoking pot at some point and it really would kick things in again.  The peaks were probably from 2 hours in to about 7 hours in, then I knew I was coming down, but it was a very gradual come down and would kick in again.  No bad feelings on the come down, I realized it felt quite pleasant to be coming back to earth but still had incredible visuals.  

Finally got to sleep at about 7 and woke up at 11.  I feel great.  Went for a 3 mile run and the day is beautiful.  I feel incredible and happy.  This is what I had been seeking for so long.  Even in the past my memories of acid were that it was fun but had moments of discomfort both physical and mental, and the end moments always felt dirty and unhealthy.  None of that whatsoever here. 

When I was tripping I thought I can't wait to get to do this again.  When I woke up today I felt a little tired mentally and knew I would need a break.  But now after my run I'm honestly ready to go again lol.  I won't of course, but I'm just thrilled at how well my body is tolerating this stuff.  I want to stock up to ensure I have enough of this important chemical to last my whole life.

1362578839.0,22,self.SilkRoad,19rwws,Controlled deliveries: Dumb luck or sophisticated sting operation? ,26,4,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/19rwws/controlled_deliveries_dumb_luck_or_sophisticated/,"What with the 2 big busts last week and a couple medium sized orders coming **my** way this week I've been thinking a lot about controlled deliveries. I've come to the conclusion that for the most part, controlled deliveries are just local law enforcement getting one handed to them. 

So let's think about this: The local customs office or post office (depending on where it was ordered from) detects something odd about the package. They alert local LE who come out, inspect the package, and if it's suspicious enough get a warrant to open it. The package contains a kilo of meth (let's say). So they've now got the name AND address of someone who probably ordered a key of meth. So they do a controlled delivery assuming that the person will accept the package. If the package is accepted and goes into the house they've got probable cause to search the house knowing the residents DO have meth inside. Once inside they're likely to find lots of other incriminating items as well. 

In this situation they don't have much invested in the whole operation. So what happens if the residents refuse delivery? They had a warrant to open the package, but will a judge issue a warrant to search their house based on the package? And if they already had a warrant to search the house, why even deal with the controlled delivery business?  They're within their rights to just execute the search. 

Am I missing something here? Am I wrong with any of my assumptions? Discuss amongst yourselves.

[oPenGP](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/opengp/id414003727?mt=8) - $3.99

-iPGmail has been suggested as a good alternative

[Onion Browser](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448?mt=8) - $0.99

[Blockchain Wallet](https://blockchain.info/wallet/iphone-app) - Free

The browser is not spectacular, but it gets the job done if I need it for some reason. The PGP app and the blockchain wallet are fantastic. Great features and very secure. I'm actually making this post because I was trying to encrypt a message today and my mac wasn't having it. All my other keys work fine, but for some reason this one wouldn't, so I looked into mobile solutions.

With all of these apps, I believe it is possible to complete SR orders on your phone/ipod. I've never done it because I prefer my laptop for obvious reasons, but the technology is there- you've got PGP, a TOR browser, and access to your bitcoins. Throw in a few banking/money apps and you could even buy BTC on your phone. Theoretically, you could buy a ""burn phone"" and use it for this if you are paranoid about your laptop. 

Even if you don't want to use all of these for Silkroad, I still recommend the PGP app for anyone out there who has problems with PGP on their laptop. It's very user friendly and has tons of options.

Note: I also use a VPN - which is supported by iOS, so that is covered as well.

1372649893.0,20,self.SilkRoad,1hel5e,Best Oxy and Benzo Vendors on the Road to US (with reviews),26,6,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1hel5e/best_oxy_and_benzo_vendors_on_the_road_to_us_with/,"Hey all--
I've been buying for a while and though this may help some noobs looking for OXy.  I only buy domestic with one exception. Here's my favorites (and not so favorites).



Oxy



Drxtc - Only Canadian vendor I buy from. The shipping and processing can take just a sec because it's going through customs, so plan ahead.  His prices are some of the best and his stealth is my absolute favorite, after dealing with tons of vendors.  It always arrives and is always on point, usually with bonuses. He is my go-to man unless I'm in a time crunch or he's out of my favorite stock. Don't be fooled by his blemished rating. I read it and it had to do with precursors. Personally, I don't even know wtf they are. For Oxy, he's on point. Sometimes slow on communication because he's slammed... But there's really nothing I need to communicate about.



Supersun - Far and away, the BEST vendor on the road.  He is THE ONLY vendor I have ever dealt with that got a product to me the very next day. His prices are THE cheapest on the road for Oxy. Honestly, he saved me from some withdrawals.  My beef with him is he RARELY has Oxy in stock and it goes fast when he does... But when he has it, I am sure hitting him up. Slow on communication because he's a busy dude... But that really doesn't matter to me... He's lightening on delivery.



NorcoCo - Super reliable. Average prices, decent stealth. Dependable as clockwork. 3-4 days from placing order to in mailbox.  You can see that by his untarnished rating. He manages his stock very well, so you never get the dreaded order cancelled. His inventory rotates and he doesn't have Oxy too too often, but he can save you from being dope sick with some of his other selections. Far and away the best communication on the road... Timely, flawless grammar, funny, and kind.



Costco - expensive! But, if speed and reliability are needed, he will come through. When all of the above options are exhausted, I head to CostCo. 



Pill City - totally worth throwing him a nod, even though he only has Norco.  Fantastic prices, free shipping, super fast delivery, wonderful stealth. He's out of stock at the moment.



And here are two vendors I had nasty experiences with...



Blumangroup - never arrived, never provided DCN. Eventually, I just finalized as I didn't want to hurt my stats and it was a small order.



Fastforward - never arrived. Provided DCN showing delivered... But never received. I have a locked mailbox so theft is non-issue. I released funds and left positive review since he provided confirmed DCN. However, it took more than a week to ship and more than two weeks to get him to communicate with me.  Not cool. He's in stealth mode now.



Benzos



Natasha - fast shipping, great prices, fantastic packaging. Shipping is very well priced!!! She's my go-to gal.



NorcoCo - Same deal as above. He's the man.



TheRealRickGrimes - what an awesome product (sour patch kids). I just ordered so I don't know anything more yet... But I am just fascinated by the product. Great prices too and amazing reviews, so I'm not worried.



Hope this helps!!!

Time for this week's giveaway. The person who posts the best picture of their smokespot(must include some sort of smoking related piece(a joint, bong, pipe, nug etc) so I know it's just not some picture of a cool place.) If it has something in it that shows it is specifically for the competition that will give you bonus points from me.



Last week was best smoke story and the winner was /u/Dat_FUPA. Since /u/racistconspiracy had a story people really seemed to like he will receive a free gram on top of any order if he ever wishes to place one. 


One last thing. Due to some problems my service was rather poor on my last round of orders. I apologize for this and will try my hardest to make sure that doesn't happen again. Since I still can't get around to well I'm only going to be selling Oz and 1/2 oz listings. This will cut down on overall number of listings/items shipped and make things a wee bit easier for me so that I can continue to offer top-notch service. This should only be for a couple weeks. 



Thanks guys,

Thurgood

1370189906.0,21,self.SilkRoad,1fivtl,Vendor Review: Thurgood Jenkins,31,10,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1fivtl/vendor_review_thurgood_jenkins/,"Please read this in its entirety to get a full grasp.

Product: Custom listing for 2 OZ of G13

I was looking for a vendor that had a 2oz listing up on this subreddit, TJ messaged me and said he could do a custom listing for me. After hearing so many good reviews from our redditor turn SR vendor, I decided that it was time to try out some of this Colorado bud. TJ set up the custom listing within a day and I placed the order not too long after it was available. The original order was for Purple Kush but after a couple of days of it still processing, I sent TJ a message asking for an update on my order. He responded in reasonable time to tell me that he had run out of stock on the Purple Kush and that he wouldnt be getting any in for a couple days. He apologies profusely and offered me compensation for the wait, which I was very surprised at but gratefully accepted it. TJ told me he could send my order out on Friday or Saturday of the week and I told him to wait til Tuesday as I was not trying to let that package sit somewhere over the holiday weekend when there was no post. He agreed and sent it out once the post was open again. Shipping took a mere two days and was surprised when the mailman got out of his truck to hand me my package while I was washing my car. At first I was confused by the packaging, it was not the normal packaging you would get for a 2oz listing so I wasnt sure what it was. After going inside I inspected the package for damage or smell, there was none. However there was a slight problem with the packaging that gave me the ""willies"" but after looking at it for a second as if I were LE, I realized there was no way it could have gave anything away. After opening the package, the stealth was top notch and no smell was emanating until the last bag was cut open.  

Lets move on to the bud, TJ sent me G13 and a little of Cherry Diesel. Now I promised that I would give my unbiased opinion since this was my first order with TJ so lets begin. Ill start with the G18; I opened the bag and poured one OZ out on a table to inspect the bud as a whole. At first glance you notice that some of the buds are very big, nearing 2.5gs. With these big nugs comes some hefty stems though as if it wasnt trimmed completely, although you could tell that this plant was VERY healthy while it grew. After trimming only the excess stems off the buds, I was left with ~1.4 grams of stems. I didnt mind because TJ did compensate me for the lateness of the package, which was more than 1.4 grams so all is good, but if I could recommend that perhaps trimming some of the excess stems off in the future, it would be awesome. Then again it could just be the strain as I have only had G-13 once before and it was already ground up in my buddies grinder. Other than the stems the bud looks unbelievable, some purple from where you can tell the bud was grown in a lower temperature of the Colorado environment and it was covered in crystals. It immediately stunk up my entire house to where I had to open the window in the room I was in just to get some fresh air in! After loading a pack into my trusty ""waterpipe"", I sparked it up. After finishing I sat and waited for the high to creep up on me and I was surprised on how closely it resembled the effects listed on Leafly for this strain. Top-notch bud for sure. Moving on to the Cherry Diesel; I had never heard of this strain before and Leafly didnt help when researching it. The bud, yes it was literally just once huge bud, was packed with crystals again and was very green when ground up. The high was pretty normal but intense enough to allow me to only pack one bowl of the ""waterpipe"". As I have never had it, I can not compare it to anything but it as superb. 

Overall: I was very pleased at the price, shipping speed, bud quality, and responsiveness of TJ. He is going to make a name for himself on SR and here is to him being able to handle it. He reminds me of the early NorthWestDirect before he got big and had trouble completing orders that were pouring in. Perhaps he could limit his vendor page so he does not get swamp but thats just me being selfish hahah. Heres to you TJ, you have gained my seal of approval with your awesome customer service and excellent quality bud. I will be back for sure in the near future. Hope your ankle heals up soon buddy.

Well now that the Road has been running great, I have barely touched the other account. I set my quantities to ""O"" and left the account alone. 

YET I STILL GET ORDERS. When I check my listing again, somehow the quantity has magically changed. I write the Admins and get no response, which is unusual there.

I change the quantity back to ""O"" and put the listing in Vacation Mode. Time passes and I check again, and MORE ORDERS.

I take care of the surplus orders and set the quantity back to ""O"" and set the listing, as well as my vendor account, to Vacation Mode.

Well, I just got a message from a customer on SR who said he had BTC left over at Atlantis and just placed a substantial order. Low and behold, the quantity has been changed AGAIN.

As Canada’s postal service, Canada Post holds a special position of trust and accountability for the mail it delivers on behalf of Canadian businesses, governments and residents.

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that mail deposited with Canada Post is not tampered with in any way while it is with the Corporation.

This policy applies to all Canada Post employees and agents, especially those who accept, process, transport, deliver mail, or enter into business arrangements to do so. Employees involved in contract tendering and business arrangements with contractors that accept, process, transport, deliver mail or could have access to the mail (such as a custodian or tradesperson) must ensure that the contracts have necessary provisions and clauses for protection of the mail while it is in the care of the contractor as detailed in the 'Planning for Security in Contracting' practice. It covers all hardcopy and electronic mail, whether this mail contains messages, information, funds or goods. This policy governs all conduct and practices associated with the handling of mail from the time it is deposited with the Corporation until it is delivered.

**Canada Post is committed to taking all measures necessary to protect mail. Employees must ensure that no one—including themselves and law enforcement authorities—tampers with (i.e., opens, keeps, steals or detains) mail from the time it is deposited with the Corporation until it is delivered.**

Employees who observe anyone tampering with the mail should promptly notify their immediate supervisor or Security &amp; Investigation Services. Employees can raise concerns and make reports without fear of reprisal.

Employees should always follow standard security measures for the protection of mail in their individual care. Employees involved in business arrangements with contractors that accept, process, transport or deliver mail must ensure that the contracts have necessary provisions for protection of the mail while it is in the care of the contractor. Contact Security &amp; Investigation Services for more information.

Violation of this policy could result in removal from the workplace, suspension, termination of employment and prosecution under the law. Employees with any questions or concerns are encouraged to discuss them with their supervisor or Security &amp; Investigation Services.

3.1 Investigations

Where sufficient evidence and information is available, suspected violations of this policy will be reviewed by Security and Investigation Services (S &amp; IS).

The Operations group or Customer Service will report all cases of violations of this policy to the National Control Center (NCC). The NCC will work with Operations to resolve these breaches and keep S&amp;IS advised of their progress. When the suspected breach is not resolved and requires follow-up, the NCC will advise S&amp;IS upon closure of their file and S&amp;IS will document and investigate/review the breach.

Team leaders who learn of suspected violations of this policy—from employees or by any other means—must immediately notify Security &amp; Investigation Services.

Employees suspected of being in breach of this policy will have the opportunity to explain the circumstances leading to the alleged violation, in line with standard security and investigative practices. Law enforcement agencies may be brought in / consulted when appropriate.

Team leaders and Security and Investigation Services will not disclose the identity of anyone who:

    reports a violation of this policy,
    participates in the investigation of a violation, or
    is being investigated for having violated the policy,

unless such disclosure is essential to resolving the incident or is required by law. Any Canada Post employee to whom this information is disclosed as part of an investigation or in any other manner will also be reminded of this requirement.

3.3 Roles and Responsibilities

Security &amp; Investigation Services (formerly known as Corporate Security)

Under the guidance of the Chief Postal Inspector / General Manager of Security and Investigation Services, S&amp;IS reviews breaches or potential breaches of policy, determines if sufficient evidence exists and when it does, conducts an investigation. Following the successful closure of the investigation, S&amp;IS shares the outcome of the investigation with senior management. When a criminal investigation occurs, S&amp;IS works in partnership with the local law enforcement agency to bring the matter to conclusion and will lay charges when evidence and circumstances support it. S&amp;IS also provides guidance and clarification on the policy.

Sourcing Management

Ensure that security requirements are included in every contract and request for proposal.

Human Resources

Ensure that all new employees read, understand and sign the ""Protection of Mail and Corporate Assets Employee Declaration form"" prior to the start date of hire or rehire. A copy of the signed form is maintained in the employees benefit file.

Process Owner (budget holder)

Ensure that the requirements of the Planning for Security in Contracting Practice are being met by contractors and sub-contractors and that security clearances are met and maintained.

Employees and Contractors

Employees and contractors must always follow standard security measures for the protection of the mail in their care as outlined in this policy and outlined in CMS 1605.05. They must advise Security and Investigation Services or their team leaders of any breach or suspected breach in policy.

Today was my first day on SR, and I must say it was magnificent...if a little baffling.  Are prices there roughly indicative of street value?  (I don't use a lot of street drugs so I have no clue).

For instance, generic prescription pills--which cost pennies per dose when purchased at a pharmacy--are outrageously priced.  And so is meth, which is easy to make at home from household chemicals by any in-the-know redneck.  Meanwhile, THC-laced edibles like lollipops (which are available only to people with an mmj card normally) are $6.00 a pop.  MDMA is relatively hard to synthesize and many of its pre-cursors are tightly controlled, so why is it dirt cheap on SR?  So many questions.

Are the prescription pills coming from pharmacy robberies and marked up because of the risk involved?  Is the meth made in a pristine underground German superlab by Nazi descendants of the Third Reich?  Most items cost what I'd expect, but some are just way out of bounds.  I'm mainly referring to U.S. vendors since I have no clue what drugs cost in other countries.

##[SOURCE CODE](http://37otxza6ovc3nq3c.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page#Source_Downloads_.28.zip.29)

Since Freedom Hosting went down, which is one primary services (well, the provider of many primary services) I use for uploading images since Imgur.com no longer allows uploads over TOR, I decided to create my own. After fearing a DNS, IP, or MAC address leak I ditched my old server (which didn't have much hosted on it anyways, FH seemed like a secure platform). So, with new hardware* I'm slowly trying to provide services that are needed in the Silk Road and TOR community.

###ImagePro V1         
**http://37otxza6ovc3nq3c.onion/app/imagepro/**         
This version is very fast but is limited to 1 file per upload session, no change in filename, a maximum final size of 1024x800 (images are resized), and a maximum size of 10240mb         
         
           
###ImagePro V2         
**http://37otxza6ovc3nq3c.onion/app/imageprov2/**         
This version is slower, but can handle up to 10 sequential file uploads, does not require resizing, renames your file for privacy and duplicate filename issues, and does not output a thumbnail.            

If you reach a ""website cannot be found"" error, try going to this address first:
**http://37otxza6ovc3nq3c.onion:80**           
______         

It's very minimalistic and doesn't have many bells and whistles (nearly none) which allows it to maintain decent speed in uploading even behind TOR over VPN. It does not alter your image or add any metadata, but in turn it **DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY REMOVE METADATA**. The ImagePro page has a link to an EXIF Stripper I use so users can remove the EXIF data (if they have not already) before they upload.        
      

**Features &amp; Specs**:
_____

* One photo per upload       
* 10mb Image Size Limit
* .bmp, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, and .tif
* Regular and thumbnail images are produced
* Regular Image size is 1024x800 
* Thumbnail size is 256x192

~~I should note that files are uploaded to a public directory, meaning that users can explore all the photos that have been uploaded. For this reason, you should not include a filename that may be used to identify you.~~ This issue has been fixed. You must now use the direct link, and will not be able to explore the directory.                 
         
**Image Directories** - These are now private, only a direct link will work.

* http://37otxza6ovc3nq3c.onion/app/imagepro/normal/

http://37otxza6ovc3nq3c.onion/app/stripper/stripper.exe           


For now it is the first (and only) working application on my new server, which in light of the Freedom Hosting disaster I decided I should invest in new server hardware.       
              
          
Currently I don't seem to be able to get the application working with onion.to through the clearweb, but due to security concerns I always recommend users to use TOR and never use a clearnet tunnel. On top of that, I also recommend every TOR user invest in a VPN service. You can find plenty that accept bitcoin and are anonymous. You can then edit Vidalia to run the VPN every time you start TOR.        
                   
             
I'll be getting the forums up next, and then since I have no alternative I'll host my webstore here as well. The advantage is I'll be able to integrate BTC Merchant API's directly into the page with the new server, as the old ones had severe limitations. Of course, I'll always offer SR escrow, although I am looking into alternate Escrow services (over .onion) for sales outside of SR.

Full-melt hash and Grape Ape bud.,23,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1j5sih/vendor_review_pureorganx_fullmelt_hash_and_grape/,"I communicated with PO before my prchase saying i wanted to try 3 different Sativa fullmelt hash, and 7g of Skywalker OG Kush. I told him to pick the 3 best Sativas and he gladly made a custom listing for 1g each of  Super Lemon Haze, Strawberry Cough, and Jack Herrer, as well as the 7g of buds. He even took $15 off for the bundle.

Shipping took 3 days. The stealth was great. He uses multiple layers of re-useable  MBBs.  Only problem was, i opened the package and   only received the 3g of hash :( I contacted PO immediately about the issue and he prompty  appologized and said he would send out the bud immediately. Since they had run out of Skywalker, he substituted an equivilant Grape Ape which arrived quickly with a free gram of Girl Scout Cookie.

First off, the  hash is gorgeous. Melts and bubbles just as described. Beautiful product that gets your brain in the moon. The strawberry cough is my favorite. The hash is a little pricey, but the quality is worth it. Where im from, you simply dont get the chance to see fullmelt hash. Turns into oil upon heating and has a great cerebral high.

The grape ape is extrememly potent and has a great high to accompany  the bag appeal with purples and oranges blending in with the medium green  of the buds. Dense, frosty nugs with a strong, sweet  aroma, with a slight akunk from a distance. Taste is that of  a  thick  grapey wine, with a touch of apple and citrus on the exhale. Nice grape taste... very much like a grape swisher sweet.

The high  is a fantastic indica stone with very little sleepyness. It leans toward the euphoric sides of the indica, and it was very easy to laugh and talk with friends. The first hit went straight behind my eyes. As I toked, I could feel it drip from  my head, down  my spine,  and then through my whole body. Smooth transition from heady to body, with the high from one bowl lsting an experienced smoker 2 hours. Beautiful product.

I would work with this vendor again. Aside from the shipping omission, it was flawless. Great products. For the curious, the total came to $245 for my order.

Shipping - 5/5.  Took one day for him/her to ship it.  3 full days to arrive, west coast to mid-west.  Very quick.

Packaging - 5/5.  Package is rock solid.  Nothing suspicious when lifting/shaking it.  I will not go into detail about exact packaging, but I'm fairly certain he/she packages his buds differently than others.  No compression from vacuum sealing.  Very secure.  Even if the package were opened accidentally, it would not be evident that anything fishy was going on.

Product - 5/5.  GREAT weed.  Smells like a fruity wonderland.  I got the Bubba Kush.  My shitty phone camera would not do the nugs justice.  They are properly trimmed and very fresh, but not too moist.  No shake to speak of and trichomes EVERYWHERE.  Weighed out to just a lil over 14 grams.  Medicinal quality, no doubts.

Vendor - 5/5.  Very responsive and helpful.  Overall great experience.

Price - 5/5.  This will vary by location but for where I live, I could NEVER, EVER get buds this good at this price.  It is unheard of.  Obviously there are places like Canada and California where 140/half is not a good deal, but I'm fairly certain that 95% of the United States would drool at $35/8ths of medicinal.

If anyone has any questions, I'd be happy to answer as many as I can.

I found FG through someone searching for discount ounces of marijuana. I was completely stunned that a vendor would provide a $165 ounce of bud that *wasn't* reggie or mids. So I saved up a bit of cash, pumped it into Coinbase, and sent the coins over to SR. I checked the vendor page, only to find that the listing for his Small Bud Mix wasn't up. I messaged him asking when it would be back up. He responded maybe 20 minutes later saying that it would be soon, but in the meantime, he had thrown together a custom listing, just for me! I was impressed to say the least, especially since I would have been just fine waiting for the SBM to come back up. So I placed the order, it was marked in transit several days later (not right after, like some vendors do to keep you from canceling the order. I believe that the package actually went into transit when he said it did).

Here's the first mistake on my part: I went on vacation. This meant I had to place my mail on hold (all my neighbors weren't able to watch the mail). I was gone for a little under a week. I came back, terrified that there would be a clip board waiting for my signature when I got back. Furthermore, I had half a gram of coke waiting in the mail as well. My fears were displaced a day later when I got the packages. No weird marks. Looked exactly like my other mail. I opened up FG's package, and was thoroughly happy.

The packaging was very nice. The box was taped up securely, and I doubt that there would have been any chance that the box would come apart during shipping. Inside, the ounce was packaged very meticulously with plenty of padding from packing peanuts. I'm confident that the package could have been stepped on, rained on, or beat to death, and my product would have been fine.

The stealth was pretty standard. A postal employee who had any suspicion probably could have discovered my product, however the sealing on the product was solid, and I don't think any drug dog could have figured out what was inside. It had already stood the test of time of nearly a week sitting in the ~~lions den~~ postal office without anyone discovering the secrets it held.

The product was excellent, especially for the price. This isn't AAA+ grade medicinal stuff, but it is much better than any mids or reggie. The bag was mixed with different strains. It smelled awesome, was cured perfectly, and only had a very small amount of shake and stems in the bottom of the bag. And let me tell you, FG made up for those stems with flying colors. What was maybe a gram of stems total, was made up for by a good 5 grams or so of extra bud. The bag was *very* fat to say the least.


**tl;dr**

**Communication**: 5/5 responded very quickly to all questions

**Packaging**: 5/5 very sturdy and wholesome

**Stealth**: 5/5 no chance of any doggies finding my goods

**Product**: 7/5 very fat bag, good weed, great price



I will definitely be buying again!

Not much has been purchased, but I hope it'll help. (I'm in Eastern Europe) 



Mahakala - 150ug candy LSD  / 1gr Changa / 500mg 2CB

Best vendor for me so far. Excellent communication. I'm not even telling you the stealth, it'll make you laugh. His LSD was my first LSD experience which blew my mind. From what I read on internet, that might have been more than 150ug. Later I messaged to him saying that it had felt more, he replied that it was around 180ug. 
12 hour trip, feelings and insights that I had never experienced before. Beautiful CEVs and stunning colors and ++OEVs. 

1 gr changa - accurate weight, lovely smell. %50 dmt
Tried it 5-6 times,  each time 0.1 gr. The most powerful experiences of my life. I mean, there aren't enough words to describe what I experienced. 

500mg 2CB Hbr - accurate weight, white fluffy powder. 

Tried 15-20mg (my scale is not that accurate)
The experience is somehow felt like the combination of MDMA, LSD, 25i. Kind a weird. On come up I was madly wanting to dance, move, do something. Then OEVs began. 3D images and slight morphing. I had a great time, really really clean roll. But again the dose was very small. 4-5 hours experience.    


_____________________________________________________________________________________________

Haizenberg - 100ug LSD / 1gr MDMA

I like his products, a specially his MDMA. He had (maybe have) some issues regarding communication. But his products are top notch.  

100ug LSD - double sided hoffmans

Well, it's the most used LSD right now I think. With one tab, felt great. No OEVs or CEVs though. But I'm not expecting OEVs from a dose like that. 

1gr MDMA - Small white crystals, no smell at all, very very bitter taste

I didn't purchase any other MDMA from SR, but I'm pretty sure he is one of the top vendors that sell the purest and strongest MDMA. At 150mg I felt like I was in heaven. (I'm 85 kg) One of the best experiences in my life. I did candyflip few times with his LSD. Just OMG :D 


_____________________________________________________________________________________________

Tyl3r - 1200ug 25i-nbome non-complexed

They're relocating right now, no listing. But don't bother with other nbome vendors. He's the best. I was dumb to try a whole tab on my first experience. Total mindfuck, meltdown. If you're gonna try nbome, do not go above 1000ug on your first time. 8 hour trip. On 8th hour, I was still seeing black smoke coming out of the bed in pitch black. I even tried to touch it lol.

1371337325.0,18,self.SilkRoad,1gf9yn,Clearance review and trip report (long),22,4,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1gf9yn/clearance_review_and_trip_report_long/,"I have been gathering my thoughts for a week since this night happened. It quite possibly was the greatest night of my life. I will talk about the product, then detail the story of my night.

In the planning of my birthday weekend I decided to make a purchase. I was not in the market to buy a large amount, so I looked for s reputable domestic vendor. After doing some research I settled on Clearance. I placed the order and it arrived about 3 days later. Communication was top notch. Packaging was good for domestic. Nothing extravagant but it obviously did it's job.

I ordered 2 grams of his mdma. It was mostly crystals with very little fine powder. It look, smelled, and tastes like quality stuff. The bag came in heavy at a bit over 2.5gs, and he threw in an orange triforce pressed pill for shits. Both nice surprises, and much appreciated.

Last weekend finally rolled around. The Saturday when the festivities were planned had an interesting start. My friend and I drove down to new Orleans. Mid trip I noticed my iPhone wouldn't charge. Great, of all days. But not a huge deal as not only did my friend have his, but so did my cousin and the others we were meeting. We get to the city and I am searching for a place to park close to my cousins hotel to meet them. A commercial van driver then suddenly decided my lane belonged to him. He tried to switch over, which caused me to swerve into a curb to avoid him. Driver side tire went out and he sped off. I was consumed with anger, and almost called the police. Obviously, I decided that wouldn't be the best decision of my life. So here I was. Stuck in the middle of a major street in new Orleans at the hottest part of the day with a flat tire. Happy birthday to me.

Luckily my cousin and his friends met us. One of them was a mechanic and had the spare on in no time. Needless to say his first few rounds were on me. Fast forward a few hours and we were at a pub crawl. For those who don't know, public intoxication in new Orleans not only is accepted, but encouraged. A big group of people follow a truck with speakers on it. You walk a mile, then stop at a pub and drink. Rinse and repeat for 6 miles. It was hot, sweaty, but we had a good time. Around 7 my friend and I headed to the hotel and prepared ourselves for the reason we came: Krewella.

Once in our hotel we smoked a good bit, took a shower, and relaxed. We were only 2 blocks from the venue and doors opened at 9, so we headed down around 8:45. We got in a rather long line. I had 4 150mg caps, and 2 100mg. 2 150mg were for my friend and I, as well as the 100mg should we want a booster. The other 2 were to sell. Behind us 3 girls and a guy get in line. Call the girls A,B, and P, and the guy shady motherfucker. We end up all talking while we are waiting. Guy asked if we had extra. So I sold him my 2 extra for 40. One was for him, and the other the girl A. Not only was this her first roll, but drug experience ever. I told her it's the best stuff in the building, and she will have the best night of her life. I was going to look out for her. I had Vicks, vapor inhaler, 4 nice spliffs, and ring pops. This isn't my first rodeo.

20 minutes later we walk are about to walk in the club. I turned around and she had a huge smile on her face. I said you took it already didn't you? Her eyes got big, she smiled, and nodded her head fast. ""Yeah, I feel great!"" Oh honey, just you wait. B and I started to hit it off some. I bought her a beer and myself a water and we head into the fastly growing crowd. This is when I dropped my first 150mg as well as my friend. We all started dancing in a group. B turned out to be an amazing dancer. We had fun for awhile. My friend was with p, and shady mfer was with A. I felt the comeup. It was fucking strong. I got good energy and was throwing down to some dubstep and trap. I felt great.

It was roughly 150 degrees in there. The floor was covered in a flash flood quality pool of sweat and other bodily fluids. I was a sweaty wreck. We all were, which made it that much more dirty in a good way. Throughout the night I was talking with A. Making sure she was okay and hydrated. Got her her first lightshow, and we ended up dancing a bit. She was a pretty chick and very cool. We had a connection. My phone was dead but I gave her my number regardless. About a hour and half in my friend needed some air so he left. So did b. 2 hours in I was at the point where I felt weak for being over heated. I had to get out for awhile, so I told A I would be back in a few. I got some water and headed outside. That would be the last time I saw her that night, which 
had me bummed.

To pick up the pace of this story I was outside for 20 minutes and felt glorious. Almost everyone outside was there for the same reason so everyone was talking and having fun. I rolled back in pun intended feeling refreshed and amazing. Time to hit that dance floor again. I met some more people, smoked them out, and had the time of my life. Krewella killed it. Production was amazing. Halfway through there set I met up with a large group of friends who go to all the shows. I raged with them for 45 minutes. These people are like fam, so we had a blast. 

Show ended around 2, and it was afterparty time. I went to the hotel to check on my friend. He has a weird stomach and the Molly upset it. He took a bar and passed out. I found 3 random people and split a cab to the afterparty where all my friends were. Our friend is a dj and producer and he was playing there. One of those 3 people had about half a g of Molly and let me dab twice. I was back in the game for a few more hours. Around 5am my standards were incredibly low. At this point if it had vagina and a pulse (which may have been optional) I was hitting on it. I walked out the venue alone. Light hit my eyes and j heard a rooster crowing across the street. That was my signal it was time to sleep. I crashed around 630. My wallet took 4 days to dry from the sweat. My shoes were squishing like I was walking a few miles in ankle deep water. Everything about me was sore and aching. Wouldn't of had it any other way.

I got home around 2, and got a go phone to last me a few days. Checked my texts and had a message from A. The most amazing girl I have ever met, whom I am about to date.

That was my birthday. Clearance gave me the best night of my life. YMMV, but his molly was the best I had. Was good for 5-6 hours, and the comedown was clean.

I think this is the time to recognize the greatest potential of SR, to do something more than circumvent the government for self-indulgent recreational drug purchases.

I'm talking about the American and other restrictive health care systems, and the patents that make them inaccessible to millions of average people.

If there is really any higher calling of the SR, this is it. To liberate the masses of uninsured people from the crippling prices of life-saving drugs in America and elsewhere.

I wish it could happen, and I do think it's possible. My mother suffers from migraines and often has to endure them because her patented medication cost more than 4$ a pill. That is not right.

The same way that vendors sell modafinil, they should be selling every kind of expensive monopolized prescription drug, for the good of humanity. Cancer, HIV, migraines, heart disease. Medications for all of these conditions can be deathly expensive. And if a patient still visits a doctor and simply fills their script on SR, they can be totally responsible.

So I call on the enterprising vendors on SR, hook up with Indian, Mexican, Thai contacts and bring cheap scripts to the masses. Do humanity a favor.

**NorCalKing** - Great vendor.  Quick communication, very fast shipping, very stealthy packaging, and excellent buds.  Only drawback is his prices are rather high compared to other vendors.

**MarleysMainMan** - The first vendor I used.  Didn't require FE (same as all vendors I've used) even for a first time buyer, nice communication.  Packaging was stealth.  Product was not quite as nice as NCK, but still quite nice, and his prices were decently low.

**HappySmoke420** - Not the best communication, not the best packaging, but nothing sub-standard, just average.  Product quality was good, I got the pineapple kush he had at the time, and to date it was the best smelling and tasting strain I've ever experienced.

**QualityKings** - Got a cheeba chew.  He threw in a free medicated taffy.  Shipping was quick, stealth was great, all in all a great vendor.  Once he puts his listings back up, I'm planning on ordering some more chews from him.

**NW Nugz** - My current favorite vendor on the road.  Absolutely stellar bud, fantastic communication, super fast shipping (&lt;3 days from placing the order to having it in my hand, and I live in the midwest).  His EMP by Headlight is the best strain I've ever had, bar none.

The main issue as I see it is a case of ratings inflation. Buyers are discouraged from leaving anything lower than a 5/5, except in cases of extreme negligence, which makes it much more difficult to distinguish between vendors.

For example, one of the more recent reviewers on MDUK's page left him with a 3/5, and explained his reasons for doing so. While I have doubts about some of the issues he brought up, it's his right to review as he pleases. But since probably 90% of reviewers on the site leave 5/5 as long as they get their product, this has had a semi-significant impact on MDUK's rating relative to other MDMA vendors.

The only solution that I can think of is to implement an objective (or at least consensus) set of scoring criteria for ratings. Otherwise the ratings system becomes meaningless except as a means of identifying vendors who are way, way off their game.

A few quick things:

a) While our hearts and hopes are with DPR &amp; company getting the Pirate Ship Silk Road back afloat, we are hedging our bets (and listings!) and we have set up an account over at Atlantis. Our name is the same there as it is at SR. (FTR we do think that DPR will pull through, as he always has in the past.)

b) If any of you have orders in transit with us, please let us know and we will get you your tracking numbers- whether or not you're finalized (or will ever be able to finalize) is immaterial. If you've got money tied up with us in SR, then you're getting your GBL. Since we haven't been able to check orders for the last few days, we cannot say the same for people who have made orders but who we haven't marked as in transit. 

c) If you have any questions for us and SR, Atlantis, BMR, AND the forums are down,  you can always reach us at jennifers@tormail.org. Please note that we barely ever look at BMR. Seriously we've gotten one order from there in eight months. We're sure it's relevant, though. No offense if it's your jam.

d) If you're one of the dozens of people who promised us an r/silkroad review but never left one, seriously WTF, don't play with our emotions.

$6.5/gram for kushage. Whats kushage? Its an OK strain that Ive had in the past. Canadaflag's kushage is about as good as any other Ive had. But his price for kushage is cheap. I would say its worth $9-$12/gram. So at $6.5/gram its cheap. But Im not a fan of the strain in general. Grade: B+

$7/gram for Blue Rhino. Talk about BAG APPEAL. These are chunky, dense nugs that look like they are from a magazine. This is a full indica and it feels like it. A blueberry cross. And you can feel it. For $7/gram this is a bargain. I would pay $10/gram easy from a compassion club. Grade: A

Chemdog $7.5/gram if you buy an ounce. (for an ounce $210) Sells samples for $9.75/gram. Every vendor is known for something they sell. For Canadaflag its all about the Chemdog.  His chemdog is PREMIUM. I bought 2 grams of it. And I jarred it in a small glass jar I got from the dollar store. I opened the jar at my buddys house and it STUNK the house up. You could smell it from upstairs lol. An amazing citrus smell. This one strain is light years ahead of anything else he sells. I would go further to say its probably some of the best chemdog I have ever had. Wicked high. Very potent head high. Racing, energizing, and so euphoric.  Easily a $300/oz so for $210 its wicked cheap. Grade A+

Overall. If you want a wicked sativa high, Canadaflag has the best chemdog on silk. While his other strains are well priced its really the chemdog that steals the show.",,False,,t5_2sidu,False,,,True,t3_1ctcdn,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1ctcdn/silkroad_vendor_review_of_canadaflag_strains/,

I've had two acid trips before: off of a .5 tess tab for my first time and 1.5 tess tabs for my second.  The trip I had from Haizenberg's Hoffman blotters exceeded both of those.  More intense visuals and headspace than I may ever have had in my life, and I'm a huge shrooms enthusiast.  About five hours into my trip, I made this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1c3zl7/just_took_two_of_haizenbergs_tabs_ama/ 

Upon later review, I think it's because it's been more than a month since I last did acid, and knowing what to expect made me feel free to trip more.  I also decided to go outdoors in a beautiful setting this time around.

I got a 10-strip, back when bitcoins were $160 (paid $102/btc).  Unfortunately, I received them on the day that bitcoin fell &gt;$200, so I feel bad for the vendor.  The product was well-priced to begin with, and I feel like I got the value for the money.

Capsule Corp: came SUPER fast within the US -- two days.  I selected this vendor because of their speed and seeming reliability and I wasn't disappointed.  I'll be back in a couple days with a quality report.  My first time trying 2C-B.


Anybody else super thankful for SR? I would never have had a lot of valuable experiences if it weren't for it.  I'm going to try to cut down on my shipments going forward, but if it weren't for SR I feel that the process of opening my mind and taking away some of the mystique around drugs would never have happened.  And I feel like I'm much less rash about my drug choices -- in the past, I'd just buy whatever was available because of such low supply.  Now it's quite easy to say no to drugs, because I can get them whenever I'd like!

First order came to one of the SE states in 6 days, second in 5. As everyone and their mother have already said, great stealth - professional business packaging outside and witty cover up job inside. Some people exaggerate a bit though - if you know what you're looking for, you'll immediately know where it is. But I don't think any unsuspecting person would have reason to open the letter at all. My orders also had different return addresses so at the very least he cycles a few and likely changes the whole pool from time to time.

Now, for the important point of this review: the first order was for a 10 strip from one of the last batches before he started laying his White Blotter. To be honest it was a bit botched - it was good, clean acid but I estimated the content at ~100ug per tab. Still  I brought it up with Tess and after checking that I had really bought from the uneven batch, he offered me a 50% refund or a reship with the next order. Little thinking, I ordered another 10 strip and come home today to a 4x5 piece of delicious white tabs waiting in the mailbox. One problem is that I won't try them for two or three weeks from now - but from what I hear they are top notch and exactly what they were advertised as.

In conclusion, I can wholeheartedly recommend Tess. It's good to know the person you're ordering from ships a good product in a timely manner but it's even better to know that if something goes wrong, they will make it right.",,False,,t5_2sidu,False,,,True,t3_1a462k,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1a462k/vendor_review_another_vote_for_tesselated/,

Hey r/LSD, I'm in need of some advice. Around 3:30 today I took what I believed to be my first dosage of LSD (2.5 hits). It was in powder form within a clear capsule purchased from a Silk Road vendor. I waited for about an hour, aware that it was going to take a while to begin to feel the trip begin. However, around 4:30 I began feeling extremely nauseated--wet mouth, hot flashes, very upset stomach. I sat down and tried to breathe deeply, but I soon began to vomit. After about 2 minutes of puking, I felt a lot better. Then, after about 30 minutes and a number of hallucinatory observations, I puked a second time. After this purge, I felt much better. I waited another 20 minutes, and smoked a joint with my sitter. (Don't worry, she originally did not want me to smoke after I had thrown up, but I promised her I would be fine.) And, indeed, after we smoked I did feel much calmer and more relaxed. However, since then I have noticed very minimal to no hallucinations. Deep thought has persisted, I've played a lot of piano, journaled etc. but nowhere near what I thought I would experience. I kept telling myself that I needed to ""just accept my LSD experience and not force any kind of trip based on what I had heard from others."" I am no longer nauseated, however I am ridiculously hungry, and THAT is something nearly every single person, including the guy who bought this with me, told me I would not experience. I feel almost completely cognizant right now; the only real affects I am currently experiencing are 1) trouble concentrating on typing this post, and 2) I am insanely creative; I am about to record an A Capella version of a favorite instrumental by Yppah.


Beyond all of this, is the fact that, on one of the bags that the 2 capsules came in (mine and my friend's) the letters ""CB"" were written in sharpie. The capsule I took came in a bag with the number ""40"" on it. My friend promised me that he purchased LSD, told me that he wasn't sure why his bag said CB, and promised me that my bag was marked with a ""40"" because it contained 40 milligrams. I asked him why it was not measured in micrograms, and he told me that he wasn't sure. But he definitely did not seem confident in his response, whatsoever. Now, I have converted milligrams to micrograms, yes, I realize that 40 milligrams of LSD would have been 40,000 micrograms, and I would not be able to write these words.


My friend has not dropped yet because he was planning on doing so tonight. I am going to warn him about my vomiting, because if this is not LSD--I'm almost positive it can't be, but it was my first time taking any legitimate psychedelic, so I might be wrong--I do not want him to possibly overdose on the same drug.


For those who respond, please do not criticize me for not being careful about the entire matter. I know that I should have not only looked to make sure my friend truly did purchase LSD, but I also should have been much more careful before taking something he claimed was measured in milligrams. Throughout the entire purchasing process, I have had terrible worries and very weird dreams about the order, but I assured myself that my friend would never intentionally fuck me over.


Please let me know what you guys think. I'm fine now, just a little high from the joint and maybe the effects of 2-CB (I haven't researched it yet; I didn't think it was necessary until after I puked my guts out twice.)


Thanks


Edit: I don't know how to condense this into a TL;DR, but I completely understand if most of y'all don't want to read that wall of text.

To everyone who responded, thank you. I spent some time researching it last night, and I'm almost positive I took 2C-B. If I ordered 2.5 hits of 2C-B it would come out to around 40 milligrams, which is what was written on my bag. Thank you for helping me though, everyone. After ""my friend"" gives me money back, I do not plan on communicating with him ever again. Hopefully, from now on, I'll be able to have more honest reports if I order from SR.

Didn't FE or 5 star rate, against the vendor policy, but the order said it had shipped so I figured all was well. 

15 days later no package has arrived so we agree to a 14 day extension.

14 day extension ends, and against ST's vendor policy I am not awarded a 50% refund or 100% reship. SR give all the cash to ST. I tried asking SR what was going on and they claimed that because I didn't follow ST's rules I had no protection. (this conversation took about a week to complete).

 I tried contacting ST but they're on vacation for a week. A week (and 2 more days cause theyre backed up) later and ST responds asking for my buyer stats. I provide them. 4 days later I get a message asking for the order details (i.e. what I purchased). I respond. 3 days later I get a response asking for the transaction details.

Now, because I've just spent about 3 weeks getting to this point with ST and another week contacting SR, plus FOUR weeks waiting for the order to come in, the transaction details had been wiped (over 6 weeks). I cannot provide these details because they are gone. So now I wait on a response from them, but I doubt I will make any progress because four days after explaining this to them, they respond with:

&gt; ""In order to give a reship or a refund we would need to have a transaction details."".

Anyhow, this is some BS because if vendor policy is considered concrete rule to be followed, then by their own policy:

&gt;""Orders under $500,- must be Finalized Early. Of course my refund/reship policy still applies! a 5/5 Feedback must also be left after Finalizing, if you finalize without leaving feedback your order will not be sent."" 

My order was never sent in the first place and ST, who now has my money and my 5 star rating, owes me my order. SR pretty much ignored any reason to use the escrow system, since apparently I either have to FE

TL;DR I've FE'd. I gave 5 star feedback. Now I can't get my order filled because I can't prove I ever made the order. SR won't help ST won't help. I consider myself to have been scammed because ST took a vacation and took 2 weeks to finally ask for the transaction details, by which time they're gone.

&gt;This coming Tuesday we'll be rolling out some changes that &gt;should be welcome to our members who are used to using &gt;currencies other than the US Dollar.  Support for 34 new fiat &gt;currencies plus gold and silver will be added.  You will be able to &gt;view the prices in the market along with your account balance in &gt;these currencies, and vendors will be able to peg their prices to &gt;these currencies as well.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;So for example, if you live in Australia and view prices in the &gt;Aussie Dollar, and you shop with domestic suppliers who peg &gt;their prices to the Aussie Dollar, you will see more or less steady &gt;prices across the market even as the exchange rates fluctuate.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;As an added bonus, we've added 2 decimal places to Bitcoin &gt;prices for a total of 4.  This can easily be expanded or contracted &gt;as necessary if the Bitcoin exchange rate changes dramatically in &gt;the future.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The site will be taken offline around 1900 UTC on July 2nd while &gt;the update is deployed and tested.  We've done our best to catch &gt;any bugs that might crop up, but please message support with &gt;any that you find asap when we come back online.

I realize there are already a bunch of vendors who sell incredible weed, but its usually very expensive. Not too many sell for under 200/ oz. I was wondering if the SR community would have much interest in this. At this point prices would start at about 160/oz. There is no shake or stems or any of that, its dank weed but just smaller nugs. If there is interest, and I became I vendor I would be happy to send out plenty of cheap samples as well!

tl;dr Any interest in medical grade budlets starting at around 160/oz???

Thanks for all the responses, I still need to get everything together and purchase a vendor account, but hopefully I can make this happen pretty soon. I will upload pictures and give out samples as soon as I get everything together.

&gt; Hidden services such as are popular, sites such as the Silk Road marketplace receive more than 60,000 unique user sessions a day.

How he knows:

&gt; Any one can set up a Tor node (HSDir) and begin logging all hidden service descriptors published to their node. They will also receive all client requests allowing them to observe the number of look-ups for particular hidden services.

Relevant to recent SR downtime:

&gt; The list of responsible HSDir’s for a hidden service is based on the calculated descriptor ID and an ordered list of HSDir fingerprints. As the descriptor ID’s are predictable, and the node fingerprint is controlled by an adversary. The can position themselves to be the responsible directories for a targeted hidden service and subsequently perform a DoS attack by not returning the hidden service descriptor to clients. There is nothing the hidden service can do about this attack. They must rely on the Tor Project authority directories to remove the malicious HSDir’s from the consensus.

The per-onion traffic:

&gt; The following table contains data on requests my nodes received for some well known Tor based marketplaces. There are also requests for related phishing sites. I have confirmed that some users were directed to these phishing pages from links on the “The Hidden Wiki” (.onion). The number of requests is what my nodes observed. Descriptor look-ups from clients will be divided at random between the 6 responsible HSDir’s and clients will keep trying the remaining HSDir’s until the descriptor is found or all HSDir’s have been checked. As a result the total number of requests received by the following sites per day may be up to 6 times more than the figures below, but these still offer a relative guide to popularity.

Specifically, if I am interpreting his .onion table right, that implies that in April &amp; May 2013, he found a lower bound of 27,836 visitors to SR &amp; 327 to SR phishing sites (so 1.17% of would-be SR visitors were exposed to a phishing site?) and an upper bound of 167,016/1,962 (respectively).",,False,,t5_2sidu,False,,,True,t3_1el2jq,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1el2jq/on_tor_traffic_observations_dos_attacks_and_total/,

Before I even gave him my address again, a package arrived on Apr. 29th and was postmarked the 25th. This raises questions such as why the package was a month late and why he still had my address.

He's got a 100 rating and I figured I would be safe ordering my painkillers from him (I got dropped from my health insurance and now have to buy painkillers for my endometriosis via the black market until I can afford it again). I got it with express shipping because I was running out. 

About an hour after I ordered I noticed he took down his listing but it didn't really worry me. Then the next day he messaged me about his ""runners"" having stolen four packages he was going to send out that day. He assured me he had went on the street and bought them himself and would be sending them out to be received on wednesday. On wednesday I told him I hadn't gotten it yet and he messaged me again saying it would be there today and ""when you get the box check the papers cause your pills are crumpled up (in a bag) taped to the balls of paper"". He included two clearly fake messages from other people who had received their packages.

Finally today I received a package. Guess what was in it? Five pieces of crumpled up paper and two blank cds. My product wasn't in there at all. He set me up so well. Now he has a dcn that says delivered and his little set up ""good stealth"" alibi for the resolution center so he can try to lie and say I'm too stupid to find the shit in my package. He has since then taken down all his listings so my feedback won't really mean anything and he will probably win in the resolve because he has such a high rating. All I can do is come here and to the forums to tell people that he's a scammer and to watch out. What a scum right?

1365624082.0,16,self.SilkRoad,1c32if,"Risk of ordering from an unhedged seller in a BTC ""bubble"" (&amp; how risky is the hedging system itself?)",25,9,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1c32if/risk_of_ordering_from_an_unhedged_seller_in_a_btc/,"I placed an order on SR an hour or two ago. When I placed the order SR still used a weighted average of $230 USD/1 BTC, but they were trading on MtGox for around $150 (down to $132 at time of posting). Of course, we generally have no idea what it'll be trading at in a few days/hours/minutes...maybe unless you have insider knowledge of a significant event, like an extremely large trade.

Nonetheless, I realized that the seller in question doesn't use hedging. What are the likely outcomes of this scenario when there's a significant drop in the BTC exchange rate? Unhedged sellers absorb fluctuations and risk since they can avoid hedging fees, and often compensate for losses when value increases. It seems like it could be different when the BTC loses nearly half its value within hours, and it seems plausible to some that it won't recover soon.

In the past, has it been common for unhedged orders to be canceled after the BTC exchange rate has dropped significantly in a short time? It's probably a bit different for an established seller who can afford to take a hit on some orders to keep their reputation, versus a newer or less reputable vendor that doesn't have as much interest/ability in keeping customers happy.

Is this seen as an ""acceptable"" reason for a seller to cancel an order? If a seller is clearly canceling orders en masse for this reason, might SR take action against them? (Of course, some will be back after they put down the BTC for a new seller account...) While I don't blame them for not wanting to take a huge loss to fill the order, I doubt a lot of sellers would have qualms about profiting from dramatic increases in BTC value.

What about the hedging system itself...how well could it withstand the BTC losing much of its value? They get revenue not only through the hedging fee (4% if I recall), but also when the exchange rate has increased once the buyer finalizes. I'm sure they probably have tons of BTC on their hands after the recent increase in value, but is it likely for the system to collapse if BTC become worthless enough? Is it self-sustaining in the sense that lost BTC value is paid for directly by previous ""profits""...or does SR have some internal mechanism of ""hedging"" for losses in BTC value?

**Update:** ...aaaand the seller inexplicably decided to cancel my order later that day. Of course, his items are still up for sale at the same USD price. The seller hasn't sent any messages about the cancellation (other than the notification from SR), and there's nothing on seller's page about current issues with anything either.

By the time it was cancelled, the item's BTC price had increased from 0.55 to 0.75 BTC, and BTC-USD exchange rate dropped from $240 to $180. That's about a 25% loss, which amounts to $30-35 in this case.

**CalifornianDream** is the seller in question.

I guess the lesson is to be careful when buying from unhedged sellers, especially when BTC rates are significantly increasing/decreasing or fluctuating.",,False,,t5_2sidu,1365739495.0,,,True,t3_1c32if,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1c32if/risk_of_ordering_from_an_unhedged_seller_in_a_btc/,

""We will usually be hooking everyone up to that extent, so if you have any friends let 'em know!"" Hah, i cant imagine he can afford to hook up everyone up like he did me, but he claims he will be for at least the next few orders!

Supposedly this guy is a grower from humboldt, CA and sells both indoor and outdoor.  This strain was advertised as being outdoor and organic, but this is not something I can verify based on experience.  Also, since it will probably be asked, this vendor DOES NOT require FE.  In fact, I think he doesn't want anyone to FE, but I could be thinking of someone else.

Packaging: 10/10 - Pretty standard.  Vacuum sealed, no smell.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  BUDS ARE NOT COMPRESSED.  This seems to be the biggest question that potential buyers have, so there ya go. 

Shipping: 10/10 - Ordered Sunday and was marked 'in transit' the following day.  Arrived Friday.  Most of my orders come in that amount of time, so all good here.

Product: 100000000000000/10 -   I am AMAZED at, presumably, how much time and effort HeartOfHumbolt puts into his nuggets.  There is not a SINGLE leaf anywhere in the bag and there isn't a SINGLE nug that has a stem sticking out.  Because of this, there are very few nugs that are over a gram, but seriously, this trim job is nuts.  I seriously don't understand the incentive behind being so meticulous.

I cannot comment on how well cured these buds are because I have no idea, but it is a tad too moist for my liking.  It smells like a pine tree that has berries growing on it and it tastes great.  After two bong rips, this bud gave me an EXTREMELY mellow high with ZERO couch lock.  Seriously I could have ran a marathon after smoking.  Kinda too mellow for my liking, but the weed is fire, have no doubts.  The edible gave me a nice, relaxing buzz too.

Communication: 10/10 - No drama with this transaction.  No contact to or from the vendor because it was not necessary.

Price: 100000000000000/10 - This part is subjective so take it for what it's worth.  I live in the midwest, and for bud this good I would have to pay ~$350 maybe even $400, and you bet your ass I would.  For me, the prices on the road are INSANE.  After making this purchase, I was browsing and saw ounces of various strains listed for ~$220 from a 100 rated vendor.  Shits ridiculous.

I have been out of the country for about 3 months and just got back this December. I decide to make an SR purchase today and turns out BitInstant no longer accepts bank deposits. So, the only option I really had was to do a moneygram. I went through the normal steps (Wallet #, REAL name, tormail address, etc. etc.) and selected a moneygram location as well as giving them my tormail address one more time along with my phone number (for ZipZap). I don't have a car right now and my nearest moneygram location was like 2 miles so I hoofed it over there only to find out that my name was not on the account or that it had not even been set up or something of that nature (I honestly couldn't completely understand the call center rep on the red phone at CVS). I'm just trying to understand what I did wrong. I've been using bank deposits for like a year and they are flawless and go without a hitch every time. Also, has anyone else been having tormail issues? I did not receive a single confirmation email or anything throughout this whole period. I also just tried to sign up for coinbase and did not receive the confirmation email. Does tormail stop sending/receiving to your account after periods of inactivity?

Thanks guys.

:EDIT: - Just received an email from coinbase finally so I know my email is working. Does anyone have experience with this service and know if it is reliable? I saw it suggested by another SR reddit user. Thanks

:EDIT2: - I appreciate all the help yall. When I first started using SR, I went with a bitcoin vendor for my first or second time, and honestly, the fees are disgusting. There is a walmart about the same distance in the opposite direction that I am going to try. Hopefully they'll make it work. I sure am getting a workout today haha. Tip for anyone who is looking to buy a car, save up a couple extra paychecks and don't buy a beater cherokee for 1500 on craigslist hoping it will run forever. Because it will break down shortly thereafter. If you have my luck, that is. 

:FINAL EDIT:: - Just wanted to say since there is a wells fargo directly across the street from me, I went with bitcopia because all they were accepting at the moment is wells fargo deposits anyway. The fee was not bad, probably equivalent to or less than bitinstant, and I had my BTC in about 2 hours directly to my silkroad wallet (which I never normally do, but I was feeling cheeky and pressed for time today).

Looks amazing,21,6,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/13wdv4/just_received_katerall_25inbome_order_looks/,"Hi everyone. So in the weeks leading up to this post, I had several other posts in this subreddit questioning the legitimacy of kateralls 25I NBOMe listing. I can now confirm that this listing is valid and legit. I received my order of 100 tabs of 25I today. I got hooked up fat too. I FE'd for the bonus hookup. I was expecting to get 115 tabs but was surprised to find 126 tabs in the envelope when i opened it. So anyone out there interested in Katerall, i can vouch that s/he is a decent vendor. The only issue that arose was the shipping time. Kat was claiming s/he was shipping orders out 12hours after getting them. For me, my order was shipped out about 5 days after i finalized. This is not that big of a deal, but it freaked me out cuz i was expecting a package in a certain time-window and when it didn't show, i started jumping to conclusion thinking i got scammed. In total, it took 11 days from the point that i finalized to the point i received my shipment. Anyway, i plan to try the product tonight or tomorrow night and report back with a good trip/product report/review. So i just wanted to kind of redact my other post the other day when i questioned if kat was a good vendor. I now know first hand that kats a great vendor. And as long as the 25I preforms as advertised, ill be one happy dude. Peace.

This time it is of this stellar vendor Fivestar!

Lets fire into it. Tierra del fuego!


------------------------------


Communication 8/5

They fucking earned that 8. Communication is beyond any vendor I've ever dealt with before. Fuck its beyond any merchant I've ever dealt with before, real life or virtual. Fivestar was the nicest they could possibly be to me. It was outstanding. I felt safe and happy throughout the whole process. This is someone who cares about our freedom, cares about the sanctity of the road, and cares about their customers. Hands down the friendliest and most caring vendor I've ever come in contact with and I don't state that lightly. 


--------------------------


Shipping 6/5

I don't know if I got lucky, location turned out right, or FIvestar helped me out. I think it was a combination of all three that turned into me getting some of the fastest express shipping I've ever got. Was outstanding. They shipped out promptly and when they said they would. No dicking around. No excuses about how they have SOO many orders or whatever.  Just straight professional as it should be. Another aspect that put a smile on my face.


---------------------------


Stealth 5/5

Again above and beyond the call of duty on this one. Weak in one area but for very good reasons. Strong as fuck in others. Without giving anything away it was packaged very very well with good cover and used the stealth that everyone should use but many don't. You should be aware of what I'm talking about. No one other gram vendors use the technology that Fivestar employs in their stealth even though they should be. I've very thankful for that.


-----------------------


Quantity/Quality 5/5

What can I say? It was a beautiful white powder with small clumps that broke up easily. Very high quality. Smell and taste was right on par and the quantity seemed fat even though its hard for me to tell. Right on point. Quality is high enough for me to prefer it to other vendors especially when you take into account how amazing Fivestar is as a vendor and the good pricing. 


---------------------------------


All in all Fivestar went far beyond what I expected. 


For the price you simply can't beat someone providing service at this level. I've now tried every gram vendor I'm going to try (read back through my history for other reviews) and I've found my true go-to. I might go for others when I feel adventurous but I'm confident Fivestar is going to treat me with respect and value me as a customer in ways that other vendor simply do not. And honestly in this game that is the most important thing you can ask for beyond getting your product and having it be as described. 


----------------------------

**EDIT GOT SOME PICS!**

that is freeway (not totally chopped up yet) on the right and fivestar on the left


you can see everything fairly clearly if you zoom in on the second pic. All those little chunks in fivestars were just moist nuggets of powder the broke apart effortlessly and finely. 



Thanks. Keep safe out there and as always

LONG LIVE THE ROAD!

Shipping 5/5: Fast Shipping! I usually order Sunday and I get it by Friday
Appearance 5/5: They look really delicious

Smell 5/5: No smell at all until you open the vacuum seal. Smells like quality edibles.

The High 5/5: The first time I ordered, I got the sampler pack. I ate half of a quad brownie and I was super baked. Also tasted very good! Do not doubt the potency of the brownies.

Communication 5/5: I messaged Thurgood when I ordered per requested on his vendor page for new buyers. He responded quickly, thanked me for messaging him and processed my order.

Shipping 5/5: I ordered Tuesday, it shipped Wednesday and came Friday to the Mid-Atlantic.

Appearance 5/5: Frosty decent sized nugs.  The bud is absolutely beautiful, covered in trichromes, sticky and well-trimmed.

Smell 5/5: Damn. Fruity and dank. The smell is so pungent and tangy, it hits you in the face when you open it up.

The High 5/5: Wow. This is the best bud I have ever personally seen or smoked. I've smoked plenty of other Colorado medical strains and the likes but nothing has ever been this potent and clean. Smokes so smooth and it burns to pure white ash. Great 50/50 hybrid, hits hard with a swimmy head high and an Indica body high that slowly creeps up on you.

Stealth 5/5: Great stealth, no smell through the package and completely inconspicuous. Smell and visual barrier inside of the box.

laWnmoWer mAn (1oz Permafrost)

Communication 5/5: He notified me that my order wouldn't be shipped until the following day cause he was dealing with power issues and once again to let me know when my package was arriving after it was shipped. 

Shipping 5/5: Ordered Tuesday, package was shipped on Wednesday and arrived Saturday with Thursday being a holiday.

Appearance 4/5: Small, mostly &lt;.5g nugs. The bag appeal is slightly lacking due to the small nug sizes but it's still great bud and covered in trichomes.

Smell 5/5: One of the more interesting buds I have had the pleasure of smelling, it's a mixture of citrus, pine and a hint of mint at the end.

The High 5/5: The sativa dominance of the strain hits you right in the head with a strong cerebral high that's accompanied by euphoria and a wonderful sense of well-being.

Stealth 4/5: There was no smell and the outside of the package was good but I would've preferred a visual barrier inside of the box.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TheBudFather (1oz Northern Lights)

Communication 5/5: Never had to message him but my order was shipped out a few hours after placing my order.

Shipping 5/5: Two day priority shipping to the Mid-Atlantic.

Appearance 5/5: Great looking bud, medium .5-2g nugs, lots of orange hairs and trichage. The trim job isn't quite as good as the Bubbleberry but it's still on point.

Smell 5/5: Not incredibly pungent but it has a musky pine smell with undertones of lemon-lime.

The High 5/5: This bud is a fantastic representation of a classic strain. There's an instant onset of a warm, cloud-like body high. It's great for relaxing, chilling with friends and playing video games.

Stealth 5/5: No smell through the package and completely inconspicuous. Smell and visual barrier inside of the box.

As i said before, this was our first time with shrooms, and we were not dissapointed at all.  We both have expirence tripping on multiple other substances, but just never got around to trying shrooms.  We both did a lemon tek with my GF taking 2g and me taking 2.3g.

Previously I raved about remoteKontrol's hash which deserves praise.  In this review I sampled [rabbithole's](http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/12f29c0c43) **Magic Maple Candy**.

Being Canadian I love maple anything, it's coded in my DNA.  I also love magic mushrooms but can't stand the taste.  I have a pretty strong gag reflex so I can barely get down enough for a dose.  When I saw this vendor I couldn't resist trying the goods and I'm very impressed!

The product is very well packaged and I have no doubts the shipping will satisfy even the most paranoid.  The taste is actually quite good and it's the first time my gag reflex didn't kick in while chewing shrooms.  I could definitely taste mushrooms in a few bites of the candy but it wasn't bad at all.  The earthyness of the shrooms mixed quite well with the earthyness of the maple - it was a great mix.  Most importantly, no gag and no funk.

The trip is as described and for my first time out I decided to try 1 candy (1g).  They describe one candy as: Colours seem brighter; some tingling of tongue and fingers; deep breaths, physical energy.  I agree with effects and I really enjoyed one candy, it left me with a nice, not too strong, buzz that seemed to enhance everything (as mushrooms do).  My sweet spot is probably 1.5 - 2 candies but I really enjoyed the effects of 1.  The vendor is committed to consistency of dose so you shouldn't have wild fluctuations in potency between candies.  I prefer this as I've had potency vary greatly between mushrooms in the past.

I asked the vendor to put a sample pack order up since not everyone will try the product out if they have to order a dozen so look out for the 4-candy pack soon.

**TL;DR: I love mushrooms but hate the taste.  [Rabbithole](http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/12f29c0c43) is providing a super tasty delivery vehicle for one of my favourite psychedelics.

To be fair to them, the categories are comprehensive (bar the annoying lack of sativa/indica/hybrid categories in cannabis.) However, I don't understand why you can't at least filter out listings in certain price ranges.

I must have sent him 3 messages over the course of the transaction and he replied to each of them within a matter of hours, and frequently within one hour. Highly recommended in this regard.

**Shipping**: he had some slight issues getting my order shipped out (took about three days to get it marked in transit) but he mentioned these issues on his vendor page and I never felt in the dark at all. I received my product within 5 days of placing the order anyway, so I have absolutely no complaints.

**Stealth** was slightly sub par, but for personal amounts of blotter acid ordered domestically... I don't really give a shit. I have no reason to believe that his package would ever get singled out as containing drugs, but compared to some vendors who have incredible stealth (aidoneus comes to mind) OotP falls short.

and most importantly, the **Product!**

I **DID NOT** reagent test his acid (as apparently blotter paper can fuck with reagent tests), so take this with a grain of salt if you like. Here's what I will tell you.

The onset took about 45 minutes, on par with what I have come to expect from LSD.

The entire trip lasted 8-9 hours, again on par with what I expected.

The ug amounts he claimed (100ug) seems on par compared to other LSD I have taken in the past. One of his tabs felt about as strong as two tabs I have purchased locally.

There were no strange or unexpected tastes in my mouth. There was no taste at all, actually.

There was no tongue/mouth numbing associated with NBOMe's.

All in all, because I didn't test it, I can't say with 100% certainty that this was LSD, but this was LSD and quality LSD at that. With a single tab I had a very pleasant, moderately visual trip.

tl;dr: I highly recommend OotP for domestic LSD if you're willing to accept less than top quality stealth for quality acid.",,False,,t5_2sidu,False,,,True,t3_1gtiew,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1gtiew/orderofthephoenix_lsd_review_tldr_awesome/,

His stealth is awesome. I ordered extra mbb that he has available for my peace of mind. No scent until breaking the final seal.

Shipping was very quick. Arrived two days after the posted date and the quoted date from TJ to the East. Cannot complain one bit there

Communication was above and beyond what was expected. Very personalized, very articulate in his responses, extremely fast on getting back to you. The quickness in response may delay some in the future due to the increase in customer flow he will surely have but I do not doubt that he will ever lose his lack of customer care and helpfulness. 

Quality looks to be on par with top shelf product. Crystals covered. Great bag appeal. No compression through shipping. Just good, good stuff. I am sure I will be very happy once tested.

This was my first purchase and to say I was nervous would be an understatement. TJ put me at ease and once I received the product I understood exactly why I should have no reservations by using his services.

I immediately got my testing kit. (Why I didn't do this before clicking finalize? I will never know.) I separated what I thought was the actual mdma from the salt. Surprise, surprise the hand picked tan mdma chunks turned purple to black and the other pile indicated no substance marquis tested for was contained in the salt pile.

Two of my buddies and I (yes, we know what a roll is supposed to feel like) took 125mg and tasted basically strong Epsom salt with a hint of the MDMA taste from being in the bag with a little bit of legit product. We started the music and games going and literally nothing. We re-dosed a little over an hour later with 75mg more, each. Nothing.

Shipping: (9/10) - Absolutely awesome stealth. Shipped through priority which ended up taking 4 days but I'm not gonna knock Ava (the vendor) for the speed of usps.

Smell: (9/10) - Extremely unique, The Big Lebowski actually has a four month cure which is something very unique that I'd never seen before. Both smelled very Earthy and pleasant.

Appearance: (10/10) - This is where Ava really shines. I'll post pictures below for emphasis. Some of the most interesting and fluffy looking bud I've ever seen.

Taste: (8/10) - The taste, like the smell, is very Earthy. I happen to like it a lot, but I understand that it isn't for everybody. It isn't a notable downside by any means, still good smoke.

The high: (10/10) - The Lebowski is one of the most enjoyable highs I've come across in a long long time. Extremely mellow and not paranoid or overpowering in any way. As she describes it, it's more of a compliment to your day. The Chemdawg x G13 is a really active sativa, so wake and baking with it makes for an awesome day. All in all, both of these deliver unique highs not found with your everyday dealer.

So I don't want to have it delivered directly to my apartment, I instead want to open up a po box thats not tied to my name.

This way, should my drugs be seized, I can just abandoned that PO box.

My questions are, 1) Is it worth all this hassle? I know MDMA is one of the harder drugs to detect, but still its being shipped internationally (domestic mdma is far more expensive). Don't certain countries set off alarms as far as this stuff goes? Like for instance, would the Netherlands be a suspicious country to receive a package from?

I'm studying http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.7139. All the data they report on in that paper are from scraping the public listings. They don't report any numbers about stealth listings or stealth mode vendors. What I want to know is: how much are we missing if we just count the public listings?

Are stealth mode sales about as big (in total sales money per month) as public sales? Are they smaller, possibly because customers prefer to buy from public listings? Or are they bigger, possibly because vendors prefer to go into stealth mode once they establish a reputation?

Is Silk Road actually twice as big, economically, as that paper suggests, because the stealth listings are about as important as public listings? Or is it ten times as big as that paper suggests, because the stealth listings are where all the action is and they move many times as much product that way?

I was surfing the road looking for some MDA, and I saw MIMM's listings of MDA(in the photo it looks tasty). I thought I might like to take maybe half a gram just to know what was it.



I did it. I ordered 1/2g and waited.


4 days after ordering it I see that the order hadn't been shipped, or even accepted. I wasn't so excited about the MDA, so I cancelled the order.


Not more than 10 minutes after canceling, he sent me a new message: *Your order has been shipped, blablabla, shipping times, blablabla.*


I knew I cancelled the order so I thought he also may not have sent my package.


To my surprise, one week later, a package came, and there, the MDA.


I was very lucky.

Now the review:

**Stealth:** 5/5. The best I've seen on the road by far. Very professional.

**Shipping time:** 5/5. One week to western europe. Good, nothing special, but it arrived at least.

**Product:** 2/5. Color was brown, and very sticky. My friend and I took all of it in the afternoon(250mg each redosing 2 times), and just felt little to no euphoria and zero visuals. 

**Comunication:** 5/5. He sent me a message saying that it had been shipped, nothing more

Vendor:

In terms of my shipping. Everything I do is with my own safety and the buyer's safety in mind. I don't take shortcuts. I have switched to handwritten Express labels for this exact reason. I get a ton of emails from people suggesting I use printed ones - I used to do this until I realized it puts the BUYER in jeopardy. I grow quite tired of this suggestion and I'm going to explain why. While you might think handwritten labels are amateurish - they are the safest form of shipping for the buyer.

Let me tell you a quick story- On my first run of H stamps I had one desperate buyer whose Express shipment took 2 days. He is always a 2-day Express as he lives in a very small town and I priced it out prior to shipment and informed him of that. The next day I log in to see 33 emails from him. He is sick, desperate, pleading for a tracking number, accusing me of not shipping, threatening me, etc etc etc. So I caved and gave him his tracking number. Then I log-in to another 20+ emails. He has called USPS a dozen or so times, he went to his local PO since the online tracking didn't show where it was, and he spoke to his local courier when he came to his door. The amount of times he contacted and stalked USPS scared me. I then realized that any electronic postage system - usps.com, stamps.com, pitneybowes.com- ties all of my buyers to one another. ALL of these systems store your addresses FOREVER - linked to my return address and linked to each other. Had this buyer told USPS he was waiting for his ""medicine"" - every one of my buyers would be in jeopardy.

Now mind you- my return address is totally stealth. I pay for postage using prepaid cards from a different state, log in anonymously to print labels- I am untouchable. However you as a buyer are not. You think I want to sit here each day and write out 20 labels when I know I can do it in 2 minutes copy and paste online? But I will not knowingly risk my buyer's safety to save myself time. The only way to get a tracking number - AND MAKE EACH PACKAGE INDEPENDENT OF ITSELF and only linked to itself....is to use handwritten labels and Express mail stamps.

I saw that freeside was one of the few that had it in stock currently and in the amount I wanted (8th). After a quick reddit search and finding a good review I decided to go for it. Placed the order over the weekend, arrived Wednesday from the West Coast to me here in the deep south, very quick.

Communication: It was my first order with him/her so I always send an introductory message after ordering. I got a nice personal reply and made me feel more confident in my purchase. That was the only comm. we had or needed. 10/10

Stealth: Damn...damn....damn. This is one of the best stealths I have seen, bar none. I thought I was being punked the whole time. You have to see to believe, very convincing. Vac'd and charcoal, whole nine yards. Also came in a nice baggie with a custom logo. 15/10

Smoke: This is very nice stuff, it is a Sativa but has a brief Indica feel for the first few minutes of the smoke, then the energy comes in and you get a nice cerebral high thats lasted for a while. I felt great, too bad I have a sore throat atm :/ Taste was nice, I just got a new wooden pipe I need to break in so I probably didn't get the true taste of it all. 10/10

Overall this was a great experience and I will def be back, I love a good Sativa and my last purchase was from Thurgood and this is, if not the same quality, better than that almost. (Still love you Thurgood!).

* **Product Quality**
This is by far the most important so ill start with this. I don't have a previous experience to compare against but I can say that this exceeded all my expectations that arose from the vast amount of research I did on this drug. I can say this with certainty it was far more euphoric, less anxious, less paranoid, and much more visual stunning then the vast amounts of LSD I've done in my lifetime. The blotter art it came on was really really cool as well. Trip lasted about 4-5 hours and only took about 30 minutes before I felt effects.
* **Stealth/ Packaging**
Perfect. Definitely don't have to worry if ordering domestic/ internationally. Took 2 days from being marked in transit to Midwest.
* **Communication/ Customer Service**
Let me share my story. This was my first purchase out of two with vendor. This experience started by me reading an article about 25c-Nbome and instantly I became intrigued by this relatively new substance. I did a search on SR and saw this vendor offering a 5 tab sample for $1.05 including free shipping. My bitcoins were absolutely depleted and due to my current goto guy from localbitcoins being out I was going to have to wait a week or so before getting more. I wrote Silo and asked him if he could waive the $1.05 so I could get to try sooner. In complete disbelief a half hour later I saw a message and $1.05 in my account haha. He ha actually sent me the money to buy the sample from him! Lol I felt like a bum but wow I never seen a vendor do that! In his message he informed me his ""family"" has been selling this chemical for years and sold hundreds of thousands of tabs over the years and now trying their luck at selling on the Silk Road. He also stated that he's giving out samples because he knows once people sample his product he was certain he would make customers for life! He was right!! I only wish he had more products but supposedly he's working on that as well! Xanax bars, medicinal and mid grade weed!! I can't wait, I mean I he starts selling products I use on a daily level like benzos, weed, and MDMA I wouldn't bother going through anyone else. I asked a few more questions in another message and he responded with an hour. Extremely polite and makes you feel like your his number one priority!!

* **Overall**
This guy will be goto guy for anything he sells that I use. 25c-NBOME is not a substance I would use very often that's why I hope he comes with new products soon.

I just received about a gram from Thurgood and let me tell you is this DANK weed. Heres my review:

Communication: 5/5 
He responded quickly to my messages and was very nice. Used correct spelling and grammar (which some sellers don't, and it really makes me question their intelligence and whether I should trust them with my package), and got the order shipping out very quickly.

Shipping: 5/5 
He shipped it 3 days ago, arrived today. Perfect shipping time and just about the best I'd expect from non-express domestic mail. 

Packaging: 5/5
Though I've never ordered weed off SR before (mainly blotters and tobacco products) I'm not that well educated in this department, but from what I can tell this is top notch. Convincing outer packaging with no smell. A site barrier inside the package and is triple vacuum packed. There was no residual smell on the package and I could only smell it when I got to the last layer of vacuum seal, and even then it was SUPER faint and I only smelled it because I was looking for it.

Aesthetics: 5/5
Very fragrant and pungent aroma. This bud smells really good. It has a lot of crystals (literally coated in them) and has small flecks of purple in it giving it a very nice look. 

High: 5/5
This, as I said before, is really good marijuana. I smoked only like 4 hits and I'm pretty high right now. To get to this point I'd usually have to smoke a bowl to myself. Will be smoking more tonight and update this with how it is when more of it is smoked. 

Overall: 5/5
Thurgood has been an exemplary vendor in offering me a free sample with no guarantee whatsoever of a review and I'd like to thoroughly complement him. Everything was top notch and I'd definitely order from if I decided to order an oz off SR.

IT'S called Silk Road and it's one of the internet's most secretive destinations.

It is an online black market for illicit drugs like ecstasy and cocaine that is the scourge of law enforcement and Customs.

Silk Road is a shadowy website with an often shadowy clientele. But Dr Philip Nitschke, a prominent euthanasia advocate who is one of Australia's most controversial doctors and often referred to as ""Doctor Death"", has found an unusual audience for the service – the elderly.
Exit International, the outspoken doctor's assisted-suicide advocacy group, has provided its mostly aged followers with a manual for how to obtain suicide medication through the encrypted black market.

Dr Nitschke said his organisation published the guide because a Customs crackdown on euthanasia medication entering the country was causing many supporters to lose their money on seized medication.

Customs figures show the number of detections of euthanasia drugs such as Nembutal (which contains the barbiturate pentobarbitone) has tripled in the past three years, from 25 in 2009-10 to 76 in the last financial year.

""They might be 80-year-olds, but they don't like losing their $400,"" Dr Nitschke told news.com.au, adding that his more sophisticated strategies may help patients save their money.

The guide is necessary as the Silk Road requires significant technical expertise to access. It can only be reached using special software, not through Google or a web browser.

Silk Road, named after the ancient trade route between Europe and Asia which revolutionized the world economy, also only accepts an untraceable virtual currency called Bitcoins, not global currencies like Australian dollars.

A spokesman for the Customs and Border Protection Service said buyers and sellers of any illegal products online or on the Silk Road risk prosecution - and run the real risk of being scammed as well.

Silk Road

The Silk Road website is better known as an encrypted destination for purchasing illicit drugs like cannabis and ecstasy. Source: news.com.au
The agency said it was working in collaboration with local and international law enforcement partners as part of a global intelligence network to clamp down on buyers and sellers of drugs on anonymous websites such as Silk Road.

""Intelligence gathered by Customs and Border Protection and commentary made by buyers and sellers in online forums suggests that this disruption activity is having an adverse effect on the degree of the trust between buyers and sellers within Silk Road.""

""Customs and Border Protection has noted an increasing trend on Silk Road, whereby several 'anonymous' dealers have announced on forums that they will no longer sell to Australians or have imposed more stringent transaction rules on Australian buyers.""

Dr Nitschke's Silk Road manual is just the latest in a string of controversial attempts to assist people with medically-assisted suicide.
The medical regulator, the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA), is investigating Dr Nitschke over his use of an apparent beer brewing company to import nitrogen cylinders that can be used for suicide.

The doctor runs Max Dog Brewers, which sells nitrogen canisters which tend to be used for food processing and in beer production. The Brewer's website says the nitrogen canisters can be used for food or ""the other many hundred uses"".

The anti-euthanasia group Hope has complained about his promotion and sale of nitrogen, arguing it makes him an unfit person to hold a medical licence.

""I think there's a significant public policy around the activities of Exit International,"" Hope director Paul Russell said.

Euthanasia is illegal in Australia. Tasmanian Premier Lara Giddings and Tasmanian Greens leader Nick McKim have introduced a proposal to legalise ""voluntary assisted dying"" in the island state.

It will likely be voted on later this year, although Dr Nitschke is uncertain about its chances.

Euthanasia was legal in the Northern Territory between 1995 and 1997, when the legislation was overruled by the Federal Government.

ENBOOM  - I bought 25 tabs of 25i from him.  I really just had some money left in my account and it was cheap so I wanted to try it out. Shipping was fast enough, came about a week after I ordered it.  It wasn't super stealthy, but I don't think it's illegal yet so maybe it's not a problem?  I tried it twice so far and it's definitely legit, but I don't plan on doing them all.  Ill probably give most to friends.  Wasn't crazy about it, but the vendor is good.

TESSELATED  - I was thinking about buying from Lucy Drop but glad I changed my mind.  This was right as things were starting to look weird with him.  Got the acid from Tess a week after I ordered.  Stealth was great, I don't think it would ever get intercepted.  I split a tab with a friend to test it out and it was great.  Going to take the whole tab next time, but it's definitely somewhere between 150-200ug. I ordered more the day after I took it, really good stuff.

ROSES GARDEN - So I live in an apartment building so I can't make edibles without stinking the whole place up, so I figured I'd try hers out.  I just bought a mulato bar which was around $15 with shipping.  It was actually really strong, I was surprised.  I ate the whole thing and was really really high.  Definitely felt like an Indica because it made me really tired.  Also I'm a daily smoker (but don't usually smoke huge amounts when I do smoke) if that helps with tolerance.  I probably wont order again only because I prefered smoking to edibles, but her stuff is great nonetheless.

Most people are of the opinion why bother setting up a PO box if it doesn't get you significantly more security? To get a PO box you have to produce a non-trivial amount of identification, so it's not like they can't find you.  

I originally got a PO box because it made me feel warm and fuzzy and ""safer"" in some impossible to define way. I now can see some real advantages over home delivery. 

First of all the danger of controlled delivery. How do they do a controlled delivery to a PO box? They hold it at the desk and wait for me to come get it? I can simply not pick it up. Are they really going to stake out the PO and wait for me to come check my box? I wouldn't think LEOs would waste that sort of manpower on a small timer like you or I (I could be wrong). 

Ease of changing address is another big advantage. Let's just say I have 50 grams of MDMA coming in from the Netherlands and it's intercepted. Well now they're going to be watching my mail. There's no need to worry if it's safe to order to my PO box. I can just stop paying the bills and go open one at another post office. 

There's also the matter of separation. If I only have ""bad"" stuff delivered to my PO Box and legit stuff delivered to my home, there's not the chance of signing for a package of bud that I THINK is that new xbox game I got off ebay. 

Of course the biggest drawback of a PO box (IMO) is that when a shipment comes in I have to drive it home. So there's definitely risk there.

FIRST THINGS FIRST!
BITCOINS ARE NOT ILLEGAL!!!!
PLEASE REMEMBER THAT!

For all of your bit coin need go to:
WWW.BTCQUICK.COM
WWW.CASHINTOCOINS.COM
WWW.LOCALBITCOINS.COM
WWW.COINBASE.COM
 I just put them in the order in prefer to use them if one is down.

Dont be scared to verify!! BITCOINS ARE 100% LEGAL
I don't know what all they take when it comes to prepaid but here is what I did.
I got a net spend prepaid card  I then set it up with my name an personal info..
I've used that card on every VERIFIED BITCOIN PURCHASE SITE.

I just wanna help u guys get bit coins that's all

And on top of it I'm not gonna lie it really gets on my nerves seeing people get pissy when they've just been ripped off buying money packs or vanilla visas, then FEing them.
I have to assume its either a kids who do this or serious drug addicts that can't get with the program. 
Either way I hope this helps some of you.

1375641346.0,14,self.SilkRoad,1jox05,[Vendor Review and Experience] Aidoneus MDMA Capsules,20,6,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1jox05/vendor_review_and_experience_aidoneus_mdma/,"Holy balls. First experience with MDMA and first purchase off the Silk Road, so I thought I'd share my terrific experience ordering from vendor Aidoneus. Sorry for the long story. Before I had the courage to do *""real drugs""*, I became more comfortable reading about other people's total experiences and now I share mine.

**SHIPPING and PRICING**

Ordered (10) 140mg capsules of Aideoneus's ""84% pure"" MDMA this past Monday at 11:00pm. Package was marked ""In Transit"" on Tuesday and arrived in my mailbox on Thursday afternoon, exactly when expected. Stealth was excellent. My SO and I giggled as we opened the package and were very impressed. Cost was $110 plus $15 for priority shipping with tracking that guarantees a re-ship in case of a delivery problem. Compared to street prices for shitty, cut, and/or fake MDMA in my area ($20/pill), that's a good deal and Aidoneus's reviews and consistently high feedback instill a lot of confidence as a buyer vs. the shady street guys.

**THE TEST and COME-UP**

Marquis reagent test showed deep purplish black results. I later learned that you should perform multiple types of tests on a sample to get an exact confirmation of MDMA. My bad. I'm still learning. We finished dinner, tidied the house, popped 1 pill each (140mg) at 8:15pm and I chilled on the couch and started chatting on [r/microgrowery](http://reddit.com/r/microgrowery) about my recent MJ plant cultivation hobby. At 8:30pm my body feels tingly and I begin to feel distracted from the task on my laptop. 5 minutes later, the come-up fully launches me into the experience and I immediately put the computer down, totally overwhelmed with body high and euphoria. I've never been high like that before and asked my SO to hold me while I crawled into his lap. No negative feelings or scariness, just overwhelming sensation and the need to equilibrate. We decided we wanted room to just lay and spread out, so we moved to the bedroom. Walking there, the wooziness made me feel nauseous and I almost threw up a little in my mouth. Made it to the bed and took a few deep breaths and things were okay again. I'm a 5'7"" 135lb female and 140mg is on the higher end of a ""strong dose"" - maybe next time I'll empty out a tiny bit of powder from my capsule.

**THE EUPHORIC HIGH**

During the peak - [see this chart from Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma_effects.shtml) - I was fucking out of my mind. Every touch, every sensation was dialed up to 100 and I could not get close enough to my SO. The empathy and euphoria were, again, overwhelming. I lost track of time. I was spinning and closing my eyes felt good. We had made a play list, but I don't know that I even heard the music. I remember heat and touch and soft lips and his skin. I have no clue how people go to EDM shows and function IRL on this drug. I was high as fuck and it was delicious.

**THE COME-DOWN**

I'm not sure when it happened, but I suddenly popped up and realized I could see straight and I'd landed back down on the ground. I was still buzzing from the stimulant effect and my SO and I hung out and chatted about what had just happened. We were sad that the swirling euphoria was gone, but had decided earlier that night that we wouldn't re-dose. The remaining several hours felt exactly like when I take adderall recreationally. I'll usually pop half of one of his 30mg tab Rx and be buzzy and chatty for an entire evening and I would compare the MDMA come-down to a reasonable dose of adderall. Around 3:00am we were tired and sleep came naturally. 

**THE NEXT DAY**

Woke up feeling a bit groggy at 10:00am. A little shitty. But after a shower and some cereal, I'm feeling great. Not going to run a marathon today, but I'm not hungover as fuck. We'll probably play video games, mess in the garden, and enjoy a normal lazy Sunday. I'm glad it's not going to wipe out my whole weekend. At the advise of a friend, we took some 5-HTP yesterday afternoon well before rolling. I'm not sure if that helps your body out, but figured it couldn't hurt. 

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

I am terrifically pleased and impressed with Aidoneus's shipping and product. Seems like a stand-up vendor and as a noob drug user at 27 years old with a lot of preconceived fears about exploring that world, that's really important to me. Fast, on-time, stealthy shipping, pure and delightful product, and no terrible hangover.

So I ordered TBF's Northern Lights grow that apparently had seeds in it so a 1/4th was discounted to $70 I think, it was too good a deal to pass up. I ordered Sunday and got a message early Monday saying that it had shipped. It arrived 2 days later on Wednesday, fastest shipping I've seen so far. 

The package and stealth were great, pretty standard it my opinion though; triple vac'ed and I think a little heavy.

NL has a pretty strong musky smell, it's pretty pleasant but can get overpowering for me. It is the classic Indica with a good energy at the start of the high and more of a couch lock feeling at the end. Great for masturbating with. 

I've been getting some great tokes off of it, very clean. I have seen maybe 1 seed in the whole sack, great product.

I see some people on here have had bad experiences with us, but nobody seems to be complaining about the high that we provide :) I only really have 2 things to add to the conversation, the first of which is the issue of the color and consistency of our product. We have been running a huge batch of nice auto-trim for the last three months, but as it turns out, auto-trim is not the best for extraction. The manufacturer of our machines, pointed out that due to auto-trim being of much finer and smaller material than just hand trimmed product, even a single butane pass will cause the oil to come out a lot darker, and with more of an elastic consistency than desired.  We are at the very tail end of our batch of auto-trim and have gone on a special business trip to contact some of the nicest and greatest farmers on the west side, to inspect their product and ensure that they only hand trim everything. We will be changing our listings as soon as we begin processing this new product, and hope that it eliminates the complaints about color or consistency :)

The second problem that we only extremely recently figured out was the issue with ""sizzling"". I have sat with at our machines for several hours, troubleshooting anything I could think of. As I pointed out in a previous post, I'm not currently a smoker, but our main oil guy is or I would have figured this out a lot earlier. The oil that comes directly out of our vac oven has absolutely no sizzle to it, the sizzle comes from our packaging process! Due to the oily nature of our current product, we do all of our weighing and packaging in a freezer, which allows a small amount of water condensation to collect on/in the oil. That water, when smoked, will quickly boil and evaporate, which will cause a bit of sizzle.

In summation, with us changing our base product in the very near future, the color and consistency will be improving, which should also reduce our having to work with the stuff in a freezer, which will eliminate any of the sizzling that everyone seems to be experiencing :) Now if anybody has any complaints about the the high they get from our product, I have no answers for you, since 99.7 percent of our customer base seems to be very happy :)

1372514659.0,13,self.SilkRoad,1hb6ga,Tessellated review and trip report!(WARNING: LONG),21,8,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1hb6ga/tessellated_review_and_trip_reportwarning_long/,"So, I have only made two orders from SR. The first, an eighth of weed, went quite smoothly. So with this new found resource for acquiring otherwise hard to find drugs, I have set out on a quest. I'm gonna try a bunch of things I've always wanted to. LSD is something I've wanted to try for many years, and have never had the chance. It's rare here, and because the connections I do have would be several degrees of separation away from what I consider trustworthy, I avoid drugs that might not be what the dealer says they are. The Road has solved this problem.

I ordered a 5 strip of Tessellated's 200mic LSD late on a Tuesday night. Friday morning, it was still listed as ""processing"". My understanding was that most vendors ship pretty frequently, so I was a bit concerned by this delay. I shot them a message asking if perhaps I had made an error in PGP or something. Within a few hours, he/she sent me a message saying not to worry and my order would ship out before the weekend. And so it did, indeed! 


The package came on Wednesday, and the stealth was excellent. Were I a Canadian resident, I probably would have tossed it. Within the package itself, the product is also not readily visible and I can see why some people are confused by it. 


I waited til Friday night to dose, as it's my night off. A buddy of mine had intended to partake in this journey with me, but he wasn't responding to texts or anything so I decided I'd go in alone. At around 9pm I placed a single tab under my tongue. I left it there for 20 minutes or so, occasionally chewing it. For the next 15 minutes I began to wonder if what I got was bullshit. See, I've never even *seen* blotters in person so I actually didn't know if I was being duped. I now think this may have been the very beginnings of the psychological effects of this particular drug, but I can't be sure. I get a phone call from the friend of mine who was supposed to trip with me, and he's coming to pick me up. For this story, I'll call him Robert. While I wait for Robert, I lay in bed with the lights off. I start noticing that the crack of light from my door is changing colors very slowly. The small LED on the back of my computer, that blinks green, is blinking red and blue and purple. Ah, it must be kicking in. At this point, I believe my roommates are asleep(they are unaware of this whole thing). Robert calls me to tell me him and another friend-let's call him Kenny- have arrived. I get out of bed, and head downstairs with a sense of overwhelming dread. My roommates are awake and watching a movie in the living room. The living room which I must travel through. Shit. Shit shit shit. They're going to know. I manage to get my shoes on and make small talk about the show they're watching, even though the TV appears to be...melting. As I open the door, Kenny and Robert are standing literally right on the other side. They try to come inside. Apparently there was some kind of miscommunication about where all of this would take place. I force them away from the house and into the parking lot. We sit and talk for a little bit about where we'll go and what we plan to do. At this point, my vision is doing weird things. The street lights are bright and the colors of the rainbow separate themselves from each other in the lights. A streetlamp in the distance looks as if it's sucking the light around it *in* as opposed to shining outwards. Very interesting visuals and I'm laughing a lot while cradling my energy drink like a newborn child. I suggest we avoid places like bars and clubs. I don't like them when I'm sober, and they would harsh my experience. We decide to simply drive to a town nearby that has a 24 hour Walmart. Some friends live near there and we can figure out what else to do while on the way.


As we leave my neighborhood, the driver decide it will be funny if he goes at a snails pace and jokes about how fast we're moving. I'm high, not stupid, but the effect messes with my sense of time and space just the same. I have a hard time telling how far objects are, and how fast we are traveling for the whole drive. Everything looks like tilt-shift photography for a while. We're listening to music, which is pretty amazing even though I know it's stuff I normally detest. I think about how there's probably layers of complexity and brilliance that I simply cannot see in this music. For the moment, though, I bob my head and talk about Vikings for a while. Not the sports team, actual Vikings. We're talking about how crazy it is that it used to be normal to simply take from someone what you didn't have. I think about how far we've come, as a species. We used to kill people for food, and now we put men in space.


For a brief period(2-3 minutes, I think, but it's impossible to be sure), my vision is reminiscent of an old comic book. I feel like I'm *in* the movie Sin City. Not incredibly intrusive, but an interesting effect to be certain. Once we arrive at WALLY WALLY WALLY WALLY WALLY WORLD, I'm shocked at just how many people are there. The parking lot is half full, and I start pondering why this might be. Last minute shopping before the weekend? Drunks? Nothing else to do in this town? For that matter, why am *I* here? Oh yes, boredom and they've got toys. I try to go in through the exit because such an arbitrary rule is utterly meaningless at this point. My friend stops me. I walk through the store, appalled at the whole thing. I'm walking much faster than is probably normal, because I'm on a mission. I want to see some TVs. We get to the electronics section and do a small lap around it. Nothing interesting. Wii-U controller is a fucking monstrosity of a thing. I'm not sure if they were messing with me, but my friends disappear. I turn around and they're just gone. I panic a bit as I walk down the main aisle looking for them. There's families here and I suspect they know I'm on something. I keep running into this one family unit consisting of a father and three children. The youngest is the only one who seems to have her wits about her, as the others rush about. Finally, what seems like miles away, I find my friends. They're playing with toy trucks. Grown men, who had only had one or two beers, playing with trucks. I admire their willingness to make asses of themselves and just have fun for a moment when one of them his a button on a toy police car. Sirens. I walk away very quickly because I'm very uncomfortable with this sound. Visually, things are pretty mild while we're there. Lights are bright. I realize though, how depressing this place is and I suggest we leave before I over-think it.


We're going to Ricky's apartment to hang out for a while. Ricky is an old friend and I'm glad to be spending time with him as it's been a while. I'm utterly useless at looking up directions. Who decided I should be navigating? Once we arrive, I cautiously approach Ricky. He looks a lot different. He's been hitting the weights, and it shows. He looks like a badass. Like some kind of redneck hitman or something. Then he sees me and all of that fades and it's just my old friend. As we ascend the stairs to his 4th floor apartment, I get disoriented. All the floors are identical, and every door looks the same. 


Ricky lives with Sanchez and Sanchez's girlfriend, Paula. I don't like Sanchez. He's a very fake person, and he's incredibly lazy. I find both of these traits to be dealbreakers when it comes to making friends. But I'm glad to be amongst people I know. I step onto their balcony and feel the wonderful night air. I stare at the lights on the next street over because they're absolutely beautiful. The trees breathe and the grass crawls. I find none of it particularly unsettling though. We sit and catch up for a while and talk about uninteresting things. My mind is a whirlwind of thoughts and ideas but I keep them to myself because I know I'm tripping and they'll be nonsense to everyone else. Everyone gets pretty drunk. At one point, Kenny and I are leaning on the balcony talking. I say that even an atomic bomb going off in the distance would only be a pretty sight to me. I then realize that if a bomb went off a few miles away, we would see it before the shockwave hit. We could joke ""Hey, remember when that bomb went off?"" within those few seconds before we're all obliterated. Kenny and I have discovered the most perfect possible instance of comedic timing. No one else thinks it's quite as funny, but that's why I love Kenny. A new face has arrived but I pay her no mind. Never met her before, and have no interest in making new friends. I harbor no resentment, but she is an unimportant detail. At one point one of my friends is trying to get me to sleep with her, but I couldn't possibly be more uninterested in such things. I realize that he's doing it to be funny, and I'm a bit offended at this. How would you feel if a man slept with you *as a punchline*? I told him I would leave his children fatherless if he pressed the subject further. I was joking.


Then we notice that the balcony below us is full of people who are talking and having a good time. I make jokes at them that are apparently incredibly funny. Somehow I nail all the right accents and timing for every joke I tell. Am I picking up on the subtleties of humor better because I'm in better touch with my subconscious or am I just high as shit and everyone else is drunk? I assume the latter. There are a few times where the visual effects fade into the background and I just feel *right*. I feel normal. I feel happy. I sort of forget that I'm on acid and I start wondering if I'm coming down. But once I stop talking to people for a moment, or I stop listening to music, it all comes back.


At one point, everyone is inside except me and Kenny. I like this moment. I love this balcony and Kenny is my best friend. We talk about nostalgia and friends. He's concerned a mutual friend of ours is having health problems. I spit some gibberish about how his situation is constantly improving because he's constantly improving or something. It makes sense to us both, though and Kenny is comforted by the idea. I think about how this is how I'd like to spend the rest of my life. Outside, on a beautiful night, with good company. The LSD isn't a necessary part of this equation, but it certainly helps.


At one point I find myself on the balcony alone. Someone said something that was awkward and as a joke I stormed out there to ""rethink my entire life"". But I actually went out there and stayed, which is *even more* awkward. But I had brought an ipod full of music, so I sat and listened to Bolt Thrower and my mind blanked out as I simply enjoyed the music. The moment was broken when Ricky came out for a smoke. We talk for a while about his roommates and how they're behind on rent and stuff. I empathize with him on some level but I mostly wonder why he involves himself with these people. He knew this would happen. Ricky is too nice.


On the way home, things turn back into tilt-shift vision for the ride. I like this. No one talks about anything in particular and I finally get home. I walk my dog and go upstairs. I dick around on reddit for a while when I stumble upon some vimeo channel of a lady who owns a snake. All her videos are of this snake, her kid or her and her husband. Her life is beautiful. I send her a message telling her this in a long ramble that probably makes no sense to anyone who isn't me. As I lay in bed, I think about the night and send texts to Kenny. I thank him for indulging my experience, and tell him he's a good friend. I finally fall asleep around noon. The visual effects stopped at around 10am, and the psychological effects were still happening as I fell asleep. Overall I loved the experience. It puts perspective on things, and I appreciate the people I was with more than I did before.


TL;DR: Good times were had, and if I order LSD again it will be from Tessellated. I'm trying two tabs soon. ",,False,,t5_2sidu,False,,,True,t3_1hb6ga,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1hb6ga/tessellated_review_and_trip_reportwarning_long/,
1372377645.0,13,self.SilkRoad,1h7qhi,Review for remoteKontrol - Great new vendor,23,10,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1h7qhi/review_for_remotekontrol_great_new_vendor/,"I ordered a sampler from RomoteKontrol. It came with 3gs of hash (1g overweight) and 4 tabs of his Blue Shiva LSD.

**Communication: 10/10**

 RomoteKontrol is a really easy-going, laid back guy. When we talked I felt very comfortable in asking about anything I needed to. Although we were not negotiating a full order, I feel that he would be a really easy to deal with vendor in the future.

**Stealth: 10/10**

 The package came in express post. It was well hidden. Everything was as it should be :).

**Shipping time: 10/10**

 It was express post, so it came in within the 2-3 day period. No shipping errors.


**The Hempstar Cheddar Hash:**
 The first thing I noticed about the hempstar cheddar hash was that it looked unusually large for 2gs. When I scaled it up, it came out to a tastey 3 grams. The quality of the hash was just amazing. had a modelling clay consistency and it made for some great bowls. It took a long while to go through even with my 3 friends. Out of all of the three different hashes I've tried from SR, this had to be the best.

**Quality rating: 10/10**


**Blue Shiva LSD:**
 Although this was the first LSD I've had, I've done a fair bit of research on it. I can assure you this is not any of the 25i variants or any other similar substances I've heard of. As RemoteKontrol assured me, this is some strong LSD. My friend and I both took 2 tabs each. I started out by taking one tab. After the first hour, a strong feeling of happiness washed over me. By the second hour, I had yet to see any visuals, so I decided it was a good idea to try a second tab. After another hour It hit me like a sack of bricks. I started to see what seemed to be grafitti covering all of the surfaces of the room, each surface having its own pattern. At that point, I urged my friend to have a second tab as well. As it was the first time trying LSD, I began inspecting every surface of the room. The closer I looked at any surface, the more patterns appeared. Not only was a having intense visuals after another hour, but I had a strong sense of one-ness with the world around me and I had trouble realizing the fact that other people couldn't understand my thoughts. Next, I went on a wonderful walk with my friends through the woods. It felt as though I were in wonderland. Afterward, we continued to drink some delicious Steam Whistle brews. The drunk complimented the LSD very well. Later in the day, we went through the now firefly filled forest. I can't begin to explain the feeling of elation I then felt. After about 14 hours, the effects of the LSD began to subside. We all decided to call it a night. Overall, RemoteKontrol's LSD provided for one of the best nights of my life. I couldn't possibly give it any less than a 10/10.

**Quality Rating: 10/10**

All in all, RemoteKontrol is one of the best vendors I've dealt with to date. He is kind, provides good deals, and has some really good stuff. I hope to deal with him in the future.

Lets jump right into this.


Communication 10/10


Fucking amazing communication. Prompt replies to every single lame question I threw his way. Very prompt. Friendly and cool about everything. Offered tracking number and even checked it for me when I didn't feel comfortable accessing the page out of paranoia. Very awesome guy who knows how to treat customers.


Stealth and Shipping 8/10


He only offers express shipping which is fine but it is slightly overpriced. Just slightly though. This is alright for me but might be a problem for others. Shipping was two days to my location. Stealth was decent. Fairly inconspicous as far as outside apperance. Inside was alright. The only problem I would say is that he didn't even use a vac seal. At least I don't think so. It was sealed in some type of vac bag but wasn't vacced. I've tried 3 H vendors so far and only one has used the preferred and actually effective method of Moisture Barrier Bags. I realize they're slightly expensive but, for client safety and when you're charging what feels like a premium for shipping I believe they should be the standard stealth go-to at this point. Overall on this front it was par for the course and I can't fault him one bit for that.


Quality 9/10


It is a beautiful gram. Fairly large rocks and a pungent vinagar smell. Has a greyish white color to it and the rocks are pretty firm. They don't just crumble up. I'm not sure what that means as far as quality but, I figured I'd mention it. 


The high is great. Nice legs so far and amazing euphoria. I did a fair bit (60-80mgs spaced out over an hour or so. ROA was snooting) and am not nodding yet. I'm enjoying the high a lot though. And the nods might come in a bit because this shit feels like its creeping. In fact I feel them coming on at the edges of my high as I finish review up. (EDIT: a little while after writing this I had a great nod on. This shit was a creeper.)


All that being said subsrgood still has higher quality stuff for the same price. But, he has had a recent policy change. Anyone who isn't in his VIP club or has less than 40 transactions completed is required to finalize early. Now, I know how everyone feels about FE and I couldn't agree more. Its a very justified stance. Though, with subs I have complete trust. I've FE'd twice for him. Once on my first order because of a low transaction number and once to enter the VIP club/help him out because he said he needed it on the forums. Both these times everything still worked out perfectly and subs made sure I was taken care of. In addition to my anecdotal experience there are a lot of oldhead users on the forums that agree that if you're going to FE with anyone it should be subs. 


The thing is subs runs out REAAAALLLY fucking quickly. So if you're uncomfortable FEing or he is out and you can't wait. I honestly believe the only option is to go with GOTSITALL baby. Dude always has his stock ready to go. He is an amazing vendor and great guy and I know I will be back. 


Overall experience was a 9.5/10. gotsitall is my go to guy now.

Between him and subsrgood I don't see why you would go with anyone else. Why get stamps when you can get consistant and high qualith weight from vendors with perfect (100) feedback? It doesn't make sense. Unless you're in a very tight spot can only get stamps with the cash you have. Even then I don't see how its worth it. And this isn't from no experience I've dealt with the stamp dealers both IRL and on the road.


I hope this review was good and helped you guys out. Keep on fighting the good fight. We're gonna win this fucking war bros.

1370232776.0,13,self.SilkRoad,1fk87y,Capsule Corp MDMA Review and Trip Report,23,10,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1fk87y/capsule_corp_mdma_review_and_trip_report/,"I have been hyping Capsule Corp for a few days now. Now that I have time I will tell you why.

I first messaged him about his product and seeing if I could sample it. I purchased a cap of 2cb, and with it he included a cap of 150mg of MDMA and 2 blotters of 25i. (Let me first say I was truly interested in the product, and not trying to get freebies so don't screw them over). I ordered on a Thursday and it arrived the Tuesday after memorial day. 

The stealth was INCREDIBLE. I can not overstate that. I literally laughed when I opened it. I could not see how he did the packing. Literally perfect. That is all I will say. You will not have a problem in this area. 

I went to a friends house after work the next Thursday. We were going to a Borgore/Ookay show. Perfect opportunity to try this stuff. I weighed the pill, and it shows 200mg. I thought to myself this night just got even better. We got to the show around 9:30. I estimate it was around 10 when I took the cap. The come up was longer than I have experienced in the past. I want to say it was roughly 45 minutes. My mouth instantly got super dry, a good sign.

A little background. I have taken good molly many times before. I always get extremely energetic with it. When it first hit me was when Ookay got on stage, perfect timing. His first song was NYG, which I highly recommend you listen to now. The 1200 people at the show all went nuts at the exact same time. It was at this time when I lit the first spliff, which intensified the effects even more. Wave after wave of euphoria and energy kept sweeping over me. I had a blast with everyone around me. I smoked all my ""neighbors out"", shared my vicks, gave hugs, and typical rave stuff. Then all of a sudden I became super chill. It was as if my body was like, ""Nah man, don't move, you're good"". I posted up, put my sunglasses on, and just smiled for what seemed like 30 minutes. I felt like a fucking king while the bass ripped through my soul. I had the MDMA visuals, which was a first for me. Very awesome surprise.

My friend started to get overheated. We got some water and went outside to smoke. We stepped outside and smoked a few cigs while sitting on the curb. I been knowing this guy for 8 years or so, and is my best friend. We had a 20 minute conversation which was excellent. Talked about life, our past hilarious adventures, and stuff. Excellent vibes. We went back inside and continued to dance to Ookay, who played the best set I have ever heard.

I finally met this girl and her friend. She was obviously rolling dick. I blew the vicks in her face, and gave her a vapor rub massage (outside of drugs, this is the best conversation starter gentlemen). We talked some, and ended up dancing. Well, stuff escalated quickly. I will leave it at that, but she turned out to be an awesome person who I am still talking too. Thanks, Capsule Corp Match Making. 

I will keep this part brief, mostly because my memory is super foggy when rolling. Borgore brought down the house as usual. After the concert we ended up at the hotel around 3 am. Checked in, smoked a jay in the bathroom, and I took a shower. Best. Shower. Ever. It was as if little water angels were masturbating on my body. Like I was getting a bukkake from every god humans ever worshiped. Pure bliss. 

After said shower I needed some cigarettes. It was that good. So I went to smoke a few and went back to the hotel. My friend and I turned on the TV, watched it on mute, while talking. Around 4:30 I started to get the energetic nods. I then woke up to my alarm at 9:30 and felt like I slept 12 hours. I was still feeling it, but the afterglow was so pleasant. The entire next day as wonderful. 

TL;DR. Capsule Corp has the best MDMA I ever tried. In fact, it was the best drug experience of my life. Good molly, good friends, and good music. I couldn't ask for a better night.

I haven't used SR but I've been browsing this forum and others and seen the same question asked many times.  
&gt;Should I use a fake name with my postal address?  

To which the answer is usually  

&gt;No, your postal carrier might be suspicious or think it's a wrong address.  Just use your real name and deny if anyone comes around asking questions.  

  
My question is this.  Wouldn't it make sense to get a handful of innocuous things sent to your address in somebody else's name?  Brochures, etc.  So your postal worker sees the name regularly alongside your own (if they even notice names) and assumes there's somebody else living with you.  

This might only be a fraction safer but isn't it worth it to not have your name on a package containing something that you don't want your name attached to?  

Maybe this has been considered before.  Just wondering.  

**Edit:** Actually why not just put your name as ""The Occupier""?  Maybe this varies from country to country but I get junk mail addressed to The Occupier every week.  And I usually throw it out without opening it.  How's that for plausable deniability?

**Jesusofrave:** Always good service, threw in extra tabs all the time, most recent order, got 7 tabs for the price of 5. Discovery of the dosage being less than 100ug really put me off too. Seems like there's better stuff out there in regards to bang for your buck. Another good thing about JOR for me is that was he is UK. Only bought once from him, although got three items from him, two being free samples for reviews. Stealth wasn't great, but it's perfectly fine. Solid trips.

**Fartbomber:** Good service. Had a November sale going last time I bought from him, so I got 5 Marylin (I know it's a typo, it was what it was sold as) Monroe blotters, all allegedly 140ug (which I believe is about right, given the comparisons with JOR, and given it is lab tested). Because of the sale, I got FOUR Shiva (~60ug, pretty common blotter going around) for free. They tasted fucking disgusting, and FartBomber even mentioned that, but that's a lot of acid for free on top of the order. I had no idea the additional four tabs were when I got them, so I PM'd him, and I got a quick response, really good customer service. Bought two times from him. Very solid trips. I did two Marylin + four Shiva one time, and three Marylin the other, and both times were great.

**Lucydrop:** Undoubtedly the cheapest acid vendor out there, and doesn't really sacrifice the quality in doing so. Tabs were advertised at 100ug, and I've read a few reports that they were a tad under 100ug, but it's still very good, given the price and everything. I'm kind of hesitant to use them now, given they now require FE (they didn't when they were just getting started up, when I was using them), although it appears that all orders go over well, for the most part.

**Foxcave:** Best vendor I've dealt with. They sell mainly shrooms, and they were the first, and only vendor I've got shrooms from, however, the package I recieved from them had fantastic stealth, and it was very overweight. I highly recommend them.

It acts as a file server mainly, hosting everything from documents to movies, backups stuff from the workstation and also most of the file archive to a 2nd hdd. Also runs a deluge daemon. It has tor installed running a socks5 proxy. There's a VM with slitaz on the server with host only ethernet and firefox/torbutton/polipo for isolation.

Need some advice on how to proceed...,18,5,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1jxhzf/received_a_package_i_didnt_order_need_some_advice/,"Let me start off by saying I'm not the paranoid type. But there are a few scenarios running through my head and I'd like some advice from you peeps if you have a moment.

So I received a package that I didn't order. It was a product I've ordered once before from this vendor. Any idea why this would happen? I ordered from him about a month ago and haven't had any correspondence since, and suddenly I have this package. I haven't messaged him or anything, as it appears SR is down at the moment.

I'm an honest customer and ideally, I'd like to pay him for it. But there is this thought running through my head that makes me uneasy. I need someone to tell me if I'm being paranoid or if this could be a real possibility. 

Is it possible that the seller was compromised, and had saved my address, and I was sent this package as an attempt to tie my SR account to my real address? Like, if I send him a message and say ""Hey, I received this but didnt order it, blah blah blah"", would that be enough evidence for an investigation? Basically, I'm admitting my SR username and my home address are together, and therefore have purchased illegal substances.

Is that completely far fetched or is it a possibility? I really want to pay for the product, but I don't want this to come back and bite me in the ass. 

So /r/SilkRoad, how would you proceed? Obviously the easiest thing would be to just not do anything and pretend it never happened. But I really don't like receiving free product, as I understand vendors are making a living doing this. I wouldn't want to be giving shit away, ya know?

Thanks for any help you guys provide! 

Edit: I've decided to message the SR admins and let them know exactly what happened. I told them I would proceed however they see fit. Thank you all for your advice. I really appreciate it. Can't be toying around with this stuff.

Business has been going well and I've started to buy out entire growers' harvests. This gives me a little bit more say in what strains are grown. I've talked to a few of them and they like the idea of becoming my ""personal growers"". So, my question to you guys is when they get the seeds/clones for the next cycles, what strains would you want included. I'll try as hard as I can to have them thrown into the next grow. 

Edit:So far I think these look like the top: 

Alaskan Ice, 

GSC, 

Blue Dream, 

Super Lemon Haze(I have lemonhead right now just fyi), 

Sour Diesel, 

Green Crack(which I have right now), 

Durban(I'll have like 20lbs of this is the semi-near future). 

I'm going to try and get all of these strains in some quantity, but definitely won't be able to get a grow for them all.

Thanks,

I scrambled to ordered 4g of his MDMA early Thursday morning when I found out about an unexpected concert. He promised me he could have it at my doorstep by Saturday and he delivered on that promise big time; it was waiting for me when I woke up Saturday morning. It should of actually been here Friday but there was a screw up on USPS side, DoD provided tracking to ease my mind. It came in one big beautiful rock that weighed in heavy at 4.6g. Seriously, can't beat it! Oh and stealth is up there with the best I've seen on the road. 

Now for the quality: I've tried MDMA from A LOT of different vendors on the road, both domestic (USA) and international and DoD's product had me rolling the hardest and longest of any of them and that is no exaggeration. I handed out 150mg doses to anyone who wanted it at the concert and I had multiple people tell me it's the best stuff they've ever had

Now lastly, communication wise, there's no one better than DoD. Once you get to talking to him you quickly realize he's not just talking to you to get your business. He's a genuinely good guy who wants to make his customers happy and delivers on his promise. If you need MDMA quick, he's your guy.

Here's the situation:

Early MONDAY evening , I place an order with a vendor I've used several times, always reliable and very fast, EVERY time. I copied and pasted my PGP'ed address as I'd always done.

By WEDNESDAY, order is still processing. Very unusual for this guy. So I send an email asking if there is a problem. 

I wait another 12 hours, no response. Finally I get an email and the vendor tells me he no longer has access to the old PGP key, he tells me to use the new one on his page. I check his page and copy the key, but don't see any note or anything about it being new. With all that has happened on SR, I'm a little sketched out, but I go ahead and send my address again using the new PGP key. 

I get an email from him a few hours later saying ""cool ok"". So I figure my order will be shipping soon, as this guy has always been quick. 

I wait another full day and it's STILL processing by early afternoon. WTF. So I email him again asking if there's a problem still, also noting he only had 3 items left when I originally ordered and now I'm thinking he's probably sold out anyway or the PGP key is still fucked and he's just too busy to bother emailing me.

Two hours go by and no response. I email again and basically ask him to cancel my order (since I can't because the damn button is greyed out)

Wait ANOTHER day (12 hours) Still processing and no email from Vendor #1.

Finally the cancel key is working, so I say fuck this and cancel my order, free up my bitcoins and I order from another vendor who I've used before who's always super fast. I copy/paste my PGP address etc.

Vendor #2, as always, is on point. He ships the order out within hours. It's ""in transit"" by early afternoon. Vendor #2 emails me and says he got the package out today and enjoy my weekend etc. I email him back thanking him for the quick service.

Now.. 2 hours after that, I FINALLY get an email response from Vendor #1 telling me he shipped my order and he just hasn't had a chance to get to SR to mark it as ""in transit""

FUCK.

So what the fuck do I do. I'm out of bitcoins and I don't have the money to buy more at the moment. Vendor #1 AND Vendor #2 have BOTH shipped and I can only pay one of them.

I emailed Vendor #1 back explaining the situation and telling him I'm not sure what to do, but I want to do the right thing. 

I have a good reputation, always finalize immediately upon receiving my order, I've been flawless with this. This is the first time I've had any problems with SR and I don't want to ruin my reputation or burn either one of these vendors.

I really need advice here. Besides pawning my laptop and TV for Bitcoins to pay Vendor #1 the only other idea I have is to wait nervously in my living room with my AR15 waiting for Vendor #1 to send his henchmen to come and rough me up for 6 bitcoins. I can't send his package back to him, can I?  What other options do I have?

Is there any difference in purity? I found this comment on a forum page and don't know if its total bullshit?
""Pure MDMA powder is white and no other color. Any color in the mix is impurity and nothing else. 

So 125 mg of a brown powder will always be less then 125 mg of the white stuff. Color impurities come from an improper preparation, from a chemist thats IMHO is lazy and more focused on making E and money as fast as possible then making pure powder. 

This comes from the fact that the freebase, before beeing transformed into the salt, is not distilled. For those who know chemistry, a simple Acid/Base extraction is not sufficient even with recrystalization to obtain a totally white product. A Pinkish powder comes from overgassing an impure solution and not recrystalizing it. Dont know about black MDMA but I would be kind of scared to take it. This is trully dirty

Overgassing only applies to unpure solution. Distilling the freebase, which is totally clear before making it into a salt gives a white powder that gives I feel a much cleaner and better buzz. The other advantage is that you know exactly how much u take is pure compared to unpure into which you dont know the exact MDMA content.""

Im a guy, 75kg and took 150mg bombed at 11pm, no redosing, 3rd time rolling, 1.5 months since last roll.

Me and my mate both dropped at 11pm. we'd double wrapped it as it had to survive a trip into town. for ages i didnt really feel anything, even though my mate said he felt it. i was starting to get a little worried, had i been sold methylone or something? surely not...? fucking lol, of course not! mduk, im sorry for doubting you. the slow onset was no doubt caused in part by my stupid double wrapping (which i wont be doing again). 

i started rolling at around 1am, just in time for the main act. I didnt even notice the come up. it crept up on me and next thing i knew i was eyes closed, arm round my buddy and mouth open just like ""oh my god this is insane!"" rolling like a mofo. the difference between the top and bottom of the waves was dramatic and the transitions between them were pretty quick. the tops made the music mind blowingly awesome, the lows were chatty and friendly. dry mouth was only a slight occurrence, never a problem.

unfortunately the place closed at 3 and i was still feeling it big time. we stopped in a couple of shops on the way back to my mates house. the one had a giant cabinet full of cans of drinks. i have never seen anything so beautifully colorful in my life. I walk around the whole shop looking at how amazing all the colours on the food packaging looks.

we get back to my friends house at about 3:30 and sink into the chairs. he was pretty tired, but i was chatty as anything. i got some things i was worried about off my chest; how exams went; what happens now we've finished uni etc. we talk for about an hour until its light outside. he says hes going to bed and i grab my bike to go home. apparently as soon as he was in bed he was asleep, no problems.

At this point im still wide awake. not rolling as such, but feeling great with loads of energy. I decide to ride along the seafront on the way home but then i notice the sun hasnt actually risen yet. change of plan. I instead decide to head up to the top of the local big hill and watch the sunrise seeing as ive never seen one before. I lock my bike at the bottom and head up. I had never realised how beautiful nature was. at this point it struck me why all the 'mericans do this and go on adventures, its freaking sweet! i was a bit cynical whenever someone mentioned rolling and not going to a music venue, but i can see why people do it now. there was hardly any noise apart from the birds and the wind rustling the trees and grass. it was pretty surreal.

I got to the top of the hill and was greeted with the most amazing sight i have ever seen. the colours of the sunrise were unreal. unfortunately im not good enough at writing to describe just how awe inspiring seeing the sunrise was. after doing my own version of double rainbow guy i went and sat on the edge of a field and watched the sun come up. again, i cant describe how amazing that was. 

I finally came down to earth just after 6am. only trouble was i was at the top of a hill 30/40 mins from my house...arse. after an absolute mission down the hill and back to my place i had a quick shower and got to sleep at 7am, no problems.

next day i was tired, but no hangover what so ever. my friend agreed, he even found music sounded really good the next day as well.

mdma, what an experience.

Took one tab at around 10PM. After about 5 minutes psychonaut swallowed the tab.  No numbing of the mouth or bitter/metallic tastes.  
*Peaked at a +++ on the Shulgin Scale.*  
Strong OEVs including breathing walls, vibrant colors, and tracers. 
CEVs 8 hours later.


**Response time**: 10/10. The order was accepted in a couple of hours and shipped out the next day.  
**Shipping**: 10/10. The item arrived in around three days from Germany to the US Eastern Time Zone.  
**Stealth**: 10/10. Vacuum sealed LSD, what more do you want? The label was a printed label.  

**Gripe**: The letter contained in the mailing was in German, when it should be in English if mailed to the USA because the majority of our population speaks English.

I've been on the road for over a year - ""gawker article"" introduced me to it. I used to sell medical grade cannabis, for now it's just MDMA but might consider adding some other ""party packs"" (i.e. GHB, 2CB, anything else that goes well with MDMA).

(i'm sure that's a stupid question but i just wanted to make sure) **this is the last step i want to confirm before i place an order from bitcoins from blue sky traders) 

1a. are blueskytraders still the best BTC vendors? any recent issues with them? I've only heard good things but i know vendors can scam in an instant. Or should i go with coinbase? i'd actually be okay with paying a little more if one of them is more reliable and faster than the other. 

2. i plan on making a sizeable purchase, around $500 worth. is that too much for a first time purchase? i kind of plan it being my first and last purchase so i thought i might as well get it in bulk. 

3. i hear the best MDMA vendor in the US is supertrips stuff through UGS, i checked a post from 12 days ago and everything seemed good but I just want to make sure i'm up to date. Has anyone had any problems with their stuff? i'm looking for the absolute best possible.

4. if i were to order on tuesday, would I be able to receive it in a week? all the reviews say so but i know things change from time to time and the reviews aren't to always be trusted.

I bought from him and eagerly awaited the delivery.

Firstly:
 - Correspondence was excellent. Apart from the Google-translateish English, it was quick and answered all of my questions.
 - Stealth was stellar. Really impressive! I will not write more about it, you will hear similar comments on the forums and here but definitely awesome.
- Product. Yeah keep reading for that one... spoiler: Wonderful.

So TL:dr for every one on Chemical Brothers: Will absolutely recommend 5/5. Really good!

Now for the fun part:

So me and my girlfriend were stoked about this Nintendo thing. We had planned that we would take ½ each on a Friday and stay in. I had some friends over who were just hanging out so this was a new for me. I am not a regular E user, I have only done it with my SO and never in the presence of other people. 

We took the ½ at 9:15 PM. We then started to play some board games all of us (yes, we are that awesome on a Friday night).

At around 9:45 I started to feel the jaw clenching up. Which was quick I thought! My SO didn't feel anything though. 

At 10:10 I was feeling it big time. It was rising and it was rising quick. The board game lost its purpose and we started to feel like maybe we should leave the others alone and spend some quality time with each other.

At 10:45 I felt comfertable enough to take the other ½ (now that we knew it wasn't poison - this however was not wise). So I took my other ½ and she said she was fine with it.

At 11:20 we had the most awesome of times. And then it happened. I sat at the kitchen tables, talking with my friends, and I guess it was starting to get a little too much. Everything started to shift to a more red hue and I felt REALLY hot. Not like you normally do, but really hot (warm). I stood up and felt like I was going to faint, drank some water, and asked about my pulse (really paranoid) and got calmed down and returned to pleasantville McAwesomeland. This entire episode lasted in total of 1 minute. Lesson: don't take two halves of a Nintendo within 2 hours. 

01:30 Time had flew by so fast. My jaw was really clenched. At one point I was actually just talking through my teeth. Sexy time was insane. We are a S/M-couple so that was intense! At this point I started to chew gum. Life saver!

02:45 I don't even know about time at this point. Everything is just swell. My SO took half of her half at this point. 

I don't really have a good trip report so I'm gonna skip ahead:

05:20 - we got to sleep. I had like restless leg thing going on and she suggested we take a walk. I declined and we both fell asleep at around 05:40.

The next day was good. I have taken E less than ten times in my life and I have never felt that day-after-blues. On the contrary I tend to wake up more energized. Maybe it's just the E still affecting but hey, I'm not complaining. 

All in all, I would recommend Nintendo for everyone who are interested in buying ecstasy, and if you are doing it from the Road, I would recommend Chemical Brothers all the way!

TL:dr - Nintendo was intense, at one point too intense but it was all awesome in the end!",,False,,t5_2sidu,False,,,True,t3_19lp24,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/19lp24/nintendo_and_chemical_brothers_review/,

Note: I'm not Jemeson. I was considering buying from gilbertwallmvp until I looked into him a bit more.

Other feedback:
""This dick scammed me for over $500. Package but NO Xanax Powder. Totally and 100% empty. Oh but it sure had a tracking number on it. If he doesn't have Xanax Powder what does he have?

I wouldn't trust this guy with an adderal or a skittle. He's turned a scamming mother fucker. Read up kids. You mess with this dude and he'll have your ass raped in seconds.""

""FE as requested...Communication not strong...did not receive package...Fingers Crossed..""

""I'm very unhappy with this experience. Placed my order, which was placed 27 days ago. Nothing. Contacted gilbertwallmvp, and after several days he finally responded and promised to re send my order. Extended the resolution several times, still nothing. Finally had to request 100% refund. Gilbertwallmvp hasn't responded to me in days. Total waste of time, and in addition to this, now I have a refund in my buyer stats.

Stay far away from this guy if you want to avoid all the hassle. """,,False,,t5_2sidu,False,,,True,t3_19jdlh,http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/19jdlh/vendor_gilbertwallmvp_is_almost_certainly_a/,

Be wary of using MedicalM as a source, he has fairly good reviews however LEO could be looking out for similar styled packages as the one picked up. If you are still willing to procure substances, make sure you use a vendor that implements vacuum sealing in the packaging of your goodies.

It seems Australian customs are cracking down upon SR possibly by way of sniffer dogs or similarity of packages from the vendor, possibly the same as the one used in the most recent bust.
