Hey reddit!

Before we get started, I'd like to thank all of you who have supported OUYA in our Kickstarter drive. You've been phenomenal!

That said: ask me (almost) anything! BTW, [here's proof it's me!](https://twitter.com/playouya/status/230014174481235969)

**I'm creating this post now and will start answering questions at 10 a.m. PT (1 p.m. ET) tomorrow, Wednesday, August 1.**

I'd like to give you all some time to aggregate your favorite questions because, truth be told, I'm SUPER busy talking with developers, publishers, media and the like.

I always thought of Kickstarter like [Kiva](http://www.kiva.org/).  Yeah, you put money into it, and you probably get something back. . . but you didn't put the money into it because of the result you thought you were getting, you put the money into it because *you wanted the recipients of your money to have a chance to try something they could never do without your help*.

We all knew the console space was kindof broken for indie game development.  Xbox seriously screwed the pooch with the XBLA store in favor of courting the big dogs, Sony never gave a shit, and the independent developers had gone to spending all of their effort on mobile and PC games.

I loved the idea of OUYA from the first moment I heard about it, but I didn't think the money I was sending them guaranteed me a working console in March--even though they said that's what they were trying to do.

I feel like **Kickstarter lets us democratize the idea of patronage**--but that doesn't mean the people who run the project I choose to fund are going to get everything just right.

**On Kickstarter, I'm not buying a product, I'm funding an attempt**.

We funded the attempt, and that attempt unleashed a tsunami.  There's a ton of chaos associated with the wave they are trying to ride, and for many of them this is the first attempt they've ever made to do something this big.

I never thought we were buying a polished, perfect console for $100 via kickstarter--**that product doesn't exist yet**. 

The OUYA might turn into that product, but if so it won't be until after the Alpha Testing Phase, which is certainly where we are right now.

What we secured was a shot at riding the wave alongside OUYA.  For the vast majority of us, that means some variation on getting-our-console-before-launch-day (but a bit later than we were hoping).  For a very small percentage of us it might mean a Console lost in shipping, or DOA, or the wrong color of case, or a controller that is nonresponsive.  Some of us will get our console but have hardware problems--a controller with a deadzone or a broken button, for example.

Any time humans do something complicated, not matter what it is (designing software program, creating a supply chain, or assembling a piece of electronics) there is always a risk of error.  And that risk of error is always greatest when the humans are first learning to perform that task.

To the vocal handful of you who have hit turbulence on this wave: I'm sorry.  **It sucks** that your console is (lost in shipping) or (you got the wrong case) or (they forgot two of your controllers) or (etc).  

But remember: your money didn't just go to pay for your product.  It was also a tiny angel investment, and without the money all of us gambled, OUYA could never have come into being.

So from someone who did get their OUYA just a couple of days ago, and who knows that it was all of you that helped make it possible: 

**Thank you**.

I'm so sorry you're having trouble, and I hope that when you do get your OUYA, it is everything you dreamed it would be.",,False,self,t5_2uhbj,False,,brown,True,t3_1ga4wq,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1ga4wq/we_paid_to_ride_the_wave/,

Great games, good hardware, hacker-friendly, all on my big TV.

It turns out, the Ouya is not so hacker-friendly as you may think.

I am a device maintainer for an aftermarket Android ROM, CyanogenMod, you may have heard of it. We work on many many Android devices. Modding, hacking and all around work on making devices awesome.

Of course when I received my Ouya, the first thing I wanted to do was boot a custom kernel on it. This should be no real issue on a 'hackers welcome' device. As it turns out, if you flash something to /dev/block/mmcblk0p2 (aka the by-name LNX partition) where the kernel and ramdisk reside, and this doesn't boot, there is NO way to recover the system.

On Android phones, there is always a key combination (VOL+ and HOME) or something of that nature to boot the device into a recovery mode and fix it. There is no such method on the Ouya. Granted it doesn't have any volume keys or anything on it, but you'd think they'd have put some sort of USB keyboard combination or SOMETHING in that would allow you to recover a non-booting system. Especially on a device that comes pre-rooted and has ALWAYS been advertised as hacker-friendly.

A few links with some useful information regarding this issue:

Notice on the first link, about 3/4 of the way down the second page, apparently I'm considered not 'qualified' to 'hack' my device. I'll let you be the judge of how qualified I am for this, but to me it sounds like the Ouya staff trying to justify a clear oversight.

We need Ouya to do something here. With custom kernels and roms we can unlock the full potential of this device. We can run things such as vanilla linux, CyanogenMod, and all sorts of other good things on here, which is what this device was intended to do from the beginning.",,False,self,t5_2uhbj,False,,green,True,t3_1gk0km,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1gk0km/ouya_advertised_as_a_hackers_welcome_device_quite/,

We've refunded you the 3 $100 purchases made in EMUya. PM me if you don't see the refunds show up on your credit card in the next 48 hours.

So far it seems only media/industry professionals have reported receiving any tracking information.

We were told we would receive them around the 28th of march, but that was switched to ""shipping on"" the 28th. That's well and good, but it appears that they have not actually began shipping although they are for some reasons maintaining the pretense that they are.

/u/zismasterflex was the 27th backer and has still received nothing (I'll be willing to bet if he is referenced enough times he will mysteriously get an update that his console has shipped).

Ouya is literally refusing to address the question of how many are shipping per day. As just one example see this thread: [link](http://forums.ouya.tv/discussion/1112/can-we-please-get-official-word-re-shipping)

There is a reality here, which is unless we bring this to public attention Ouya is going to keep brushing concerns aside. Yes, I know it's been less than a week, but it has been less than a week full of deception by appearances, and I don't like the lack of fullfilling *any* of their side of the kickstarter understanding.

I humbly submit that we should upvote this post to bring it to fuller attention, and reinforce and post requests for a quantity of units shipped per day and how they are being shipped, because unless we hold some feet to the fire, they will continue to discount us.

I would even go so far as to begin contacting the gaming media individuals (email, twitter, comments, whatever) to raise awareness about this. We deserve an answer that isn't vague and deceptive, it's not unreasonable in exchange for 8.5 million dollars.

(xpost from r/games),156,33,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1h3twd/an_honest_review_of_the_ouya_from_someone_that/,"I bought an Ouya, second hand from someone that was a backer. I paid $100 for the Ouya, everything that originally came with it, and an extra controller. The guy I bought it from mentioned that he just didn't have enough time to use it and hoped I would get good use out of it. He was friendly and offered some help if I needed it while setting it up.
I took the Ouya home and set it up. 

Setup was really easy. Plug in an HDMI cord, plug in the power cord. Follow the onscreen instructions and you're done. I googled how to install XBMC on the box and had it installed 15 minutes later. I also downloaded a couple emulators and had roms up and running in no time, along with a couple other Ouya games (mainly Bombsquad).
XBMC runs flawlessly for me, over Wifi, in my bedroom. The menus are quick (much faster than my Raspberry Pi that I use in the main room.), videos start right up, and everything just works. 

As I mentioned, I also have a Raspberry Pi with XBMC. Videos that are choppy on my Pi run smooth on my Ouya (these are mainly large files with 3D, or with surround sound. My Pi is hooked up with ethernet, my Ouya with wireless n).

Games have been great. No lag, and my girlfriend has loved playing Bombsquad and other classic games. She also loves that she can use the controller and navigate through XBMC a lot easier than she was able to with my Pi. That's where the key difference lies between the Pi and the Ouya. The Ouya is easy enough that anyone can use it to do whatever they want. The Pi just isn't. I would have to have separate SD cards or partitions to get the same type of functionality on my Pi that I get with my Ouya, combined with a wireless dongle, bluetooth dongle for PS3 controller, case, and SD cards, which in total would end up costing about as much as the Ouya does anyways. Setting up and using a Pi isn't for everyone as well and can even be a headache for those who know what they are doing.

Now for the hype. If you honestly believed this would compete with the Xbox 360 and PS3, as compared to competing against the Pi and other boxes like Apple TV, Roku, Google TV, then you shouldn't be allowed to make your own purchases. People hyped this up way beyond what the kickstarter claims are. Read the kickstarter again and you will see that the only mentions about AAA gaming are that Ouya could possibly change how people make games by getting rid of publishers and licenses. There isn't anything in there that says you will get the comparable performance of a current gen system.

Compared to other boxes, like the ones I mentioned before, Ouya is the clear winner. I've found it to do everything and more than what those other boxes do, and all for the same price. So lets stop with the blind hate towards something most of us don't even own or seem to understand.

It is exactly as expected. There're some pretty minor warts on the ui still, which will obviously begin to melt away as time goes on. It's small, fast, easy to set up. The game selection is pretty good so far. The emulators work well. The controller is decent. It's a capable media center. It arrived late, like most Kickstarter stuff. It was $99.

To hear everyone talk, I was expecting something resembling an atari 2600 that was going to belch noxious green failure fumes as soon as I unboxed it and then reach into my pocket and eat my credit card. What I found instead was exactly what was advertised - a low cost console aimed at indie developers that triples as an emulator box and media center. 

If you expected something other than this, A) no wonder you're disappointed, you had unreasonably high expectations and B) you didn't read what you were pre-ordering, you just wadded up money and threw it at them saying ""THIS BETTER BE WHAT I WANT IT TO BE AND NOT WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS.""",,False,self,t5_2uhbj,1372743044.0,,,True,t3_1hh9j4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1hh9j4/so_uh_what_was_everyone_bitching_about/,

Whether it be on the Android Store, or App Store, or XBIG/XBLA, or PSN, or Steam, and what have you; games get popular and they get featured.

You see this, and take interest in said popular and featured games. You buy one, you enjoy it. That's cool.

After you've had your fun, you go back into the store, and what do you see featured?


The same games you saw before...including the ones you bought...

...hmm...okay..

So here comes my idea.

Games that we purchase off the featured list, no longer show up on the featured lists, and instead the games that would rank under move up one, adding a new game to the bottom of the list.

So if you bought a game ranked #4th in that featured category, it would no longer show up for you. #5th would be the new #4th, #6th would be the new #5th. So on and so forth. That way, unpurchased games get more exposure.

Because if you buy 9 out of the top 10 featured games in the category, there is no reason for you to keep looking at their icons/labels/banners in the store when you're looking for more games, right?

1370015484.0,100,self.ouya,1fer59,Thoughts after a few weeks with the OUYA,119,19,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1fer59/thoughts_after_a_few_weeks_with_the_ouya/,"When I backed the OUYA on Kickstarter, I had no idea what role/purpose the console would fill. Cell phone games on the TV? Meh. A cheap home media center? My PS3 did that fine. An open console with potential for modding and hacking? At $99, I was intrigued enough to buy in. 


With that in mind, I was largely underwhelmed with my OUYA in my first few weeks of use. Although I understood that the console was largely still in a ""beta"" stage, everything felt half-baked. The user interface was laggy, the controller felt unresponsive, and nothing in the app store really caught my attention. I downloaded a few games, such as Cannabalt and BombSquad, but after a few minutes on each game, I was finished. Instead, I found myself installing emulators and loading old N64 and SNES games, essentially turning it into an all-in-one retro gaming system. As much as I enjoyed rediscovering Super Mario World, my PC was always capable of running emulators, and I couldn't see myself powering up the OUYA on even a semi-regular basis to play retro games. I also sideloaded a few video streaming APKs, such as Netflix and HBOGo, but they were both pretty buggy and the video quality was choppy and low quality. In short, after the initial excitement of playing around with the OUYA, it felt like nothing more than the semi-occasional toy. 


Yesterday, however, was the first time that I was really glad I owned an OUYA. I had a few friends over for dinner, and afterwards, as we were sitting in my living room, one of them saw the OUYA and asked about it. I loaded it up and showed them some of the emulators, essentially explaining that it was sort of an all-in-one retro gaming console. I think everyone thought it was sort of cool, but I don't think anyone was interested enough to purchase a console, or even use mine for more than a few minutes. Then I remembered BombSquad, and I casually mentioned that we could all play it together. After fumbling around with the interface for about 10 minutes, I was finally able to get two PS3 controllers, the Ouya Controller, and a wired XBox Controller connected to the OUYA. I still had about 50 minutes left in my free trial, and after about 30 seconds, everybody (including the non-gamers in the group) understood the mechanics and controls of the game. We played co-op and free-for-all, and it was honestly the most fun I've had playing video games in a really long time. On both the PC and PS3, the majority of my games are either single-player, story-driven games, or two player fighting games that most casual players have no interest in. The OUYA was the only console that could accept every single one of my controllers so a large group could immediately jump in and play. (At the time, I wasn't aware that you could also control BombSquad using a remote smartphone app, thus allowing even more players. I think a generic OUYA iPhone/Android app to turn the phone into a controller would be awesome.).


After my trial period was up, everyone agreed that $5 was an absolute bargain for BombSquad. I purchased the game (my first purchase on OUYA) and we played for another hour. As everyone was leaving, the entire mood around the OUYA changed. We are all working professionals and are only able to get together once every few weeks, but we were all talking about getting together for another night of BombSquad. We then wondered what other fun, quick to play multiplayer games were in the OUYA store, and what new ones could be in development.


Last night, my OUYA became my ""BombSquad"" console. It also has the potential to fill a major entertainment hole I didn't even realize was missing. When my friends get together, we almost never play video games, largely because we don't have enough controllers and/or there aren't any fun large-group games. The OUYA, with its ability to connect almost any type of controller (including phones), makes this problem largely irrelevant. With more games delivering an experience like we had last night (a Castle Crashers-like game would be awesome), I can absolutely see the OUYA as my go-to device whenever my friends are around.

Reddit Is Fun: writing this post utilizing blueboard.

Pandora internet radio: keeps playing after I navigate away from the screen. Plays music while I play older games with crappy sound or reddit.

Netflix: double tap at the bottom of the screen with trackpad to pull up menu.

Hulu: Actually I don't know if this is acting perfectly. My wife is the only one who watches Hulu.

And some of the indy games are pretty fun.

I have NES, SNES, N64, Sega and PSOne emulators rolling with a few select favorite games. I'm also rocking XBMC for downloaded movies. But most of all, I'm finding some amazing gems in the Ouya store.

Right now, I'm really digging Nimble Quest. I'm bashing my way through levels, trying to unlock all the characters and collect all the gems before I run headlong into a spider. Paid for it. Same story with Knightmare Tower. Those two games have had my palms sweating in a way that I haven't experienced since my NES days.

And OH MY GOD Towerfall. My brother-in-law came over the other day and we gave it a try for the first time. We were making so much noise in the living room we almost woke up my sleeping 2 year old. That game is out of control fun. I even got my wife involved. And we could all play, because I had a couple extra Xbox 360 controllers. Reminds me of playing all-night sessions of Mario Kart.

I understand that some people don't like Ouya. Or they don't get it. I feel bad that they don't see the value of it. Bue I do. I have to hand it to some of the talented devs that have put some really great titles out there already. I only mentioned a few, but I have about 20 games on my console now I'm very happy with. Hidden in Plain Sight. League of Evil. Dig. Raiden Legacy. Square Off. Mini Squadron (a really fun game from a couple years ago I re-discovered thanks to the Ouya.)

For me, it's much more convenient to play the Ouya, compared to Xbox 360 or even the Wii. After a full day of work, taking care of a toddler and our house, I have maybe 45 minutes to devote to game time. The Ouya fits the bill, and it's a blast.

* New Discover section is LIVE!
 * Layout is changed to better highlight games and allow the user to more easily access them.
 * Tile images now load in more quickly and have better caching.
 * Improved performance and navigation.

* Region Restrictions are now available for Developers.  You can restrict regions for your games through the Dev Portal.  Remember, you are choosing which regions to NOT show in.  Your games show in all regions by default.
* Release Calendar is now available for developers.  Devs can choose to give a release date for their title that will show on ouya.tv for all users to see.  It’s a great way to tell people to look out for your game!
* Fixed issue that could cause input queuing in some games.

&gt; Is Humble Bundle planning on releasing a bundle for the OUYA when it is released? Perhaps as a ""grand opening"" of sorts to promote a indie developer centric console.

I got the following response:

	We’re very interested in the Ouya and hope to be able to support it
	in the future. Our developers are getting their hands on them, but
 	we’re not sure of what timeframe we can begin to see support for
	the device. Stay tuned though!

	Thank you for your support,

	Humble Bundle 


So while we might not see a ""Grand Opening"" bundle, a Humble OUYA Bundle sounds very promising. Thought I'd share, and yes I asked them if it was OK to share. So stay tuned!

While the amount of Ouya gameplay/app footage is small, I think I'd be a good idea to list them in one convenient post. It is also important to note that most of these apps are currently in alpha build stages (or unofficial sideloaded apps) and are not yet completely optimized for the Ouya.

---  

I know it's frustrating when you're waiting to get, or you get your new toy that you've been waiting a lot time for up and running only to find teething issues.   

I know that Ouya's communication and support has been seriously lacking in areas.   

But I also know that no matter what people are saying, and no matter how many websites have reviewed or commented on the Ouya at the stage: **Ouya is not a finished product and certainly isn't claiming to be.**   

We all know that the demand for the hardware and support is *much* greater than they ever anticipated.   

We know that they're operating within a budget which is much smaller than the money available to other game platforms.  

---
I do think it's important that we log any faults and flaws we come across in these early stages, especially if you've paid for something that has broken or lacking features, but it is a BETA product and the first of it's kind, if we don't manage this in some sort of coordinated way - it will only result in bad press for the product we all want to see succeed.   

Ouya doesn't have anything near the lines of defence, mass marketing and corporate funding that other established products have.   

I also understand Ouya hasn't provided us a great way to manage hardware/software issues, and as it prides itself on being an open console, I'd really like to see Ouya adopt a dynamic bug logging and management tool; say for example something similar to [launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/) used by Ubuntu and others for software bugs.  

---

We are all really, *really* excited about this product that has so much potential, we can't wait to get our hands on the thing - but right now, we're only shooting ourselves in the foot and creating an uncoordinated support nightmare for the Ouya team - that may not be our fault and certainly isn't our intension but we are only helping the big competition make out Ouya to seem foolish and unpolished - before it's even released.

---  

Seeing all these individual posts for things like overscan issues, weak wifi, controller lag etc... only points to the fact that we / Ouya needs a wiki of known or suspected issues and what to try before contacting support to get a replacement unit if necessary.  

---

If anyone can think of a bug / fault tracking system that Ouya could use to their benefit - I would suggest discussing it here and writing a proposal to send on to their support / fault management team.

---

how to side load applications on Ouya.

Using the Ouya browser under Make, search google and download ES File Explorer.   This file manager has an excellent feature which turns your ouya into an ftp server.  Install the application and click on remote manager.  This will turn your device into an FTP server with anonymous login ( no user and password )   then using an FTP client on your computer connect to the Ouya IP address and FTP port.   You will then be able to upload IPK files onto your Ouya.   I put my files inside the Downloads folder and then use ESFile manager to open the files and install them on my Ouya.

2.-Youtube for Google TV. 
you can install Youtube by downloading this APK file http://d-h.st/HsD
then using the FTP client upload it to your Ouya and install it. 

3.-Amazon android store.  Download the Amazon app from http://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/get-appstore/android/ref=mas_rw_ldg
and install it via the FTP upload you will then be able to install Android apps on your Ouya. Not all of them work but some do and are useful.

Fine.   
  
You guys actually don't see the big picture? It's shipping, perhaps slightly later than projected but it's on it's way to us as we bitch and moan. Pebble was delayed by months. OUYA? They started shipping at the end of March. More or less when it was projected way back when we first became aware of this hopeful project.   
  
I'm rather dismayed by the seemingly complete reversal of the excitement this little micro console stirred up. Once proud backers now whining and moaning about how you should be getting yours first or that overseeing an assembly line of electronics should be child's play. You'd prefer to moan about that when we've single handedly financed the next big little console that could?   
  
Sit up straight, tuck in your shirt and stop slouching! It's a freaking miracle that we might be ushering the new Nintendo or Sega because our hard earned cash demanded it.  
  
I've said my piece. Downvote me or upvote me. I'll be sitting by my front door eyes glued to the mail slot.

Edit: So it would appear that I stuck my naughty bits in the proverbial hornets' nest so to speak. A lot of arguments on both sides. Transparency from OUYA seems to the the key factor regarding the dissatisfaction. I'll admit it's not ideal, nor perfect, but some people are so up in arms about it, they're making it sound on par with taking the money and running to a non-extraditing country and living like royalty. They *are* communicating. They are giving us updates. Is it perfect? Not really, but for a group of people that simply wanted to try and fund a console not made by Sony, Sega, Nintendo or Microsoft they are doing a rather decent hash of it. If they miss shipping it to me with the projected timeline, I'll be annoyed but just remember this is the first time most of these guys have had to do anything on the hardware/shipping side of things.

It really didn't take as long as I thought it would. Everything is actually pretty easy to setup out of the box. Hopefully someone else will find this summary of value.  

Sideloaded: XBMC, OnLive, and Netflix by putting the .APK files in a dropbox folder from my PC. From the Ouya browser within the Make menu, I went to dropbox.com, logged in to my account, and downloaded the .APK files (this is how I learned how handy the built in touchpad is, moving the little mouse cursor around was a breeze). From the system settings menu I accessed the download folder and proceeded to install the .APKs. It was all really simple.  

I then created a shared folder on my PC w/ a select few movies, connected XBMC to that directory using the IP address and watched Wreck it Ralph. No fuss, no hassle.  

Installed from the store: Mupen64, SuperGNES, Puddle, Final Fantasy III, Bombsquad.  

Played Super Mario World, Chrono Trigger, Diddy Kong Racing, Super Mario 64, Turok: Rage Wars and Perfect Dark.  

The emulators performed better on the Ouya than they did on my PC and my PC is no slouch.  

I'm having an OUYA BBQ and party tonight with a close group of friends so we can try Bombsquad with 8 people. Does anyone have any other recommendations for games that can be found in the OUYA store??  

Thanks for reading, I love my OUYA.

1342111094.0,74,self.ouya,wg5mn,To the people complaining about the hardware specs...,89,15,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/wg5mn/to_the_people_complaining_about_the_hardware_specs/,"... First off, a disclosure: I'm not associated with Ouya in any way.

The whining about the console specs really needs to stop. There are far too many posts stating things like ""put in Tegra 4, 2/4GB DDR3 RAM, and 64GB storage plz"".

Firstly, even though it would be nice, there is no need for 2 to 4GB RAM in a unit of this spec, and it wouldn't be possible to include it without changing the price point or, at the *very* least, affecting the shipping date. To put things into perspective, The PS3 has [256MB of system RAM and 256MB of GPU RAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3_hardware), and the [Xbox 360 has 512MB RAM shared between the CPU **and**﻿ GPU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_hardware).These consoles can render 1080p images and textures perfectly despite having **half** the RAM the OUYA has. Moreover, The hardware spec being used will have been chosen for a reason. If the software developers thought performance would have been an issue, they would have put more RAM on the circuit board.

The 8GB storage space I would certainly agree would be an issue if there was no possibility of expansion, but the Ouya has a USB port, and [Android has supported the use of USB hubs since 2.3.1](http://support.google.com/ics/nexus/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2386439), so any storage issues can  be resolved with equipment that you have lying around (think USB pen drives or external hard drives).

&gt;EDIT: Any discussion about the single USB port is now moot. From Kickstarter:

&gt;""Hey everybody - just wanted to address some of the hardware discussion! Remember we want to pack as much as we can into a tiny package for you, so we're sticking with 1GB RAM out the gate. **In regards to storage - remember we've included multiple USB ports.** You can slap an external HD in there or even a disk drive. We're still hammering out details, just keep in mind that we have to keep costs low and quality high! And (pssst) we're hearing rumors of Ethernet. :)""

&gt;Thanks KoopaKhan for pointing this out!

The most important thing is, the device is $99! if you want something more powerful, go and buy a PC! The Tegra 3 is a very capable SoC, (see [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U2r3yKg0Ng)) and has more than enough grunt to handle some great titles and playback your HD content.

Please keep in mind this is a list from a gamer that likes a challenge in gaming, and looks for unique titles with thought put into them.

***5. Bomb Squad*** http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=C8VcV6CfaJ4 Very fun party game, I thought the graphics were well done, and the game mechanics are very solid.  I still haven't got to test what 8 player is like, and I have my concerns that the OUYA couldn't handle that many players on screen.  I would love to hear from anyone that's tested this.  Right now with 4 players we get some lag spikes although not major.

***4. Hidden in plain sight*** http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=LZuLCtscA68 The inventor of this game is brilliant!  I think the amount you get free in this game is way too much IMO. My favorite game mode is Death Race, I can't stress how awesome this game is.  I don't play to many party games, but as far as the OUYA is concerned this is the best party game on the market right now.

***3.  No Brakes Valet*** http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UyqrbevGg8 Such a simple concept, and simple graphics, but soooo damn fun!!!  This is the reason I got the OUYA, games like this make me really want to support indie devs. We don't have triple A titles on the OUYA, and I don't want them. I want more indie developers to make games like this, simple, fun, and challenging!

***2.The Secret of the Universe Alpha*** http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZJanfHA6ec This game has it all, exploration, boss fights, and puzzles!  I really have enjoyed following the developer on this project.  This game to me says why Indie Developers are just flat out better than your typical triple A team.  Indie developers really care about what they are making because it's their game. This game is a blast to play, and its currently my go to game when I'm bored, and want something that I can settle into for a couple hours with a good challenge. 

***1. Rage Runner*** http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Kyv8lvoLDM&amp;list=PLwDHLBWAilT_6SSTWSGALhIlNfZCheixZ This game is insane, and my number one pick!  Ok so do any of you guys or gals remember a game that blew up called *** The Impossible game***? That's the game I use to rate all other challenging games, and so far  Rage Runner is harder than that.  This is the type of game I live for, so hard that it pisses you off!  I have been following the developers of this title for some time now, and what they have created is just plain epic.  They have made a game that makes you feel like a badass when you beat a level.  I swear to god when I beat level 3 it felt like Christmas to me lol.  Not only is the game ridiculous in difficulty, but it's more than meets the eye.  The level editor is what I have been spending the last few days on.  The controls take some getting used to, but when you use it for long enough it starts to get pretty quick.  I am now constructing a pretty insane level that I later plan to upload to the community server so others can download it. Last thing I love about this game is the High-Score.  I went back to play level 1 again, and ended up getting the top score after about 30 minutes. But I come back 2 hours later, and I'm already knocked off the leader boards.  So far the community is really active, and I'm enjoying the competition factor, it really adds replay ability to the levels.

***Edit:*** ***Also linking their Postmortem write up because its a really good read, the minds of a new devloper***  http://www.hypercanestudios.com/2013/05/rage-runner-postmortem.html

That's my top 5 after the first couple weeks with the OUYA!  This little console has surpassed my expectations, and I hope it stays Indie for life!

***Edit:*** ***Some people requested links to the games so here you go, didnt think this post would be so popular:)***

1365609200.0,76,self.ouya,1c2huj,I see the OUYA in a similar position as the Xbox was in 2000 and here's why.,97,21,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1c2huj/i_see_the_ouya_in_a_similar_position_as_the_xbox/,"Let me preface this bloggy post by saying this: **I have not been this excited over a gaming platform since the release of the original Xbox.**

Since shipments and emails have started rolling out (albeit, *slowly*...) the excitement I've carried for this new console has been growing at a rapid pace. I've been diving into OUYAforum more and more each day, utilizing Twitter much more to stay in touch with the OUYAteam/community members, and tech blogs. 

I've been absolutely blown away by the loyalty many of you carry into this subreddit, the forums, and your own social outlets even in the face of miscues in communication and slipping deadlines. As someone who has worked as an online community manager in the games industry, you have taken it upon yourself to keep engaged with the brand and even provide glimpses of hope and support through tools like [isouyashipping.com](http://www.isouyashipping.com). You guys and gals are incredible. And that's only one reason I'm so excited about the upcoming June launch.

I've been a gamer since 1987, learning at the age of 3 how to run my own Commodore 64 commands to launch games like Test Drive, Superman, and many others. I spent my first paycheck on a Dreamcast. Fast forward into 2005 and I was nominated and awarded the Microsoft Most Valuable Professional Award for Xbox four years consecutively as a founding contributor in the Xbox community. I stopped contributing to their platform when they chose to abandon the community that made them who they were. The things you guys are doing are building potentially one of the greatest communities for gaming that we've ever seen, I firmly believe that.

(/soapbox)

While the OUYA's target market is certainly different than any of the ""big 3"" consoles in homes today, the success path that I'm seeing for OUYA is very similar to the position Microsoft had in 2000, leading up to the launch in 2001. Microsoft had to overcome:

* A supposedly ""saturated market"", populated by the likes of Sony and Nintendo
* A marketplace that didn't understand the need or value for a broadband port
* Giving a new brand a unique identity to drive brand loyalty
* A biased assumption by hardcore gamers that we'd only see PC ports

They overcame each challenge in spades. New franchises were born, communities rallied for something new in what's now the largest entertainment delivery network of all time, they accelerated broadband adoption rates in the early 2000's, and through unique branding etched their own path into the gaming market in a huge way.

I see OUYA's path to be very, very similar. What are the hurdles for OUYA? 

* A brand new concept to gamers, bringing easily accessible games traditionally thought of as ""mobile-only"" to the television.
* Convincing a community, and eventually the public, that this IS an accessible and profitable platform, where it's value only ends in the end-user's creativity limit. 
* Proving that there is room in a crowded gaming space for something unconventional.
* Increasing public awareness through timely responses, community presence, and eventually traditional marketing.

Agree? Disagree? I'm anxious to hear your view. I think all of these hurdles are easily overcome and we'll have one of the strongest online communities yet. I'm just hoping it plays out more like Track and Field, and not QWOP. ;) 

**TL;DR** I think the OUYA is positioned for success by presenting an open platform ready for games and applications as seen fit by you, the awesome OUYA community. Where there have been broad assumptions about the platform, like Xbox in 2000/2001, OUYA is positioning itself to carve its own path for success.

^.

**Terminology:**

**Emulators**: ""Software that duplicates (or emulates) the functions"" of a game system. Often abbreviated Emus.

**ROMs**: ROMs are simply the game's files compacted into one file that the emulator can understand/read. Usually games that cartridge based are ROM files (i.e. N64, SNES, NES...)

**ISO**: Similar to that of ROMs in function but are based on CD games. (i.e. PSX, PS2)

**ZIP/RAR files**: These are compressed files that can be extracted through programs such as WinRar or 7zip. Most emulators are able to play ZIP/RAR files without having to extract themb yourself.

**Save States**: Save states basically allow you to ""save"" the state of the game without having to save in game. This is particularly useful for older games without a saving function.

**Load state**: Function within emulator that allows you to load your save state.

^^.

**Emulators**

Currently, the Ouya has many emulators available for the system.  Here is a comprehensive list of Emulators available for Ouya. http://dayoftheouya.com/a-list-of-all-known-emulators-for-ouya/

These are the best emulators to use for each major system (in my opinion)

**GBC**: GBC.emu -*Works flawlessy*

**GBA**: GBA.emu -*Nearly perfect, only a few lesser known roms don't play well*

**NES**:  NES.emu/EMUya -*Both work well, EMUya has some extra features*

**SNES**: SNES 9X + -*Works with nearly every ROM you throw at it, even starfox!*

**N64**: N64oid (version 2.7) * -*Works extremely well with many ROMs and doesn't have many graphical errors*

**PSX**: ePSXe * /FPse -Both work well, but I've had better luck with ePSXe (FPse currenlty lacks support to read from USB/HDD*

**SEGA GENESIS**: MD.emu -*Works well*

**NEO GEO**:  NEO.emu -*This the go to emulator for neo geo*

**NDS**: DraStic * /NDS4droid - *DraStic is a recent emu that runs at near 100% speeds and completely outperforms NDS4droid. The only thing is that it must be sideloaded white NDS4droid is available in the Ouya store.*

**PSP**: PPSSPP* - *Currently the only PSP for Android. Many games do not run, but it is being worked on.*

^^.

**Note: Emulators with a * must be sideloaded and are not available in the Ouya store**

*p.s. an app called Retroarch is a single app that contains many emulators in it, it can be sideloaded but a bit tricky to configure*

^.

**How to sideload APKs (Android apps) onto the Ouya:** 
.

For this, you may want to seek another guide, such as this one http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2421039,00.asp

^.

**How to get ROMs:**

Now, I can't explicitly say where to get ROMs (due to the legality of it) but I can tell **Emu**lators can be quite difficult to understand, but once you get it up and running, it can be a **paradise**. Do you get **.me**?

^.

**How to play ROMs/ISOs:**

Step  1: Get a USB stick/external harddrive

Step 2: Create a folder on the USB/HDD, place your ROM files here

Step 3: Connect USB/HDD

Step 4: Open up Emulator, click load game

Step 5: You should be presented with an in-app file manager, go back to your root directory

Step 6: go to your /usbdrive folder, this is the location of your USB/HDD

Step 7: Select the ROM file you wish to play

Step 8: Thats it!

^.

**Legality of emulation:**

This is often a gray area for emulation. Emulators themselves are not illegal, that is how they are able to exist in the Ouya store. ROMs and ISOs however, are technically illegal if you download them. They are only legal under the circumstance that you backed up your own games to your computer. If you feel strongly against piracy, then emulation is probably not for you. I will say that it is highly improbable that you would get in trouble for downloading ROM files. Use common sense and you should be fine.

^.

**FAQs:**

Q: *""I can't find my USB/HDD ! Where is it?""*

A: **Did you locate the /usbdrive folder? This is where your files should be. If nothing is there, you may want to reformat your drive and try again. The worst case scenario is your Ouya's usb port is broken.**

^.

Q:*""Help! I've run out buttons to map for X emulator! What do?""

A: **Since Ouya doesn't have start and select buttons, you have to use a work around for it. Personally, I've found that using L3/R3 for select/start usually work well since most games don't use them.**  

^.

Q: *"" Hey! X game doesn't work with Y emulator! what gives?""

A: **Well some emulators aren't perfect and because of that, some ROMs cant be played or have some other bug or graphical issue. You can try another emulator in this case.**

or:

**Sometimes it might be a bad rom you downloaded so you may want to try from another source. The emulator might not be able to read compressed files so if it is a RAR file, try extracting first on your PC**.

^.

Q:*""Multiplayer isn't working, how do I fix this?""*

A: **This is usually a result of the Ouya and emulator not reading controllers properly.  I can't really say much on this issue except either contact the dev or try another controller.** 

^.

So there you have it. You know basically what you need to know to get started. If I missed anything, let me know!

http://bhspitmonkey.github.io/VuDo-Android/

(VuDo, pronounced like ""Voodoo""!)

Basically, there's a receiver app you install on the OUYA, and a sender app you install on your phones/tablets.  The Send app adds a new action to your ""Share via"" dialogs (the one you see when you share the current web page you're on, or a link to a video, etc.), which forwards the content over the LAN to any Receivers that are running.  The content will launch instantly on the OUYA if it's running.

**Important notes:**

* You'll need to reboot the OUYA after you install the Receiver APK in order for it to begin listening.
* Sometimes it doesn't send the first time, and you have to re-share one or two more times before it will work. That's a known issue. It's alpha software, after all!

Sharing links from Browser/Chrome, YouTube, Reddit apps, etc. all seem to work great.  For best results with YouTube links, I recommend installing the YouTube Google TV app on your OUYA.

&gt;That doesn't mean that we're shooting the idea down, you need to keep in mind that in terms of priorities this is way down the list as you'd expect from any feature where it's being requested by less than one tenth of one percent of the user-base.

1363207751.0,69,self.ouya,1a8mz4,The Ouya-hate phenomenon: one theory.,82,13,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1a8mz4/the_ouyahate_phenomenon_one_theory/,"If you've visited the comments on any recent Ouya story at a major tech site like The Verge or Engadget, you've probably seen rivers of unbridled hate spewing from commenters. I'm no Ouya evangelist, but I thought the console seemed like a good idea, and I'm eager to see how it turns out. 

Even if I wasn't very interested, though, why would anyone comment on every Ouya story just to spew anger about (a) how it won't compare favorably to existing consoles, (b) how it will supposedly just put phone games on a much-too-big TV, or (c) how all kickstarter projects are scams? Those are the themes I've seen in the negative comments, anyway.

My theory depends on what attracted me to the Ouya in the first place: I'm not a console gamer. I loved what the iphone and Android markets did for indie developers and big game studios alike: the incentive to make smaller, more casual, easily accessible games, and sell them for a few bucks with no distribution costs. I have no desire or intention to ever buy some huge, $69 game from EA and play through it continuously for weeks. I have a job, I have a family, I have little free time.

So the biggest criticisms I see in comments are from gamers comparing Ouya to the Xbox or PS3. If you're doing that, you've already missed the point. Android and the iphone brought millions of people to gaming who previously had little or no interest in it. That's the promise of Ouya, but for the living room instead of the phone. Small-scale, casual, inexpensive, indie, accessible, games that you can now play on the big screen. I don't think the games will be the same as those on Android phones, but I think they'll bear more resemblance to those than they do to Madden or CoD. 

This low-barrier-to-entry gaming is a whole different ball game than contemporary consoles. *Of course* the games won't look as good as next-gen consoles or even some current-gen. *Of course* they won't be as big in scale. But that's because Ouya is inexpensive and wide open: its the advantage, not the weakness -- this is a different market, and one that Microsoft and Sony aren't catering to. No one is, really.

So basically, I think the Ouya-hate is the result of the demographic commenting on tech/gaming articles: young men with a lot of time on their hands, and who already own and enjoy a mainstream console. These were never going to be the target market, but I'm afraid they've cast a negative shadow over the console's release, because they're so vocal and visible, and they influence tech journalists as well.

tl;dr Ouya has received disproportionate criticism among commenters on tech sites because they're mistakenly comparing it to existing console gaming, rather than the new niche that it's seeking to fill.",,False,self,t5_2uhbj,1363208641.0,,,True,t3_1a8mz4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1a8mz4/the_ouyahate_phenomenon_one_theory/,

#1 Someone posted that they had proven the user's Onlive footage was ripped from another video. The user has since taken off that video though.

#2 They recently posted a fake video of Ouya playing Shadowgun. Noticing touch sprites on the footage didn't settle well with me, and hearing #1 I decided to look into it. I found the video he ripped it from! Here's his fake [footage](http://youtu.be/qP1Xq-1eQO4), and here's the [video](http://youtu.be/4Ol1Y_zI3HI) he ripped from.

Like many people I was disappointed with that news because it looked like a fun game. But some time ago I decided to give it a try anyway, because hey, Portal was 2 hours long and it was the best thing ever.


I gotta say I was pleasantly suprised with this game. First of all, yeah if you are going for casual run it will take you 2-3 hours to complete it. But it quickly becomes obvious that this game was not build for runs like that. There are plenty of bonus treasure chests containing collectible cards, and there is additional ""pros only"" dungeon that is hard as nails, and it will require you to pull off all kinds of crazy tricks with your items that often feels like sequence-breaking. Needles to say it took me **6 hours and 33 minutes** to reach 100% completion.


Still not enough? Okay here is another fun thing. Out of 3 puzzle-solving items available in this game you only need 2 to complete the game. Any two (game even keeps best times for each combination of items). Also the dungeons are designed that way, that you can get these items in any order you want. And when you have less items available to you, you realize you have to find alternate ways to solve puzzles that previously you saw as trivial, or find completely different way to progress further.


There are also ""pro shortcuts"" that allows you to skip straight to the dungeon boss, but you gotta solve some pretty complicated puzzle first.


Sure you can forget all that, and just beat the game getting all 3 items, ignore all the alternative ways and puzzles, and that's it, but in the long run it feel like using a warp whistle in SMB3 - it just cheats you out of gameplay. Ittle Dew is a puzzle game at heart, and each absurdly hard puzzle solved without using FAQs gives you immense sense of satisfaction, so why wouldn't you want to solve them all?


Now let's come back to the numbers. One 100% run + three 2-items runs (all possible combinations) took me of total **10 hours 8 minutes**. I think it's not bad, considering most AAA games nowadays take about 8 hours.


So in conclusion - if you are completion freak like I am, and you like puzzle games, give this game a chance.

I thought to myself ""this is interesting"". Opened it and it was a gif of an unboxing and set up where the WiFi doesn't work and he throws in the trash, it was done in a funny way

The gif in my mind was not that damaging, what was in my opinion was the comments

http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fvhkg/ouya_unboxing

I can't link to individual posts as I am on my phone but it got torn apart. One of the top posts is about frame rate issues. It had hundreds of up votes. 

The general hive mind consensus was the ouya was a flop and did not live up to hype.

The same way the ouya kick starter was so successful because the community bought into it , it's success also depends on the community. 

It does not have the money to put adverts on prime time to hit the masses, in my opinion it needs word of mouth to survive.

Now millions of people who hit the front page of reddit potentially have the impression that the console is a flop. It takes alot of effort to build a good reputation, it takes seconds to lose it.

This was cemented for me when I was talking to someone in work about the game I'm developing for ouya and the ouya in general, and he responded ""does it not suffer from rate issues?” 

This guy is the ouyas target market, he would have no problem buying a ouya(even expressed interest in buying one previously), he would have no problem buying games and in app purchases.

But now he has the impression that it has major issues.

I don't know if team ouya are worried about the impact of the post and comments, but if I them, I certainly would be.

I hope I'm wrong, but I think this is the biggest set back I've seen with the ouya, and I think it will have lasting effect on how the console does.

It got me thinking.

*""Ouya is NOT a normal console!""*
*""It claims to be a console, but not one that we're thinking of.""*
*""One of the big points of Ouya, is to shake up the gaming industry with something extremely different and accessable for users and devs alike.""*


Think about it guys.

It's a console that uses hardware only found in the ***Mobile Device*** market. It's hardware is in a completely different league in comparison to the 360/PS3/Wii/PC. The most common comparison with Ouya is typically with *Cellphones* and *Tabelts*.

But even still, through all that, it's clearly defined as a console. It acts like a console, it looks like a console. Well, at least for the most part.

To put it simply, it is not like any other console that comes to mind when someone says to us, ""Video Game Console.""

I should be speaking for myself, but I feel that it's a safe assumption that a majority of the public thinks 360/PS3/Wii when people say, ""Console"" or ""Video Game Console""

More and more of us are starting to include the Ouya within that list, but at the same time, we know Ouya is not like the other consoles. It's different.


***IT'S ITS OWN THING.***

It has the brains and organs of mobile devices, but the heart of a console.


Julie herself even stated that Ouya is NOT trying to compete with the big 3, but rather carve out it's own niche while giving indie devs an easy easy platform to make games for.

It's unique, in the sense of that it is a hybrid of things we have in our everyday life, allowing it to have it's own identity.

It's not enough to be considered a console like the big 3, but it's more than enough to seperate itself from mobile devices. So I feel that we should stop holding Ouya up to the standards of traditional consoles or mobile devices, and look at it as a completely different type of console.


A Mini-Console.
A Micro-Console.
Something.

Where the hardware is in a completely different league. Where the software is different. Where it's purpose is not exactly the same as everyone elses, or the same as what you expect.


I'm not using this as an excuse to forgive choices made by the Ouya Team, but rather we should look at our standards and shift them appropriately to better fit what Ouya is trying to be.

It's *OWN* thing.

In android development, you can code your apps and then eventually you compile your work to test it out. In my case, I do so many times a minute. Now you have to decide what to test your app on. Either a device or an emulator. Now an emulator in principle would be much easier as it allows you to be able to test it out on your screen by seeing a large emulator. However in practise the emulators are just too slow. I would be lucky to get a frame per second. Therefore I have always compiled to my mobile phone which allows much faster framerate and more realistic feel. However you have to use a small phone screen, its fiddly and a strain on the eyes after many hours of work. Also this has ruined many of my phones due to the constant high strain on the phone. However the ouya is fantastic for developing. It allows a full HD screen emulation of my work.. 1080p! I cant stress how nice it is to be able to use a full screen to debug. The device copes well with the high strains of work and allows me to be developing what runs like a top range phone. For the price, it is absolutely awesome. I would have to spend hundreds in order to buy a device of these specs. My productivity has literally tripled. However I must make clear, this is brilliant for any android development, not just ouya.

The main reason that I hacked the living crap out of my Nintendo Wii was to play games from other regions with it - something that the Wii's hardware would of course support without a problem, but that I was blocked from due to the typical ""region lock"".

You cannot play American games on a European console unless you hack it. Even the downloadable Super Mario RPG refused to work on a PAL television and tried to play in NTSC color mode (aka black and white), before I forced it into PAL mode (which it of course supported) via some homebrew application known as the Priiloader. And on the Nintendo 3DS, I cannot even use Download Play to play Mario Kart on two systems if one is American and one is European due to these restrictions.

And how is Ouya, the ""open"" gaming platform going to change it? Not at all, apparently it has the potential to become even worse. For if a game is distributed by disc, you can go and get the American disc on eBay and play it on the European system anyway, provided you hacked your way into it. But if it's a digital download with DRM, you cannot even do that.

From the [Kickstarter FAQ](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ouya/ouya-a-new-kind-of-video-game-console):
""Lastly, some developers might choose to only publish in some countries, but that's their choice – not ours.""

Is that all you got? Is that the homebrew revolution? Are we going to see games released in different regions with release dates that are months apart (hello Nintendo), with an incompatible online mode across regions (à la StarCraft 2) and with games not available in some countries at all? 

If [Good Old Games](http://www.gog.com/) can force companies like Ubisoft and Electronic Arts to release all of their games either internationally, or not at all on their system, why can't Ouya require the same thing?

I am explicitly **not** talking about the extra services that the Ouya will have or might have (OnLive, Vevo, Netflix, etc.), just about the regular games.",,False,self,t5_2uhbj,False,,,True,t3_y3by1,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/y3by1/say_no_to_region_lock/,

For that to work, there are no prices on the OUYA store, otherwise people might judge the game based on that, rather than the actual content of the game

However, for many of the games, it is not necessarily clear what the price is until the player is suddenly confronted with a message asking them to pay to continue. This has two problems

Firstly, it gives the player the feeling they’ve been suckered into a game that while they enjoy, is not worth the (large) price now being asked for it.

Secondly, it pulls the player out of their immersion in the game, suddenly bringing the player back to the financial concerns of the real world that they may well have been seeking to escape through gaming


Unfortunately, there are no easy solutions. The “products” that game developers sell through IAP (in-app purchase) in their games are not linked to any one particular game. Furthermore, even for a simple demo + unlock full game type monetisation model, there may be multiple products. My own game has “Full price” and “20% Early discount”. Some games may even mix monetisation models, having individual items or levels unlockable, in addition to having one purchase to unlock everything. So there is no way for the store to automatically pick these things up.

Another option might be to have developers specify from a list of timed demo, free to play, donation etc, that then gets displayed on the store. However, putting the onus on game developers is what happens with the current system, where clearly some developers aren’t being as up front as consumers might like them to be about pricing. It may also introduce bias against particular monetisation models, which again mean people are judging a game before they’ve played it

My personal hope is that developers will recognise that sales are hurt for everyone when not being transparent with game prices, and that consumers will vote with their wallets to encourage good behaviour. OUYA is in many ways breaking new ground, and as the platform matures, we’ll see whether this particular experiment works out

The selection on the store is limited at the moment so why not test out some unofficial apps?

Here is how I sideload apps, there are many ways to do this but to me this is the easiest.

First on your home computer go to the website www.dropbox.com and create an account. its a cloud storage site. When you have your account then upload your apk to your folder online.

Then on your Ouya go to the web browser and go to dropbox.com and sign in. click the apk and it will download. The download folder is hidden on Ouya. Navigate to manage-advanced-settings-storage-then click downloads and then the apk it should install.

I would suggest getting es file explorer apk and installing that first so you have easy access to the file structure.

Then sideload the dropbox apk and you will have easy access to your cloud storage on your Ouya.

Then I would download Nova Launcher, it is much faster than the current Ouya UI and better organized with more options.

It is also a quick, useful check for game developers to see how their game’s popularity is progressing

Conversely, there are legitimate reasons for wanting to indicate dissatisfaction with a game. Shoddy ports with poor controls or games with shady in-app purchasing practices might warrant a “downvote”.

However, including such an option wouldn’t be as straight forward as it might first appear.

Firstly it creates a general air of negativity. People are looking for reasons to downvote, to find reasons to dislike a game. At the moment, if you don’t like a game, you move on, rather than dwelling on the bad.

There are also no disincentives for people downvoting. The process is anonymous and there is little to stop trolling or personal vendettas. Even just being in a bad mood or something beyond the developer’s control, such as input lag or slow internet may cause a downvote.

More generally, there is no way to determine the reason for a downvote. Everyone is downvoting for different reasons and have different thresholds before they downvote a game. Some people might downvote anything they even vaguely don’t like the look of, while others may only downvote a game if it is really bad. Downvotes might result from a specific bug that has long ago been fixed

There are two underlying problems; one of quality and standards and one of connecting the right game with the player who will enjoy it. OUYA will be adding tools to help both these issues as the system matures, and it may be the downvote option can later on be a part of that balanced system. But for now, the downvote button is at best, a crude implement, and at worst, actively unhelpful.

The problem is that anything which is not graced by OUYA falls under the nondescript ""Sandbox"" category, which is an unsorted list of games with no way to sort by genre, tag, type, developer, etc. To look for non-featured games, you just have to blindly browse an enormous and ever-growing list of games without any way to filter out types of games you're not interested in, or narrow it down to genres you're looking for.

There are two levels of shutdown for the Ouya: ""soft"" shutdown and ""hard"" shutdown. A ""soft"" shutdown (ie. standby) can be achieved by pressing Y at the main menu and selecting the option to shut down the console. (Same goes for those of you using the BAXY launcher on a rooted Ouya.) This puts the Ouya into a low-power state but does not fully shut down the console (so it appears to have an instantaneous startup).

A ""hard"" shutdown can be achieved by pressing and holding the power button on the console for a few seconds, then selecting ""Yes"" (or whatever it is) when the little ""Do you want to shut down?"" window appears. This powers the device down fully.

You can also simply press and hold the power button until it shuts off, but as with every other electronic device *that is not recommended* because there are cleanup tasks performed at shutdown that don't happen if you force it to shut down.

tl;dr: Stop telling people to unplug their unit or hold the power button to force a shutdown.

This is it.,97,46,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1ilxsl/truly_dissapointed_as_an_ouya_backer_so_i_sent_an/,"First of all, I just want to say this is not a rant. I don't want the company to fail as I've read around, nor anything like it. I just wanted to share the email I sent, as I got really dissapointed at how we stand as backers.
---------------

Hello, my name is Federico and I'm one of the Kickstarter Backers for the OUYA (order 23023), from Montevideo, Uruguay.

I was one of the early backers for the OUYA, pledging on the second day after the project started on Kickstarter. I understand pledging on a project from Kickstarter implies trusting in the project managers and standing by their side when there might be complications in completing it, or when unforseeables make things run more slowly than expected. I think knowing you stood by the project throughout it's creation is one of the few rewards one gets when pledging the money up front. It's probably why most of us do it, and sometimes see some extra rewards for standing by the project for so long, making us stand out from the regular end-of-the-line customers. 

As far as the OUYA goes, there was only one extra reward for pledging our money up front nearly an year earlier. We didn't get a discount, we didn't get any extras: All we were promised was to get our consoles before it hit the shelfs. And we were happy about that. We didn't need, and we didn't ask for anything else. However, three weeks after the OUYA hitting shelves everywhere, I feel we have been neglected as backers. There was no delay on getting the OUYAs to sellers, and many people who did not back the project, who didn't pledge their money up front, who didn't risk anything to help make the project alive and better, even knowing there could be risks to it, they can all get them, for the same price, and almost instantly. I understand there's a company that needs running, but from what we had read and heard from you throughout the project and this years that we've waited anxiously for the console, I think most of us backers were hoping that the team's efforts where more concentrated to getting everything as it should be to the people who stood by you from day one. Instead, we got almost no feedback, no solutions, and, three weeks after the OUYA being available to the general public, still no consoles.

In my case, as I said before, I backed the project on the second day it was live on KS. As consoles were being shipped, and the fulfillment graph you guys posted got near to 100%, I started getting worried at why I hand't heard a thing about mine. But, I live in Uruguay, and I know being an international backer is sometimes (though not always) a bit harder, so I waited. But the updates said all consoles were shipped, and I heard nothing. The countdown to the official release was every day closer, and I heard nothing. That's when a friend (here in Uruguay too, and who's in the exact same situation as me) told me, apparently, there were lots of backers who, a couple days before the release, knew nothing of their OUYAs. But, we waited. Finally, 4 days before hitting the shelves, I get an email saying ""my OUYA is on the move"", giving me a tracking # and telling me to expect it between June 25th (release date for the OUYA) and July 15th (way past release date). So ok, I'm not happy about that, considering most people will buy theirs probably before me, but still, I say nothing. At least it's coming, and maybe I just have to wait a bit more because I live all the way down in South America. The tracking number, of course, says nothing.

Now the day before release, I get an email giving me a second link to try the tracking number against. Great! Maybe that was it, maybe my OUYA is on it's way and it's just that the link wasn't working. But no, the new link still says nothing. And June 25th comes, and the OUYA hits the shelves everywhere. Now everyone can buy one, no delay at all, same price as I did, but not having to pay it one year in advance. And my tracking number still says nothing. BestBuy has it (we don't get that here, but apparently it's a big deal in USA), Amazon even has it at $99. I go check it out, and well... at least Amazon isn't shipping OUYAs to Uruguay, so I stand down, thinking at least I'm getting it the only way I know it's shipped here. 

Days go by, and finally, the tracking number shows something. Apparently, it was dispatched in HK the 25th. Now that's a bummer, but maybe shipping is fast and I'll get it here in a week or so. But no. Three more weeks go by, where I check the tracking number every few days, and the package is still sitting in Hong Kong. As I write this email, on July 18th, the expected time range to get my OUYA has flown past, and OUYA has been in shelves for more than three weeks, and my package is still sitting in Hong Kong. DHL Uruguay hasn't even heard a thing about that package.

Worst thing is, as of a couple days ago (at the least), Amazon is now shipping OUYAs to Uruguay, at nearly the same price as I paid when backing through KS, and promising to deliver it within three days. Three days. That's an awful little amount of time, when I've waited three weeks for the package to move from Hong Kong. And I know Amazon can deliver. They've brought me a Kindle down to Uruguay in just 2 days, so they can deliver what they promise. What's even more, they're shipping through Express Mail (which, of course, you are not), which means that when the OUYA arrives, it falls into a decree whereby I haven't got to pay taxes for it. Meanwhile, the package I'm expecting from you, being over $100 in cost and not coming through EMS, has to pay at least $80 in taxes, plus broker fees (nearly an additional $100). Now, I had made my peace with having to pay all that, because I was getting my OUYA early. And one of the first. And there was no other way of getting it. But now, knowing Amazon can bring it in under a week, no taxes, and at the same price, I'm not willing to pay for that anymore.

I am truly, very truly, dissappointed. I'm not mad, I don't wish the company to go broke (as I've read on reddit and such). I am just so very dissappointed. I feel completely let down, which makes it even a harder blow, considering all the faith I had put on you guys when you kept telling us, again and again, how we backers were your priority. Now I feel like you've let us aside, and just focused on selling the ouya to everyone else, and forgot everything about us.

Now, to the point ot this email. Considering all I've said before, I've come to the conclusion that I no longer want my backer OUYA. You have been unable to deliver what you promised, and been unable to provide any solutions, ammendments, or anything at all. So I no longer want it. What I want right now, is my money back. I don't want an email telling me to be patient, nor a promise that the ouya will come and be great. All I want is a refund. And I think you can agree, I'm entitled to it. Truth be told, I don't even know if I'm going to be buying the OUYA from Amazon. I feel so let down with you guys right now, I'm not even sure I want one anymore. Maybe it will pass, and maybe I'll end up buying one anyways, but I do know, I don't want the one that's been sitting in Hong Kong for the past three weeks.

So, as a last request from a backer, before cutting ties with the ouya team, I'd very much like for you to refund the $149 US dollars I pledged nearly a year ago (OUYA + shipping + extra controller). I don't want an indemnization, all I want is simply my money back.

Thank you, and I hope at least in this, I can hear from you soon. I'm really sorry it had to end this way.


TL;DR: Got my tracking number a couple days before hitting the shelves. Still no sign of it moving from HK. Amazon is selling OUYAs and shipping to Uruguay within 3 days. I am dissapointed at how things were managed and just want my money back.
------------------------------------
EDIT: A couple hours ago I got an email from OUYA's Community Manager as well as a response to my support ticket saying they'd refund me the money, and appologising for the trouble. Made my day, and brought back some of my faith in the OUYA team. Wish they could be as attentive with the rest of the backers.

Another thing that is really making me smile is watching how consumers want to reward developers for their time.   Think about it -- people threw $100+ at a console because they ""believed"" in it (whether it be emulators, streaming, or new games), and many are willing to throw money at developers who make this system worthwhile.

So my plea to developers -- if you're making a free game, please consider making a ""donate"" option to at least reward you for your hard work.  I've already enjoyed the heck out of No Brakes Valet, and I know there are others who haven't given the option for donations.  

Hidden in Plain Sight and Stalagfight are great examples of stuff I want to support.

I am pissed. Some of you have not yet received your OUYA -- and, to you, I apologize. I did not promise to ship to *most* of you before we hit store shelves. I promised to ship to *all* of you. I’ve been reading your comments, and we are working to solve this.

Here is what I know:

We delivered your OUYAs to our partner in May, and since then they have been in their custody. We paid for shipping, yet the deliveries remain incomplete. We know everyone is getting their OUYA, but it is taking longer than we expected.

We are working hard to get you answers, and more importantly, to fix this. On our end, we have tripled our customer service team so we can respond as quickly as possible to your questions (though the answer may still be that it’s in transit). We are working with our partners to resolve any administrative issues related to undelivered boxes (errors in shipping addresses, customs holds, etc.). I’m told that despite our best efforts, it may take another two weeks or more for some of these units to arrive.

We will resolve this as quickly as possible. I’ve had my team working all evening to provide me with the current state of affairs and what we are doing to make it right. Ken, our Special Ops lead, can give you more detail.

Hi Everyone,

My name is Ken Stephens, and I am the Head of Operations at OUYA.

This post is personally addressed to our early backers who have not yet received their OUYAs. 

As we hit store shelves tomorrow, it is very important that I try my best to explain why your units are behind schedule from our commitment and when we anticipate delivery.

As you may be aware, we manufacture OUYA in mainland China with our fulfillment partner in Hong Kong who is responsible for the individual shipments to you all.

Over the past few months, we encountered and conquered many challenges spanning both hardware and software in order to bring the best product we could to market. We have tried to make sure that the challenges we faced did not impact our early supporters, but unfortunately we came up short.

On average, shipment processing--from fulfillment center to product delivery--runs 20 days, end to end. It takes 3 to 5 days to pick, pack and ship the units out -- and then 15 to 17 days of transit time. Therefore, if you received your tracking number with your shipping confirmation email, your unit is on its way.

I know that many of you are frustrated with the DHL tracking system. While we are working hard to get this issue rectified, I am sorry to say this is still causing problems. When you receive a tracking number, you expect it to work immediately, but sometimes these tracking numbers don’t do that. The reason for this is that when the product leaves Hong Kong, the tracking process does not initiate until it arrives for the first scan at your country’s local depot. As a result, you could have a period of up to 10 days within which the product appears in limbo. This, we all agree, is very frustrating.

Additionally, we have seen a lot of cases where the unit will be delivered to your door without the product ever getting an arrival scan. This also unfortunately happens when dealing with the local postal systems.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of those who haven’t yet received OUYA are international backers. It just takes a lot longer to ship to some countries.

All of these units HAVE left Hong Kong, and you have received your tracking email.

So, based on the date of your shipping-confirmation email, your OUYA will arrive within 15 to 17 days from that date.

Please accept my personal apology for not yet delivering on our promise.

Sincerely,

Ken""

Honestly though, the ouya should have a Worms title. Growing up it was the best game to play with friends at the house. Basically what the ouya was built for. I sideloaded Worms 2 Armageddon, but basically unplayable without button mapping the touch screen controls to the controller. I know i could do it if I root the system, but I have already dumped so much time into making my ouya the system I want it to be, that i don't feel like losing all that and having to start over again. At least this is what I've read about rooting. Any new updates? Is it safe to do yet? ",,False,self,t5_2uhbj,False,,,True,t3_1k68rq,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1k68rq/we_need_worms/,

Of course I remind the wife that we have got the unit before it hit the stores and there are currently games in development that aren't ready.

I love the try it before you buy it model and have just purchased my first game, bombsquad.  My daughter and I are having a blast with that game and we had to keep playing when the demo time ran out.  And for 5 bucks I had it purchased within a minute after the expiration time.

I am also really enjoying the Pinball game on my large screen TV.  At 41 years old I dropped a lot of quarters into these machines and I played the table they gave me free a lot.  I have yet to purchase a new table, but I will once I wear out the Tales Of The Arabian Nights one.

There's many I haven't tried yet and many others that I won't try again.  But the Ouya is living up to my expectations.  Keep in mind I also had reasonable expectations.

My Ouya is a vessel that brings me little games by Independent game makers.  In my mind Indy games fall into two groups.  Either an Idea that should never have been developed but they either had too much money or time so they made it anyway, or an Idea that is really good but just not a draw for a super console that sells their games at 50+ bucks.  I look forward to the latter. 

I'm sorry for the people that's had trouble with their system.  Give them time.  Remember there are larger and more established companies that have horrible customer service.  Ouya is small and overwhelmed right now. Be polite and be persistent and I'm sure they will make it right.  They are getting enough bad press from the ""journalists""
that are still comparing the system to the big boys and don't get the market the Ouya is trying to fill.

Anyway,  off to work and when I get home going to play some more Bombsquad, check out what games have just released and have a little fun.",,False,self,t5_2uhbj,False,,green,True,t3_1gc2wh,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1gc2wh/having_fun_with_my_ouya/,

First, open your browser by going into Make -&gt; Software. Use the touchpad to navigate and do a Google search for astro apk. (This is the file manager that allows you to install netflix. I used the one from appsapk.com)

Click download. It should say starting download.

Next google search netflix apk and download netflix 2.1.2 .apk (later versions will probably work too if a newer version is out) I used the androiddrawer.com link. 

Now go back to the homescreen and go into Manage -&gt; System -&gt; Advanced. Then open storage -&gt; downloads and tap the astro apk to install it. 

Once installed it should appear in the software list where you opened your browser. Start astro and open the download folder. Tap the Netflix apk choose ""open app manager"" and install the app. It should now show up in the software section.

Start the app and login to your account. The first time i started a video it said to enable playback disable save app state or something. But it brought me right into the settings and i just unchecked the box it was complaining about. Its a little glitchy since its designed for a tablet or smartphone but this is hopefully just a temporary solution until Ouya 
and Netflix work something out. 

I haven't tried this with other apps but i imagine it should work. If there is an easier way or im missing something let me know.

EDIT: Probably should have mentioned that the reason I installed astro first is because when I tried to install Netflix the same way it gave the message ""cannot open file"".

Didn't follow the Kickstarter at all. I'm a 32 year old retro gamer mainly. Yeah I like some new games, but I always gravitate to things with old-school game play. Got the Ouya after seeing my friend post about it on Facebook for the past few weeks.

I actually like the controller. It's not nearly as crappy or cheap as everyone makes it seem. The D-Pad does kind of suck, particularly in NES games. No problem. I was able to sync my PS3 controller easily enough. Okay, so it took some trial-and-error, but it was still much easier than blowing into old carts.

After 3-4 hours, I had no wifi probs, no lag, and none of the other horror stories I've read. Loaded all the emulators and roms with ease. Synced 1 ouya controller and 2 PS3 controllers simultaneously. Yeah there's some quirks and frustration and fussing around. It's more gadget than console at this point, and I don't mind. 

I put this thing through the ringer with some old school NES action including Mike Tyson's Punch Out. That game is so precision that it doesn't even emulate well on the Wii, but it did good here. I beat Glass Joe same as always, but I can't speak to the harder levels yet.

The wife played Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego. I have no idea how she knew what to do.

Ouya games: No Brakes Valet wasn't has fun as everyone else suggested, but the wife liked it. I can see us picking it up and playing it here and there. It's a great time waster and laugh.

Hidden in Plain Sight - Great. We were cracking up. I'll be buying this.

We didn't even get to Towerfall yet. Really looking forward to it.

Feel free to add items and I'll update the OP.


**Sideloading apps (the easy way)**

1. From the home screen, go to **Make** &gt; **Software** &gt; **Browser**
2. Do a standard search or url to download an android app APK
3. Once the file is downloaded, go back to the home screen, then **Manage** &gt; **System** &gt; **Advanced**
4. You'll go to the default android settings menu. Go to **Storage** &gt; **Downloads**
5. Select the APK that was downloaded and accept the installation dialog box
6. The installed APK will appear in **Make** &gt; **Software**

**Sideloaded apps that work:**


**XBMC** 

Description: **The** universal media player. 

Compatibility: This alpha version is hardware accelerated and works pretty well (not sure about 1080p content). Navi-X and Youtube seems to be a bit buggy, though.

Link: [http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=152005](http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=152005) (Updated link is next to ""Download this build"")


**ES File Explorer**

Description: Useful file management app. You'll probably need this to move files around from the download folder or to upload APKs and files via network. 

Compatibility: It's primarily a touch app, so a mouse (the touchpad barely works) is recommended.

Link: [http://www.estrongs.com/en/download.html](http://www.estrongs.com/en/download.html)


**RetroArch**

Description: A good alternative for emulation while the Ouya store fills up. It's free and supports the major consoles (SNES, Genesis, TG16) and arcade systems (CPS1, 2, Neogeo). 

Compatibility: Seems better to use a PS3 or Xbox controller with this (attached via USB).

Link: [http://uploaded.net/file/y6i3pgml](http://uploaded.net/file/y6i3pgml)



From **xboxpants:**

**Astro File Manager**

Description: Useful file management app, helpful for browsing external storage.

Compatibility: It works well, but has very limited gamepad compatibility. You mostly have to use the touchpad. ""A"" works as ""back"".


**HBO GO**

Description: Watch HBO shows if you have a subscription on your cable plan.

Compatibility: It works, but the video quality is dreadful over wifi. Even if you use ethernet it's mediocre at best. No gamepad compatibility.


**Speedtest.net**

Description: Test the speed of your connection. Useful to see whether you should be using ethernet or if WiFi is fine.

Compatibility: It doesn't display fullscreen, and it doesn't have any gamepad support, but using the touchpad works fine.


**Humble Bundle Library**

Description: If you're bought any Humble Android bundles, you can access them with this app. Most of them aren't really playable with OUYA, but some should be. I still need to try out Machinarium.

Compatibility: First time I opened it there was a crash at launch, but since then it has worked fine.

If it already runs on android, then it will run on ouya.  It remains to be seen how ouya will handle android-native games - whether we will have to boot back and forth (possibly even re-flash back and forth) between the ouya OS and android, or whether it will run android apps under the ouya software itself.  But one way or another, they've already promised android on the device.  The hardware is no longer the fastest available, but it's still pretty high-end, so any app that will run on a decent android handset or tablet will run just fine on ouya.

As for everything else, you'll have to wait and see.  The ouya hardware is certainly *capable* of running pretty much any type of software (it's a computer, after all) - it just remains to be seen what software will be written to work on the device.  Asking ""will software X run on the ouya?"" months before the first developer kits (let alone standard production units) have shipped is pointless.  If Ubisoft wanted to port far cry 2 to the ouya, they certainly could - albeit with a much dumbed-down graphics engine.  But obviously there is almost no chance they would put in an enormous amount of effort to completely re-do the game engine for a niche device.  The *only* barrier to any one particular piece of software running on the box is getting a developer to do the work.  Any particular application that is not already android-native and is developed by a company that hasn't announced support for ouya, it is safe to assume it won't be ported unless you hear otherwise.  It technically *could* be, but it probably won't be.

As far as other features or capabilities, nobody knows.  The ouya team hasn't given a lot of specifics, and until they do, we won't know.  Things like video conferencing or universal achievement systems or home automation are all totally possible, but will only happen if they build them into the software.  Unless it's been officially anounced by the ouya team, the answer can safely assumed to be ""no"".

1371485642.0,46,self.ouya,1gitjb,OUYA review after 10 days of receiving it,51,5,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1gitjb/ouya_review_after_10_days_of_receiving_it/,"I received my OUYA 10 days ago and got to tinker around with it a bit and I’d like to share my experiences so far, both good and bad.  My original intents when I first backed the kickstarter campaign was to have a neat emulation device at its worst and have a console to develop for at its best, but I still have much to learn before I start making a decent game on it, so for now, it’s all about the games.

**Emulation**

I have tried 2 N64 emulators, Mupen64 and N64oid, the latter of which seems to work much better in terms of general game play and functionality.  Mupen takes a bit of tinkering with to get split-screen games working, but once you do, it runs nicely.  So far I’ve played Super Mario 64, Maro Kart 64, GoldenEye (seems to work best using n64oid), Super Smash Bros. 64 (also works best using n64oid) and Diddy Kong Racing.  I would kill to get Bomberman 64 working but so far, I’ve only gotten it to load using Mupen and even then, it can only get to the main menu and that’s it.  Overall, I’m enjoying the N64 emulation very much.

This weekend I worked on getting ePSX working and after figuring out how to quickly transfer the unzipped .bin files, I finally got Diablo and FF8 loaded and working nicely.  The only issue I have so far is that ePSX doesn’t seem to want to resize the screen when adjusting the emulator settings, specifically the area where you map the OUYA buttons.  I also installed FPse but it refused to load Diablo for some reason and I haven’t tried any other games on it, so who knows.  Other than the button mapping frustrations, I’m happy with the PSX emulation as well.

I also tried the NDS4droid from the OUYA store and although I got some roms loaded and running, the performance was very sluggish, even when adjusting all the video, filter and frame settings to lower quality for better performance, it wasn't very playable.  I'll have to try some other android DS emulators.

All other emulation including NES, SNES, Sega systems and Atari, I have not tried yet, but I’m not too worried about those since their performance requirements aren’t very heavy.

**Games**

The OUYA store has a great deal of games to choose from and I’m very happy with the demo everything model that is available.  Even so, the price points on most of the games are very reasonable as well so I have no problem paying for these games since I easily get my money’s worth after only a few play sessions.  Many of the popular games previously mentioned I have tried and also enjoyed, this includes: Bombsquad (bought this the first night I played it, tons of fun), Hidden In Plain Sight, Stalagflight, No Breaks Valet (my wife and I play this, very fun to just pick up and play), Chrono Blade (looking forward to the release) and You Don’t Know Jack.

I love the idea of party games on the couch.  I brought some friends over and we spent hours playing Bombsquad and HIPS, so much fun and they’re quick enough to get in and out for everyone to enjoy.  I can definitely see the potential for the OUYA if more developers make games with local multiplayer capabilities, split-screen or not.  I’m tired of multiplayer being online only and requiring everyone to be at their home on their own separate device.  It’s gotten stale and it’s just not as much fun as it used to be.  The OUYA is a breath of fresh air when it comes to the multiplayer experience and if you’re looking to game it up playing party games like Goldeneye, Mario Kart or Bombsquad, then look no further.  If you want big MMO style games or faced paced FPS multiplayer experiences, there’s already a slew of games on other consoles or the PC for that.

**Hardware**

I’ve had no issues with network connectivity, both Ethernet and wireless.  Updates and downloads go smoothly. Transfering an 800+MB file over my home network took about 15 min or so using Ghost Commander with the Samba plug-in.  Both .apks installed nicely and the interface can be traversed very well using the OUYA controller.  The controller itself is nice and I love the touchpad, though the tap response seems a bit slow and tends to take a few taps to be recognized.  They also have issues with lag or delay after longer gaming sessions and rebooting the OUYA is usually the fix.  Connecting PS3 controllers worked beautifully, less so with wireless 360 controllers.  I connected a USB wireless receiver to connect my 2 xbox controllers and it froze the OUYA and unlinked my OUYA controllers.  After a shutdown and restart, I paired my OUYA controllers, then plugged the receiver in again and got them working in Mario Kart for 4-player split-screen.

**(TL;DR)**
Overall based on my experiences:

**Pros**

* Good emulation support, looking forward to more dedicated apps for the OUYA.
* Great party games in the OUYA store.  Potential for expansion in this genre/style.
* Sideloading apps via Dropbox or other means works smoothly for installing.

**Cons**

* Not all sideloaded apps work perfectly with the OUYA controller or they don’t re-size the screen properly.
* Controllers have some issues with connectivity becoming sluggish or unresponsive.  More support for 360 controllers would be great.

I was impressed with the build quality upon unboxing it.  Note: the silver cladding on the console and controllers are aluminium, not plastic.  They appear to have conformal coating not anodization, which is a cheaper process but still pretty durable (good enough for aerospace applications).

Console is appropriately weighty for the cords it has to support.  There are 4 screws on top that take a 2mm hex.  I have not opened it up yet.  It did not have engraving on the side from the kickstarter like I expected, I am somewhat disappointed by this, as is my son (He is a huge minecraft fan and would have liked Notch being on the side of the Ouya.)  The OUYA logo engraved on the front of the console and on the left plate of the controller looks to be engraved or stamped, it is not etched.  I'm leaning towards engraving, but it could also be stamped.   If stamped the dies were very crisp.  Before coating it appears that the metal was bead blasted.

The controllers feel good to both my son and I.  Only time will tell how the coating holds up to hand wear but I expect it to do okay. The nylon tabs that pull out the batteries are appropriately heavy duty.  Neodymium magnets hold the faceplates down.  This is an ingenious enclosure mechanism, far better than the standard plastic tab.  We have had no trouble with faceplates coming off, they are quite solidly on.  On the right side of the controller under the faceplate is a 10 pin test point jumper labelled with TP203 to TP213.  Wonder what that does? :)  I have not opened the controller.

We both like the feel of the controller, the OUYA buttons and dpad are a little stiff but that should get better with break in.  The trackpad can be a janky but it is sufficient for menu navigation, would not want to use it for gameplay.  We haven't had any trouble with button sticking.  

Ouya needs to do a better job deburring the aluminium faceplates where they contact the analog sticks.  The plates have cut a groove into the sticks, and the plate edges are not well deburred.  This should be a self-limiting problem since this contact only occurs at the maximum travel of the stick pots.  It also looks like the OUYA button labelling is screened on and not monolithic with the plastic.  This will probably wear.  It is hard to tell though, and the coloration may extend into the plastic and will be durable.  Not sure. 

The controllers really do feel and look quite good and it makes sense why they will retail at 50 bucks a pop.

Had a little trouble getting wifi going at first, not sure if it was me or the Ouya, but it finally connected and no problems since.  Update went smoothly.  I lost my password for the username and that took some time to iron out as a automated request for a password reset failed to show up in my inbox.  After an hour of farting around we found another password reset dialog on the ouya site that did immediately work.

There are some ui and software tweaks that need to be made, the lag in menus being particularity annoying.  Sometimes it forgets to load pictures in the Discover menus.  We want to be able to select smaller pictures and see a blown up version.  It appears that has been designed for but not implemented yet.  Also, the console will sometimes seem to start lagging in gameplay when a more resource intensive game has been played before the current game.  I have no clue as to what is actually causing it but it feels like games/apps are not properly releasing resources when closed.  Sleeps/Reboots are sometimes needed to fix this.  The controls also hang occasionally.  It goes away after a minute.  This causes much profanity when it occurs.

Best twoplayer games so far other than emulation are Stalagflight and Hidden in Plain Sight.  

Stalagflight would have made millions back in the arcade days.  We wish it had a name capability with highscores or some sort of leaderboard.  Also some sort of points keeping in mulitplayer.  Much trash talking with this game.  I beat my sons high of 350m last night and my wife came out to see what all the yelling was about.  We did donate a $.99 piece of pizza to the dev.  However, the game is completely free.  Very simple but highly addictive.

We purchased the full version of Hidden in Plain Sight ($.99).  Lots of fun, but the best modes are already free.  The other modes that get unlocked are probably better with more than two people.  I haven't figured out how to get an Xbox controller working yet.  This game is a lot of fun, especially if you know how your opponent thinks.  Lots of indirection and the trash talking is more about lying to fool the other person.

My son really likes Bomb Squad, the control of your little character in this game just pisses me off.  Full version is $4.99 I think.

Emulation works great for the nes and snes.  Loading roms from a usb stick worked on all 3 emulators we tried.  You have to navigate upfolder from the SDcard0 or whereever it is that you start to find the usb folder when looking for the files.  Emuya requires a toplevel folder on the usb stick called roms and will add other folders.

SuperGNES is $.99 to add the ability to load saved states.  We went ahead and purchased.  My son is playing one of the Kirby titles and I'm working through Earthbound.  

Emuya is free for loading save states and such, you can purchase indie roms and the ability to ""rewind"" gameplay.  Works well, the screen has red text to the side of the game area that is basically an add for ""rewind"" feature.  Emulates great, we had a lot of fun playing SMB3.  Up next for the NES is M.U.L.E.  My son was very interested when I told him that it was an economic resource and colonization simulator.  The dev was an interesting and influential gaming personality and looked at gaming with a very different perspective (even had a sex change in the early '90s).

Mupen64 is the 64 emulator and is free.  Works on some games.  Ocarina of Time was glitchy but seemed playable.  Duke Nukem: Zero Hour ran well.  After some key remapping I totally pwned my son. :) (I learned fps physics with the original pc version of Duke Nukem 3D and nothing has ever felt quite right since.)  The problem may be our roms, but in South Park, everyone had multiple sets of eyes and the game wouldn't play and is one of the creepiest glitches I've ever seen.  Worms Armageddon glitched all the way out.  Banjo and kazooie seemed playable with some minor glitching.

All in all, we are having a lot of fun with the Ouya.  And, although it has a few rough edges, it is very playable.  The physical controller and console have some slight problems.  However, I am very impressed with the construction.  The engineers actually knew what the hell they were doing when it was designed and in some ways the controller is superior to the Xbox controller it is derived from.  A lot of the games on Discover are crap, some are awesome.  I expect this to get better.

tl;dr

Console and controllers have a few small problems but are well built.  UI and software need tweaks.  Stalagflight and Hidden in Plain Sight rock.  NES and SNES emulation rock, N64 not so much.

I know HTML and CSS, that's it. I backed the OUYA on kickstarter, mostly because I have a fascination with gadgets and have been playing video games my whole life. I'm also an early adopter; I can't help it! I just want the shiny new gadget!

When I first turned this thing on, I thought the welcome screen/sound was really cool. I played a few games, poked around in the settings menus (never used Android before), and was kind of underwhelmed at the quality of some of the software and/or (stock Android) UI elements when seen on a TV. 

Then I realized that this is a really different kind of console. It really is for playing *AND* building. Once I ""got"" it, I fell in love. The OUYA is magical. You can feel the love that some of these games are made with. 

And I'm inspired. I know my way around Cinema4D, just. I used to wish I knew how to enable some kind of interactive camera system wherein I could let viewers walk around an object I created in 3D. And with OUYA, I feel like it's within my reach to do this on my TV! And then I could share it with all of you! There's a lot to do between here and there, a lot of learning and futzing, but I honestly believe that given enough time and help that I can achieve this. And it's all thanks to this odd little box and angular controller with an untapped touchscreen.

Just thought I'd share. Thanks, Julie, the rest of the OUYA team, and all the developers that already have games up or me to fall in love with.

We're the fervent supporters of this console. We're the ones who have been following it since day one and thought that it was an awesome idea, and its an exciting time now that they are finally being shipped.

Hopefully I *am* preaching to the choir here, but I really want to discourage the initial early ""tech savy"" supporters of the console (us) from pirating. My guess is that just by the mere fact that we're the type of people who follow this thing, nearly all of us know how to jump on google, download an apk, and sideload it. (Which in the case of Netflix or XBMC, or similar app is completely fine for the time being)

I say all of this because we are the initial consumers. For the next few months ""we"" will define this consoles user base and we will create a stereotype... a stereotype that may make a lasting impression on game devs. If we, the consumers, want this console, platform, and this way of doing business to take off we can not be a group known for pirating. We see it in the PC world, just recently with Game Dev Tycoon, and I don't want us to fall in that same category. If the Ouya is going to take off, we have to show interest in actually purchasing games. So please, the devs and the Ouya team have made it easy on us to try out every game for free. If a dev asks us to pay for it, and we like the product, lets pay for it. We really want to see a dev community grow around this thing.

While it is a port of our heavily praised iOS title, the entire game is being rewritten and redesigned for Ouya. Everything from map generation, the skills for all 4 player classes, monsters, pacing, all will be receiving individual attention, and we will be making at least 1 completely new game mode for Ouya, to make the game the best possible console game it can be.

I was immediately excited by the possibilities Ouya opens up for gamers and developers, and I want little more than to see 100 Rogues contribute to that.

1367509081.0,46,self.ouya,1dk0s1,My first impressions with OUYA,56,10,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1dk0s1/my_first_impressions_with_ouya/,"Like many of you, I am an early backer of OUYA. I was lucky enough to receive my console on the 29th, and have spent 10-12 hours on it playing over 15 games and apps. Without further ado, here are my thoughts as organized and digestible as possible. **Keep in mind these are a first impression and your experiences could vary significantly.**

**Controller** – There has been much said already about the controller. In my experience with it, the controller has performed admirably for every game and app designed for it. Many games have been ported from other Android platforms with standard USB functionality play fine with it, but in some of these cases it seems that the analog stick does not perform up to par. This is a software issue on the developer, not the controller or the hardware. It’s just something to be mindful of. For example, in GSNES the angles are not recognized well at all. When running in Super Mario World, Mario was constantly wanting to “duck” with his head down. Frustrating, but solved by switching over to the D-pad. The shoulder buttons at the top of the controller feel a little cheap and don’t have a good “click” or “snap” to them. The triggers perform fine in all games, but on my controller they seem to have a little too much friction against the inside body resulting in a squeak.  The complete range of motion on the triggers seems a little limited as well, meaning they don’t sink in as much as the Xbox 360’s when pressed. The buttons function fine and never once have been stuck down as some have said before me. The only time I got that to happen was by pressing extremely hard, harder than you’d ever press during gameplay. Even so, it seems that this would be easily remedied by making the holes in the aluminum faceplate just 1/32” larger. The d-pad is functional but is only on par with what you may have experienced with the xbox 360. Why is this so hard to master? Grrr….

**Console** – This little thing is pretty amazing. It’s quiet, heavy (for such a little box), and looks cool. Nothing seemed cheap or fragile about it. Well designed and executed. During my first boot of the console I made a huge mistake in having an external USB HDD attached. Thinking I could just turn the controller on and start dicking around in the menus, I didn’t think this would be a big deal. During all of the troubles I was having in getting a controller to connect (will talk about this later) I must have unplugged it during a critical moment, as now 260GB of data was now corrupt. This has been a hellacious process in recovering this data since then. The entire partition was now unusable. Don’t do what I did. Do the initial setup and pairing before plugging in any USB data device you value.

**UI/Frontend** – I know this is going to change soon, but as it is don’t get your hopes up thinking that what you’ll have is anything close to the original Kickstarter video. That’s not the case here, at least not yet. Moving in and out of menus isn’t as responsive as anyone would desire, images take a long time to load in the Sandbox, and the overall quality of the color gradients used in the background isn’t attractive. But it is simple and well organized for sure.  Discovering games is fun and pretty painless. Background downloading is automatic here, so you can start a large download and continue looking around or jump into a new game.

**Issues** – Bluetooth, you are a bitch. I don’t know why, but like a minority of users out there have experienced, the initial pairing process was extremely painful for me. After following the directions to the letter over multiple times I could not get the stock OUYA controller to pair after over an hour. I resorted to using my PS3 controller, which during the pairing process I’ve read you need to plug in via USB while pairing. As soon as I’d plug in the controller, then turn it on, in the Advanced Settings-bluetooth- pair screen it would show “enabling Bluetooth” and would sit there for 10 minutes. Nothing.  Only after performing a hard reset on the console through the advanced settings menu was I able to get Bluetooth working the way it was designed.  If this mirrors the retail experience, there will be some very pissed off people. It was a mistake to not include a USB port on the controller to make pairing an easier process. 

Some games like “No Brakes Valet” give absolutely no control instructions. This is one standard that needs to be met by all games. Tell us how to control your fucking game.
 
Give us some kind of app that allows us to map USB controllers to OUYA controls, a simple diagram that translates into USB button presses set individually by the user. 

**TL;DR**

+Console build quality

+Fun, unique games (bombsquad, canabalt, many more)

+Compatibility with Xbox/PS3/USB controllers is wonderful

+Quick to boot/sleep/resume

+Exiting game to go to the home screen is extremely fast. (less than 1 second)



-Bluetooth pairing issues on first boot

-An “open” marketplace means we’re all at the mercy of developers. Some real great efforts, but also some real shitty ones will be found. A couple standards could go a long way to improving the accessibility of some games.

-Only a minor issue with the triggers keeps the stock controller from being a great one

-UI is a bit clunky at the moment. I fully expect this to improve significantly.

-An opportunity is being lost by not including a few basic games with the console. Dear OUYA: Show your new customers some of your best offerings without requiring someone to go to the store and download! The first thing people want to do when buying the console is play games, not hunt in the store, set up a new account, input payment info, etc. 


In short, every issue I mentioned is easily remedied and even as it is, is a fun console that brings something new to many of us.

While we can hook up external drives to gain more space, half the time they either don't work. Or stop working later on after some use. Having them mount to /usbdrive/ is unacceptable. If you are connecting a drive that is ext3/4 formatted the system should pick it up and allow you to begin installing things off the ouya store to it. No having to mess with links2sd or any other 3rd party sideloaded app to create the necessary links. External drives connected into the system should also show up in windows when the micousb slot is connected to a pc. This way if they are formatted in ext3/4 they can be written too directly from windows. 

An actual file manager built into the ouya system that is accessible from the 'play' or 'manage' section that is root compatible. This way we can manipulate files directly on the ouya after they have been transferred to the system. 

The ability to connect to the ouya via adb wireless as a toggle within the os, that doesn't disable the ouyas microusb port. 

Something other than holding down ""alt-sysrq keys and press I"" multiple times during the boot sequence to crash the system into recovery. While its nice to have, its annoying to have to hook up a keyboard to get into it. There should be something buried into the developer options within the device to boot into recovery. This would keep kids from getting into it, but allow people who have some knowledge to access recovery.

The Bard's Tale seems to have the right idea, and seems to internally be subsampling it's renderer to about 800x960, which keeps the game running at a nice smooth clip at about 40-50fps.

My name is Marco Williams, CEO of Hashbang Games,  and today our game Gravi was approved and put up in the OUYA sandbox.   Gravi was one of the original entries of the Killscreen OUYA Create Jam.  We didn't win,  but we really wanted to complete the game and bring it to you all on the OUYA.

Today is a proud day for all of us here at Hashbang Games.  We worked hard at optimizing our first game for the Android and our game is running super smooth.   

For those of you that don't know about Gravi or have never heard of it.  

Gravi is an intense puzzle-platformer that will test your tolerance for pain. Shoot and swing your way towards victory as Gravi, an adorable blue ball of energy. You’ll launch through terrorizing traps and bend gravity to your will, evading the single-minded, psychotic Anti-Gravi as you go. 

We have a cute little video trailer that is quite entertaining.  We hit up steam first to try to get the ball rolling there while we optimized for android.  Our trailer is available on our website  http://playgravi.com. We will be updating the website soon with all the new OUYA info.

You will find that Gravi for Ouya is a little different,  we have replaced some of the particle effects with sprite sheets and to be honest, the OUYA version looks a tad bit better than the PC version *wink*, we have also re-created the boss battle experiences to be more puzzle based.

Feel free to check it out.  It's available for download in the Discover area, under sandbox until we get at least 20 up votes.  So if you like our game, please give it a thumbs up! 

We love feedback, so after you've given it a go, feel free to post some feedback here and let us know what you think! 

Thanks,
Marco

1371656770.0,42,self.ouya,1gnt0e,My new Ouya - a non-backer's perspective.,51,9,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1gnt0e/my_new_ouya_a_nonbackers_perspective/,"I had not heard about the Ouya until the past few weeks.  After researching it and all of it's possibilities, I wanted to buy one.  Clearly, I was not able to back the Kickstarter campaign, so I looked on eBay.  I was able to get the standard console with an extra controller for $160, only $10 more than what that would cost me if I waited until next week (and only $1 more if you consider sales tax!).  I am here to write a review for the console from someone who was not waiting for months for the console.  I imagine my review would be similar to someone that picks it up in stores in the coming weeks.

The Ouya arrived from the seller Monday.  The backer that received it hadn't taken anything out of the packing.  The controllers and console all seem pretty solid, considering their price.  I expected some cheap feeling controller.  Not to say that it doesn't have its flaws, but they are better than I expected.  I thought it was nice that they include batteries and an HDMI cable.  Those are things that most electronic devices would not include, and it was a nice touch.

Before discussing the software, I feel that I should talk about me and what I was expecting from the console.  I have a Raspberry Pi that I set up as an emulator about a month ago using RetroPie.  I was happy with this, except I really wanted N64 emulation, and better PSX emulation.  That being said, one of the main selling points for me was the N64 emulation available on the Ouya.  It certainly is not perfect, but I have yet to find an emulator that is.  I also enjoy playing indie games from the XBLA, so I was excited to see what this had to offer.  There are a lot of fun, interesting games on the Ouya, and the fact that you can try them all for free is great.  I have yet to buy any games, but I did purchase the full version of FPse yesterday.  I was pretty bummed to find out that after a few minutes of playing FF7, the sound cut out and I was given the option to pay for the full version.  I was so excited to play the game that I gave in and paid the $2.99 for the full version.  I hope to see some nice updates to this emulator, since the menu is not the best for a TV screen.  Purchasing things on the Ouya is almost too easy, and I feel like developers are going to benefit greatly from impulse buys similar to what I did with FPse.

I also have set up my Raspberry Pi as an XBMC media center.  I sideloaded the android version to try it out and compare it the openElec build that I have running on the pi.  Menu navigation seemed to be much snappier, which I enjoyed.  However, I was unable to get the remote app on iOS to work with it, and it wasn't showing up as an Airplay receiver either.  I will keep using my pi for XBMC until that works.

On the topic of sideloading things, I was able to sideload GTA3 yesterday and play it with the controller without any additional setup.  It takes some playing around to figure out the controls, but it does work.  I tried dead trigger, but the additional content would not download, so I couldn't play the game.  This was probably just an issue with my apk.  

I just read today about Kainy getting a native Ouya version, and I am excited to get that hooked up to play Steam games from my laptop.  I haven't used Steam before, but I still look forward to getting it set up.  I also plan on buying the new Humble Bundle and trying those games out as well.

Lastly, I want to talk about the controller.  I am happy (lucky?) that I have not seen any considerable controller lag, even in the emulators.  I have been playing it in an open room, where the couch is very close to where the Ouya is sitting.  However, the joysticks have got a ring worn around them already, and I've only had it for two days!  I saw some posts regarding this, and tried sanding down the faceplate to no avail.  I will try again, but this is definitely going to be an issue if people are supposed to buying these things in a week.  You think they would have caught this and fixed it while testing.  I guess that can be said for most of the issues that they have had though.

All in all, I am pleased with my purchase.  I am going to school for Computer Engineering, and I work as a Software Engineering intern, so I am very interested in making my own game for the Ouya.  To me, that's one of the best things about this system.  I have some ideas, but the great community support and documentation for things like the ODK and the Android SDK, as well as engines like libgdx are very promising.

I'm interested to see what less-informed consumers think of the Ouya in the coming weeks.

**Update: 6/19/2013, 6:46 PM**
I am adding some photos of my controller.  You can see that the analog sticks have been worn where they rub on the faceplates.  This can be seen on the right side, where only half of the analog stick has a ring worn on it, since only half of the stick is surrounded by the faceplate.

**Update: 6/20/2013, 10:44 AM**
In the wake of them adding a 16 GB version of the Ouya on the preorder page, I was reminded about my experience with the USB drive.  I have a 320 GB external HD (Seagate Free Agent) that I keep all of my movies and TV episodes on for XBMC.  This worked just as it would in openElec, or I assume any other XBMC distro.  I also have my ROMs on a 16GB flash drive, which worked with all of the emulators that I have been using (Super GNES, Mupen64, FPse, NES, GBA, and GBC).  I will eventually move all of the ROMs onto the HD as well, but having them separate was a good test of the Ouya.  After unplugging the flash drive and plugging in the HD, it was mounted to /usbdrive without any issues.  The Ouya also seems to power the HD fine.  However, I don't think that it draws a lot of power to operate, seeing as my Raspberry Pi will power it as well, along with a WiFi dongle.  I have not gotten to the point where I have ran out of space on the Ouya for downloaded games, but USB support is something of a necessity for a device like this, and I can only assume that they are working on it (hopefully for a launch-day update).
In a way I feel like June 25th will be like getting the Ouya all over again.  If they are smart, there will be a software update with some huge changes/fixes/improvements, and there should be many new games to play.  If only the people that made this thing happen were able to enjoy it.",,False,self,t5_2uhbj,1371739987.0,,,True,t3_1gnt0e,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1gnt0e/my_new_ouya_a_nonbackers_perspective/,

1342194731.0,41,self.ouya,wi527,A couple of misconceptions about the Ouya,69,28,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/wi527/a_couple_of_misconceptions_about_the_ouya/,"1. **This system is just a phone**.  No, this system is NOT a phone. It is a console based on the android operating system.  It will have dedicated ports for video out, audio out, and usb out, and controllers.  Your phone doesn't have that and if it did, it would cost more than $99 to get it there, much less the cost of your phone.  Much less that you would still only have access to games based on phone control.
2. **It won't be successful if it can't run Skyrim**.  This system is not meant to win the graphics arms race.  It's meant to be competetive in the current market (It's specs actually dwarf the wii) but not to win.  These guys have an indy mindset that believes games don't have to cost a million dollars to be fun.  This is the guy who made the $100 laptop and people didn't believe there was a market at the time for a low powered laptop.  Those naysayers were wrong then, and they are wrong now, there is always room in the market for mid-to-low powered systems.
3. **Ouya will have a separate market which means Android fragmentation**.  Yes it will have a separate market, because IT IS NOT A PHONE.  It is a console system based on the same operating system as many phones.  You think it's easy to develop a game for the wii, xbox and ps3 all at once?  In comparison it will be a cakewalk to make a game that runs on most android phones, and then port it to a console that has the exact same codebase.
4. **Independent developers don't exist / where is their champion**? Independent developers exist, they just currently work at EA.  They work at Ubisoft.  They are taking computer science courses.  They're electrical engineers who tinker with software in their spare time.  What do you think every major game production house was at one time?  7 dudes in a college dorm, or 3 guys in a basement, or 4 ladies in a rented office, making doom.  There are always developers, there's just been such a large barrier to entry for console development.  Look at how successful XBLA was, because finally small developers had access to console controllers.",,False,self,t5_2uhbj,False,,yellow,True,t3_wi527,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/wi527/a_couple_of_misconceptions_about_the_ouya/,

I'm a developer myself, so I understand there is a huge difference between a single-player, local multiplayer game, and a networked one, but remember that with some effort, you can probably double your conversion rates. In my case, some of the games mentioned above are moved from instabuy to worthless category based on one criteria-- online multiplayer availability.

**Edit:** Wow, thanks for the great responses guys!



**Edit 2:** So I've been seeing a lot of similar responses on here as well as the Kickstarter comments...I have explicitly said that I *know* that there are delays, however Ouya has raised *millions* of dollars; they should have been prepared for all of these issues. Except instead of being up front and *honest* with their backers, they have covered up the truth, kind of ignored the actual problems, and pretended that everything is hunky-dory. 

Sure, there are ""whiny"" people, complaining that they don't have their console. But those arguing against that seem to disregard the fact that Ouya *has not* been honest with their backers, the people who should be most important to them! Instead they have focused their time with investors and making charts.

Ouya *has* listened to *some* of the backer's issues: they pushed their release date back, they changed the production order (which was the very first issue and they could have dealt with the issue better), but they have not really been up front and said ""We are sorry for not being able to fulfill our promises.

One of the greatest things about this console is that it bring back the more casual, in-person co-op, style of games that I'm sure a lot of us enjoyed growing up. Amidst the negative posts, just thought you'd all appreciate this little post of support.

A lot of gamers don't like current gen consoles because the games are too serious, too involved, too complicated.

I am a kickstarter backer of the OUYA, and I just recieved my console + 2 controllers yasterday, I opened the box and started it, iv'e managed to start some games but didn't really ENJOYED playing it, maybe a little of the crane game..

But today, a friend came over to hang out a bit, I was like ""Oh you know I have that ouya thing we might wanna try it"", and man, we played 4 hours straight without a stop, laughing, battling, coop-ing together, after that we both were like ""OMG WHEN DO WE MEET UP AGAIN"".

This is the most fun i've had with a console since PS1 crash bash, this console is probably made for couch and party gaming...

The games we reallly enjoyed are TowerFall, Bombsquad and hidden in plane sight,

TowerFall - just an epic game, simple, but epic, we wish we had 2 more buddies right here today to play with, but i need to get more controllers first anyway.

BombSquad - Man, this game, has everything: music - CHECK, graphic art - CHECK, physics - CHECK, funny running animation - CHECK, and best of all, it has fun coop gamemodes.

Hidden in plane sight - What do I need to say, this game is pretty awesome and unique, iv'e yet to play such an intensive game that actually makes you think, plus you need pokerface to play this game, HIGHLY RECOMMANDED!

TL:DR if you have friends, buy this console, if not, mehh..",,False,self,t5_2uhbj,False,,green,True,t3_1hn6u8,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1hn6u8/so_a_friend_came_over_today/,

* They're at about 50% KS units shipped
* LE and international have *started* shipping
* They are concentrating on the current generation ouya console and have not started work on any future products/plans
* They claim to be ""shipping everywhere""
* ""To date we have announced: TwitchTV, Vevo, iheartradio TuneIn, Flixster, Crunchyroll, XBMC, and Plex...more coming in daily, literally. I have a Kellee Santiago for non-games too :). OUYA can be your everything box.""
* Julie/the team have been meeting devs at lots of dev conferences
* There are no plans to allow the controller to allow power activation
* The controller issues have been fixed by design (not trying to put words in Julie's mouth, but that says to me that if there are now any controller issues that it may be a problem with that one controller, not with the general design)
* More and more consoles are coming off the line every day. Full production capacity should be achieved by end of next week
* OnLive is still coming
* They still reckon to have all pre-retail consoles to backers before the retail launch date
* No units have been made then put aside for retail. KS consoles first, then pre-orders THEN retail units will be manufactured
* Game devs decide entirely on how to monetise their games, as long as there is a free element

As a developer, this worried me and I hoped that a menu would pop up for that input instead. I hadn't gotten much of a response in the forums (they are *busy*), and I said here that I'd try harder to get an answer about this, so I did, and got some good news for players and devs!

Here's the reply I got from Bob (developer relations) and Nick (android developer) at OUYA:

----



Bob

CCing Nick so he can correct me if I'm wrong.
But as far as I know, the milestone is set for:
1 click is pause.
2 clicks is overlay (with option to go back to menu)

Is this correct, Nick?

----

Nick

1 click just sends the game a menu button key event, so we don't force any pausing, just recommend it :)

2 clicks (or a long press on non-dev kit controllers) opens the launcher app. We're still working on improving the menu in hopes it will become more of a dialog and not close the running game, but currently its not completely reliable in that regard. For now I'd recommend treating the system menu opening as a closing event until we've ironed out the app retention.

",43,9,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/y80sg/ouya_the_best_retro_console_youll_ever_buy/,"To preface, I have had Android devices since the geriatric HTC  G1/Dream. I have enjoyed many types of Android games and will continue to support the Android game developers when I can. That being said, I'm also a console gamer regardless of the general apathy that a lot of Redditors seem to have towards the consoles. I turned to Android originally because of the variety of emulators available for the OS. GENsoid, MAME, SNESoid etc have all proven to be extremely well done emulators even if there's the odd compatibility issue.   
  
My initial attraction for the OUYA was basically a way of playing my old console games both in terms of image quality, as well as reducing the amount of wear on the old consoles themselves. I love my consoles, but they are getting long in the tooth, and indeed, parts to repair them will only get scarcer. Emulation has some distinct advantages. Since I'm not skilled enough in the art of soldering and certain cable connections are hard to come by, the absolute best I am able to output my old consoles on is composite. This on it's own is adequate, but after experiencing on pc and android the capabilities of decent emulators, the prospect of playing classics on an HDTV with the highest image output quality possible is too appealing to ignore. Plus with essentially unlimited storage for retro games, with the usb input, this makes retrogaming as easy as playing XBLA on my 360 or PSN on PS3.   
  
Regardless of the grey area ROMs occupy, this is essentially one of the main reasons I'm getting an OUYA. I have an Xperia Play which despite it's short comings as an Android super phone, is the gaming phone I would have reverently described to friends, and it sounded like Sony was lurking outside my window listening when they cobbled it together. The OUYA is the next step in retrogaming, as opposed to hacking and modifying older game systems, the OUYA is designed with Android APKs already. Side loading them should be easy as an Android phone.   
  
Fellow retrogamers, fellow console gamers, this is all in a box the size of a Rubik's Cube. If anything, the fact that there's no alterations required out of the box makes this a console worth buying.

And, while I can’t believe the day has come, I always knew we’d get Here. 

Here: having shipped tens of thousands of consoles to passionate backers who bet on OUYA when it was just a concept.

Here: partnered with top retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop,Target and GAME.

Here: in hundreds of stores across the U.S., Canada and the U.K.

Here: with more games at launch than any other console in gaming history. And this is all just the beginning. 

People said it was impossible: Taking on the big boys in an industry that chewed up the competition. The video game market was considered impenetrable. It was expensive, closed, and built for three. That was just the way it was and nobody thought it could be any different. Nobody wondered how.

But you -- and tens of thousands like you -- wanted something new. You -- the game players and the game creators -- you knew that things could be different. In backing OUYA, you proved that there were people out there who wanted a change. 

The path we chose hasn’t been easy. Our development process was unprecedented in its transparency. We solicited your opinions and heard your feedback on Reddit, on Twitter and in email. We brought everyone along for the ride making both our victories and our missteps public. Because -- we believe this process is what makes OUYA better.

OUYA is built with gamers, for gamers. We do it together.

And the games... what you game creators have done is amazing! Inventive. Different. FUN. Not the same old games by the same old folks adding +1 to the version number and slapping on a price tag of $60 or more. OUYA Devs are making it happen. From raucous couch-gaming romps like Hidden in Plain Sight and You Don’t Know Jack; oddball racing games like Rush Bros and Flashout; shouting-match PvP games like BombSquad and the “killer app” candidate TowerFall; and action-packed adventures in the forms of RPG beat-em-up ChronoBlade and soon-to-come coop, iso-shooter Killing Floor: Calamity -- you’ve delivered a game lineup that rocks.

So, launch is upon us. And I can’t let us launch without acknowledging the role YOU played. 

THANK YOU. 

You can CONTINUE to expect great things from OUYA. The OUYA team is ready. We will continue to deliver. And -- if you were one of our backers that was impacted by the complications caused by DHL (shipping service) and have yet to receive your OUYA, please know that we are working overtime to get this resolved. We will continue to push our partners to find a resolution and will work directly with you and keep you in the loop until every backer has an OUYA in-hand. Thank you for all of your patience and support.

Thank you. Thank you from the team, and thank you from me, personally. I will be forever awed by what we have all brought to life. And this is just the beginning...

Yours. Literally. 
Julie

P.S. -- Be sure to keep in touch -- we’ll be sure to do the same @playouya, on Facebook, Google+, and on OUYA.tv. We might not be using this Kickstarter list often anymore, but if there’s something that’s just relevant to our Kickstarter backers we might still pop it here. Otherwise, Kickstarter you’ve done what you set out to do -- kindled something entirely new, that wouldn’t have existed without you.

How many of you would pay $50-60 for an upgrade kit that they swap into their current Ouya in order to give it a Tegra 4 rather than the Tegra 3?,58,21,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1dpr7m/5060_for_a_tegra_4_upgrade_kit_for_the_ouya_how/,"Ouya would benefit greatly from having a Tegra 4 inside of it rather than the current Tegra 3. So here's what I suggest. Launch an Ouya 2 by Christmas for $150 that comes with Tegra 4 inside and offer all original Ouya founders/kickstarters a $60 upgrade kit. They simply open up their Ouya and swap out the insides of their Ouya with the internals in the Upgrade Kit, and viola, they now have an Ouya 2 as well.

One major reason to do this is to give the Ouya enough graphical prowess that it can natively support the Oculus Rift. A dedicated Oculus Rift console that has a ton of appeal (no one wants to install all sorts of crap on PC and fiddle with settings for their GPU to get the Rift running, something like the Rift would be far better when it comes with a closed box that requires no fiddling with settings). Team up with Oculus Rift and sell a combo Ouya 2 + Oculus Rift package for $399 and watch as sales skyrocket.


Ouya would benefit greatly from having a Tegra 4 inside of it rather than the current Tegra 3. So here's what I suggest. Launch an Ouya 2 by Christmas for $150 that comes with Tegra 4 inside and offer all original Ouya founders/kickstarters a $60 upgrade kit. They simply open up their Ouya and swap out the insides of their Ouya with the internals in the Upgrade Kit, and viola, they now have an Ouya 2 as well.

1. Tegra 3s gpu is based on a 7 yr old architecture. Tegra 4s gpu will be the first time Nvidia brings its modern gpu architecture and unified shaders to the mobile space. Tegra 3 produces semi decent graphics at smartphone resolutions only when there are minimal resources dedicated to things like framerate, physics, AI, number of enemies and having wide open levels. Pare it up to 1080p resolutions and ideally four person multiplayer gaming and no I dont see how the Tegra 3 is good enough to pull it even okay 3d graphics without massively sacrificing things like physics, framerate, number of simultaneous enemies and friendlies and large rooms (instead of small cooridors) all of which hurts gameplay. Tegra 4 offers unified shaders and a far improved architecture. By all indications it would allow for significantly better gameplay (lots of enemies, open levels, solid physics, 1080p/60fps). Tegra 4 also uses the a15 CPU which is a vastly superior architecture to the a9 architecture used by the Tegra 3.

2. By launching with the Tegra 3, the Ouya team faces a real risk of someone releasing a Tegra 4 box late 2013 and eating away at the Ouyas sales. It's a nobrainer for someone to do this given how much revenue the Ouya raised even with outdated hardware. 

3. As someone who forked down $130 for a device that's wont be out for another 8 months, I certainly wouldnt mind having to wait an extra three months to get an exponentially better device. They already have the money. They should make the best possible device they can with it, even if it takes a little bit longer. 

4. The Tegra 4 soc goes into production mid 2013, just a month or two after the Ouya launches. The Tegra 4 soc costs $21, same as the Tegra 3 soc costs.

5. OUYA is getting a 30% profit on each game sold from developers. The longer legs the Ouya has, the more money they stand to make in the long run.

6. There is no need to rush the Ouya. I would rather they wait and get more dev support than rushing it out the door and see incomplete software being rushed to be the ""first one in OUYA"". Any thing developed for Tegra 3 will run flawlessly on Tegra 4. A strong polished launch library would generate good word of mouth and give the console longer legs.

7. This isnt a retail device with a large marketing campaign, the ouyas market is clearly one that keeps up with tech. It's undeniable that more people will buy the Ouya next year if it features a modern soc with current architecture than a one yr outdated one built on a 7 yr old architecture.
In summary, the Tegra 4 soc costs $21. Even if the Tegra 3s price drops to half that by the end of the year, the Ouya team would be well served in the long term to spend the extra $10 to go with Tegra 4. They could sell the Ouya for $120 after release, and it would still sell really well. It would also stay relevant a lot longer and thus have longer legs (continue to sell well into 2014).",,False,self,t5_2uhbj,False,,,True,t3_1dpr7m,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1dpr7m/5060_for_a_tegra_4_upgrade_kit_for_the_ouya_how/,

The one thing that I AM worried about though is that the ""All the games are free to try"" restriction to the OUYA game store. Here's why:

1. I'm worried that this will encourage the trend of Pay-To-Win gaming, which IMO has been one of the biggest detriments to the gaming industry in the past decade.

2. If not Pay-To-Win, then it could encourage the equally annoying release day-DLC trend we're seeing from EA/Bioware and other big names in the industry. 

3. I'm worried that instead of developers thinking ""How do I make this game as awesome as possible?"" they might be thinking ""Well, shoot. How the hell can I meet the Free To Play element so I can get approval??""  I mean, how do you make a demo of an epic RPG? Open world games? 

4. While game like The Walking Dead have proven an episodic format can work. I think we're all agreed that all games don't fit this format. I'm worried that the episodic model could be increasingly a default if the free element is really a requirement of the OUYA.

I'm worried that forcing a free aspect to games will actually limit the development of the games themselves. Where should the efforts of Devs go? To making an awesome game, or trying to make that same game fit a free to play system?

Despite all of the drama surrounding the game, Fez will be a great addition to the system, and is an excellent 2.5d platformer.

[Website](http://www.ansimuz.com/elliotquest/)

This charming game is determined to come to OUYA, as well as other platforms. It has a style reminiscent of Zelda II. It could use more funding, because it will only be a side project for the developer if it doesn't earn enough, but I don't know if it is even technically possible to pre-order OUYA games.

**#1 Strange Happenings on Murder Island**

Winner of the Create Game Jam, this game looks to be one of the most interesting and unique games for the OUYA, as well as being an exclusive, but very little info is available about the game. The developer just greenlit a game on steam, so it is likely it will take awhile till Strange Happenings hits OUYA

1372660017.0,37,self.ouya,1heuqy,Thoughts after a weekend with my Ouya,47,10,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1heuqy/thoughts_after_a_weekend_with_my_ouya/,"So I was a backer of the Ouya and finally got it last Thursday, but since I have to slave for the man, I only had a chance to really play over the weekend, so wanted to share my thoughts.

GETTING MY OUYA:
Firstly, there was the issue of delivery, as I received 1 email saying I would receive another email confirming order and postal tracking number and my Ouya would arrive within 2 weeks. However, 2 weeks later and I still hadn't received the confirmation email for my tracking number.

I wasn't alone, as many people know, which was frustrating, but 3 weeks after that first email, I did get my tracking number and confirmation it was on it's way.

1 week later, my Ouya finally arrived. So from receiving the first email titled #myouyaiscoming until receipt took about 1 month.

However, I am still waiting for my limited edition faceplate, but it is purely aesthetic, so I'm not too concerned now.

GETTING STARTED:
So, pop the batteries in the controller, plug the Ouya in and off we go.

Here's the first thing to note; I have to connect to my buildings internet and enter a login and password to connect. Since the Ouya requires a download on first start up, I couldn't open a web browser in order to login, so I had to connect my Ouya to my phones wifi hotspot instead.

Once I was over the hurdle however, I connected back to my apartments wifi. Then under SYSTEM - ACCOUNT - NOTIFICATIONS, I can click SIGN IN TO INTERNET or something, which brings up the browser for me to login. However, navigating around this browser is a pain in the arse.

It seems impossible to edit the text field without using the trackpad on the Ouya controller, but I guess I could also use a wireless mouse or even possibly with Blue Board, but I haven't used this yet.

It would be better if the browser was easier to navigate, rather than using the D-pad to move a page up or down then the tracking pad to click on things spread over the page.

So now I was signed in I thought I would be good to go, but for some reason when I tried to look in the Ouya ""DISCOVER"" store, it acted like I still wasn't connected to the net. I waited about 5 mins and then it seemed to work though.

DOWNLOADING AND PLAYING:
Downloading games is easy enough, just click and go, but while there is a bar at the top of each game tile showing the DL progress, there is no single place to view pending downloads.

Also, it would seem that downloads only DL in the background when not actually playing a game. However, that may just be my internet connection or something.

GAMING:
I haven't experienced any issues really when playing games. A couple of times a game has crashed and kicked me back to the home screen, but all in all I have been very impressed with the speed at which games load and the ease with which you can return to the home screen (long press Ouya button and then basically straight back home).

Some of the games are amazing (Towerfall, Hidden In Plain Sight and Super Crate Box are probably the ones I've played the most) and the all have some element of free, but can be upgraded for various prices. Some games like Towerfall cost $15, but personally I feel it will be worth it. Other games are cheaper and some games give you the option of how much you want to pay, like Hidden In Plain Sight. Actually, I chose to only pay 99C for this game and already feel like a cheapskate, so will probably donate more when the burden of guilt weighs too heavily.

Since I only got 1 controller, I easily connect my PS3 controller and am able to play some (not all) games using the PS3 controller. Actually, the Ouya controller isn't great, so I would recommend this option when available.

CONTROLLER:
As mentioned above, you can play a lot of games using PS3 (and other manufacturers) controllers, which I was really impressed with, especially how easy it was to connect (PnP).

But the Ouya controller itself seems to have some lag issues and sometimes does random things like always go left. But these are intermittent faults and I'm not sure whether Ouya's fault or developers fault.

CONCLUSION:
All in all, I'm really happy with my Ouya and can't recommend it enough. Yes it does have some faults, most of which I probably haven't encountered yet, but I think it is very almost the complete package of what I was looking for in a gaming console of this kind, which is short, casual, creative games and potential for a whole lot more.

Also, I didn't touch my PS3 and my newly purchased The Last of Us all weekend, which certainly says something about the draw of this platform.

People say the Ouya has potential, which I completely agree with, but in my opinion, even if no new features were added, I'd be pretty happy with the little box that can.

TL;DR - Yes some things are a pain in the arse, like delivery wait, but by Jupiter the wait was worth it.

1369652501.0,36,self.ouya,1f4rgi,Adding sideloaded apps to the Play menu - how to,39,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1f4rgi/adding_sideloaded_apps_to_the_play_menu_how_to/,"I got my OUYA today and found that finding sideloaded apps is not as easy as it should be so I have found a way to add the apps I've installed to the play menu. It looks like the check to include the apps in the play menu is quite simple, all the launcher does is check the installed APKs and compares a few things against 2 xml files and a sqlite3 db.

You will need to have your OUYA rooted for this to work. To root your OUYA see the instructions [here](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2270589). You will also need to know your way around the command line and understand unix permissions. 

**Do not do this if you are not confident working with a root shell. If you brick your OUYA there is no way to recover at the moment.**

**Step 1 - Make them pretty**

This step can be skipped if you don't care about how your apps look but by default the OUYA tries to load a resource file from the apk called ouya_icon.png. if this does not exist is uses the app icon on a grey background which I think is ugly. If you have an apk you can edit it before loading it on the OUYA to fix this.

First you want to download and extract [apktool](https://code.google.com/p/android-apktool/) then extract the apk. Open a command window and use the following

    cd c:\path\to\apktool
    apktool.bat d --keep-broken-res c:\path\to\xbmc.apk c:\path\to\new\xbmcfolder

this will extract the apk (c:\path\to\xbmc.apk) to a new folder created at c:\path\to\new\xbmcfolder

Once that is done you want to create a folder in c:\path\to\new\xbmcfolderres\drawable-xhdpi and put a png in that folder called ouya_icon.png. I used this [one](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SsljBO_BVkc/UCWySvpPDdI/AAAAAAAABK4/JVaydal48B8/s1600/xbmc_grub.png) found with a quick google search.

You can now pack the apk file back up with the following:

    cd c:\path\to\apktool
    apktool.bat b c:\path\to\new\xbmcfolder c:\path\to\xbmc-repacked.apk

You now need to sign the apk so it can be loaded. I followed the instructions [here](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2213985). Download this [file](http://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1846095&amp;d=1364661948), extract the contents then in a command window do the following

    cd c:\path\to\extracted\files\
    java -jar signapk.jar certificate.pem key.pk8 c:\path\to\xbmc-repacked.apk c:\path\to\xbmc-signed.apk

This will sign your apk. You can now sideload your new edited apk file and it will have a pretty icon as seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/hZe5I21.png).

**Step 2 - Add to play menu**

For this step we are going to edit 2 xml files and a sqlite3 db. I'm going to assume you know how to edit text files on the OUYA and get files off/on the OUYA. If you do not you should probably not be messing around with this as **if you brick your OUYA you can not fix it**. 

the 3 files that need editing are:

    /data/data/tv.ouya.console/shared_prefs/PackageNameTitles.xml
    /data/data/tv.ouya.console/shared_prefs/app_sizes.xml
    /data/data/tv.ouya/databases/AppVersions

PackageNameTitles.xml is pretty simple, it just relates package names to a human readable name. 

app_sizes.xml related the OUYA store UUID to the size of the apk file. This is the only real check that the OUYA does to verify the file is what is says it is. 

AppVersions is an sqlite3 db that has one table in it. It relates the package name to the OUYA UUID and the human readable name.

First get a root shell on your console up, this can be done with SSH, adb or by running a terminal on your OUYA. Type the following commands

    ls -laF /data/app

this will give you an output like this 

    -rw-r--r-- system   system     965715 2013-05-27 05:14 com.explusalpha.Snes9xPlus-1.apk
    -rw-r--r-- system   system   53593422 2013-05-27 09:07 org.xbmc.xbmc-1.apk
    -rw-r--r-- system   system    4078511 2013-05-27 01:10 stericson.busybox-1.apk

if you get a permission denied error make sure you have a root console. From this we need the package name (org.xbmc.xbmc) and the size of the package (53593422)

Edit the sqlite3 database, you can use the sqlite3 official tools or a gui browser like [SQLite Database Browser](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlitebrowser/). Add a row to the app_versions table with the following:

    package_name: org.xbmc.xbmc
    installed_version: 818a3079-dcc1-4c35-bd7a-93482d31ce6d
    name: XBMC

The UUID I've listed above is one I generated by changing the Canabalt UUID slightly. You can use anything as long as it is a valid UUID and it does **not** exist in the OUYA store. The package name has to be the one we noted from above. The name is just a human readable name for the APK. All the other values in the row can be left blank.

Once this is done edit PackageNameTitles.xml. You need to add the following line between &lt;map&gt; and &lt;/map&gt;

    &lt;string name=""org.xbmc.xbmc""&gt;XBMC&lt;/string&gt;

The name has to be the package name we used in the sqlite3 db and noted from above. The value is just the human readable name we used in the sqlite3 db.

Last up edit the app_sizes.xml file. Add the following line between &lt;map&gt; and &lt;/map&gt;

    &lt;long name=""818a3079-dcc1-4c35-bd7a-93482d31ce6d"" value=""53593422"" /&gt;

This name needs to be the same as the UUID you used in the sqlite3 db and the value is the size we got from the /data/app directory.

**Back up the original files on the OUYA** and replace them with the newly edited files. Make sure the owner and the permissions are the same, if they are not bad things could happen. On my OUYA the xml files are owned by u0_a18 and have 660 permissions. The db is owned by u0_a29 and has 660 as well. 

Now kill the OUYAFramework and the OUYALauncher from the apps menu in Settings &gt; Advanced. When you back out of the settings menu the OUYA should relaunch the launcher.

If you did all of the above correctly you should have XBMC in your play menu like [so](http://i.imgur.com/xNnCUrE.png). YAY! That was a lot of work for such a small pay off. If you try to get details on XBMC you should see a toast notification saying ""Invalid Uuid was provided"" as the item does not exist in the OUYA store.

I've also found that if you uninstall the app from the android app manager it will clean the information out the sqlite3 db but not the 2 xml files.",,False,self,t5_2uhbj,False,,,True,t3_1f4rgi,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1f4rgi/adding_sideloaded_apps_to_the_play_menu_how_to/,

I'm asking for peoples honest take on the situation. Over the past 10 months watching this process I have felt my own impression of this company really sour. 


Right now for me it feels that while yes, they promised these systems to us last year, I imagine they also promised systems to retail stores last year too. They have a contract with 'both' of us, and a contract for presumably thousands of systems with a retail partner such as Best Buy is probably alot more attractive for them to honor. Quite possibly because the experienced retail partner is far more familiar with protecting their contracted interests legally when compared to the average pre-ordering / kickstarting end user.


That kind of is what it is, I don’t even want to blame OUYA for that, but I cant get beyond this feeling that they have been straight up contemptuous of the individuals who supported them into being here in the first place. There has been no honest, upfront communication with customers. Posting on their own blogs and occasional comments on social media acknowledging slipping delivery dates and opining their difficulties do not constitute treating customers with respect. WHERE were the emails?


Now, Kickstarter backers are engaging with a company and reward tiers on a crowd funding site, there are multiple warnings about the lack of responsibility on different parties behalves when we pledge or 'buy' a product in its Kickstarter stage.


I almost feel worse for the pre-order customers, any who bought while they were still busy assuring April, then pre-launch delivery dates. There is no disclaimer at that point, that you're dealing with a company that may or may not actually honor the promise they are selling. OUYA took money without a disclaimer. They didn’t have to take pre-orders on their website. They could have focused on honoring the Kickstarters who gave them life and then stocking shelves for the retail launch.


They got greedy, they didn’t cross their t's and dot their i's, they took customers money and I get this feeling that the tone at their office right now is just "" Everyone will forget about the awful fulfillment problems a couple of months after launch we just have to make it through with as few scrapes and concessions as possible guys"". They misrepresented their position. They lied.


Customer support is all but non existent. "" They will get back to you in 2-3 business days "" , do you mean Venusian business days? If you actually hammer and call out the CEO on her personal twitter channel she may direct someone to treat you as if you’re a real person. What the fuck is that? It's so incredibly sleazy.


I cant look at this in any way that makes me feel anything but gross about OUYA and the prospect of supporting the company and the platform into the future. I just cant come onboard with the #patience sentiment, they haven’t done ANYTHING at all to justify affording them extra patience and understanding.

It would be interesting if Ouya made an app for Android devices that allowed them to interact with the Ouya like Xbox Smart Glass (web browse in the TV using the phone, adds extra gaming info to the experience, etc.) but also allowed you to sync games you are playing on your phone with your Ouya via wifi. This way you can play a game on the Ouya and if you have the same game on your phone it will sync your save data and you can play it on the go, right from where you left off. The benefit is that you already have an Android phone and that you already have games. What if the Ouya app had a gamecenter-like feature as Android has been been missing a well organized Nexus for ALL of your games. I also would love for some type of seamless interface between my mobile Android device and the Ouya. The Ouya being open source, this could be a definite possibility.

(2) Groomsmen Gifts: i'm getting married in the near future, and my friends almost all have little kids. I know they'd like their kids to grow up with the same games they did. Ouya + emulators are probably at a good price point for that.

I've tested ROMs from Pokemon Platinum to Mario Kart  and others and it just works amazingly. Its called DraStic and it just blows NDS4droid out of the water. The thing is it has to be sideloaded but I found that it reads input from the Ouya controller so you can map the controls to the controller. 

Anyway, heres the video of me setting it up on my Ouya (sorry for my thumb and shitty quality)

Notes/recommendations:

Under configure options

-Check Mult-threaded 3D rendering

-Under input, check a ""no mapping box"" then click Map keys

-Disable mapped keys in overlay (removes on screen controls)

-Check autosave

-Check Savestate overwrite needs confirmation

-I recommend playing games that primarily rely on controls, rather than touch

-To find bios files, search in google (be sure to save them to Download folder of Ouya)

""Still, some of you told us you’d have loved to get a developer kit – but they were just too expensive...

But for now, we want to help some of you great developers out there who may not have been able to afford a dev console. And we want to get more of you making games ready for OUYA’s launch…""

To me, this seemed like a very awesome contest to have. OUYA would get a lot of twitter attention and in return some developers very much in need of some help would get dev kits.

What seemed to happen is OUYA mostly picked teams that either had popular products that surely made them enough money to afford an $800 dev kit (seeing as they are functioning companies) or teams that weren't even considering making an OUYA game until the contest appeared and only offered a port of their game in return for winning.

Of the chosen developers, only a small few seemed like they could really benefit from an OUYA dev kit. Starbound is by the developers of Terraria, a game that I know at least 60 of my friends purchased, so how can it be that they couldn't afford a dev kit? The team behind Dusty Revenge will be making a spin off specifically for Ouya, according to a comment on Facebook. That doesn't sound like something they'll be able to accomplish by the launch of OUYA. As a developer myself and having worked in the game industry for almost 8 years, $800 for a developer kit is damn easy for any established company, like most of the winners were.

I was really hoping OUYA would pick only teams that actually couldn't afford a dev kit, but had promise. All in all, I was a little disappointed to see established companies be the majority when there are hopeful developers out there that couldn't actually afford one.

That's my opinion, now let's talk!

Does anyone else think they strayed from what they said their intentions were?

Which of the chosen games are you most excited about?

Which ones do you think will actually make a product ready for the launch of Ouya?

Are there any developers here who couldn't afford a Dev Kit and is on track to have a game ready for around OUYA's launch? (I may be able to help you)",,False,self,t5_2uhbj,False,,red,True,t3_154t95,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/154t95/did_the_dev_kit_contest_lose_sight_of_its/,

This would probably be just fine, if it weren't for keyboards.  

If your keyboard is already plugged into the OUYA when you turn it on, it seems that it automatically registers itself as Controller #1, meaning whichever controller you turn on after that will be Controller #2.  With the aforementioned games and several others, this means that your gamepad WILL NOT WORK to control the game because it thinks it is controller #2 and basically just ignores its input.

With a built in browser and several apps on their way that make use of keyboards (XBMC is one example), many Ouya owners will likely want to leave their wireless keyboards plugged in.  Removing your keyboard fixes this issue, but it's a hassle, and some games require a restart of the OUYA before they will work.  I don't like having to get up and walk over to the TV each time I need to plug in/unplug the keyboard, and as a bonus, unplugging the keyboard while the Ouya is turned on often causes the Ouya to freeze.

So, I beg of you dear game devs: try to fix this issue!  No, it's not crippling, and no, most people probably won't use a keyboard, but it seems like an avoidable situations that would greatly please those of us that DO use a keyboard!

1371436771.0,29,self.ouya,1ghne3,[FIX] Decrease joystick wear on OUYA Controllers,33,4,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1ghne3/fix_decrease_joystick_wear_on_ouya_controllers/,"**TL;DR**:  600-grit Silicon (silicone) Carbide sandpaper

It's that simple.

[Album](http://imgur.com/a/GOCur)

I received my OUYA about one week ago and have used it every day.  I noticed a few days ago that the plastic joystick has been wearing down very rapidly, like in [this post](http://redd.it/1exrzr); MUCH more rapidly than an XBOX 360 controller.  I found this is due to the joystick making contact to the aluminum front of the battery cover.  If you remove the cover and feel around the edge of the joystick hole you will notice that the aluminum is VERY jagged.  This jagged portion is right where the plastic joystick meets the case.

I figured this jagged edge could be smoothed out, so I Googled what the best type of sandpaper for aluminum is and came across silicon(e) carbide sandpaper.  I went to the hardware store and picked up some [3M Wet/Dry 600-grit Ultra Fine Sandpaper](http://www.amazon.com/Wet-Dry-Ultra-Fine-Sandpaper/dp/B0000AXT76).

To smooth the edge, I cut a few 2.25"" x 1"" pieces of sandpaper, took the face plates off, and using my index finger put a piece of sandpaper through the hole and started sanding!  Note: do this over a trashcan, and wash your hands afterwards. I did circular and back/forth (through the hole at an angle) motions until it felt smooth.

There's no way to actually prove that this decreases the wear on the joysticks but common sense would tell you that it would.  I would suggest doing this on your left joystick hole and your right half-joystick hole.  After sanding the edge I noticed the joystick feels smoother rubbing along the edge in comparison to not being sanded.

I hope this fix helps you enjoy more gaming time with your OUYA controllers! :D

1368568290.0,29,self.ouya,1ecbxa,Calling it right now - there is literally no chance whatsoever that Ouya will ship out all of the pre-retail units by the end of May.,71,42,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1ecbxa/calling_it_right_now_there_is_literally_no_chance/,"It's now May 14th and supposedly as of the end of last week 65% of all ""early backer"" units have actually left the warehouse.  The numbers, in my most humble opinion, just don't support this.  I am calling it right now: Ouya will not have all of these units shipped by the end of May, two months after the original promised shipment day by the way.  They've hemmed and hawed for 6 weeks now, stretching the definition of ""shipped"" to ridiculous levels where backers are receiving ""pre-shipment"" emails 3 weeks before they have a working tracking number.

Counting just the 63,400+ Kickstarter backers, that means that 41,210 units should be shipped, or lets say conservatively 30,000 units in backer hands.  Let's say you don't buy the isouyashipping.com numbers, which at last glance show less than 5% of Ouya's received to date.   Fair enough.  A quick look at Ebay shows that only 3-4 units sell per day.  This traffic is, to me, indicative of something on the order of 3000-5000 units actually in the wild.  The actual number could be much lower.  Of course I don't have any hard stats to back this up but as an Ebay power seller I have a pretty good intuition about these things.  The Ouya is worth $150-$200 on Ebay, and based on the lukewarm at best reviews the Ouya is getting, there is no way just 3-4 people a day take a $50-100 payday on the Ouya (assuming, again, that there are 30-40K units in the wild).  For the record I have three orders, one of which is in the 1200 range, that have not shipped.  I don't even have a ""pre-shipment notification"" for any of these three orders.

So wait for it.. as we draw near the end of the month and Ouya realizes that their little secret ramp-up-at-the-last-minute plan didn't work out as expected, there will be new misdirection, yet another obvious shifting of the goalposts which the Ouya PR team will again play off as an incredible victory and somehow exceeding forecasts.

I don't see Ouya coming clean on any of this because it does them no good to do so.  If I were their business advisor I would tell them to do exactly what they are doing.  BS the Kickstarters, because they're already in, you have their cash.  In the end when they have their unit they'll forget alllll about how long they had to wait while having their strings pulled the entire time.  The prospect of losing PR steam on being the next big thing is too great if you come clean regarding manufacturing difficulties early on.  The last thing they need is to be written off before the retail launch, especially now that venture capital is on the line.

And, to clarify, it's not the wait but rather the string pulling that really irks me.  It's too bad that Ouya had to become a large enough company so quickly that they seemingly lost the ability to be honest with the people that made this launch possible.  So if you will permit me a moment of immaturity:

I asked in the previous post but no one responded. So I'm creating a new post in the hopes we can create some progressive dialogue.
 
We realize that some feature partners we've received (like OnLive and VEVO) don't work in several international countries. If you check their websites - both companies state they're trying everything they can to expand their reach.
 
That said, I'd like to ask you all again:

**However**: the KS pitch for the console was heavy on the concept of modding and tinkering. I was honestly expecting SU access to be provided by the company.  That is clearly not the case so i am relying on third party modders to provide the fixes, which work great. In response, the ouya pushes out mandatory, un-deferrable updates which force me to re-root every single time just so i can update my Play store apps.

I know from a lot of posts developers are craving users feedback on their games. 
So what we could do is every week feature one r/ouya user's game that all of us download and try and provide feedback on. Of we limit it to one game a week it wouldn't be too much of a commitment in terms of time and I know for a fact it would mean an awful lot to the developers to get user feedback. You never know you might just have some fun playing a game you never tried before! And with your feedback you can help improve it further.

Developers interested: please reply or message me with your game and I'll post a new thread every Friday with one game. In the interest of fairness I will not feature my own game. No need to provide any background or instructions, new users on the ouya won't have that. Like some of the feedback can be on your presentation of the game on the store.

I see this might be a problem if there are more games and technically ALL games are listed on one page. But can't the box art and name be cached some how? For a few days at least. Let them display the last cached version and check in the database for updated art and only reload that.
If that's not possible then make two tabs or so (one level above) so there's like ""featured / people's playlists"" or whatever and genres, where all genres are listed as seperate categories and you can zip through all the games with ease.

And decided that I would post an honest review.  I would first like to start of by saying, I am 14 Y/O and have been begging my parents for an ouya since the kickstarter units showed up on ebay.  I knew about the console long before that though.  I had read about it when the kickstarted first started, I knew that I wasn't going to ""Back"" them at the time, mainly because at that time I had no money.  I thought the idea was incredible, an open sourced, fully hackable android console, that would be awesome to have!  I already had the Galaxy s3 and thought that having every game the phone could play on the tv would really cool.  Alright, so on june 25th, the release date in the us, we were in bestbuy, I had completely forgot about the ouya at that point.  I was walking in the game isle, when I saw that they had an ouya set up on a demo tv.  I was really excited to try it out.  I started playing it, and I was really dissapointed.  The games that were installed were very simple, and not very fun.  I wound up leaving bestbuy, and looking up more advanced consoles.  Later that week we drove back up to were the best buy was, my dad handed me the money for the ouya and told me to go buy it.  I was so exited!  We took it home, set it up, and started to install some emulators, apps, sideloaded content, xbmc, and abunch of other stuff.  It was so cool to play super mario bros, galaga, space invaders and so many more games on such an affordable console.  It was amazing!  The only issues I have seen so far, were easily fixed with a quick google search.  We also watch hd movies almost every night through xbmc, which is great as well.  If you are thinking about purchasing an ouya, I would definitly recommend purchasing one, it is well worth $99!

First off, As many of you may remember, I made a post a week ago called '3 hours with the Ouya'.  

In this post, I talked about how easily I was able to setup a few things in a quick 3 hours and mentioned that I was going to share the Ouya with a few close friends alongside a BBQ that evening. At the end of the post, I asked the /r/ouya community to suggest a few multiplayer games that I should try in order to provide my friends with a fun multiplayer experience and you guys delivered. Thank you!  

Now, there were two games in particular that kept us busy until 2am and one of them actually came as a great surprise- Hidden in Plain Sight. For those interested, the other was Bombsquad (which handled 6 players flawlessly).  

Among the replies in my topic, a user by 'AdamSpraggGames' mentioned that I should keep my eyes open for a soon to be released Ouya game called Hidden in Plain Sight. I had never heard of the game nor did I know that this gentleman was actually the creator of the game. A few hours went by during my workday and I received a private message with a link to download the W.I.P .apk from Mr Adam Spragg himself.  

How cool is that!? A developer that is actually willing to share a build release with a complete stranger hoping that I would have it in time for the party. I was surprised and eager to share with my friends that we had access to a game that wasn't yet available on the market.  

Fast forward a few hours into the evening, a couple of beers and cheeseburgers later, and about 3 hours into playing the only two gameplay modes we had available... this game was a hit!  

**Gameplay Description**  
Both gameplay modes were just awesome and we quickly discovered that the game actually offers a lot of strategy for something that appears so simple on the surface. I won't divulge my secrets so you'll have to discover them yourself but be sure to invite a few friends over for some mayhem.  

The game leaves you in the dark at first. There are a ton of sprites on the screen and you have no clue which one you are. A few seconds go by and few movements later and you should have a general idea which one you are... unless an NPC happens to be moving at the same time and direction you are, which does happen more often that you would think. It can mess with your mind a little.  

One of the gameplay modes is like a race to the finish line and you can only move right, slow or fast. However, if you go fast or stutter when someone's crosshairs get near you, you'll be discovered and sniped by another player (each player has just one bullet) since the NPC players cannot run.  Near the end, if everyone manages to keep their wits and stay in a tight group, players start to sprint for the finish and only one will be the winner among the bullets being fired. It's pretty hilarious.
  
The other gameplay mode is also like a race but you can move in all directions and *only* have to touch 5 statues. In this gameplay mode, walking a straight line is a sure fire way to get yourself discovered and killed by another player. Once you have been stabbed, the other player will ideally have to drop a smokebomb and flee the scene so they can act normal (like an NPC) again. The twist is that there is a 'ding' when another player touches a statue so instead of watching your own character all the time, you're actively looking for the others as well. First to touch all 5 statues or kill all of the other players wins.  

For both gameplay modes you really want to remain patient and make your way around the map by acting like your an NPC. Your mannerisms and gameplay style need to be altered in order to succeed in this game. The room is generally quiet and on-edge for the first few minutes of each round, it's pretty intense.

**Dispute among the community**  
A few people have expressed that they desire online multiplayer and to that I say, ""No way!"" This is a game that is best played on the couch with a few friends so the hilarity and trash talking can ensue. Like the good old nostalgic days when consoles lacked an Ethernet port, this game brings back what makes playing a game with friends fun. You'll talk trash, you'll swear at someone and you'll be excited to play it again the next time they come over.

The vibe you would get playing this on the net would be rather drab in comparison. Well done Adam, you have essentially made a game for the Ouya, the way the Ouya was made to be enjoyed.

**In Closing**  
I would like to give a huge thanks to Adam Spragg for being some damn awesome and generous. Thank you so much for introducing me to this amazing game.

**tl;dr:** Get this game, it is so much fun, you won't regret it. Thank you Adam.",,False,self,t5_2uhbj,1369410816.0,,green,True,t3_1ez5sc,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1ez5sc/hidden_in_plain_sight_a_story_about_a_generous/,

HIPS is a local-multiplayer only party game which centers around stealth and craftiness.  Players try to accomplish goals while surrounded by a swarm of randomly moving NPCs.  It's important to blend in, however, because players also can eliminate each other from the game.  Games rounds are short and always end in laughter and usually shouting.  Works with two players, but much better with four (or more, including spectators)

Here is a particularly good demo of the game (long)

1367645306.0,26,self.ouya,1dnyye,Guide to install Superuser permissions on Ouya.,32,6,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1dnyye/guide_to_install_superuser_permissions_on_ouya/,"I know that the Ouya is pre-rooted and you can use su inside of the shell, but I wanted to install superuser so I could install apps that used su permissions without having to do the terminal every time. 

 I am a novice rooter (ie [I have no idea what I'm doing](http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/32427787.jpg)) and I couldn't find a concise guide on how to do it (I hope I didn't just overlook one :S).  So after much deliberation and internet browsing, I finally was able to install Superuser and busybox.  Here's the steps I took.  Maybe it'll help someone else out

**---Stuff to download---**

* [Download/install android sdk](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#win-bundle)
* [Download superuser.apk](http://androidsu.com/superuser/)
* [Download busybox installer.apk](http://www.androiddrawer.com/8867/download-busybox-installer-4-1-app-apk/#inline_content)
* Download some file manager (I used [Astro](http://www.androiddrawer.com/6896/download-astro-file-manager-browser-4-0-430-app-apk/#inline_content))

**---Launch Android SDK Manager---**

  -Install these packages:

* Tools: Including both Android SDK and Android SDK Platform tools
* Android 4.1 (API 16): SDK Platform
* Android 4.0 (API 14): SDK Platform
* Extras: Android Support Library

You will need to modify the file &lt;AndroidSDKRoot&gt;\sdk\extras\google\usb_driver\android_winusb.inf within the Android SDK for your OUYA console to be recognised.

You should locate the section with the title [Google.NTx86] and add the following lines before connecting the console;


;OUYA Console

%SingleAdbInterface% = USB_Install, USB\VID_2836&amp;PID_0010

%CompositeAdbInterface% = USB_Install, USB\VID_2836&amp;PID_0010&amp;MI_01


You should then connect your consoles micro USB port to the USB port of your computer using the appropriate cable. Once it has been connected you should run open up a command prompt in &lt;AndroidSDKRoot&gt;\sdk\platform-tools

Run:

* adb kill-server
* echo 0x2836 &gt;&gt; ""%USERPROFILE%\.android\adb_usb.ini""
* adb start-server
* adb devices
* Your console should be shown in the list of available devices.

*---optional wireless adb access---*

1) connect the Ouya via USB
2) adb tcpip 5555 (if you have more devices connected, you need to specify the Ouya's id)
3) unconnect the Ouya from USB
4) adb connect ip-of-ouya (do not include the port number)

**--Install File Manager---**

* Open up command prompt in /platform-tools/
* adb install /path/of/filemanager.apk

**---change device to read-write---**

* Open up command prompt in /platform-tools/
* adb shell
* su
* mount -o rw,remount -t ext4 /dev/block/platform/sdhci-tegra.3/by-name/APP
* mount -o rw,remount -t ext4 /dev/block/platform/sdhci-tegra.3/by-name/UDA
* mount -o rw,remount -t ext4 /dev/block/platform/sdhci-tegra.3/by-name/CAC

**---replace su file---**

The file that makes the magic happen is the su file that comes in the Superuser.apk download.  It should be located in the /system/bin/ of the files you extracted.

* adb push /pathofwhereyouextractedSuperuser/system/bin/su /sdcard/su/
* adb shell
* su
* cat /sdcard/su &gt; /system/bin/su
* cat /sdcard/su &gt; /system/xbin/su

**---install superuser---**

* adb push /path/of/superuser.apk /sdcard/
* 
* Open up the file manager you installed inside of Ouya, navigate to the sdcard folder, click superuser.apk to install

**---install busybox---**

* adb push /path/of/busyboxinstaller.apk /sdcard/
* Open up the file manager you installed inside of Ouya, navigate to the sdcard folder, click busyboxinstaller.apk to install
* Navigate to busybox installer in your installed programs on the Ouya. Allow superuser permissions, install busybox.



I'm pretty sure that's how I did it.  I am very new to this, so there might be an easier way and I might have skipped a step. Please 
comment if you find something wrong, because I'm sure there's something wrong.  Also, if the instructions are unclear, let me know.

EDIT: I forgot to add some steps in the ""replace su file"" section.

It's small, easy to transport in a carry on bag, and extremely versatile for what I can use it for.

A couple of downsides that I've run into though. 

The updates are annoying, if i connect to any hotel ISP (which many are slow and choppy) I have to either try and disable it or let the download continue which could take a hour or so. If OUYA could have a feature to disable auto updates that would be awesome.

After the updates and trying everything, FAT32 will not read on my system. NTFS works perfect.

No Reddit app.......WTF!

No controller options.

I've compared this to using a WD live box for the same price. And by far XMBC is faster, smoother and less of a headache to load a HDD. Gaming aside, you can not run netflix on a WD live box from most hotel ISPs due to any login screen. You get the same problem loading the OUYA for the first time.

But for the money, if anyone is debating on whether or not to buy, and if you travel for a living. This little device is perfect and only 100$. Beats dragging around a PS3, Xbox 360, or Wii.

1372448750.0,26,self.ouya,1h9o1t,I suspect/fear OUYA killed itself with a bungled launch,65,39,102,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1h9o1t/i_suspectfear_ouya_killed_itself_with_a_bungled/,"First off, I speculate that inferior versions of the OUYA were rushed out to reviewers and backers.  I base this partly on [Ashen's video in which he reviews a ""leaked"" backer version of the OUYA](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf_jmGaanuY) (bad PR in itself that a backer version was sold) and the fact that my experiences do not seem to match up with many of the poor reviews.  

Here are various complaints that are common which I have either not experienced or have been resolved.  Note that I have a retail (pre-order) version of the console and was not a backer.

1. Controller lag - I experienced some odd controller behavior upon first use, but the issue seems to have resolved itself.
2. Uncomfortable/sharp d-pad - the d-pad on the retail version seems fine, isn't sharp, feels comfortable and has been fine in games.
3. Inaccurate sticks - I've not had a console-wide issue with the sticks, though some few games have horrible implementations of the controls.  That, however, is the fault of the games and not the console.
4. Slowness or low framerate - I've used only the software made available via ""Discover"" and have experienced very few performance issues.  In most cases, I would again blame the game/software (such as ""Ravensword: Shadowlands,"" which is a laggy, steamy pile of dung).  Note: Many reviews complain that the OUYA should've waited for the Tegra 4 along with this - hard to argue against that, but I'm not sure it's truly necessary.

These issues would mean death if they couldn't be fixed, but fixed or not won't matter due to the very bad first impressions most reviewers were given overall (obviously, the difference in processor can't be fixed).  Unfortunately, there are a number of other issues that could have been fixed before launch (and surely will be soon) that helped drive all the other nails in the coffin.

1. Unreliable/slow connection to OUYA servers
2. Flaky networking (only seems to like WIFI, and only when it feels like)
3. Organization/presentation of new software
4. Hype/promotion of best software
5. SHIPPING ISSUES, and
6. COMMUNICATION ISSUES (do NOT piss off your supporters and customers, seriously)
7. Pricing of software - While developers are welcome to charge whatever they like, many games ""felt"" overpriced at the beginning.  Many games were $10 to $15 dollars at launch.  On day 2, many of the devs cut their prices in half.  FF3 remains $16 and I will not purchase it at that price, considering I already own the DS version (same 3D engine, btw).
8. Where are the Sonic games?  SEGA was the only other big hitter, the OUYA needs this.

Much of the above could have been resolved given a bit more time before launching.  I feel that they should have probably taken another year or so (if they had the available funding) to allow time for:

1. Tegra 4 upgrade
2. FIX SHIPPING ISSUES
3. Get developer kits out early and get some heavyweight launch titles
4. Hammer down any/all OS issues

It's all over now, unfortunately.  I predict that the OUYA will rapidly fade from the mainstream memory and won't have the necessary momentum to get any big software titles (though it is absolutely capable).  Indie devs will probably avoid it too if the install base isn't significant enough to justify the effort.

At any rate, I am a bit sad about this because I think the OUYA is good and could have done pretty fairly.  I'll be amazed if the OUYA team figure out a way to salvage anything from all this wreckage.  Also, I very much hope that I'm wrong here - I would love to see them succeed.

Eventually we brought out the console so everyone could give it a try. 

The first game I made people try was ""League of Evil"". I'm told its similar to Super Meat Boy, though I've never played that. About 10 of us passed the controller around for an hour or so as the levels got harder. We were all captivated by the screen even as others were playing.

Next my brother pulled up ""No Brakes Valet"". I had seen the game and thought it was stupid...until I played with a second player. Again we spent a ridiculous amount of time playing and passing the controllers around.

Finally, we played Knightmare Tower. I'd played it a few times, but didn't really get into it, until we started buying power-ups. Once we maxed out the demo version, i immediately payed so we could continue. We stayed up until 4am (there were only 3 of us left at this point) trying to beat the game. We got to the final ""boss"" and realized it was 4am and ended up calling it a night.

In the end, im pretty sure just trying a few games won some people over. Also, you should go play each of those games if you haven't already.

1373779799.0,24,self.ouya,1i9fqg,"[How-to] QI4A Android Quake port with enhanced graphics on Ouya (demonstration video, link to APK, and full instructions inside).",31,7,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1i9fqg/howto_qi4a_android_quake_port_with_enhanced/,"I know I've talked about Quake on Ouya quite a bit this last week, but I have put a good chunk of time into contacting the developer of the QI4A Android app and turning this into an Ouya-friendly sideloaded game. I will probably not need to talk about Quake on Ouya (Quya?) for a while now after this. Getting Quake to run at its best on the Ouya was just a pet project of mine stemming from my nostalgia for classic first-person shooters. And nostalgia seems to be what's helping fuel the Ouya community right now.

[So here's a small video of me playing Quake with the enhanced graphics on my Ouya.](http://youtu.be/mumTq43AElw) I also give a few seconds to display the options that get altered in the QI4A app.

**Note:** The steps that follow is how I was able to do it on my Windows 7 PC. I do not know the steps that would need to be taken on Linux or Mac. I have only been able to get medium level graphics to run on the Ouya. High or ultra level graphics won't load and the QI4A app will force close. Also, these instructions assume previous knowledge of sideloading apps.

Follow these steps exactly and you should not come across any problems.

1) Download the Epsilon enhanced graphics build files: http://www.gamefront.com/files/files/21688386/quake_epsilon_12052012.zip (Warning: 2.3GB file)

2) Unzip this file to its own folder (named 'quake_epsilon_12052012').

3) Within this folder, run the file titled 'epsilon - change graphics quality'. A command prompt (DOS) window will pop up.

4) Type in 'm' then hit 'Enter'. You will then see a message displaying '*DONE! Configured graphics to medium settings.*' Hit 'enter' again to exit the prompt.

5) Create a folder on your Ouya's internal memory or your USB drive named 'qi4a'

6) Copy the 'id1' folder (2.5GB of files) to the 'qi4a' folder on your Ouya or USB drive.

7) Download the QI4A APK here: http://www.droidbin.com/p17vddrvhr15vqlla1gorct41hl03 then sideload the QI4A app onto your Ouya.

8) Run the QI4A app on your Ouya. Once loaded, you will see three tabs: GENERAL, CONTROLS, and GRAPHICS

9) Under the GENERAL tab there is a section titled 'Game working directory:'. This should either say '/sdcard/qi4a' (default setting) or you can change it to '/mnt/usbdrive/qi4a' if you copied the game files over to a USB drive.

10) Under the CONTROLS tab, make sure 'Smooth joystick' is checked. Then click on 'Configure on-screen controls'. This is where you will see the control setup usually used for playing on a touchscreen device, such as a phone. Here you can use the trackpad to select the controls then change them so they are completely transparent while playing the game. I just reduced both the size and the opacity until they are are no longer visible. (I had already done this before I made the video.)

11) Under the GRAPHICS tab, make sure the '32-bit' option is checked. Under 'Screen resolution' select 'Custom' and make sure the values are either [640 x 480] or [800 x 600]. Anything else and the game will not display properly or it will end up with a choppy frame rate.

12) Select and click 'Start Game' at the top. After that you will get a loading screen. Loading time may be a couple minutes especially if it's being loaded from a USB drive. Observe the blue bar at the bottom of the screen to estimate loading progress.

Controls: 

The version of the QI4A APK linked in this post is controller independent, no keyboard is required to load, run, or start a single player game. All controls are already mapped to buttons on the Ouya controller.

The Ouya (System) button acts as the 'Esc' key while the U button acts as the 'Enter' key. Pressing the Ouya button at any time will pull up or exit the Quake main menu. You can then use the d-pad to change selections (up/down) and change values (left/right). You can also use the Ouya button to back out of the sub-menus, but **DO NOT** press the Ouya button too quickly in succession or else you will end up exiting out of the game prematurely because of the 'Double tap for Home' feature on the Ouya. 

Left analog stick moves the player forward, back, strafe left or right.

Right analog stick is for aiming. 

R1 to attack.

L1 to jump.

R2 to change to next weapon.

L2 to change to previous weapon.

A button to swim down.

O is the spacebar (used in other Quake games).

Y is unused.

This version is also compatible with the PS3 controller using the correspondingly positioned buttons.

The Quake Epsilon build download only contains the shareware version of Quake. For an enhanced version of the full game, simply copy the 'ID1' folder from the standard Quake PC game files over to the 'quake_epsilon_12052012' folder and merge the files and folders. Then follow the steps above. The full version of Quake is available on Steam (usually for $10 or less) at http://store.steampowered.com/app/2310/.


Also, a very special thanks goes out to n0n3m4, the developer of QI4A, for updating and altering the QI4A app to be more Ouya-friendly. Please take the time to donate a buck or two to him in the hopes that he'll bring his Quake ports to the Discover Store and make them native Ouya apps.",,False,self,t5_2uhbj,1373846194.0,,,True,t3_1i9fqg,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1i9fqg/howto_qi4a_android_quake_port_with_enhanced/,

So I had this idea of giving developers their own specialized written flair. Something that lets users know not only that they are a developer, but also what game they are developing/have developed. This way as other users see it they can go off and find the game in the Ouya Store, or Google search for it, or whatever if they are interested.

This is also a great way for developers to get some free advertisement directly on an Ouya community. The more active you are in the community (publishing posts or comments), the more chances you allow for another user to see your flair, without being intrusive or spammy.

You can apply for this simply by sending me a message. This is completely optional and all that is required is that you are subscribed to our subreddit (can't change your flair if you aren't) and that in your message to me you provide some sort of proof that you're working on the game you claim to be yours.

The color we will use for the flair will be the same as the red 'Elite Developer Backer' as this is the least common used one and stands out best against our Subreddit's theme. The personalizing comes in the form of it saying your game's title + developer. For example, it would read 'Final Fantasy III Developer'.

I let it slide for a while until I felt that their support staff got up to speed before I filed a support request to replace the case. This was about a month ago.

Today with no e-mail notification I received a package from Ouya. They didn't send me a new kickstarter case but they did send me a whole new Ouya in the retail case!

Since I have two controllers already I have two full Ouya systems!

Thanks to Ouya and their support team. They may have some problems but sometimes they not only do what is right but go beyond.

Game developers might want to record a particular moment in their game for a trailer, promotional video or to demonstrate the capabilities of their game. Many games are popularised by youtubers posting “lets play videos”, and reviewers of the OUYA may want to post videos to better illustrate their points about the console and/or games on it

Unfortunately, OUYA uses HDCP, which encrypts video between the OUYA and a compatible TV screen, monitor or whatever else the OUYA HDMI cable is plugged into. Often that other end will be a video capture device that doesn’t support HDCP. However, some devices do support HDCP, making it useless for actually protecting copyrighted material.

What it does do is hurt those legitimate users who might have the wrong type of capture device. Game developers for one having to resort to poor quality camcorder videos of a TV screen or otherwise incur the extra expense of a different capture device (for many small or indie developers, this cost may not be insignificant).

Lets’ play makers are unlikely to go out and buy a new device just for recording OUYA footage, since they will already have a device perfectly fine for other platforms. The end result is that they simply pass over OUYA games and do other games instead, or play the game on another platform and make no mention of it being available on OUYA as well

Reviewers are also not a good group of people to frustrate by putting technological barriers in their way, especially if you want them to give your product a good score

I’ve been surprised on my own youtube channel just how much more effective it has been at reaching a wider audience than other social media. Clearly OUYA has a lot to gain by freeing up video makers to spread the word about OUYA. My hope is that an appeal from the community and the point about the reputation cost and consequent hurt to the bottom line will make OUYA consider making this simple yet effective change in policy

According to the tracking site, it is still located in HK. Went to the customs office this morning, paid ~22€ and took the package with me to the office.
When I unboxed it there, I realised it had the wrong PSU adapter. Well, looks like here is another showstopper... 
Thank god I had an adapter at home so I gave it a try when I came home this evening.

Powered the device and tried some games in the Ouya store. Didn't like it, so I went on and rooted the device (also installed busybox &amp; stuff) and prepared for an evening of sideloading via adb.
Lucky me, a guy on XDA posted today a small package that installed a working Play Store on my Ouya. Yay, even works w/ two-factor auth.

So I went on and installed a couple of paid apps (BubbleUPNP, Nova, BeyondPod, TuneIn Pro etc). All of them are working. Neat! 

Let's see if Google Music works. It is! What about droidmote server? As well? Holy crap!

&gt;It’s not in your living room yet -- and we know that SUCKS.  There are approximately 7,500 early supporters like yourself that are still waiting for their OUYA.  

&gt;You want answers and we want to give them to you.  So here it goes:

&gt;Two weeks ago, we provided an update through Kickstarter that 100% of early backer orders had shipped from Hong Kong.  This was/is a true statement.  All units were manufactured, packaged, and on route to one of our distribution facilities (based on your mailing address).  At these facilities, your OUYA is labeled, scanned, and shipped to your doorstep (hence the 1-2 week delay in receiving your shipping email and activating your tracking code).

&gt;In your case, things didn’t go as planned.  It’s important to note at this point that the cause(s) behind your delayed OUYA isn’t the result of a single point of failure -- rather, it is the result of several small(ish) logistical hurdles (new) that we encountered late in the game. 

&gt;What we do know is that 5,000 units will ship this weekend -- so many of you can expect your first email very soon.  Do not be surprised, however, if it does not have a tracking number.  In that case, you should receive a secondary email (which includes your tracking number) shortly afterwards.

&gt;I don’t expect this to make you feel *much* better (well maybe a little ;). I can tell you that everyone is pushing and working hard and YOU are important to us.  If for whatever crazy reason you do not receive your MY OUYA HAS SHIPPED email by Wednesday (6/12), we will email you.  We will keep you in the loop.  PROMISE.

&gt;Now, go have a great weekend.  I’m getting back to work.

This will open the console up to millions of existing apps. It will require root, but since the console already has root (through ADB), I might try working in an auto-root tool to add app-root functionality when you run the program, too. 

I originally started writing this as a personal app, but I just want to see what kind of interest the community has over this. I'd imagine most people would want this, though.

Edit: I'd also like to add that I have a file browser setup that let's you install packages. This makes it really easy for people to just copy an apk over and install it through my app, instead of setting up ADB and everything.

Edit2: It'll allow button remapping too, so if you don't like how an emulator or game maps buttons, you can always change it.

http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dmykb/hey_reddit_we_are_ouya_founderceo_julie_uhrman/c9rv72s?context=3

**Q:**
Can we get some real, hard numbers on the amount of units that have shipped?

**Uhrman:**  
Shipping -- I knew this would be my first question. ;) As of today we have produced over 50% (just) of our units to satisfy our KS orders....yeah....this includes Limited Edition units, International orders, and orders with multiple controllers. We have finished our first run and thus are now at max capacity -- yeah. On track to deliver everything by end of May ahead of retail. I don't have exact numbers as there are units coming off lines, in transit, on planes and in cars heading to doors -- just the reality of how this works but big picture we're shipping.

http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dmykb/hey_reddit_we_are_ouya_founderceo_julie_uhrman/c9rv824?context=3

**Q:**
Are there any side projects you guys are working on with the ouya? Any new accesories? and also, congrats! I'm waiting for my Ouya to get here.

**Uhrman:**  
We have only 1 project -- getting our first product out :). We're bluetooth so you can pair other devices. We are coming up with a list that work on OUYA and will post when we finish it.

**Q:**
What social features do you have planned (achievements, friends lists etc) and how will they be integrated with the system? Also well done guys you've done a great job, can't wait to get mine in the post :P

**Uhrman:**  
You're awesome thank you....social is an ""after launch"" feature. And as such would love to know from you what's most important. We're talking to devs to get their take as well...

http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dmykb/hey_reddit_we_are_ouya_founderceo_julie_uhrman/c9rvc9o?context=3

**Q:**
1) Why is the site www.isouyashipping.com so incredibly different from what you're telling us? That sample size should not differentiate as much as it does without something significant.  

2) Also, why does it seem that most of the people are receiving their Ouyas and shipping information are on the West cost of the US rather than anywhere else in the country? Are you actually shipping there first and if so, why?  

**edit followup:** Why has ""we're shipping by backer number"" resounded as a response to shipping questions, yet it doesn't seem to be the case at all? 
 
3) Lastly, do you think the future versions of Ouya will keep the same price point of $99? And in additon to that, will you still sell the older versions at a discounted price?

Thanks for doing an AMA, I think it's something everyone wanted to see.  


**Uhrman:**  
Great questions, let me take them 1 by 1....

1) It's a great site and idea -- but it requires folks to tell them (the site) that they've received their OUYA. Unfortunately, not everyone does. We know what we've shipped/made and that's what we report.

2) Don't know why. We're shipping everywhere. Maybe more folks on the West Coast bought them :). Being from CA this makes me happy :).

3) Really just focused on OUYA 1.0 :) but our plan is to sell OUYAs as inexpensively as we can so you can play, play, play.

**Q:**
Is the OUYA a good alternative to something like the Roku in terms of non-gaming entertainment?

**Uhrman:**  
Yes, we will have Apps -- super excited. To date we have announced: TwitchTV, Vevo, iheartradio TuneIn, Flixster, Crunchyroll, XBMC, and Plex...more coming in daily, literally. I have a Kellee Santiago for non-games too :). OUYA can be your everything box.

**Q:**
I'm backer 4588, and I haven't received my Ouya or notification, how does a backer in the 50k and over get her Ouya before me?

**Uhrman:**  
Could be a number of things....did you have the Limited Edition or multiple controllers or based outside the US? We just started making this last week so that could answer it...if no, then ya I'll look into it.

**Q:**
Why did you delete a tweet telling customers to get refunds by issuing a chargeback? Proof: http://i.imgur.com/Hacz7am.png An email chain to OUYA support also confirms this method http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3532967&amp;pagenumber=260#post41477816

**Uhrman:**  
Because we found a way to do it which was much simler and easier -- so everyone is happy. And if you're not happy we will find a way.

**Q:**
Why so much emphasis on press and media coverage, rather than going out and actually meeting developers (No GDC booth? Why not more things like the IGDA Chicago) ?

**Uhrman:**  
Hey there -- Devs are super important to us. Without games we have no gamers. I've been on a roadshow since last year talking to devs:
IGDA Seattle IGDA NY IGDA Atlanta IGDA Austin IGDA Chicago IGDA Montreal
More to come -- but I have the frequent flyer miles to prove it :)

**Q:**
Simple question: If the Ouya is released in June and Kickstarter Backers have not received their shipment. How about us, the pre-orderers ? :) (I was too late to be a backer)

**Uhrman:**  
You will get yours before retail too -- we promised and we will deliver!

**Q:**
Why should I choose Ouya over one of the numerous android tv sticks on the market?

**Uhrman:**  
Ah. I could write about this for the next 38 minutes :)

GAMES...GAMES...GAMES -- we have over 100 games, over 12,000 developers and more of each coming in each day. We are seeing every type of genre and gameplay that we know and love plus so super fun ones from new developers -- what I love today Polarity, Dub Wars, No Brakes Valet, Knightmare Tower....super fun...

Developers -- exclusive games!!!! Kim Swift, Tripwire, Double Fine....

Powerful and beautiful console -- just wait until you pick up your controller!

http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dmykb/hey_reddit_we_are_ouya_founderceo_julie_uhrman/c9rvqhu?context=3

**Q:**
Being an open console, could we get more insight into the manufacturing process? How many have been made so far? What have some of the challenges been in getting the hardware from design to reality? I know many of us are very interested in how this has gone from concept to product.

**Uhrman:**  
Great question -- they don't call it HARDware for nothing. It's a lot of wor to get right and we're doing it in an incredibly condensed timeframe which means we count on everything being perfect.

We have 3 different partners we are coordinating -- console manufacturer, controller manufacturing, and a supplier for the aluminum. They all have to work together -- this doesn't include the multiple logistics partners that get our product between vendors in China, then to you, distributors, retailers, etc. It's a dance and when one is off it slows everything down.

Also, it was important for us to ramp production so we could actively be involved in the quality review and control of our product. We didn't want to product 10k bad units day one. I'd rather that be 10 and then we fix and the next day it's 100 great. This was always the plan -- we just started later in March than we expected thus our continued rolling shipments today through May.

http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dmykb/hey_reddit_we_are_ouya_founderceo_julie_uhrman/c9rvr79?context=3

**Q:**
Will OUYA be sold in stores, or purely online distribution?

**Uhrman:**  
Both! We will in retail in the US, Canada, and UK for launch -- specifically BestBuy, Gamestop, Game, and Target. Online at Amazon and OUYA.tv

•

http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dmykb/hey_reddit_we_are_ouya_founderceo_julie_uhrman/c9rvs2y?context=3

**Q:**
Can we boot the Ouya with the Controller?

**Uhrman:**  
Nope, not today. There is a button on the top of the OUYA that turns it on.

•

http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dmykb/hey_reddit_we_are_ouya_founderceo_julie_uhrman/c9rvx14?context=3

**Q:**
Will you be fixing the Controller issues reported by Joystiq? (sticky directional sticks, buttons getting caught under faceplate).
These issues are complete deal-breakers for me. I will not buy the console if the controllers are bad.
Thank you.

**Uhrman:**  
Already fixed! The sticky directional stick was a result of some glue seeping out during manufacturing -- found it and fixed immediately.
Buttons, that was interesting. Didn't realize it until you told us about that -- great to have a preview period. We went about increasing the size of the opening for the buttons so no more sticking under the faceplates.
We also started shipping faceplates with tape so they don't fall off during transit.

This is exactly why we had the preview period -- to learn what we didn't know and continue to make OUYA better. Same improvements are happening on the software side. We're polishing, cleaning up bugs, and improving our performance/speed. June is looking great!

**Q:**
If you're having difficulty fulfilling a mere 60k backer units, how are you going to be ready for retail next month?

**Uhrman:**  
It's about ramp. You do more each week as you dial in the process, get people trained, and confirm the quality of the product is what you want it to be. That is why we are above our weekly goal, bc each week we are able to do more. The plan is to be at full capacity next week.

I'm embarrassed by you Reddit.

http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dmykb/hey_reddit_we_are_ouya_founderceo_julie_uhrman/c9rw2fz?context=3

**Q:**
Hello! I have a few questions:

1. I haven't heard much about OnLive. Do you happen to know the status of that? Will it actually happen?  
2. When are the pre-orders set to ship?  
3. What's your favorite OUYA game that you have played?  
4. It is said that it can be easily modded. What kinds of things did you have in mind for people to do when you made it that way?

Thanks!!!

**Uhrman:**  
Hey there --- thanks for you questions....Here we go.
1) We are working closely with them to bring OnLive to OUYA. There is mutual interest to make it happen.

2) Kickstarter units are shipping now. Pre-orders from OUYA.tv will ship after but all will hit before retail.

3) Favorite game -- I'm really digging Knightmare Tower right now but daughter (she's 4 1/2) loves Puddle so we play that a lot. She also kicks my ass in Canabalt and Vector.

4) That's kind of the best part -- I didn't OUYA to be limited by my creativity so by opening it up stuff I haven't even thought about will happen....

**Q:**
Do you consider it a cop-out that you were able to meet your initial ship date, but the actual shipping of units is spread across several months? Out of the 5 people I personally know that backed you guys (including myself) no one has received their console.

**Uhrman:**  
I am SUPER proud of my team! We started shipping when we promised, in March. I wish it was earlier but we did it. We are building and shipping daily now. I am really proud of what they have accomplished -- an amazing feat from going from an idea to a great product in 9 months -- THEY DO THE IMPOSSIBLE EVERY DAY...I am humbled.

•

http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dmykb/hey_reddit_we_are_ouya_founderceo_julie_uhrman/c9rw5gr?context=3

**Q:**
The first 10 questions are in relation to orders not being fulfilled yet. Coincidence?

**Uhrman:**  
No -- people want their units. We are almost at full capacity -- next week. Everyone will get their units before retail launch. We are literally 24/7 over here. I get the frustration but know we are pushing hard (and I won't sacrifice quality).

Oh and you will get yours before retail....PROMISE.

**Q:**
What would you do differently if you could time travel and do these last 6 months all over again?

**Uhrman:**  
OMG, great question and boy do I long for the day I have time to think about this -- I am in love with my team and what we've accomplished. My partners have been amazing (Yves, SurfaceInk, NVIDIA, etc) and have really killed themselves. Plus we have manufactures treating us like the big boys vs a no name start up -- all pretty amazing in my experience.

I will say I have learned a lot about manufacturing and shipping/logistics. We've experienced the natural growing pains as any new company building a HW product. I feel we've gotten threw them pretty well as we hit our Dev console ship date and Kickstarter date, but, knowing what I know now I could have planned a bit differently and really just asked different questions.

We are moving incredibly fast but so proud of what we have done. AND what makes it all worthwhile is you -- believing in us and trusting us to deliver for you. Albeit not as fast as you'd like but you still believe in us. AND the games are awesome.

A lot of people aren't happy with how the D-Pad currently is, and the Ouya devs do acknowledge this. I am a little worried that they still will make a bad choice regarding what to use due to lack of input and poor input. 

I think we should help them with this decision since it will ultimately affect us. Keep in mind the games and genres where you'd use the D-pad instead of the analog (fighting games for me). Keep in mind your favorite type of D-pad from previous systems or gamepads. What D-pad do you want to see? Personally, Playstation has it right for me. My biggest issue is accuracy and consistency and I thought that Playstation did it best, and Xbox probably the worst.

Overplayed is an Android client that works over the network so you can turn your Android phone into a controller with On-Screen buttons.

My friend works in Japan. He runs an expory company and does work for some of the big mobile phone companies, too. He encouraged me to back ouya after he did. Here's (with his permission) his opinion:

""... I bet I know what the Chinese shipping company is doing. 

According to Julie, Ouya prepaid shipping in USD quite some time ago, but since that time, the USD has dropped in value. 

I bet you that the Chinese company still has ouya's money in USD, and is trying to time when to sell dollars for Won so they don't get raped on the FOREX.

I have the same dilemma in my company- we are sitting on about 100,000 USD, but don't want to convert to Yen now, because out profit margins are so tight that we would end up going backwards on the deal if we cash out now. 

If Ouya had some Chinese legal savvy, they could have structured the contract so that the shipping company would be forced to ship on demand, instead of having discretion about shipping schedule. 

Regardless, at the end of the day, the burden is on Ouya to MAKE THINGS RIGHT with everyone still waiting. 

I would say you are entitled to receive an Ouya AND get a refund. That would be fair. After that, Ouya can pursue getting the money they lost in giving you a refund from the Chinese shipping company. 

That is how they can make it right.  That is the ONLY way they can make it right...""",,False,self,t5_2uhbj,False,,blue,True,t3_1h1t89,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1h1t89/interesting_take_on_shipping_problem/,

A console does not determine the framerate of a game, the developer of the game does.  Most games released for the Atari 2600 were 60fps!! does that make it a better system than the PS3 or 360, since quite a few games on modern consoles are locked at 30fps? ... No.

Every developer should be taking the speed of the target system into account and adjusting detail and/or optimizing code to get a smooth, playable experience.

Even with the limited pre-launch library, many OUYA titles are pushing 60fps and outputting at 720p or more.. something that was impossible for the Wii, since it was limited to 480p.

For example, Bombsquad is one of the best looking games on the OUYA and it is able to hold a solid 60fps while rendering 3D at [720p](http://forums.ouya.tv/discussion/1249/bombsquad-8-player-party-game-madness-testers-needed). Pretty amazing!

Primarily I was interested in using it as a set top box with the added benefit of playing emulators. On those counts, I think the ouya preforms wonderfully.

Upon receiving my ouya I installed Airdroid, which has made it super easy to sideload other apps all from my computer. This is awesome because I feel like the ouya browser is sort of lackluster. Initially I had a problem getting my external hard drive to work, plugging the drive in would cause the ouya to freeze everytime. However, it was an extremely old drive so I just bought a new 2 tb external off Amazon for ~100 which works perfectly. I had to format it to fat32 to be able to write to it, which is a slight let down. But not too much, as I don't have any media files that reach the 4gb file size limit. I am a little disappointed that the ouya doesn't feature usb 3.0 as I feel like it should be standard on any new hardware. 

I like being able to use airdroid to upload files from my computer onto the external connected to the ouya, but I wanted to have native integration with my OS so I sideloaded SERVER Ultimate Pro as well. This app allows you to run all sorts of servers on the ouya. I am currently only running a SAMBA server so that I can copy files onto the console through my file manager. The app has the option to start up the server automatically on boot and run in the background, but I have had trouble getting that to work. At the moment the console has to be running the app while you copy, which means no playing and uploading simultaneously. I would really like to fix this issue as, if I can get the app to run in the background I might consider using the ouya as a light home server as well.

Upon getting my new external all hooked up, I sideloaded the libstagefright (I think that is the name) version of XBMC and it has been working wonderfully. Setup was a pain as I had to type in the share information in though the on screen keyboard. I would recommend plugging in a keyboard for that part. It also took me a while to realize the center button on the controller brought up the context menu in xbmc. However, once I found that it has been really easy to navigate the app with a controller. Performance wise the video playback has been really good. Videos begin playing very quickly for me and I haven't really noticed any stuttering or dropped frames, even on a 1080 video. 

I've installed the Aeon Nox theme which I think is a fairly graphically intensive theme. So far it runs almost perfectly, the menus aren't super smooth but they are definitely usable. I think it looks cool enough to be worth it, but you can easily use a less demanding theme like the default one. 

I am having some audio playback issues when watching videos. The audio and video get out of sync very frequently for me even on videos that run perfectly on my computer. However I think this is actually an issue with my tv and not the ouya itself. The audio chip in my tv has always had issues with my xbox as well. On that front I am slightly disappointed that the console doesn't include analog audio out. But I might just be the last barbarian out there who still has an analog audio tuner. I really want to get a new one soon though, which I hope will resolve my audio issues. 

As for emulators I currently have Mupen64 AE+, SuperGNES, and GBAoid installed. For those three emulators I have every title released in North America. All these roms are cataloged on my external and so far I haven't found one that won't run on the ouya (Note: I have only played a small subset of these roms on the ouya so far). Of the three, Mupen is the only one that doesn't run flawlessly. It can get pretty choppy when I've been playing Harvest Moon 64. I haven't heard of anyone running GBAoid on the ouya yet, but it has worked well for me. I've been sucked into Advance Wars really badly now, so I haven't tried out other titles yet. It may be that it doesn't run well on other GBA games. If you have any titles in particular for one of these emulators that you would like me to try out for you, just leave a comment and I can give it a spin.

My experience with the ouya has had rough spots as well. Mainly I've been having issues with the controller. Overall I like the feel and button placement on the controller. I think the controller has good weight, which is often my gripe with other controllers. However, I clearly got a preupdated controller. Buttons get stuck under the face plate whenever I press too hard. I also have this problem with one of the triggers which is extremely annoying. It always gets stuck when the game is tense and I am frantically tugging on the trigger. I've had several games sessions get ruined by the sticky trigger. Ouya customer support has not gotten back to me on a replacement and its been over two weeks now. Also I feel the controller integration isn't very consistent across games.

I'd like to here people's thoughts on this. 


**Edit:** I'm enjoying the bit of feedback so far. For those who are interested, I'll be drawing a lot of inspiration from games like Goldeneye, Perfect Dark and much from [this game](http://youtu.be/sgYWP7iy-_E), one of my favorites growing up. 

I will be thinking of a single-player campaign down the road, but to start with I want to focus on a fun and balanced multi-player game. Of course, if you don't have friends(or extra controllers!), I'll throw in a bit of AI for solo folks to test out the combat experience.

**Update:** I've decided to start building the game as a proof-of-concept. Not much at the moment.. just an empty room, simple movement using two analog sticks, and started implementing the features for additional players. 3D needs to be heavily optimized for the Ouya; spent most of my time on that alone.

And this seems to be a pretty recurring theme with this thing.

Yesterday, I took my Ouya to CEO 2013, with the intention of playing Breaker's Revenge on Robert Broglia's excellent NEO.emu Neo Geo emulator. My multi-console modded Mad Catz TE works fine, except for a few issues. In Xbox mode, D-Pad mode doesn't work, so I have to set it to left analog stick mode, which, luckily, works fine. In PS3 mode, the D-Pad mode works fine, but it's sometimes unable to navigate menus, even though the controls all work in-game. And it doesn't reliably automatically pick Xbox or PS3 mode when I plug it in - it seems random.

My friend plugged in his homemade Hitbox, which has no analog/d-pad switch, and was unable to use it in either PS3 or Xbox mode - the buttons worked, but not the directions.

This problem reared its head any time someone tried to use their own controller. Even though these controllers would work fine in a PS3 or an Xbox, the Ouya (or NEO.emu) just seemed to have a problem with them.

Also, even after reading tutorials on how to do it, we were unable to ever successfully sync a PS3 controller to the Ouya.

Anyway, we eventually got a couple of arcade sticks that agreed with everything. The emulation passed the ""does it suck?"" test as applied by several people who regularly play the game on an arcade cabinet. They deemed it an acceptable replacement, though its colors are way too bright compared to a CRT display with its scanlines; this is probably something that can be fixed with post-processing, if that's ever added to the emulator (and in a way that doesn't introduce additional lag on the Ouya).

So, if you were cool with using a controller that was compatible with the Ouya and NEO.emu, everything was smooth. 

Fast forward to today. Took my Ouya with me again (also brought my PS3). This time, I set it up next to Smash Bros with TowerFall, hoping to court some of their players. I brought my Ouya controller, 1 wired 360 controllers, and two wireless ones. Syncing the 360 controllers with the USB dongle is just as easy as doing so on a PC, which was a relief. The only issue is that the player indicator just flashes, so you can't look at your controller and tell what number you are. 

Booted up TowerFall. Had the initial loading screen. It spent some time saying Loading. Then it got to Authenticating, and stayed there. For several minutes.

After a bit of research, I learned the startling truth: **TowerFall has an online authentication requirement every single time you start the app, even if you've already paid for the game.** I gritted my teeth and tethered my Ouya to my iPhone, and it was finally able to successfully authenticate. We eventually got 4 players in, and we all had a blast. Afterwards, we checked the ""variants"" menu and found a bunch of settings that should appeal to competitive players. We left them all alone because of our philosophy of not screwing with game rules before we truly understand the balance (though we did turn off that lame ""auto-balance"" feature that spawns your team with shields if you're losing badly).

It seems like a game that wants to take itself seriously competitively, but with the requirement of an online connection every single time the app runs, it is **not competitively viable.** As a Verizon iPhone 5 owner, I am in the minority of people who are willing to bring their game console to a tournament *and* tether it to their phone every time they start certain apps. This form of DRM is worse than what the Xbox One recently completely reversed. Games should not phone home, especially after they've been purchased, and *especially* not if they are completely offline-only. I've already decided that I won't be taking TowerFall seriously until this policy has changed. Anyone who plays the game at home and thinks about taking it to a friend's house or a tournament, make sure you keep in mind the requirement to have an internet connection reliable enough to authenticate when it starts, especially if you're in a venue with bad wireless reception.

We played TowerFall until it was time to start the Breaker's Revenge tournament. I moved the Ouya to the other side of the ballroom next to the Breaker's Revenge cabinet, hooked everything up, and watched the Ouya lock up during startup every single time I tried to turn it on. The U animation would simply not move. I unplugged the powered USB hub, and it was able to boot successfully.

I have not gotten a single USB device to function on my Ouya since. Plugging anything in causes its light to turn on for a fraction of a second, turn off, then never turn back on. Combined with the fact that, despite my pledging additional money for 3 extra controllers, I only received one with my Kickstarter Ouya (which I received only the day before retail, by the way), I am essentially unable to use my Ouya for any function that requires anything more than a single Ouya controller. I can't play roms off my USB hard drive. I can't use my USB hub to plug in arcade sticks. I can't use my USB dongle to pair 360 controllers. A lack of online play in all the games and emulators I like means that I can't play anything multiplayer (aside from Get On Top, I suppose).

The word of the day (well, word of the last few months) for the Ouya is... disappointment. I won't be bringing it back to CEO tomorrow, and I won't be bringing it to any tournaments until I have it replaced, and I'm sure it's bulletproof. 

Edit: TowerFall's developer has pushed a build to the Ouya Store that enables offline purchase authentication caching, which should enable offline play. 

After a bit of research, [I found a temporary workaround](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=43086475&amp;postcount=18) for my USB issues. It involves using a safety pin to bend the two prongs inside the USB housing upwards so that the USB contacts of your device push into and touch the contacts inside the Ouya. At first, USB connections will be more snug, but over time, reinsertions will push the prongs back down, and they'll have to be bent up again. I'm still gonna try to get my Ouya replaced one way or another, but in the meantime, if I plug the hub in and never remove it, I should be in good shape.

I found the aptoide store to be very easy to navigate on the ouya, almost everything could be accessed without the touch pad. I would have explored more but I had to get to work.  In my opinion aptoide is magnitudes better than the Amazon Market.

These are the steps I took to install it, there is possibly a shorter way (posted below) but these are the steps I took.

1. First install the store for [Aptoide](http://m.aptoide.com) by downloading their [apk](http://imgs.aptoide.com/apks/Aptoide.apk)
2. Open Aptoid
3. Press the ouya button (one on the middle)
4. Go to settings
5. Uncheck Filter Applications
6. Go back to the main screen (a button)
7. Use the touch pad to click on the search icon in the upper left
8. Search for ""Google TV""
9. Select ""Youtube for Google TV""
10. it will come up and say version 1.3.5, click on the ""Get Latest"" link next to it.
11. Once in the browser click on install then follow the directions.

If given the option install the roku store, it looks like there are more options there too try.

Experimental version (I have not tried this):

1. Download the [Aptoide apk](http://imgs.aptoide.com/apks/Aptoide.apk)
2. Download the [Youtube For Google TV

I decided to give it a shot, seeing that the games I wanted to play (Ocarina of Time, Super Smash Brothers, and Flying Dragon to be specific) didn't work quite as well as I wished on Mupen64. And wow, I'm glad I decided to give n64oid a shot, there seems to be a night and day difference in performance between the two! The only downside is that N64oid isn't optimized for the Ouya, to get the C-buttons to work I have to map them on the D-pad instead of the Right joystick.

I don't quite understand as to why N64oid performs better than Mupen64. From what I've researched N64oid seems to be based off of Mupen64 and hasn't been updated in quite some time. I've tried finding the developer's contact info to see if he would be interested in porting it over, but I've had no luck. I know that I would gladly pay for an optimized port, and I'm sure many others would as well.

I don't beleive anywhere has mention that OUYA would be open source^* but several videos I watched on you two did. It is open hardware, in the sense that you are encouraged to take it apart and tinker, but the schematics and source are not open to all. And people are not able to take OUYA out and redistribute it on their own terms which is core to open source software.

This is my understanding with regard to Open Source and F2P on the OUYA. I would love it if the OUYA community could confirm, or correct my understanding. Thanks.

Tbh, this is going to be a huge selling point for the Ouya. It's going to be easier for homebrew devs because they don't have to worry about grey areas as you would with Nintendo/Microsoft/Sony.

I would rather support the smaller indie devs with this money as opposed to the bigger players like Sega, Gamesloft etc. Also I think Towerfall is doing good on its own right plus that would blow the full amount on one game.
I would much rather spread it about on 2 or 3 games.

1375098730.0,18,self.ouya,1j9rrn,OUYAs in Dusty Cupboards,26,8,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1j9rrn/ouyas_in_dusty_cupboards/,"According to OUYA CEO, Julie Uhrman, the OUYA has an [attach rate of 27%](http://www.crystallinegreen.com/www.gamasutra.com/view/news/197084/73_percent_of_Ouya_owners_havent_bought_a_thing.php). That means 73% of OUYA owners have never bought anything on the console. There are lots of reasons why OUYA owners might have yet to make a purchase, but some are receiving more attention than others:

Emulators

 * The idea being that the plethora of emulators on the OUYA are one of the main attractions, and mean people spend their time playing old school classics for free (probably illegally), without bothering to look at the native content. However, many of the emulators on the OUYA store have IAP, and so may be positively contributing to the 27% attach rate. Plus, emulator fans will undoubtedly glance across the store from time to time, increasing the chance they will try and buy at least some of the games on the OUYA store itself

Game Selection

* Many OUYAs were sold without prior knowledge of what games would eventually be on them. A lack of games in certain genres or inflated expectations about the graphics quality and scope/depth of the games the OUYA would be able to produce in the 6 months since developers have actually had their hands on the device may have contributed to many people simply not finding any games they enjoy and want to pay for.

* The setup of the store may also partly contribute to this, as people may not be willing to dig through to try and find the types of games they usually go for.

* Equally, it may be there are only one or two games in any one genre on the OUYA, and if they don’t offer anything different from the games those users have already on other platforms, there would be no incentive to buy (versus someone who is new to the genre)

* Finally, since many of the games have been developed by indie and small studios, those studios might not have the resources nor willpower to invest in marketing their game, meaning players are not finding out about the games they might be interested in, even though they exist on the store

Free to Try

* All games on the OUYA have to have a free demo, trial period or other part that allows you to play at least part of the game without paying. This being a completely new concept, many developers are not getting the balance right between how much the provide for free (erring on the side of caution and providing too much), versus how much is behind the paywall, and when and how they go about asking for payment.

* There is also a theory that [demos can reduce sales](http://www.computerandvideogames.com/416824/game-demos-halve-sales-new-data-suggests/), rather than increasing them, and this may also be contributing to an underlying sense of “well I tried it and it was OK, but not worth paying for”.

**Dusty Cupboard**

All these theories discussed so far suppose people are actually using their OUYAs, but there are lots of reasons why people might have an OUYA sitting in some cupboard getting dusty

Poor Customer Service

* Many who bought the OUYA in the hype and excitement have been let down by OUYA’s poor communication with regard to shipping delays. That enthusiasm has evaporated, replaced with a bitter taste that may make OUYA owners either not even bother once the package finally arrives, or find reason for the console to match the less than stellar support they have received.

Bad First Impressions

* There was (still is?) a problem where if you download lots of games in one session, it causes huge amounts of controller lag. While a simple reset solves this, the first thing most people do is download a whole bunch of games, fire a couple up and get terrible input lag. That kind of first impression will make them more likely to put it straight back in the box and/or not bother with it

This is It?

* While the OUYA is constantly improving and evolving, the fact that it might not be the finished article is something OUYA have failed to communicate. Consumers are expect a fully finished product. They assume that what they take out of the box the first time they use it, “that’s it”, and if it is underwhelming, they may not give it a second chance

No Friends

* The games that make the OUYA really shine are (IMO) the local multiplayer games. Most people will play the OUYA for the first time on their own, so not realise that. Anecdotally, I hear stories of OUYAs sitting on shelves getting dusty till one day, the owner’s friend comes round and asks to play it. Upon which they have a great time, but that is more by chance, and many more will not be sitting around in front of the TV waiting for fate to intervene.

Just a Bunch of Ports

* The games people have already heard of (FF3, Sonic, Shadowgun etc) tend to get pushed to the front of the store because people download and play the familiar. New OUYA owners fire up the store to see a bunch of stuff they can already play on their mobiles/tablets and assume the rest of the store is like that, don’t explore further and so put the OUYA to one side

Game developers understand the OUYA is new and will take time to grow the market size, and posting good conversion and attach rates will encourage them that while the volumes may be small, should they grow, the platform can be quite profitable.

Soc-Car is a local multi-player game where you control cars playing a game of soccer. It's 2-4 players (You can also mess around with one player)


The game supports Ouya, Xbox and Ps3 controllers. 


Phones and tablets are also supported without the need for external apps, using a free open source library I'm working on called [""More Controllers Please""](https://github.com/witnessmenow/MoreControllersPlease). If you are interested in adding MCP to your game please get in touch and I can help you.


There is not really too much I can say here other than if you have some friends over please give it a try, its 100% free and is only about 5Mb of a download.


This is my first ever game so I would love to hear any feedback or suggestions for improvements.


Thanks,

Brian

I completely get that you guys are being shafted, and it's not fair. I only got my Ouya a couple days ago, and I felt a bit miffed, but at no point did I feel like I made a pre-order when I funded the Ouya via Kickstarter...

I'm finding it difficult to consider the mindset of thinking that Ouya has ""stolen your money"" or anything of that nature. Kickstarter is a public funding platform. Many funded projects never see completion, because it is almost a donation platform in a sense. You aren't buying a product, you're funding a company to make a thing. The incentives are not pre-orders. They're incentives. People are complaining, for example, about international shipping being something added on top that wasn't warranted. Correct, it sure wasn't required, but I don't feel like they stole the money I funded extra - I'm glad that they can make use of that money, because it has helped them create this product that is genuinely being created.

Patience is a virtue, and ultimately, we're all incredibly lucky that there is a product to be patient for. I can imagine that if Ouya failed to deliver anything, this would have been a massive scandal, and Kickstarter would have dropped off the map because of unfulfilled promises. But seriously, you funded something. You didn't buy something. There is a HUGE difference, and I think that it's in very poor taste to bad mouth a company when they have barely even put their feet on the ground. I funded Ouya to open the industry a bit, not so that I would get something before everyone else. Yeah, they were later than they originally said. Big whoop. You didn't get to set up your console yet - there is still a lot more that needs to be done to get the Ouya into a position that's even close to competition for the other gaming console companies, so don't feel too down-trodden. Think about what your money is helping to achieve, and please, can we stop using this fucking subreddit to whine?

1. Whlie I was testing games with a friend of mine he had repeatedly controller problems. Not as much lag as people have reported about, but more of ""controller freeze"". What I mean is that he loses control of a character for a while and last input is repeated.  
For example while playing BombSquad he ran off the cliff because he couldn't turn. I later had same problem in Ice Rage.  
  
1. Yesterday I looked through the list of games on Ouyas site and started downloading them. Quite many of them. I can't remember how many I put on download before my Ouya froze and I had to reset it.  
After resetting I noticed that only some of the games had downloaded, most of them hadn't. Although I did have limited back processes on and that may have caused the problem.  
  
1. After playing Knightmare Tower for couple of hours Ouya stated to get laggy and less responsive.  
  
That's all that comes to mind right now, hopefully someone at Ouya will find this helpful.

I did not join the Kickstarter campaign, it was closed when I found out about the Ouya.  I ordered directly from the Ouya website.

The only communication I received from Ouya was my original pre-order confirmation email sent back on Feb 1st.  Now the unit is going to be available in stores on June 25th?

I'm am happy to be patient with the Ouya team; I certainly understand the challenges and pressures they've been under as a new company.  But why trick me into pre-ordering (giving you my money upfront) with a false promise? At least give me some communication as to what's going on? I gave you my cash upfront on the condition you would deliver my console ahead of the official release.  You broke your word and forgot about me.

I'm not trying to be unreasonable, but I feel cheated. Communication is the key to any relationship, and Ouya's lack of communication leaves me feeling left out in the cold.

MOGA is here to help.,20,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1gkzzz/want_more_controlleroptimized_games_moga_is_here/,"I got a Moga Pocket at PAX East last year, and when testing it with my Ouya I discovered you *need* the MOGA Pivot app sideloaded in order to connect the controller properly. So, after much frustration and cursing (ever try to find APKs for free apps?), I managed to get my hands on the MOGA Pivot APK and sideload it onto my device.

Guess what? Every game in the MOGA store is optimized for controller use. There are lots of free ones, and you don't even need a MOGA controller to play the games. So if you're itching for more games than the ones in Discover, the MOGA store is a good place to look.

Just figured this might be helpful to some people.

**Ed:** The method I used to obtain the APK was to download it onto a tester Android phone I have, then use [ES File Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop) to back it up to the microSD card.

The old version I'm referring to has a design problem where the O-U-Y-A buttons can sometimes get stuck behind the right faceplate. There is also a significant dead-zone issue with the left analog stick. It's unclear now whether the issue was ever purely hardware or software, but it seems the consensus is that it was a mixture of both. These images attempt to illustrate how you can tell which version you have, since the model numbers are the same.

* Back side of the old controller's right faceplate: http://imgur.com/a/IBpDg#1
* Back side of the new controller's right faceplate: http://imgur.com/a/IBpDg#0

* Old controller's analog stick plotting graph: http://imgur.com/a/IBpDg#3
* New controller's analog stick plotting graph: http://imgur.com/a/IBpDg#2

To test your controller's analog stick, follow these instructions (note: this process works for any app you might want to side-load):

1. Upgrade the firmware on your OUYA to ODK 1.0.4 and Firmware 1.0.248 (if your OUYA has access to the internet and says its up to date, you're done).

2. In the Make | Software menu, open the web browser and browse to this URL: http://www.files.froemling.net/images/joystick_test/JoystickTest.apk - This will download the testing app.

3. Go to the Manage | Advanced | Storage menu and open Downloads. Select the JoystickTest app, and install it.

4. Go back to Make | Software and run JoystickTest (or just run it when the install completes). 

5. The longer and more comprehensively you move your analog stick around, the more complete your graph will be.

If your controller resembles my examples for the old controller, you can request an RMA from OUYA if you desire to have it replaced. To do that, send an email to support@ouya.tv stating you have a malfunctioning controller and provide the following pieces of information:

1. The controller serial number. It's found on the back side of the controller plate.
2. Pictures of the controller with the controller plate on and off.
3. Name and address used to purchase your OUYA. 

OUYA Supprt cannot process your request without that data, and it's their discretion to RMA your controller or not.

Hope this helps.",,False,self,t5_2uhbj,False,,green,True,t3_1ex30o,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1ex30o/new_and_old_controller_comparisons/,

Also, ""Android Apps on Google Play"" , there are so many awesome controller supported games I play on a Android Tablet (Acer A200, OC). Even if ,initially, the App's were windowed until they can be courted to upscale.

I talked to a couple BB worker drones.  One of them had heard of it, and didn't know it was coming out today.  The other typed up on the computer (needed help spelling it), found it bestbuy.com, and grabbed the product code and did a search at other stores.

From what I could see over his shoulder, there are about a dozen Best Buy locations in San Diego County.  Two stores had about 13-14, and one or two other stores had a small handful, and the rest had zero.

I don't know exactly what conclusions to draw from this.  Speculation could include a limited first run, and simply not enough units to go around.  Or perhaps the stores haven't received their units yet.  It's possible, though seems unlikely, that the stores are simply sold out.

I think Ouya, like any indie developer, now faces an uphill battle to simply get it's name known by the public.

She's been dodging questions from various reviewers and even we can see it and can't really defend it. She's been vague and while she has't been directly making things worse, that fact that she hasn't been directly making things better is indirectly negatively impacting Ouya as a device.

All the unknowns she allows to exist are spaces that can be filled in with negatively, regardless of what kind of negativeity or where it stems from.

It lets people talk shit without reprecussion in the sense of, we can't really counter the points of negativity because we're realistically running low on ammo. At least this is how I feel about it all.

This is why I want to get her to do an AMA with us directly. The biggest and most dedicated of her user base. If she can't answer us directly and thoroughly, then that wont speak well with Ouya, no? More than likely, in my personal opinion.

My thought was that an Ouya Store for android could be released as an APK, similarly to the Amazon Market. It would allow users to download their purchased games onto their phones/tablets. Also people could just buy games on their phone and have them preinstalled onto their console when they get home (Kind of like the Steam app.)

So after a bit of interest I think it would be good to start a regular post where we pick one game a week to provide feedback to developers with a presence on r/ouya

To Developers: Any one interested in getting your game featured please message me.

So first up we will start with **FishMoto** from Overpowered games [(u/JTownlol)](http://www.reddit.com/user/JTownlol).

[Link to Title Art](https://devs-ouya-tv-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/apps/d30a5fb7-b017-4037-8385-f6201e19c4b2/com.OverpoweredGames.fishMoto/ba0fd897-612a-41aa-813b-ca36c4e01b9e/ouya_icon.png)

Please try this game out and provide feedback. The feedback can be as long as you like or one sentence, every bit of feedback is important.
Please do not downvote feedback that you don't agree with if it is a valid opinion, lets try encourage as much discussion as possible(i.e. dont downvote ""this game was too easy"", feel free to downvote ""this game is crap."" with no supporting points).

Please feel free to provide feedback on the entire process acquiring the game. Some examples of things to give feedback on might be:

* Have you seen the game in the store before?
* If so what put you off trying it?
* Was the title art appealing to you?
* Was the game anything like you expected?
* If there is a paywall, did you get a sufficient trial of the game?(did you get too much?)
* Did you play single player or multi
* What changes would you make?
* Did it represent good value for money?
* Do you normally enjoy this type of game?
* Is there a simliar game on the market that you enjoy more?

Thanks!

This game is an absolute masterpiece. I only just discovered it yesterday while browsing the Discover section (oddly enough it was nowhere to be found in the staff picks or faves)

It's Bomberman meets Smash Bros Meets Lemmings if that's an accurate enough description. Fast and loose party game with less focus on precision than fun. As many times as the game has bested me there's never been a moment when it felt as though I was robbed.

Needless to say an hour of trial play wasn't nearly enough so dropping $5 for the full version wasn't even an issue.

[UPDATE]

Reflecting on some of the comments below I feel the need to add some additional info.

Everybody who has spent a significant amount of time playing video games has that one or two titles which are near and dear to them for whatever reason. Usually it's entirely personal but sometimes the affinity revolves around a shared experience. To be blunt I was initally underwhelmed with the offering of titles on the OUYA. [Stalagflight](http://www.stalagflight.com/), [Whizorb](http://www.wizorb.com/), [No Brakes Valet](http://www.captain-games.com/jam/index.html) and a few other titles were sufficient to hold my attention for a few minutes to a couple of hours, but they felt lacking in terms of entertainment over time. I tried to get into swapping the controller with friends to stretch out the entertainment but those games simply do not lend themselves to extended play sessions.

I initially played Bomb Squad with a good friend and we exhausted the hour long trial period in a single sitting. I immediately made the purchase at that point. The following day I prompted a couple of additional friends to try it. Nobody was disappointed. It's the type of game which elicits fits of swearing, controller throwing, bickering, feelings of betrayal among others, and various deep seated emotions to well up yet at the same time nobody wants to stop. If you've ever played [Munchkin](http://www.worldofmunchkin.com/game/) (card game) it's that sort of social experience that divides friends and unites enemies all in the name of fun. There are few games coming out these days that I personally feel deliver such an experience.",,False,self,t5_2uhbj,1370322161.0,,green,True,t3_1fh9ns,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1fh9ns/go_buy_bomb_squad_right_now/,

1361913688.0,15,self.ouya,19a6gx,Creating a community around Ouya,20,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/19a6gx/creating_a_community_around_ouya/,"This is just going to be some thoughts regarding this community and what I see it's potential as and I'd love to hear everyone else's thoughts on the topic.



First off, in /r/ouya and most Ouya forums, there seems to be a big focus on articles that predict that the Ouya will be a failure. I think we should disregard these articles and blog posts and whatever else they might be; they don't offer anything constructive and in all likelihood they're going to continue to happen after launch (as will articles about how awesome the console is, which I also don't think we need to give much thought to). Furthermore (as seen in the comments on [today's post about the Ouya being a failure](http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/199fly/this_guy_seems_pessimistic_about_the_ouya/)), reactions on /r/ouya to these types of articles tend to be pretty mindless attacks and namecalling, ranging from [idiot](http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/199fly/this_guy_seems_pessimistic_about_the_ouya/c8m0ntx) to [tool](http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/199fly/this_guy_seems_pessimistic_about_the_ouya/c8m1o04) and on and on. And these comments get upvoted. I see no reason to put so much weight into what these people want to say about the Ouya, firstly because it doesn't matter, and secondly, because it makes our community seem pretty nasty and mean-spirited by stooping to the attacker's level. So I'd say let's stop posting and upvoting articles that say the Ouya will be a failure, and let's stop the namecalling and attacking of people who are skeptical of the Ouya. It's not gonna be productive in any sense.



That point also relates somewhat to my next point: I've seen some people in Ouya forums (somewhat in /r/ouya, but much more so in other forums) that think the Ouya is going to be this huge massive success and it's going to take down the console industry and so on. I think we, as a community, need to discourage this sort of thinking because I think it's pretty clear that, yes, while Ouya is successful for a startup, it's not going to be a threat to the big consoles in the immediate future. Allowing this sort of thinking to happen is only going to let people build up those sort of expectations and then be let down when they aren't met. With the current lineup of launch games, it seems pretty clear to me that it's gonna be difficult to get any really major success - at least right away. While some titles do look really good, I think I'm being pretty realistic in saying that a lot of the titles do truly look like fairly shallow mobile titles. Many of these could be fun, but it seems that many are being developed by first-time developers who want to try their hand at game making, which is great, but I think there really are going to be a lot of throwaway titles right away. Additionally, many of the titles I'm really looking forward to ([Super Metro Squad](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kickstarter.com%2Fprojects%2Fexplodingrabbit%2Fsuper-retro-squad&amp;ei=BSQtUYapGImpqgHY7YCIDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEA6kOlq3VhySR49C-9iMrjtG7C7w&amp;sig2=IwvrNDqJNAw7Rlgp0m5n_g&amp;bvm=bv.42965579,d.aWc), [Pier Solar](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=11&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CH8QtwIwCg&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kickstarter.com%2Fprojects%2F573261866%2Fpier-solar-hd-an-rpg-for-xbox360-pc-mac-linux-and&amp;ei=HCQtUYmqGca1qgGY14HYBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNE6lzvlY2219njuphSx2w68PEdKoA&amp;sig2=rRwzTsCYYiYZhS7Cs2R5Qw&amp;bvm=bv.42965579,d.aWc), [Cryamore](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEMQtwIwAg&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kickstarter.com%2Fprojects%2Frobaato%2Fcryamore-a-true-first-class-take-on-the-action-rpg&amp;ei=OyQtUbKgLpSkqwHUzICwDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNE90dxu-Sj301aaw75G6_DSiO91Dw&amp;sig2=5sMObBLhV0sd2UbR8ICgzA&amp;bvm=bv.42965579,d.aWc)), aren't going to be launch titles, and the console is - for better or worse - going to be judged by mainstream media on its launch titles. Additionally, without the sort of poster-child launch games, it's initial sales are also going to be somewhat hampered. But this is all fine with me, because of my next point:



This point is one on which others here may or may not agree with me, so I'd be interested in hearing what you have to say. It's not really a critique or anything, just my general feelings and hopes for the console. Being that the Ouya is going to have an install base of less than 100,000, I see it as kind of a cult console. My hope is that we can have a sort of cult following and culminate a dedicated, friendly, welcoming community. The Dreamcast community in particular is one that I think would be great to try to emulate to some extent. I, for one, would like to be a part of a community that's small enough that I feel like I can get to know and be friends with other prominent members, which requires that the community be both friendly/welcoming and not huge. That is the sort of community that can have major staying power and a dedicated userbase (see again: Dreamcast).



And finally - with this sort of philosophy for the community in mind - I'd like to make some suggestions for building the /r/ouya community once the system is released (and I'd love to hear everyone elses' ideas). My main idea is to have two weekly threads: the first to suggest good, perhaps relatively unknown/undiscovered games in the Ouya catalog. Then, a few days later, we would do a Let's Play type of thread for the top voted game from the previous thread. Then talk about and discuss about the game. I think this would be great for discoverability of games and could be something to bring the community together around a shared thread - in addition to hopefully removing lots of ""fluff"" posts everyday about different games. My only concern is that devs would just post their own games every week, but I think this would be somewhat mitigated by up/downvotes since (I'm guessing) there's more gamers than devs here.



Sorry for the wall of text, my goal was to offer a bit of a critique and also some insight as to what I see as the potential for this community. Any thoughts or other ideas for /r/ouya?

**TL;DR: Let's stop quibbling over negative articles, and reduce all the negativity that has plagued this forum in reaction to negative/skeptical articles. Let's be realistic about how successful the OUYA will be. And let's do our best to create a sense of community and a positive atmosphere.**",,False,self,t5_2uhbj,1361992836.0,,yellow,True,t3_19a6gx,http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/19a6gx/creating_a_community_around_ouya/,

Ouya has a ton of potential and I'd like to support the devs working on this and the apps and games as much as possible.

Any suggestions on how to reach out to devs and open some line of contact to help report bugs/submit feedback?

I bought the OUYA with the sole intention on using it as a dedicated XBMC set top box frontend for all my media and live tv/PVR using [NextPVR](http://www.nextpvr.com/).  I sideloaded [libstagefright](http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=152005) and was immediately informed that all PVR addons were 'broken'.  I then set up my movies and tv shows from a SAMBA share on my NAS.  XBMC scanned my media and downloaded all meta data.  I also installed the XBMC remote app on my Android phone and was able to control XBMC without use of the OUYA controller.  Video playback on all of my media was perfect and browsing the libraries was very snappy.

I decided to install a few video plugins from XBMCHUB.  I tried Hulu which worked perfectly and was also surprisingly very responsive when browsing.  I also installed the Amazon addon and was able to browse but unable to play a movie.  I received a somewhat generic 'network' type error but discounted any network problems being I was able to browse with both Amazon and Hulu.  NAVI-X also worked quite well.  I did crash XBMC when I mistakenly tried to fast forward in NAVI-X instead of hitting stop.  I tried it again after force closing XBMC and again crashed to desktop.  Another oddity was video playback on the 'America's Test Kitchen' add on.  The audio played fine but the video was very garbled but in a very strange way.  It looked a bit like interlacing but with large blocks instead of lines.  I'll need to look at the logs to see if I can figure out why some of these issues are happening.

Overall, my first experience with XBMC on OUYA was pretty decent.  I did manage to crash it a few times but I'm sure the app will become more stable as the XBMC team works out whatever is causing these instabilities.

A few questions I have for those who have ventured further with XBMC than I have are:

* Is there a better version of XBMC available for OUYA beside the libstagefright version I linked above?
* Does anyone know the status of CEC control?  I saw that some are working on it but didn't see any sort of release.  I'm hoping to control XBMC via my Harmony remote over CEC.  Is that even possible?  I don't have any experience with CEC.  Would it be possible to power the OUYA on/off using CEC?
* Does anyone know of an easy way to have OUYA boot directly into XBMC instead of having to launch it manually?
* Where are the XBMC logs stored on the OUYA?  Can I SSH into the OUYA or do I have to install something to be able to get a shell remotely?
* ~~Is PVR functionality coming to OUYA or is there a problem with Android and the PVR addons?~~

*EDIT* I was able to get PVR connection to my NextPVR livetv server by enabling LiveTV in XBMC Settings-&gt;LiveTV  .  I'm guessing XBMC mark these as broken until LiveTV is enabled.  I think it would have been better to label them unavailable rather than broken, but perhaps that's not an option.

However, I only had a handful of games installed, so this didn't seem right. 

When I looked at my storage (under Advanced Settings), it turns out that ~5GB was being used for ""misc"" files. Looking at these, it seems that they were all orphaned downloads (possibly ""pending"" when I updated, or failed downloads?). There were, for example, 3 versions of the TowerFall package, each eating up ~60MB (if memory serves).

I have fixed this with a factory restore. However, I have a couple requests for the Ouya team:

1) Make storage management easier. I could find no way to navigate the stock Android storage menu to actually delete these

2) Try to keep track of (and delete) failed/incomplete downloads that are no longer downloading

3) Give me a way to easily find my past downloads and redownload them. Would also be great for folks with multiple consoles (especially when setting up a second console)

My first Ouya was delivered yesterday (I have 3 coming, each ordered at different stages)   
It took DHL less than 1 working day to send it from China to Australia! (sent Saturday night - delivered 11.45AM Monday)   

---

**Hardware:**  

The controller feels *really* good.   
The power brick feels better than the cheap and nasty ones that come with MK802's and other low-end android devices.  

No issues with overscan (2012 50'' Panasonic Plasma)  

**Initial Setup:**  

The setup was very straight forward and the initial update came down without a problem - everything seemed to work pretty well out of the box (Lan, Wifi, Controller etc...)   

As expected with a beta OS the menus need some optimisation - they tend to lag up when you're downloading several games at once etc...   

Downloads seemed to go as fast as my crappy Telstra ADSL connection would allow and I managed to download a huge pile of games over an hour or so of fiddling round.  

The in-menu sounds definitely need some optimisations done, if two menu sounds play at once they seem to cause stuttering / noise - again not an issue in game and I think it should be a straightforward fix.  


**In game:**  

Games run really well, framerate is good, the worst I could see was in the imech online game - but even that was still playable.   

I haven't come across any control / input lag what so ever (remember to put your TV in 'game' mode people!).  

I really dislike dubstep but dubwars is AWESOME on the ouya!  

I've never had so much fun punching deer and bears.  


**Emulation:**  

I was able to easily side-load some N64 roms to mupin and managed to play super smash brothers and mario kart without any issues (actually, I think pikachu's eye sprites were missing in SSB).  

I loaded some SNES roms onto a USB key and loaded up the emulator but it didn't seem to want to find them - probably user error so I'll try this again tonight.  

**XBMC BETA build:**  

I download an experimental XBMC hardware accelerated build - wow - it seriously runs as well as my i5 ubuntu media PC! It did however crash when trying to browse a SAMBA share - I've had this before and it is a BETA build.

Really looking forward to seeing an official XBMC app on the Ouya.  

**Overall Experience:**  

Taking into account the goals of the project, the price and the fact the OS is still in BETA - I'd give the Ouya BETA experience a 8.5/10!  

It's definitely not perfect, but I didn't expect it to be and I think that the areas that are a bit rusty shouldn't be too hard to tidy up over the next month or so.  

For $99 it's really shaping up to be a big winner.  

**Looking forward to:**  

More menu settings  
Background downloads while playing games  
Menu and menu sound performance enhancements  
Official XBMC app  
Official MAME emulator  
More hack n' slash dungeon crawlers!  
Storage of games on USB flash

(Bonus fact: looks like extra-firm tofu -- our favorite!) In all seriousness, Alchemedium is another strong, small group of devs doing something interesting and we're all about it!

Last but not least, Snow Castle Games for [Festival of Magic!](http://snowcastlegames.com) -- out of all the incredible RPGs proposed during the #myouyagame adventure, we have a soft spot for this one. Something about growing your own food and then using that food to vanquish your enemies piques our interest!

* I can put the console in my backpack, but what will be its power consumption? Can I create or buy a battery pack to use it wherever I want, on my car, on the train, in holiday house using a tablet or large smartphone connected via hdmi such as screen?

* I didn't read if our controllers will have included rumble pack, can be possible? maybe to save battery? but what type of battery, lithium or normal AAA? two or more?

* The led light up the console will change colour during standy to announce new messages, updates, games, etc.? One colour per announcement type?

* If my friend come in my house with his Ouya controller, he will play on my Ouya? The controllers can be paired with all Ouyas in the worlds?

* I like the very small size of console, but how many big will be the power supply? Such as one of notebook, netbook, cellphone? How long will be the cable of power supply? 1 m, or less?

* How many mW on usb out? Can I use my portable hdd without its external power supply, or will be supported pendrive only?

* In some images I've seen Ouya will use an internal sd slot for its 8 gb of storage. Just unpacked, can I open the console and change the sd card with a 32 or 64 gb? What maximum speed will supported? Can I use a super fast sd card to speed up game loading and file transfers?

* The Ouya will have to be always connected to internet to work? Once installed some games can I disconnect and take it with me to sea or mountain house without internet coverage and play anyway?

* I would load my profile (games achievements, characters of RPG, modified cars of racing games) on Ouya of my friend when I'll play in splitscreen at his house, but how? Will I open my Ouya user account using my password on Ouya of my friend (privacy problem?)?

I've tried downloading 2 of the new ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" games. To me they seem choppy, the physics are weird (I'm used to the original games from Sega Genesis) and a couple of other issues.
Why do they release games that seem unfinished?
I understand why indie-developers might do it, with an open dialog with the gamers and such (like Minecraft) and others that make games for fun, but I don't expect that from a ""big release game"" like Sonic.
This also apply to a couple of other games. It might just be my console, or me not getting used to the Ouya ecosystem yet, but I end up with games like Knightmare Tower (which is awesome) and Dig! (which is awesome too!).

My TV does have lag, and no game mode. This is tested with other systems, so I am aware of some visual lag updating the screen. I also know the feel of how much lag there is regularly. 

Now I got the OUYA and loaded up a ton of games and have noticed the input lag is horrible. I even had my brother bring over his monitor to do some testing. My brother is big into fighting games and bullet hells such as DoDonPachi, and is hyper sensitive to input lag, hence why I figured I'd use his monitor with its 1ms lag.

In some games I noticed even on the monitor there is a half a second delay on input. A few of these games are: SNES emulators, Sonic 4: ep 2, ChronoBlade, Giana Sisters, Flashout 3D.

Some games have worse problems. Sometimes ChronoBlade will have my character running left even if I'm not even touching the controller. Giana Sisters has the main character's sprite literally disappear for split seconds whenever a new movement input is issued, and then there's Dubwars. 

Dubwars is fine at first, but as the game goes on and more things come on the screen, the input lag time can be counted in seconds. I've found that it can sometimes even have as much as 3 seconds of delay. I see people saying they've been playing a lot of it and I wonder how they can. I'd love to play it, but the lag makes the experience miserable.

I know that when downloading games the system hangs a lot and lag runs rampant, so all these tests were done with nothing downloading.

There are other issues but this should cover the gist of what I'm trying to convey. Now I think that these may be game related as Towerfall (a real gem) has no more lag than what my TV does, and runs beautifully on the monitor. 

My questions are: Is this typical across all OUYAs? or does it sound like mine is experiencing issues? If this is typical, was the issue made aware to OUYA themselves? (Haven't been keeping up with things as I didn't have my system)

Not sure it this has been posted already.

Warning: changing the wrong settings can brick your TV! (I think)

http://osxtechtips.com/?p=237


Copypasta:
&gt;I’ve owned this TV for almost 3 years now, and have just finally figured out how to turn off the overscan that is set automatically from the factory.  It’s not in the normal On Screen Menu that you can access via your remote control, so there is a bit of technical work involved with making the change.

&gt;I had never noticed the overscan until I attached a mac computer to my TV to use Frontrow, Boxee, and some other entertainment based applications.  It never really bothered me until then, and I searched through every bit of the on-screen menus to try and turn it  off.

&gt;I found that there was no way to turn it off.  If I turned on overscan in the display settings on my mac, it made the top menubar move off the top of the screen, and the dock was barely visible.  If I turned off the overscan feature it made a black border about 3/4″ thick all the way around the screen.  There was no way that I could find to get the screen to fit correctly.

&gt;I really started to notice this when watching movies through Netflix Streaming and Hulu+ TV shows on my new AppleTV and my RokuHD box.  I finally got my girlfriend to look up the answer for me.  There wasn’t anything in the way of an answer except the information of how to get to the service menus on the TV.

&gt;So, without further ado:

&gt;1. Turn off the TV.
&gt;2. Unplug all devices from the back of the TV.
&gt;3. Unplug the AC power to the TV.
&gt;4. Press the Power button several times with the AC power unplugged, then hold the power button in for about 30 seconds with the AC power still unplugged. (This often took me several attempts to get the menu to come up).
&gt;5. Hold down the Channel Down button on the side of the TV, while holding it down, plug in the AC power.  Once you hear the TV turn on, release the Channel down button immediately.  Within a few seconds you should see a two row menu come up on the screen.
&gt;6. Use the Up/Down and Left/Right arrow keys on the remote (D-pad) to cycle through the options.  This will be accomplished with the left-most number highlighted  in a green block.  You will want to use the Up/Down arrows to move to Item #25 (LetteerBoxOvSc).
&gt;7. Now use the Left/Right arrow to move the green box to the column labeled “Value”.  Change the number to 0 using the Up/Down arrows, then use the Left/Right arrow to move back to the  ”Index” column.
&gt;8. Now use the Up/Down arrows to go to item # 55 (LeftOvS), and again use the Left/Right arrow to move to the “Value” column and change the number to 0 using the Up/Down arrows.
&gt;9. Move back to the “Index” column and repeat step 8 for items 56 – 58 (RightOvS, TopOvS, and BottomOvS).
&gt;10. When all items are 0, press the “Menu” button on the remote to return to regular viewing mode.
&gt;11. Turn off the TV.  Re-connect a device that you know Overscans, and see if it looks proper now.
&gt;12. If it does, then reconnect all devices and enjoy.
&gt;13. If not, then you cn navigate back in and make the changes again.
&gt;14. Hope this helps anyone else having this issue.

Other manufactures may also have hidden maintenance menus

So I bought my Ouya yesterday and I'm disappointed with the WiFi. 

I have a fast and stable connection. The router is in my bedroom, about 15 feet from the living room where the Ouya sits. Although it *found* my network, the signal strength was at the 1/3 mark. I tried downloading the system update - and my signal kept getting dropped. 

My next step was to set the Ouya up in my bedroom, less than 2 feet from the Router. Signal strength was full - yet, connection got lost during the system update. I plugged in Ethernet and it downloaded the necessary update and some games. 

I unplugged the ethernet and ran WiFi two feet from the router - it works fine from this distance. I took the console and reconnected it to my living room, 15 feet away - and it found my network fine with about half the signal strength.

When I click ""Discover"", the signal strength is so weak that it can't load the store. 

I should note that I own a Roku, that sits in the living room as well - and has *no problem streaming Netflix, Hulu or Amazon* over the WiFi. I get crisp video everytime. My iPad works fine in that room as well - so I *know* its not my network. 

Does the Ouya simply have  a *shitty* WiFi card? I really don't want to run a wire across my apartment. What gives?

/Note: Besides this issue, I'm loving the console. Controller feels great, games are fun, emulators are fantastic, interface is solid, great price point.

I was playing a game and then exited and immediately my console began updating. Took a minute or two and I was back in action. I checked what the version was and it's 1.0.346_r1. I looked around a bit to see if there was anything noticeable that had changed, been added, etc. I was looking through the discover area and clicked on a random game in the sandbox section. I started downloading it and then pressed A to go back to the game selection, and that's when my console froze. It was completely unresponsive except when I double-tapped the menu button. It brought me back to the main screen but only after lagging for a few seconds. I canceled my game download and tried again, and it froze again when I tried to exit the info screen.

So I tried viewing a game I had already downloaded and exited the info screen and it was fine. I then tried viewing a game I hadn't downloaded but wasn't in the sandbox section and I was able to leave the info screen without a problem.

There are many different answers to this question. With different pros and cons. Many suggest getting started using an easy to use game engine like Unity, which doesn't require much programming background to start using. But programming is very important for any game. And on indie Game Development communities, people who can use Unity or similar are dime a dozen. And people who can actually write good code are very rare. So are very valuable. If you wanna be one of those valuable developers, I recommend you get started learning how to program first.

And if do decide to learn to program. You're in luck. Udacity just launched a new intro to programming course using Java, the programming language you'll need to know to make Android Games. Udacity is awesome, it's one of the best online resources you'll ever find. I personally already took many classes from them. They're made by some of the best professionals and professors in the area, and are really easy to follow short videos that you can take any time.

So if you wanna get started making OUYA games. I personally recommend starting learning programming Java with the new Udacity class here:
https://www.udacity.com/course/cs046

Once you're familiar with Java. You'll head to the best resource for learning how to develop for Android. Which is the official Android website:
http://d.android.com

I´m one of the devs for Hule Studios and we want to develop for OUYA. Our main problem is that we haven´t an OUYA at this moment. So you must test for us ;)
We are currently porting one of our android games and wan´t to be sure that the controls work.
It would be nice if someone with an OUYA could test it.

I went to check on the status of the shipment this morning and it says for the 2nd entry ""Returned to shipper"".  

Q.  Is this what it suggests, that it was returned because of some kind of problem?
