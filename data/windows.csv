When Windows 8 was officially released, I immediately bought it and upgraded my existing 7 Installation. I was prepared for the worst..made a back-up, copied everything to external HDD's, nothing could go wrong, but I was still worried. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised. The upgrade process was extremely smooth, fast and easy. It finished within 30 minutes and after the introduction to Windows 8, I was greeted by the heavily criticized Start Menu. I went to desktop mode to check if all drivers survived the upgrade process and they all did. No driver-problems at all. I noticed that this OS felt smoother and faster than 7. It took me about an hour to figure out all the new stuff and after I had gotten used to everything, I was very happy with my new fully functional OS.

I am starting to believe that I'm one of the few people around who actually have had this experience. There is so much criticism on this OS, it's almost like it has become a game to hate on Windows 8. The worst thing is, most of the negative remarks are from users who haven't even tried it yet, but are riding along on the 'Fuck Windows 8 and it's lack of a start button'-train. The people who have tried it, hate it because there are some changes they can't or just don't want to get used to, for example the location of the 'shutdown/restart' menu. I know some people have difficulties with changes in general, but really, it isn't that hard to learn. Yes, I agree you shouldn't change a winning team, but I actually believe the start menu and some of the new features like the 'fresh install' option to easily reformat your system are actually improvements. It's all a matter of getting used to. Nevertheless, the bad reviews are endless and the anti-windows 8 circlejerk is gathering more members every day. 

So I am getting tired of defending the OS and actually convincing people to give it a try. I sincerely believe this OS has a future, comparable to its stable older brothers XP and 7, but I find myself on a very lonely road. I wouldn't be surprised if my story is downvoted just for me liking the OS, but I wanted to share my thoughts with you. And for those who are doubting to upgrade..give it a try. You might like it..

Apparently they're trying to censor the outcry from unhappy users about their adware / bloat.  I also found out that µTorrent was bought by ""BitTorrent, Inc."" which may explain why the new owners are so clueless compared to the original µTorrent developers.

µTorrent originally became the most popular torrent app for one simple reason... it was a small, simple utility that simply let you download torrent content, without pestering users with a bunch of added ""features"" they didn't want.  Other apps foolishly loaded their programs with superfluous fluff that most users didn't want... ""featured content"", web search (might as well put a whole web browser inside the app while you're at it), add-ons, media playing, media conversions... etc etc.  Users rejected all that garbage and chose µTorrent specifically because it was the one torrent app that gave users exactly what they wanted.  A simple, small application that does one thing well and doesn't try to be anything it's not.   We already have web browsers, media players, media converters, and virus protection.  We don't want a torrent download utility that thinks it's an operating system.

Somewhere along the way, uTorrent utterly and completely lost sight as to what made it popular in the first place.  It used to be ""a (very) tiny BitTorrent client."" Not only is that no longer true, it has become a joke.  And not only that, but the current developers honestly probably are genuinely unaware of why that tagline was appealing to users.  I really, honestly think they don't know.  I think they really believe users want a torrent app that does everything imaginable.  They probably think it was a fluke that uTorrent become so popular without being loaded down with all those ""useful"" features that surely users must want.

More than that, what really drove me to finally stop using uTorrent for good was the atrocity I saw when I installed the latest version.  There must have been half a dozen spyware, adware, and paid bloatware garbage applications that it tried to push at me.  The screens were even designed in such a way to fool novice computer users into choosing to install the junkware by using misleading text and dialog boxes that seemed to imply it was necessary or advantageous to install the junkware programs.  

I've had it.  I'm done.  I'm actually angry at this piece of software at this point.  And I'm not the only one.  Users are going to start dumping µTorrent in droves.  We've seen it happen to countless other programs that went from popular to hated because of this very thing (anyone remember RealPlayer? or WinAmp?).  

But some companies will never learn.  So they repeat the same mistakes, grasping for every dollar they can strangle out of their userbase, until they find they have no users left.

I really think it's probably too late to save µTorrent at this point.  Once you lose the faith of your users, it's almost impossible to gain it back again.",,False,self,t5_2qh3k,False,,,True,t3_ym8rz,http://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/ym8rz/µtorrent_has_lost_its_way/,

Essentially, it is a volume license purchase plan for companies to use to distribute large quantities to their employees as a ""perk"" for working there. There are a lot of companies that either don't know that they can take advantage of this, or they don't bother telling their employees that they can get Office Pro for $10 (Or Office for Mac, for the same price). It is even mentioned on the [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_2013#Distribution_changes) page for Office 2013

The price is valid for companies that are part of the Microsoft HUP (Home Use Program). You must enter your company email to qualify. I have also seen school &amp; military emails work for this deal (Military personal would use the .mil email address in the form of @us.af.mil, @us.navy.mil, etc for it to work).

Even if your company email is not working, but you know they are part of HUP. You can get a program code from HR/Admin and enter it in at the program eligibility page.

Then click ""Enter Program Code Manually"" on the right hand sid

Follow these simple steps:

1. http://www.microsofthup.com/hupus/home.aspx?country_id=US&amp;dialect_id=en-US&amp;WT.mc_id=vc885&amp;lookup

2. Enter your work email address to check your company's eligibility.

3. Microsoft will send you an email with a buy link

4. Buy the software, download and Enjoy!.

Allows you to Buy

* Office for Mac 2011 - $9.95

* Microsoft Project Professional 2013 - $9.95

* Microsoft Visio Professional 2013 - $9.95

* Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013 - $9.95

These are all digital downloads but you have the option of a back up disc for $13 too.",,False,self,t5_2qh3k,False,,,True,t3_1d5u9x,http://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/1d5u9x/in_case_you_didnt_know_microsoft_has_a_hup/,

Not just bad, they HATE it! Using windows 8 for almost 2 moths now and i'm very happy with it

_____________________________________________________________________________






I am a 21 year old ICT student, wich means i use PC's and laptop almost all day long. I consider myself a heavy user because i know almost all windows shortcuts. When i get something new, i inspect it thoroughly and i find all options/setting verry quickly.

I've used Windows 95, 98, xp, Vista and 7. I've also used Ubuntu (started at 10.04), linux mint, Backtrack 5, chromium os, and some more i don't remember. Now it's Windows 8's turn. **As a matter of fact i'm typing this in windows 8**.

I have to admit, when i first installed it i had some problems finding things. But it really isn't that difficult as many say.
I got to the Metro UI (wich isn't even called metro anymore) and i thought it was looking great! Simple, yet compact. 

A lot of people complain about how terrible IE is. Yes it is (the metro version). But if you are somewhat a regular pc user, you don't even look at IE. The only time you'll want to use it is to download another browser, wich was chrome in my case.

The default music player? It looked nice at first, but not practical so i installed AIMP3 and VLC. 

I hear many people complaining about metro, how stupid it is, how they don't find their apps, how there is no global search option (wich there is). This is how i use the start menu: press the windows button ( i practically never use the start button in windows 7 so i didn't even had to adapt), type the first two or three letters of the app you want to open et voila. It will open on the desktop, wich looks just like windows 7.

In my opinion windows 8 is faster and visually more appealing than any other OS i've used before.
I tested a few games a month ago. I have a Dell Studio 1737 laptop wich isn't really a game laptop, but it can handle some heavy programs/games. I was surprised how well they ran!! The fact that there wasn't even a driver installed made it even more stunning! Just the default windows drivers! 

In windows 7 it annoyed me that i coulnd't scroll smoothly. I don't know how to explain it in English but it didn't go smooth at all because my driver did not support it. Windows 8's default driver made scrolling much more pleasant!

When i bought my laptop i ordered a bigger battery. A 9 cell battery instead of 6 cells. But even with a bigger battery my longest uptime without recharging is 2.5-3 hours in win7 and 3.5 or even 4.5 hours in win8

Windows 8 has been my primairy OS for almost two months now (dual boot with windows 7) and i have to say, i'm really liking it! I admit, finding everything at first can be an adventure, but once you found it, you'll wonder why you haven't found it earlier.


Now, with that said, i don't understand why so many people dislike windows 8. And when i say ""dislike"" i actually meant ""**hate**"". I understand if some features or things bother you, but i don't get how you could hate the **entire** OS.
 

 
 

Everytime i read a review everthing *sucks* in their opinion. Not even 
&gt;""i did not like this but hey, that's just like, my opinion, man"" 

but more like 
&gt;""This SUCKS and you should NEVER EVER buy windows 8!!!""

And now i really feel like the only man in the world who actually likes windows 8 and would recommend it to friends!

This post came out a bit longer then i anticipated but i had to share my thought to the world. I'm sorry it had to be you, /r/windows. 
Also, i'm not very good at writing long texts. Especially in English, wich is my third language so i'm sorry if it was boring and full of mistakes :)

**Major Bypasses, Removals, and Alterations to Windows 8 to make it work more like previous versions of Windows**

* Boot Directly to the desktop: [Classic Shell... free](http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/), [Skip Metro... free](http://winaero.com/comment.php?comment.news.103), IObit's [StartMenu8](http://www.iobit.com/iobitstartmenu8.php), [StartIsBack... $3](http://www.startisback.com/#features), [Power8... donation optional](http://code.google.com/p/power8/), [StartW8... Donation supported](http://www.areaguard.com/startw8), or [Retro UI... $5](http://retroui.com/), [this hack](http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-skip-start-screen-natively-without-using-any-third-party-tool/) or [this hack](http://www.windows8update.com/2012/08/22/boot-directly-to-the-desktop-in-windows-8-new-shortcut/) or [this hack](http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/bypass-windows-8-start-screen-to-jump-directly-to-desktop-on-startup/). 

* Get a civilized start menu:   [Classic Shell... free](http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/), [Start8...$5](http://www.stardock.com/products/start8/), IObit's [StartMenu8](http://www.iobit.com/iobitstartmenu8.php),  [Power8... donation optional](http://code.google.com/p/power8/), [StartIsBack... $3](http://www.startisback.com/#features), [StartW8... Donation supported](http://www.areaguard.com/startw8), [ViStart](http://lee-soft.com/vistart/), the [Pokki Win8 start menu...free](https://www.pokki.com/windows-8-start-menu), and [Retro UI... $5](http://retroui.com/).  If you just want a start BUTTON, but are fine with the new start screen as it is, then [the Tweaks.com start button is a nice little configurable utility](http://tweaks.com/software/start/).  [A separate review of most of these software packages is available here.](http://www.infoworld.com/d/microsoft-windows/9-windows-start-menus-windows-8-208963?page=0,0)

* Regain a unified search function instead of Win8's broken search.  There are a number of different free and commercial Windows Search Replacements, but their relative advantages and disadvantages are complex.  [Here's a good article discussing them](http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/free-replacement-windows-search.htm), but the best free alternative seems to be [Everything... Donation Supported](http://www.voidtools.com/).  Also, [StartIsBack... $3](http://www.startisback.com/#features), [Start8...$5](http://www.stardock.com/products/start8/), [ViStart](http://lee-soft.com/vistart/), and [StartW8... Donation supported](http://www.areaguard.com/startw8), and [Classic Shell... free](http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/) make stabs at reconstructing comprehensive search.

* Kill Hot corners: The hot corners can be disabled by [these registry hacks](http://www.instantfundas.com/2012/08/disable-start-screen-and-hot-corners-in.html), by these programs:  [Power8... donation optional](http://code.google.com/p/power8/), [Skip Metro... free](http://winaero.com/comment.php?comment.news.103), [Retro UI... $5](http://retroui.com/), [Classic Shell... free](http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/).

* Metro Apps opened inside civilized windows instead of full screen: Two tools can do this: [Retro UI... $5](http://retroui.com/), and [ModernMix... $5](http://www.stardock.com/products/modernmix/features.asp).

* Keep the Taskbar visible even when the Start Screen and ""modern UI"" apps are open: So far the only tool I know to do this is [Retro UI... $5](http://retroui.com/).

-----
**Minor Bypasses, Removals, and Alterations to Windows 8 to make it work more like previous versions of Windows**

* A lot of the behaviors of the taskbar in both Windows 7 &amp; 8 can be controlled with [7+ Taskbar Tweaker](http://rammichael.com/7-taskbar-tweaker) including, task grouping, stacking, thumbnail-previews, left, right, scroll-wheel, and middle click actions.

* Launch ""Modern UI"" apps from the desktop:  [Detailed Instructions](http://itswindows.com/tips-windows-8-launch-metro-apps-desktop/).

* To collect the many setting of Win8 into one place one can make a [GodMode folder for Win8.](http://tweaks.com/windows/61231/activate-windows-8-god-mode/)

* Disable the ribbon version of Explorer on Win8.  [Ribbon Disabler for Windows 8 ](http://winaero.com/download.php?view.18).  You can also set up the drives as the default view instead of libraries [with this hack](http://tweaks.com/windows/63907/launch-file-explorer-with-drive-list/).  Although frankly there are 3rd party file managers out there more powerful than either version of explorer; I suggest [A43... free](http://www.a43filemanager.us/).

* Get the old task-manager and briefcase back.  The people at WinAero have provided us with [Instructions and appropriate tools to do just that](http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-restore-the-good-old-task-manager-in-windows-8/).  Although frankly there are 3rd party task managers out there more powerful than either version of task manager; I suggest [Process Explorer](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-ca/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx).  

* The windows briefcase can be [re-enabled via a registry tweak](http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-restore-the-missing-briefcase-feature-in-windows-8-rtm/).

* Turn off SmartScreen filter for installing 3rd-party applications using [This Hack](http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-turn-off-smartscreen-filter-for-windows-8/).

* Get rid of the lock-screen: [Step by step instructions](http://www.windows7hacker.com/index.php/2012/07/how-to-disable-and-bypass-windows-8-lock-screen/).  If you want to keep the lock screen and log on with a pin, [then you can use this hack to force on the Num-Lock key when the lock screen is showing.](http://tweaks.com/windows/64867/enable-num-lock-on-the-windows-8-logon-screen/)

* Get desktop gadgets back:  I never had any use for them, but you can get them back with [8GadgetPack](http://8gadgetpack.bplaced.net/).

* Windows Games such as Minesweaper, and Solitair have been included in Windows for many years.  [In Win8, they must now be downloaded in the windows store, and are metro-apps](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-8-version-of-minesweeper-includes-themes-adventure-mode/) rather than desktop applications.  If you want the [old desktop versions they can be copied from an old computer onto a Win8 as described here](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/replace-terrible-windows-7-games-classic-xp/).

* Get back DVD movie support.  Windows used to have this functionality natively.  Now we need a 3rd party app.  A good one that is free is [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/).  Similarly, Windows Media Center, is now only available as a costly upgrade.  However there is a free alternative Media Center program [XBMC... Donation Supported.](http://xbmc.org/download/)

* [XPmode that works in Win 8](http://lifehacker.com/5965889/how-to-run-windows-xp-for-free-in-windows-8?utm_campaign=socialflow_lifehacker_facebook&amp;utm_source=lifehacker_facebook&amp;utm_medium=socialflow).

* [IE in metro mode now supports flash on all websites, unless they are specifically black-listed on a ""compatability view list"".](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2013/03/11/flash-in-windows-8.aspx).  If you are using an earlier version of Win8 and IE10, then the non-desktop version of IE10 might only support flash on specific white-listed sites.  If that is the case. you can edit the local version of this list to include other sites [using this method](http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2012/11/05/how-to-use-microsofts-own-whitelisting-feature-to-enable-flash-on-the-metro-version-of-ie10/).  Although I have ot tried it, it stands to reason, that the existing blacklist for IE10 could also be bypassed in this manner.

* Microsoft has made a number of Metro apps the default applications for opening many media files.  So double clicking on a file can invoke metro apps even if you are in the desktop and avoiding metro implicitly.  Since even the best metro apps are generally dramatically less powerful, useful, or intuitive than their desktop alternatives this can be very annoying.  One option is to [individually change the default association between each file type and its application](http://www.howtogeek.com/127559/how-to-make-images-music-video-and-pdf-files-open-on-the-desktop-in-windows-8/), however this is very slow and tedious.  It is however possible to uninstall all of the default metro apps for a user or all users all at once [using a command in powershell as described here](http://techdows.com/2013/02/remove-windows-8-default-apps.html).  Also, Microsoft has [unwittingly given us a way to prevent Metro apps from running at all by requiring that User Account Control be enabled in the registry for them to run](http://www.gamespot.com/forums/topic/29309528/windows-8-disable-uac-and-keep-metro-apps-functioning).  There are security issues with disabling UAC, but doing so is another way to kill all metro apps in one step, but it's probably better to uninstall them using the powershell command.  [A wide variety of free replacement desktop apps can then be downloaded and installed in batch via Ninite](https://ninite.com/).

**Appearance and theme alterations to Win8**

* Disable transparency of Windows 8 Task Bar:  [Start8...$5](http://www.stardock.com/products/start8/) has an option to do this.  [Classic Shell, as of v3.6.6 (April 2013)](http://www.classicshell.net/) can now do this as well.  The most commonly cited way to do this is to re-enable the aerolite theme as [described in this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irYQeJqhRzo) and [this article](http://www.askvg.com/how-to-enable-hidden-aero-lite-theme-in-windows-8-rtm/).  This theme also has black borders around windows making it more useful.

* If you want the transparent window border with blur effect from the days of Aero-Glass in Windows7, then you can get it back with [this hack](http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/161788-).

* It used to be that an interface to adjust window-border padding existed.  That interface has been removed but the setting that it controlled can still be accessed [as described here](http://tweaks.com/windows/62971/adjust-window-border-padding/).

* The 'Advanced Appearance' dialog to control most windows appearance settings like text size, color, background size, etc has been removed in Win8, [however the old Advanced Apearances settings still exist in the registry as they did in Win7, and can be altered directly from the registry](http://www.askvg.com/how-to-access-advanced-appearance-settings-option-to-change-text-size-in-windows-8/).  There is still [a gui for changing text size](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPOrtG-Kjds), but colors require the registry.  The color of windows and taskbar can be set with [Aero8Tuner](http://winaero.com/comment.php?comment.news.95).

* Windows compresses images that are set to the desktop background.  This has been so on all recent windows versions, but because of the desktop syncing feature of Win8, the compression level is set higher.  This can lead to background images, particularly vector art images looking very poor.  Fortunately, this ""feature"" can be bypassed [as described here.](http://www.neowin.net/forum/topic/1115331-wallpaper-quality/page-2?p=595278309#entry595278309)

* Out of the box, a lot of the start screen's appearance and behavior can not be customized.  Fortunately, there are 3rd party solutions: [Windows 8 Start Screen Customizer... site is in spanish](http://apps.codigobit.info/).  With [this app](http://vhanla.deviantart.com/art/Windows-8-Start-Screen-Customizer-v1-3-beta-337308916), a lot of small visual effects in the Start Screen can be added or controlled.  You can customize the appearance of the start screen in many ways with [Decor8... $5](http://www.stardock.com/products/decor8/index.asp).

* MS has set it up such that themes can only be loaded that are digitally signed from MS itself, however [this requirement can be lifted with a variety of pieces of software as described here](http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-install-third-party-theme-in-windows-8/).  However, these software patch system files, which is intrinsically dangerous.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!  Once system files are patched, you can install 3rd party themes.  You will be able to find loads at [DeviantArt.com](http://browse.deviantart.com/).  One theme of note is this [reconstruction of the Windows Classic Theme for Win8](http://kizo2703.deviantart.com/art/Windows-classic-theme-for-Windows-8-RTM-325642288).

**Customizations to Windows 8 that don't attempt to change the Windows 8 paradigm**

* User Account Control (UAC) can be disabled by either a registry hack or by running as an administrator and [selecting ""Never Notify Me"" in the control-panel interface](http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/5509-user-account-control-uac-change-settings-windows-8-a.html)  If you want to disable UAC in Win8 AND be able to run Metro-Apps, you must use the linked control panel method.  The registry hack is not compatible with Metro.

* Create Custom Refresh Point In Windows 8 [With Recimg Tool](http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/create-custom-refresh-point-in-windows-8-with-recimg-tool/).

* A lot of customizations can be made with [Windows 8 Manager](http://www.yamicsoft.com/windows8manager/index.html).

* Windows 8 natively doesn't let you pin just anything to the start page... only apps.  Fortunately, our friends at WinAero are here to rescue us with [Pin to 8](http://winaero.com/download.php?view.36).

* You can change the number of app tile rows in the Windows 8 start screen [with this hack.](http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/increase-number-of-app-tile-rows-in-windows-8-start-menu/)

* You can make custom tiles for the start menu with [OblyTile](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1899865).

* The Win+X menu can also be customized with [this tool from WinAero](http://winaero.com/download.php?view.21).

* Several of the apps that ship with Windows8 have advertisements built into them.  If you find the idea of paying for adware offensive, these adds can in fact be removed.

judging from the screenshots, these come from a new build of windows 8, and seem to be the ones we'll see at //Build today. here you go:

[Lock Screen](http://i.imgur.com/frrMS.jpg)

[Start Screen](http://i.imgur.com/KFs23.jpg)

[Visual Studio 11 express with the slate emulator open](http://i.imgur.com/R6E1J.jpg)

[Performance Tab of the Task Manager](http://i.imgur.com/aGvzp.jpg)

aside from these, the blog post wasn't saying much we didn't already knew...
Basically, 
the same app on win7 runs slower than on the dev preview of win8;

3 new security functions: Secure Boot, System Refresh and a set of APIs to create or install certificates for apps who interact with webservices. 

**Secure Boot** basically closes (rough translation, i'm french not spanish) components of the boot to prevent malware from taking control of your machine, if the components don't pass the MS certificates, they're reinstalled from a secure location.

**System Refresh** is what it sounds like if you've screwed up something, it takes your archives, favs, pics, profiles separates it from the os, reinstalls the OS and at the end of the task opens with the compartiment which stored your files.

**The new set of APIs** apparently seems to be directed to Metro Apps who interact a lot with webservices and such and let you create or install certificates specifically for the packets downloaded with restriction permissions.


The post then talks about the Metro interface and how it's made for the use of apps which makes you think that the old desktop is now more like an app itself made to run apps inside (photoshop, powerpoint etc)
The apps must work together, ie: if you're looking for something and the results come from bing but are presented directly inside the app you're in (and formatted accordingly)

as for developing the apps, HTML5 and CSS3 for the interface, JavaScript for the logic.
or if you're using C++ / C# or Visual Basic for your logic, XAML for the UI. as for games, C++ and DirectX 11.1 (I'm guessing C# and XNA too) and win32 (COM), and APIs from the .NET framework.

That's it from the article itself, sorry if this seems a bit unorganized, but I haven't translated spanish in a while (and like I said, i'm french...)

1341979767.0,79,self.windows,wd9pq,Just clarifying a few things about Windows 8.,96,17,126,http://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/wd9pq/just_clarifying_a_few_things_about_windows_8/,"There seems to be a surprising amount of confusion and misinformation about Windows 8. So let me try to clear a few things up. Admittedly, I don't like the Metro UI much, but I'll be as neutral as possible.

I am not an expert. However, I have actually used the developer, consumer and release previews, so I have some experience with Windows 8. I am typing this on a mediocre 4-year-old laptop running Windows 8 Release Preview, so if I am not sure about some OS feature, I can quickly check it.

Why am I doing this? I'm just bored. Also annoyed at all the Windows 8 misinformation.

Here are a few points to start with. Feel free to pipe in with your questions and comments.

~

Q) Which version should I buy?

A) If you want to buy and install Windows, you have 2 choices - Win 8 and Win 8 Pro.

If you have a license for XP, Vista or 7, Win 8 Pro will be cheap as an upgrade until Jan 31, 2013, so get that. After that date, Win 8 will probably be cheaper than Win 8 Pro. [See the differences between Win 8 and Win 8 Pro here](http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2012/04/16/announcing-the-windows-8-editions.aspx) and decide for yourself which one suits you best.

There is another consumer version of the OS: Windows RT (note that it is Windows RT, not Windows 8 RT). You can't actually get the installer for it though; Windows RT will come installed on ARM tablets. So, if you're buying an ARM tablet that has Windows on it, Windows RT is your only choice.

~

Q) Do I get Office free with Windows 8?

A) Windows RT will come with Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote 2013. You'll have to buy Office separately on Windows 8 or Windows 8 Pro. Or, you know, continue to use whatever Office you already have. All applications that run on Windows 7 will also run on Windows 8 and Windows 8 Pro.

~

Q) How do I turn off Metro?

A) You can't. You can, however, stay mostly on the Desktop in Windows 8 and Windows 8 Pro.

Also, you can uninstall all Metro apps except the Desktop app and the Store app. This may change in the final version, though I doubt it will.

Also, most people refer to the Start screen as ""Metro"". Metro is much more than just that - it is more appropriate to term all the modern UI elements in Windows 8 that follow the Metro design language as ""Metro"".

~

Q) How do I boot straight to the desktop?

A) You can't boot straight to the desktop. You can resume from sleep straight to the desktop.

~

Q) How do I get the Start button and Start menu back?

A) You can't. Or maybe you can if Stardock builds a program for it. The Metro Start screen is an effective replacement for the Windows 7 Start menu. In Windows 7, you click on the Start button to get to the Start menu. In Windows 8, you do something similar to get to the Start screen:

* With keyboard - tap the Windows logo key

* With mouse - click the bottom-left corner of the screen

* With mouse - hover the pointer at the bottom-right of the screen for a second, the charms bar will show up. Click the Windows logo charm.

* With mouse - Swipe from the top-right of the screen to the bottom-right, the charms bar will show up. Click the Windows logo charm. (You don't need to swipe down all the way)

* On a tablet - tap the Windows logo key.

* On a touch device - swipe inward from the right edge, the charms bar will show up. Tap the Windows logo charm.

Lots of choices there, you just need to know the one that suits you best.

~

Q) Can I use Windows 8 with keyboard and mouse, i.e. without a touchscreen?

A) Yes. Additionally, the experience with keyboard and mouse is on par with the touchscreen experience. This holds true for Windows 8, Windows 8 Pro and Windows RT.

~

Q) Is Windows 8 just Windows 7 with Metro slapped on?

A) No, it's much more than that. Windows 8 boots up faster than 7, performs better and has a number of functional improvements.

~

Q) Can I run Windows 7 programs on Windows 8?

A) Anything you can run on Windows 7, you can run on Windows 8 and Pro. However, you can't run them on Windows RT.


~

Q) Can I install programs without going through the Store?

A) You can install Metro apps only from the Store. Enterprise versions of the OS allow Metro apps to be installed from outside the Store under certain conditions. You can install Desktop (traditional, non-Metro) applications in Windows 8 and Windows 8 Pro from anywhere. You can't actually install Desktop applications on Windows RT.",,False,self,t5_2qh3k,False,,,True,t3_wd9pq,http://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/wd9pq/just_clarifying_a_few_things_about_windows_8/,

Closing Video showed an immediate drop in GPU temp and it went right back to 40C. I did this several times with the same results each time. Other full screen Windows 8 apps can cause a smaller leap in idle temperature.

I am new to this just like all of you...started playing last night


So many of you are pulling down the Win8CP to try it out, which is good. It's going to be a new experience for you - but keep in mind that this is still in beta and Microsoft wants your feedback (good or stark raving mad). Metro is the center of some rather heated debate at the moment, much of which I think stems from being totally new in concept. For me, it's defiantly a shift in direction...but so was 3.1 :)


**Key shortcuts are your friend as you learn to move around**

* Win key brings up the start(metro) view

* Win+X will bring up a quick launch style window in place of the traditional start bar.
* Win+A brings up the apps (aka - start) quickly. 
* Win+E brings up explorer (like before) 
* Win+R brings up run
* Win+T brings up the tabs for the current running process
* Win+I brings up the settings pane (right side) 
* Win+P brings up projector settings
* Win+D brings up desktop
* Win+F brings up files/search
* Win+H brings up Share
* Win+K brings up devices
* Win+L locks the box
* Win+M minimizes all windows (dektop)
* Win+TAB brings up the sidebar view of all running apps (cycle through)
* Win+#  brings up the process running in that space (same as 7)
* Win+W brings up settings
* Win+C brings up the quick sidebar (the name escapes me at the moment)
* Ctrl+shift+esc brings up the new Task Manager
* Alt+tab cycles through apps horz.

Grab an app and slap it to the side of the screen to keep it in view (handy w/ mail + desktop view). You can also force a left/right snap by right clicking the app once it's up on the side view

Using the facebook app built in has no ads (for those who aren't using firefox+adblock already :) )

Hyper-V is built in - go spin up all your favorite VM's and play around (Do try out Server). Native wireless support is now baked in (yay!)

Rainmeter works like a champ and is a really easy way to customize your desktop area. We still have the gadgets also

I call it **procrstn8**, mainly because I wanted to put an 8 in the name and the name 'Redd8' was already taken :)

It started as a quick weekend project to teach myself the WinRT programming model. But after I bought my first tablet(Surface RT), I kept craving that one more feature and have now spent more weekends(and nights) on this than originally planned.

It has enough features now and I feel confident in introducing it to this audience. Do let me know if you like it. Feedback and feature requests are welcome. Also, check out /r/procrstn8

3. **Save posts** you like and read them later
4. **Sort** posts and comments by top, hot, new, etc.
5. **Post a story** on reddit

12. **Search on reddit** using the search charm

1356900521.0,55,self.windows,15orcw,My 1994 experience with teaching a bunch of secretaries to use a mouse.,78,23,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/15orcw/my_1994_experience_with_teaching_a_bunch_of/,"When I was 16 years old (I'm 34 now) and starting my junior year of high school, my family moved to a new school district.  In my previous district, I had come from taking computer science 1 &amp; 2, and I made it clear to my guidance counselor that I had wanted to continue to take computer classes as I found them interesting and enjoyable.  He informed me that the school was just starting their computer curriculum that year and promptly enrolled me in the school's first computer class. 

On the first day, I walked in to a packed room, which was a bit of a shocker, even coming from a school system where computer education was mandatory.  The teacher was equally as shocked and while taking roll, stopped midway through and said ""could I get a show of hands of people who were sent here for typing classes?"" and almost every hand in the room went up.  ""Ok, if you have your hand raised, please go to your guidance counselor right now and explain to them that this is not a typing class.""  Afterwards, there was something like 7 of us.

Fast forward a couple of months, and the school district opens up the computer lab in the middle school after hours for the public to come and try out the new computers and learn a bit more.  (Remember, at this time, having a computer in the house was still considered somewhat special.)  I was offered a job with the school, maintaining the systems and answering questions for anyone that came by, which was primarily  the school district's secretarial staff, who would come in to learn how to use Word and ... well, Word.

And here we come to the point of all of this ... The first couple of weeks of doing this, I would be jarred from my game of Doom that I was playing on the server to a loud banging sound.  When I looked over, the  secretarial pool was picking up the mice and slamming them back down to click on things, and then when they would miss because the cursor would move just a tiny bit when they brought the mouse down, they would just line it up and do it again.  After I showed them how to use a mouse, the problem promptly stopped.

These were women in their 50's, 60's, and 70's for whom the term ""Word Processor"" didn't mean Word or Wordperfect or Open Office, but rather [something more along these lines](http://files.encuentra24.com/20/31/2031720_867cef.jpg).  The learning curve for them was straight up and down, and they adjusted very quickly once they were shown by a 16 year old kid how to click a mouse.  And when they asked how to use the most basic functions in Word, they started to learn on their own.

My point that I'm trying to get at here is that so many people are making such a big deal out of how different that Windows 8 is when compared to 7 (in practice, it's hardly at all), that they forget that this whole truly personal computing thing is still relatively new.

**Edit/Epilogue:** When Windows 95 came out, they spent a little time adjusting to the start menu, but once they understood how to get in to Word (which about half of them figured out on their own), they just went straight to work.  There was no dicking around on Yahoo (what's this Internet thing?) or loading up 50 toolbars.  They just went straight to work.

It was a completely different ecosystem with a totally new Interface.  Nothing at all looked like the Windows that I had taught them to use, and they adjusted to the new system mostly on their own.

Here's the thing that I found really amusing.  Care to guess who was that the person that had the most trouble adjusting to Windows 95 and complained about how the new interface was going to be a complete failure?

It might help some of us in the future. So please don't fall for this or let your loved ones fall for it.

I'm sure this has happened to many of you. But I thought I would share my experience. 

This morning I'm working away on issues like always when one of the admins calls me. 

""This is Derpa, I have a guy on the phone saying there is a problem with windows.""

""Oh, okay. I'll see what I can do.""

I take the call and it is a guy with a very heavy accent. 


They guy lets me know he is from ""Mircosoft call center"". Oh ya. Not ""the"" Microsoft call center, the one located in the Garden of Eden and plated with gold and diamonds is it?


He continues to tell me that my computer is seeing a report that there is something wrong with it. I ask him which computer. We have over 100 computers in the building not to mention all the servers. So I ask him if the report to him included a computer name or Ip address. Looks like the report to him only include the information ""Windows 7"", and nothing else. But he is pretty adamant that it is the computer I am currently sitting at. 


Well if he is so sure I had better let him troubleshoot this for me. So I proceed to let him troubleshoot it. At which point he gets really excited and says, 


""You see the c t r l key on your keyboard?"" he asks.


""Yes I see the control key on the keyboard."" I reply


""Yes the ctrl key."" he asks again.


I let him know again I know the key.


Finally he gets that I know which key it is. He then continues, ""Next to it is the windows key. Press that and the R key""


""Yep, done that. What do you want me to run?"" I reply.


""Type I N F and press enter.""


""Got it I have the INF folder up.""


He asks me how many files there are, to which I tell him. He then reply's, ""These are the hackings!""


I then start to see if he will play. I ask him again how he got my info and what my name was. He was good enough to know my first name from the Admin Assistant that transferred the call to me. But doesn't know my last name. 

Under his breath he then says, ""I'm a scammer. I want to scam you off your money""


I then ask him where he worked. Which again is just ""call center"". I then asked him for some random made up Microsoft reseller partner number. 


Hey then asks me if I am IT. I say yes. His response is classic, ""Liar, you're not IT. F*** off!"" and hangs up on me.


I love my job sometimes.


For those really interested here is a copy of the audio from the call.

At home, for the past few years, I've been schlepping around on a 2009 13"" MacBook Pro.  Frankly, I don't really need two primary computers, and I'm not exactly Apple-obsessive, and certainly the E6520 will beat the snot out of my old MBP and yawn while doing it.

So, with that, I'm thinking I'm just going to sell my MBP and make the Dell my primary machine.

In doing that, though, I have a few questions:

* I've got a bunch of pictures in iPhoto that I'd like to export either into a raw directory structure or directly import into something like Picasa (or some other photo management software).  Does anybody know of a painless way of accomplishing such a task?

* I'm looking for a good way to keep the Windows machine backed up, preferably over a network.  I've got a FreeBSD fileserver at the house with lots of ZFS storage, it would be great if there were some sort of file-level (read: incremental) backup solution available under Windows, preferably something baked in and that lets me look at historical backups at a file level.  I've never really gone looking for such a feature, so I don't know what to expect.  What about some sort of utility similar to Carbon Copy Cloner?

* I've actually enjoyed later versions of Safari, and if I could preserve bookmarks, etc., that would be great.  How terrible is the Windows version of Safari, and should I just move to Chrome or Firefox?

* Anything else I should know?

Some advice would be great -- I'm going to miss some things about Apple.  I really, really like their hardware form factor (nice big multi-touch glass trackpad... OMG, why can't other manufacturers emulate this?), however I'm just ""meh"" about OSX since 10.7, and I don't like feeling like a filthy hipster whenever I take it somewhere in public.  Overall, I don't like Apple enough to go out of my way to buy and keep a second computer around just for that purpose.

Also, completely sort-of-unrelated -- how's Diablo 3 run on a Quad-i7 and an NVS-4200M? :)

It's pretty rare to read tech news and come across an article written by someone who genuinely thinks Widows 8 is going to be awesome.

I even think a lot of the criticism is somewhat valid. I don't care much about the Start menu going away and I like Metro, but I don't like how Metro has been integrated into the OS. I'm not really a fan of the hot corners either because they feel unintuitive.

I'm curious to know how Microsoft is responding to the criticism. Is Microsoft taking it seriously into account, or do they know (or think they know) something we don't and are just going to push ahead with it. I know one guy who works for Microsoft and he loves Windows 8 and has been using it since last year but he's the sort of person who would rave about Apple products if he worked for Apple.

Windows 8 appears to be hugely improved over Windows 7 in so many ways but the integration of Metro seems to leave a bad taste in everybody's mouths.",,False,self,t5_2qh3k,False,,,True,t3_xec26,http://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/xec26/what_will_the_negative_publicity_mean_for_windows/,

This means you like to control when, and what updates are installed on your computer. Well since I got my new Win8 ultrabook, I've changed the update settings to ""Check for updates, but let me choose whether to download and install them"".

Well doing this breaks Windows Defender's autoupdate functionality as it depends on two things:

1. Automatic Updates are on, and...
2. That Auto updates have the default settings

(Now before you bug me about using Defender, I know it's not the greatest, but I'm too damn cheap to update to the latest Symantec Endpoint, and I am behind a pfSense firewall which scans ALL traffic and sends it via local proxy to an AV scanner before the traffic even reaches me. All malicious traffic is blocked by Snort.)

So with some Google-fu, I found this page: http://omnidirecttech.wordpress.com/2012/11/14/windows-defender-automatic-definition-updates-in-windows-8/

It shows you how to set up Defender to check for updates through the  Task Scheduler. Someone was even nice enough to leave a comment at the bottom of the page to show you how to do it through the cmd prompt.

So hey, maybe not a big deal for everyone, but for those of you who might share my frustration with this, here ya go.

It was a bit of a surprise, but when it came along, I couldn't be happier.  Clean, sleek interface, absolutely free, very simple, and apparently a very good net for malware and viruses.

However, I keep read articles about how it is falling behind in AV tests, and that it's losing certifications, and that its effectiveness isn't as good as it once was.

Can someone with actual knowledge/experience on the subject chime in?

[Example 1](http://www.informationweek.com/security/antivirus/microsoft-security-essentials-loses-av-c/240142986)

I'm sure many of you would be tempted to say ""It works fine for me!"" but I don't really care how fine you think it works for you.  I'm honestly interested to see if someone with industry knowledge could explain if these certifications really are that important, or if they're rigged or biased in some way.

Having said that. I am making an honest attempt at liking windows 8. The OS does have a lot of features I find useful. But also a lot of things that leave me scratching my head. 

I can deal with the new start screen as its not too dissimilar to other quick launch interfaces that came before it in OSX and Linux. It would be nice to have the option to have a button instead of a magic invisible corner button. But I guess that would be too much to ask.

The first issue I have is with dual monitors. The fact that every time I mouse between the monitors I hit either the charm or the application sidebars for a split second is really annoying There should be a way to set the 4 corners and avoid the space in the middle. 

The second Issue I ran into tonight was when I was trying out the music app.  I got it all configured picked a band and started listening to music. It was great.  I click on my 2nd monitor to go back to the desktop to work on my homework. BAM, no more music.  There really needs to be some kind of continuity between the desktop and the new ui.

The third issue is pretty much the same as the 2nd. I was watching a movie with netflix and decided that I wanted to look something up on the googles. I click the windows button ont he keyboard to bring up the start menu on the other monitor and BAM netflix disappears. It's almost as if microsoft forgot that computers are capable of multi-tasking.

I see so many people praising Windows 8 and pretty much dismissing anyone who does not like it as crabby pants who dont want to upgrade. So I gave it a shot. It feels horribly incomplete and not very fluid for the desktop user. 

I promised myself 2 weeks to adjust. But so far if some of these issues are not fixed. I think I will be rolling back to Windows 7. ",,False,self,t5_2qh3k,False,,,True,t3_13zn3j,http://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/13zn3j/a_few_big_problems_with_windows_8_so_far/,

I'm sure everyone is going to think this is a bashing post, but in fact, it's not. I bought a Macbook Pro 2012, with the 1440x900 Screen, not 24 hours ago and I am already to return it. I bought it due to great number of people I work with scream their passion about Mac and Steve Jobs. Don't get me wrong, I love these people but I really wanted something to work for me. Anyways, I got one and found a lot of downfalls with... not the software, but the hardware. I will go through each one of these and try to give some explanation.

 The first issue I had with it was all the adapters I needed to buy to get the basic port functionally I needed. I knew the fact going in that it could not support 2 external non Thunderbolt displays but not having basic ports such as HDMI and only 2 USB ports really is not ideal for me, personally. It’s 2013, my old D630 has more USB ports.. 

The second issue I had was with the cooling and the heat output of this machine. Any amount of stress put on the CPU will cause temps to hover at or above 70-80C. The same goes for the GPU, doing a full load test on the GPU will cause the temps to shoot upwards of 210F. This also directly heats up the CPU to the same temperature so any load put on both CPU and GPU at the same time is just asking for trouble. Which comes to another issue, the heat output.. This laptop works great while you are working on a word document or doing some light browsing but other than that, it heats up your legs and your desk. Since the entire thing conducts heat, your hands start to get hot..  My 11 inch W110ER handles the heat output much better than a 15 inch Macbook Pro. 

 Speaking of heat output and power, the adapter that comes with the Pro model is nowhere near powerful to sustain playing a game or rendering a video, let alone charging a battery. Simple math says just the GPU and CPU use more than 85 watts, throw in the screen, the wireless cards audio, SSD/HD, it just doesn’t make sense. Apple stated that if you exceed the power output of the adapter it will start the draw from the battery. Well that sucks if you are in a pinch or enjoying BF3. Battlefield 3 is the only game I noticed that forces the Macbook to draw from battery most, other games draw a lot less. Last thing, my particular computer had nasty backlight bleed at the bottom on the screen, it was so distracting while trying to watch Netflix or play games in the dark.. 

 so there is my opinion, I am back to Windows and will always be! Maybe Macbooks work for other people, but they do not work with my workload

Serious question.,79,46,122,http://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/1hmrex/why_do_people_still_install_java_serious_question/,"I'm talking about Java, and its runtime environment for Java coded objects.  **Not Javascript**, which is different.  Everyone uses Javascript quite alot when visiting a site and every browser supports it by default.  Java on the other hand is completely different and must be installed manually.  

With the amount of security holes it has, and its relatively low usage on the internet, I figured I would ask this question.  In the past, during the 90s it was a good practice to install Java because the sites running Java applets were much more common.  You would install the system, get the drivers, download Java and so on.  But these days things have changed, Java is rarely used on websites anymore and has almost been completely replaced by Flash.  Actually, aside from Minecraft, I can't think of it being used on anything popular anymore.  I have probably come across only a couple of (non-essential) sites that required it in 5 years.  It also happens to be **one of the most popular** ways drive-by malware gets installed onto systems, through Java exploits.  To me this doesn't sound like a good trade off for the amount of security issues it has.  I have asked this question in other places and the main response I usually receive is ""my company's website still uses it so I have to have it"".

* Each test ran with emptied browser cache, default browser settings, closed and restarted after each test. No other processes took priority.

* Each test was ran four times. Average was used for result data.

* **Requested feature:** A ""best of"" graph for the browsers has been created by normalizing all browser results and averaging them across the tests (using ""lower is better"" as negative impacts, also normalized). This assumes equal weight/importance to all tests.

If you are running Win 8, you probably noticed that there is no simple way to actually delete your network profile and network list. Technically it still can be done using 'netsh' command or some registry trick. I usually travel with my laptop and it has been quite annoying lately having lots of network list, the other day it reached up to Network 32.

So, I was doing a one-man hackathon (it is just something that I do once a month or more to improve my skills), then I came up with this little project. It is a tool to delete the network profile and network list.

It runs fine on my laptop, Win 8 Pro 64-bit. I haven't tested on any other machine yet. But it should work fine on Win 8 I supposed. It requires .Net 4.5 (pre-installed for Win 8). Well, Win 7 doesn't have this problem at the first place.

Code-wise, it is pretty simple and I still need to do some refactoring (lots of redundancy in codes). Code review is also welcome (I am still beginner). 

*Edit*:
If the program crashed, can you let me know in the comment what type of OS are you running, 32/64-bit, how it crashed, .Net version. More details are much appreciated as would be easy for me to debug.

So far I've only tested on Win 7 64-bit, and Win 8 Pro 64-bit and both work fine. ",,False,self,t5_2qh3k,1374135174.0,,,True,t3_1iiy0q,http://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/1iiy0q/better_network_win_8_wifi_profile_manager_i/,

I'm making this mainly for people who need it.,35,5,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/kcddy/my_steps_to_cleaning_any_windows_computers_anyone/,"1.	Backup your important files
a.	It is better safe than sorry. Copy them onto a flash drive or external to ensure their safety.

2.	Update the Windows OS
a.	Do so until it says no more updates.  
i.	Windows 7 has the option of installing multiple language packs. Only install the ones you actually need. You can hide all the rest.

3.	Update Programs
a.	This includes Firefox, Adobe, Java, and any other programs you use frequently.  
b.	You should also upgrade your software if you are able to.  Do some research on your older software and determine if you can better use a new version or not.
c.	Updating/upgrading your antivirus is also important and is discussed at the end.

4.	Remove Programs
a.	If you have programs preinstalled such as bloatware or applications you no longer use nor need, then it is best to remove them to clear up some hard drive space. You can go to add/remove programs in the control panel to do this.

5.	Install ccleaner (piriform.com)
a.	Once installed, run the cleaner.
b.	Clean the registry.
c.	Under tools you can select to uninstall programs and to disable startup programs
i.	Uninstall any programs you haven’t already done.
ii.	Disable startup programs that you know you do not need so do your own research. Keep the startups that look for updates active of course.

6.	Install Defraggler (piriform.com)
a.	I personally consider this better than the built-in defragging option.  It also gives you a better interface.  Install and run till completion.

7.	Install/update/upgrade Antivirus
a.	If you do not have any I personally suggest Microsoft Essentials (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx) since it does a good job, is free, and doesn’t annoy the user as much as some other varieties.  If you pay for your antivirus make sure to have it up to date and keep it that way.

8.	Run a full antivirus scan
a.	If it finds something allow it to remove the virus.  Depending on your antivirus it may ask or might do it automatically. 

After these steps you should have a faster system.  Make sure to update and clean regularly. The amount of time these steps take can range depending on many factors including the age, amount of use, and hardware of the machine. The first time is always the longest.

EDIT: I really should had added 'speeding up' in the title as well :/

&gt;A firewall protects your computer against unwanted guests from the Internet. But who protects your private data from being sent out? Little Snitch does!
&gt;
&gt;Little Snitch informs you whenever a program attempts to establish an outgoing Internet connection. You can then choose to allow or deny this connection, or define a rule how to handle similar, future connection attempts. This reliably prevents private data from being sent out without your knowledge. Little Snitch runs inconspicuously in the background and it can also detect network related activity of viruses, trojans and other malware.
&gt;
&gt;Little Snitch provides flexible configuration options, allowing you to grant specific permissions to your trusted applications or to prevent others from establishing particular Internet connections at all. 
&gt;
&gt;So you will only be warned in those cases that really need your attention.

Is there a close equivalent of Little Snitch on Windows?

1311390456.0,26,self.windows,ixdoo,I was the guy trying Windows for the first time in 7 years. It's been fun but switching back. Reasons inside.,43,17,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/ixdoo/i_was_the_guy_trying_windows_for_the_first_time/,"First, let me say that /r/windows is probably the nicest and most helpful tech subreddit I've seen. Maybe Windows users are just less fanboy-ish about their platform choice or something? Don't know. Whatever it is I found this /r to be much cooler than most tech subreddits.

To recap: I've been using Mac OS X and then Linux for the past 7 years. Hadn't touched Windows since XP way back when. I am one of those few people who doesn't even encounter Windows at work so I legitimately had 0 contact with it for the better part of a decade. I decided to install 7 on my laptop and asked /r/windows for advice.

It's been been pretty much a month. I've been using Windows 7 exclusively at home (my corporate laptop doesn't have Windows on it so only at home.) I've been writing code in it, doing the general browse the web and email stuff, and a little light graphic editing. After a month I can say it's definitely not right for me. There's plenty to like about it and I'm not going to knock it - 7 is attractive and not at all a bad OS - but it's just too alien to me and lacks too many features that upon not having them I realize I cannot do without. 

Here's a list (in no particular order) of the main reasons I am switching back:

1. Lack of an official software repo. I dread downloading programs on Windows. The process of going out on the web and looking for an app from a download source that wont leave me stuck with malware is just too stressful. I miss just installing whatever I want whenever I want without thinking about ""is this safe?"" ""is this genuine?"" The result was I stuck to open source software I already knew from Linux. Things like Firefox, GIMP, XChat, etc. So I was using the same software as I was on Linux, it was just harder to install.

2. Lack of multiple desktops. This one is just such a killer for me. I've found the process of managing windows on Windows a complete pain. I have all this stuff piled up on top of each other. Finding what I want when I want it is a mess. I love to have different desktops with different tasks on them and use spacial memory to navigate them. I just remember things like ""terminal is to the left"" and ""firefox is to the right."" Once you get that way of navigating ingrained in you nothing else works. And an add-on program doesn't work - you need multiple desktops integrated tightly into your desktop environment and window manager.

3. Crapware and disorganization. It seems like every app I download wants to - by default - install all kinds of rubbish. Task bars, virus scanners, little tool apps. I don't want that stuff. I feel like whenever you want to install an app in Windows you have to read every page of the installer with a hawk's eye to keep from installing something weird. Apps are also quite messy and disorganized - they almost always throw icons on the desktop and the structure of the Start menu confounds me; apps aren't categorized by type, it is arbitrarily named folders decided by the developer.

4. Command line. BASH is awesome. As a developer I found myself feeling like I was Batman missing his utility belt. The Windows command line is way too basic. PowerShell seems more full featured but I didn't want to put in the time to learn a whole new shell for the sake of an experiment. I tried CygWin but is was slow and not quite what I wanted. I use GNU tools constantly. I can't live without sed, awk, wc, grep, and friends.

5. The little things: I can't stand Windows' font rendering / ClearType. It's like the anti-aliasing is only on to the slightest degree. On high resolution displays Windows fonts look light, thin, and blocky. I never got used to it. There are no tabs in the file manager?! What?! That's insane! Having a whole mess of file manager windows open drives me nuts (and gets messy.) Windows update is way too aggressive. I twice ended up going down for reboots I didn't expect in the middle of doing something. You can tell a lot of apps are written with older APIs and just look ugly / out of date. I saw that a lot on Windows whereas Linux and Mac developers seem to do a better job of moving their apps to newer APIs. Linux systems also do a much better job of updating old API elements (like tool kits) to not look old so they old apps and new apps blend fairly well.

6. Lack of freely available high quality software. Anything full featured on Windows costs - and usually costs a lot. It's like the Ferengi designed it. On Linux I am used to having access to tons of great software for my hobbies. Music production software, virtualization software, digital painting and graphics editing software, all sorts of stuff I'm in to. I was able to get some of it for Windows (GIMP, Xchat) but most of it isn't available and the Windows equivalents cost big time. I am all for paying for software but hundreds of dollars for software in this day and age? Nope. And piriting is out of the question for me. I have a strict policy of never taking another person's work against their terms. If someone makes a program that costs too much I use an alternative; I don't take that person's work against their terms.

There are things I'll miss about Windows though. Here's a few:

1. The Windows 7 - not sure what you call it - ""bar at the bottom that is like a dock on steroids."" Definitely the best combination app launcher / manager thing I've used on any platform. I've come close to it on KDE but Windows 7's is great.

2. Firefox for Windows is fast, fast, fast, fast. Mozilla puts a lot more into Firefox for Windows as compared to Linux and it shows. I was shocked at how buttery smooth Firefox on Windows is. I will miss that.

3. Netflix. :( Back to only having it on my PS3 (and now my 3DS woot!)

4. Steam :( I &lt;3 Audiosurf

5. Windows is pretty consistently fast. It wakes from sleep fast. It connects to wifi fast (though the connect to wifi UI is not nearly as well designed as Mac or GNOME.) Windows pop up fast. Everything is pretty snappy. There are some Linux distros and DEs that are as fast as Windows on my hardware but none of the really pretty ones. KDE looks as pretty as windows but suffers fairly constant stutters. 

Well, that's it folks. Thanks for your help and all of your great suggestions. Please don't take this is a ""M$ Windoze is teh suxor!!!111"" fanboy rant. I really did try it for a month. I really do like it. It is just isn't for me. It never felt right. I never got used to it and frankly I enjoyed using my computer less because of the unease.

If it isn't, could you tell me where to post?) 

I've been using Apple products exclusively for the past 8 or 9 years and I'm finally at the point where I'm fed up for paying a premium price for products that aren't, in my opinion (no offense meant to Apple fans), worth it. I'm looking to buy a new laptop (and a new smartphone, but I'll probably get an android) in the coming months and was looking for advice on where to start. 

From a purely hardware standpoint, one of the things I like about my macbook pro is how portable it is. I like the fact that I can stop whatever I'm doing, close it, and be able to open it back up and start again wherever I left off. I also like how light it is (compared to some of the clunkier PCs I've seen). 

I have no idea where to even begin when it comes to operating systems. I've heard Windows 8 is coming out soon, but I've been so used to not having a choice, I don't know where to begin. I've been told that there are different versions of the OS for different purposes, but I don't know where to start. My dad is a CS professor and he's been telling me to get the same operating system that he's using (Windows 7 Ultimate and then he has linux on his other computer, but I don't think I'm ready to tackle Linux), but I'm worried that I'll end up spending more money for software that has a bunch of features that I don't need. I'm a college student (studying neuroscience) and I plan on having this laptop for the next 3 or 4 years.

Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated because, as you can probably tell, I'm very lost. Thanks!

**EDIT:** (copy and paste from a question below) I'm planning on using it mainly for writing papers and using the internet. My mac tends to get incredibly hot when I'm running multiple programs at once (for example, last night I had excel, word, and chrome all open at the same time and it sounded like it was going to explode), so if there's a machine that won't get as hot, I'd really like that.

I'm probably willing to spend around $2000 for a good machine, I just feel like I could get a PC that is top of the line for less than a top of the line mac. I've heard good things about the Samsung Series 7, but again, the people I've been asking are mostly CS majors (I had a pretty confusing and hilarious conversation that involved a lot of arguing between them and a lot of confusion from me with some of my dad's grad students), so I'm not sure if it's worth it.",,False,self,t5_2qh3k,1348945671.0,,,True,t3_10ock2,http://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/10ock2/switching_from_mac_to_windows_after_almost_10/,

Same thing with drivers and compatibility. It's everything else I'm worried about, I feel like I'm missing out on how Windows 8 should be used because I don't have any sort of touchscreen. A lot of the mouse gestures are kind of weird and even though I know them, I'm kind of uneasy about actually buying Windows 8 when the time comes. Having to switch between desktop and startscreen also feels clunky when I'm not using metro apps-it's hard to describe, it just seems weird that it was done this way. I feel like maybe I'm not getting it, that I should use it for a few more weeks (only been a couple of days) and it'll suddenly make a lot of sense and be fast and intuitive, but for now it feels weird.

* OS X's hotkeys seems to be more consistent (both from program to program, and in terms of typically being initiated by the apple key), and friendlier on the hands (meaning less contortion needed). Any tips on adjusting and becoming competent?

* Navigating Windows 8 is tricky, both because there's no start button, and the metro start screen seems somewhat redundant or tangential to the desktop. Any tips to understand and optimize it?

* On my macbook pro, I relied really heavily on the trackpad's various features (e.g., two fingers to initiate a right click). It seems like windows is better suited to having a mouse. Any tips?

* How do you best you the thinkpad's magic red button?

* Are there any programs that will improve the windows experience? (I've already done the ninite setup, which was *awesome*)

Beyond my questions/concerns, I'd love any additional tips you have to proffer.

By the way, this thinkpad's (T430) keyboard is dope; it's really satisfying to type on it.

Are you kidding me? Shouldn't you be fully aware, after years of getting your ass handed to you, how personal a browser choice is to people?
I wanted to see what this app web browser experience was like, I was ready to give it a real shot (utilizing it for quick web searches, wikipedia rabbit-holing etc.) for a month. I was even open to switching from Chrome to Internet Explorer.

I want to just let that sink in for a second. I was open to using IE. All the time. Of my own free will.

But that was based on being able to preview the browser at ""full strength"". That was based on not being forced to adopt IE as my default browser in order to even have the full experience.

This is classic Microsoft bullshit and I'm only upset because everything else they're doing seems to be trending in a generally positive direction.

Yes, this is a rant, I *am* full on mad and all my jimmies have been rustled.

I'd like to setup TWO instances on their PC of Windows 7 somehow using Windows virtual hard disks, but I've never done so.

Image 1 is a regular install with my usual goodies, and they get the administrator password to it.

Image 2 is locked down to Windows, a few core things (VLC), IE uninstalled, Chrome with adblock. Their router points to OpenDNS which blocks malware and other various bad sites.

This way they can install little games or what not for my cousins to their hearts content, but image #2 is always going to work for simple web browsing (Mom's email and MS Word). If they screw up #1, too bad until the next time I'm bored and feel like fixing it and restoring a backup.

So I'm planning on buying the new Razer Blade, however I'm not confident with being forced into Windows 8.

So I was wondering how are people finding Windows 8?

Has anyone one downloaded the many tools out there to bring back the start menu and how are they finding it?

Has anyone got a  Windows 8 laptop and downgraded and if so how easy was it to do? (I'm worried about drivers as the Razer Blade only comes in Windows 8 so not sure if the drivers will work with  Windows 7)

This placed a Google Chrome tile on my Start page as well as pinning the app to my desktop taskbar.

If Chrome is already running and I click the start page's Chrome tile, it brings me to the desktop and gives focus to the existing Chrome session. If Chrome is NOT running, that very same tile will launch Metro app Chrome.

So that's a little weird but it gets better. As far as I can tell, that tile is just a shortcut to Chrome sitting in my ""Users\whatever\Start Menu"" folder. If I right-click this and hit 'Pin to Start' then it will make a copy (So, ""Google Chrome (2)"") in the start menu that behaves differently: clicking it will always launch a new desktop Chrome session. Viewing the shortcut properties, they look literally identical except that the file size is a bit different.

Now to make matters sillier, on my friend's computer, also just upgraded to Windows 8, the Chrome tile will *always* launch Metro Chrome.

Now my issue here is that between the two of us, we have three different Chrome shortcuts that all do different things, and our operating systems are giving us ZERO cues regarding how to go about making one of these things in particular happen. To put things into perspective, we're both programmers and have been using Windows for years (my friend even works for MS, amusingly enough) so personally I feel that if it's not clear to *us* how to make this OS do what we want, I have no idea how your average user will make anything work the way they want it to.

(As an amusing side anecdote, when he tried to 'Pin to Start' his Chrome like I did, next time he opened the start screen it was completely blank. Literally zero tiles. However I'll put that down as a bug, whereas the rest of this is just poor design.)",,False,self,t5_2qh3k,False,,,True,t3_12aomu,http://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/12aomu/my_biggest_gripe_with_windows_8_inconsistent/,

1362852697.0,23,self.windows,19zaai,Mac-like Four Finger Swipe in Windows 8 Tutorial,33,10,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/19zaai/maclike_four_finger_swipe_in_windows_8_tutorial/,"After a good deal of research and effort I have enabled 4 finger desktop swipe on my Samsung NP700Z7C-S03 laptop. This allows me to swipe left or right and jump to a different workspace. I figured this might be a good place to post this because I went down the hackintosh road too and there's a good chance some of you may be interested.

First off there are requirements. I have only tested this with my pc so I can't guarantee it for other laptops or even other versions of windows on this laptop. But I'm guessing as long as you have Windows 8 (maybe 7) and an Elan (elantech) touchpad with at least 4 finger multitouch, there's a good chance it'll work.

First requirement: an Elan touchpad with at least 4 finger swipe. You can either check online to find out, or possibly go into your Elantech install directory (C:/Program Files/Elantech for me) and launch the ETDDeviceInformation.exe. Hopefully it's there for you as it was for me. That will tell you how many fingers it supports. Also any driver MAY work, but I'm using the newest samsung NP700Z7C touchpad driver available from Samsung's support website. My version is 11.7.2.1_WHQL.

Next requirement: Dexpot 1.6.6, Build 2227. Other versions or builds may work, but this is the one I'm using that I know works. This is a free download from http://www.dexpot.de. It is the program that enables multiple workspaces in windows.

Third requirement: Windows 8. There is a very good chance 7 will work fine but this is the one I know works. To be specific, Windows 8 Pro 64.
Alright, onto the process.

1. Install Dexpot
2. Load registry editor and go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Elantech/SmartPad. Make a backup of your registry settings just in case. Make a backup of your whole OS if possible. Do not change anything except what I specify. Be aware that modifying your registry could make windows unusable so backup and be careful if you're new at that. (Probably not a problem for this subreddit)
3. Open your Elantech specific touchpad settings UI and set it aside.
4. Open the Dexpot settings and go to controls on the left.
5. Change the following key settings to the following values if not there already: FourFingerMove_Enable=0x00000001 FourFingerMove_Enable_Mode=0x00000000 FourFingerMoveLeft_Enable=0x00000001 FourFingerMoveLeft_Func=0x00000004 FourFingerMoveRight_Enable=0x00000001 FourFingerMoveRight_Func=0x00000003
6. Go to your mouse settings window you've opened and make a small change, and then change it back. This should force windows to recognize the registry changes.
7. Go back into Dexpot's settings/controls section and open the ""Switch desktop"" list. Click on ""Next desktop"". Check ""Allow hotkeys without modifiers"" and uncheck any modifiers. Then click in the textbox underneath the modifiers. Perform a 4 finger swipe left or right (depending on how you want it to function, I prefer left like OSX). ""Keycode 167"" or ""Keycode 166"" should show up. Do the same with ""Previous desktop"" but with the opposite swipe.
8. Click apply and try it out.

If Keycode 167 or 166 did not show up then either your drivers or hardware doesn't support it, or something got mixed up in the previous steps. Check your drivers and retrace the steps.

I'm really hoping this works for other people. I've searched high and low for something like this and failed to find anything, so I hope others can find this useful. If you try it and succeed please let me know, especially if you're using a setup different than mine. If you try and fail, let me know what didn't work and if I can think of anything to help I will.

Also it's not quite as fluid as OSX, but it's better than nothing in my opinion. Also sometimes it doesn't work when certain programs are loaded and have focus, click on the desktop and try again.


Cross-post from Hackintosh.


**edit:**
You can also enable a mac-like app expose to show all current workspaces and applications on each, with the ability to drag windows to other workspaces.  To do this:

Set FourFingerMoveUp_Enable to 1 and FourFingerMoveUp_Func to 9 (which is pageup). Then go into the dexpot settings under controls/dexpot components and set the ""Window catalog (all desktops)"" to shift and then perform the swipe in the input box. Remember to change a setting in the mouse settings gui quick to make windows recognize the registry change.

You can set this to whatever your comfortable with, it doesn't have to be the shift key. But it should be something that most programs wouldn't catch and interpret differently.

Better yet, set the Func value to 4 again and just add a modifier. So far nothing seems to use Keycode 167 for anything else. I think technically it's supposed to be an internet forward/backward function but it doesn't seem to have that effect in chrome for me, or anywhere else. When setting a new key combination be sure to disable the originals first or it will want to change desktops instead of setting the value.

Note: I understand that some people will say ""looks fine, why change it?"" but it really doesn't seem to match the whole OS. 


I know there's a universal style that Windows 8 RTM does where your borders/taskbar matches your wallpaper. So why can't we do something similar with the context menu? Don't make it a pure color, but make it into pastel colors to match the overall style of the OS or whatever color the borders are.

1314591915.0,24,self.windows,jxn93,(basic) Windows Licensing and You!,26,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/jxn93/basic_windows_licensing_and_you/,"I see a lot of posts asking if a certain installation/upgrade scenario is possible with certain licenses. To help curb some of these, here's a basic guide to their licensing models and how they can be appropriately used. Please remember, this was written with consumers  in mind. Anyone with a the business with 5 or more employees should really get in contact with a Microsoft partner, as they have agreements that can save you some money in the long run.



This is a guide for what is *legal,* not what you can *get away with*.



**Version** = XP, Vista, 7, etc.

**Edition** = Starter, Home Premium, Business, Ultimate, etc.



* OEM Licensing - This is the license that comes with a new pc. If your computer has a Microsoft sticker on it with a Windows product key, that is your license for an OEM copy of that version and edition of Windows. Once the OS has been activated, you are legally allowed to run that operating system ONLY on that computer. Even if this computer explodes, you may not use that product key in any way/shape/form on another computer.
Microsoft seems to boil the definition of 'computer' down to the motherboard. This means you can upgrade any or all of your components as long as the motherboard hasn't changed. If your motherboard dies, you may replace it with the exact same make/model, but any deviation will cause Microsoft to consider it a 'new' computer (even if it's a worse computer).



* Retail - These are the 'boxed copies' that aren't upgrades. Each one of these that you own lets you install one copy of the OS (from scratch) on any computer you want, so long as you're only using it on a single computer at a time (per license).



* Upgrade - *Not to be confused with Anytime Upgrade.* Upgrade copies of Windows are applied to existing licenses, and can be applied to both OEM and Retail copies. **Windows Upgrades applied to OEM copies remain confined to the original computer.** Upgrades applied to Retail copies assume the transferability of the Retail copy. With current licensing terms, assuming you only ever owned one computer at a time, you could buy one Retail copy of Windows, and purchase upgrade copies of the new versions from here until the end of time, and be totally in compliance.



**FAQs**



&gt; What about 32bit vs 64bit?

OEM copies are restricted per processor architecture. During the install of any of the retail or upgrade editions, it will give you the option to select if you wish to load 32bit or 64bit. I'm not sure if it is smart enough to restrict you from upgrading a 32bit OEM license to a 64bit one.



&gt; What is Windows Anytime Upgrade?

Anytime Upgrade is designed to let you perform in-place upgrades of Windows Editions (i.e, you could upgrade a computer running 7 Home Premium to 7 Ultimate). In its current form, it cannot allow you to upgrade Windows versions (e.g. Vista to 7) nor can you go from 32bit to 64 (or vice-versa).



&gt; A friend of mine splits the cost of an MSDN subscription with friends and family and gets his Windows really cheap, what gives?

MSDN subscriptions give you access to many different Microsoft applications that can be registered and activated freely. However, these subscriptions are designed for developers, and per the Licensing Agreement, the software can only be used for development purposes. It's silly for consumers to do this, because you wind up paying money and still aren't in compliance with Microsoft licensing. You may feel like you're saving money, but push come to shove, you're still violating a license agreement, and Microsoft can still slap you.



&gt; What's the point in buying retail copies when OEM copies come with every computer I buy?

First and foremost, know that OEM copy of Windows is optional. Many manufacturers now offer computers with no OS pre-loaded. Even if they don't, you can usually call them (often after you've received the computer and tell them you've declined the Windows license agreement) and explain that you're not going to use that OEM copy of the OS, and get a portion of your purchase price back. This is a common tactic among Linux enthusiasts.

Secondly, if you're someone who buys new computers regularly, or someone who builds their own with frequent upgrades, it would behoove you to go the retail route, as you would likely save money over time vs dealing with OEM's this-computer-and-this-computer-only restriction, especially when Upgrades cost only slightly more than OEMs.



&gt; Can I download an ISO disk of win7 Home Pro, then install it using an OEM license?

No. Microsoft considers your media to be part of your 'license.' Using anything other than your original media is called 'diskloading,' and is a violation of the license agreement. Best Buy (and other shops like it) somehow get around this, because they always magically come up with restore disks to fix anyone's machine. I'm not sure if they have an agreement with Microsoft, a library of oem restore disks, or something more nefarious is up...

*I have no idea if this will even take hold, but ask any questions below and I'll try to answer them and/or work them into the FAQ.*
