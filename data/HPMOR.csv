1367001110.0,137,self.HPMOR,1d63xn,the unbreakable vow.,151,14,102,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1d63xn/the_unbreakable_vow/," &gt;""The Unbreakable Vow requires three participants and three sacrifices. The one who receives the Unbreakable Vow must be one who could have come to trust the Vower, but chooses instead to demand the Vow from them, and they sacrifice that possibility of trust. The one who makes the Vow must be someone who could have chosen to do what the Vow demands of them, and they sacrifice that capacity for choice. And the third wizard, the binder, permanently sacrifices a small portion of their own magic, to sustain the Vow forever.""

this is non-canon in its explanation, however the rationale supports the canon instances.  an unbreakable vow was accidentally made the same way(and at the same time) harry becomes an accidental horcrux when voldi kills his parents. magic is not an intentional thing, if it were the mages could whip their wands in any fashion and cause spells without words. certain requirements must be met to project spells. 

&gt;""Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead!""

she offers the vow, and sacrifices her belief that voldi is there to kill lilly and james (his combatants), instead of the innoncent harry.

&gt;Very well,"" said the voice of death, now sounding coldly amused, ""I accept the bargain. Yourself to die, and the child to live. Now drop your wand so that I can murder you.""

this is important, because it showcases the agreement. voldi, even if only in word, accepted the deal. even if lilly raised her wand to kill voldi, he still slayed her and fulfilled her role of death in the vow.  He basically stated, ""my killing you means harry will not die by my hand."" 

his sacrifice is the intent to kill harry, which he promised to lilly right before killing her.  Lilly breaks the intent by raising her wand to voldi, but fulfills her part in the bargain by her own death at voldi's hands. her sacrifice is acceptable because she had to sacrifice her belief that she and james were bigger targets than harry, and by expansion that her and her husbands actions were meaningful, without which she would not fight. at this point he has entered into an unbreakable vow to not kill harry potter. harry was witness to this exchange (evidenced by his recall) fulfilling the the last prerequisite for the unbreakable vow, meaning that a small part of his magical ability is tied up in the vow, unless its breakage releases him. 

this is what saved him, not any sort of mother's love, not any innate ability, it was the breaking of an unbreakable vow. in canon, that backlash means death. 

edit: cannon, canon; one fires balls, one is story compliance. 

Further Editing:

The only time we actually see evidence of the vow killing someone is if we accept the premise that some sort of vow was made between Lilly, Voldi and traumatized infant Harry using underage wandless magic which is more likely than it may sound. Tom Riddle, when interviewed by Dumbledore, admits that odd things happen around him when he is mad, usually to people he doesn't like. 

&gt;Before Harry Potter went to Hogwarts, he did several things accidentally using his magical powers. He turned his teacher's wig blue, shrunk one of Dudley Dursley's old sweaters that Aunt Petunia was forcing him to wear, and found himself on the roof once when his cousin, Dudley Dursley, and his gang were chasing him; this may have been a form of Apparition. He managed to grow all his hair back when his Aunt Petunia gave him a dreadful haircut using a pair of kitchen scissors. He also magically let a boa constrictor free from a zoo after he spoke to it in Parseltongue.

Given that apparition is a highly advanced and difficult spell, it could be assumed that if Harry could accidentally do it when confronted with bullies he could accidentally do quite a bit more in the the face of his parents' death.  Ron was only 5ish when the twins tired to trick him into the vow meaning that they were at most 8, meaning the spell is much less difficult, if no less dangerous, than apparition.

[Spoilers to chapter 96],115,3,118,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1j1kk3/what_does_lucius_do_about_all_this_spoilers_to/,"So you're Lucius Malfoy.  After a few immensely confusing run-ins with 'Harry Potter', you finally put two and two together after the Christmas battle speech and realize that Voldemort is still alive and possessing the young boy.  You confront him on the train-station platform and you and your henchman are unable to avoid expressing the fear you feel in your words and body language at confronting the dark lord who had controlled you like a puppet for so long (like Voldemort ever really needed an Imperius to get *anyone* to do exactly what he wanted).  

Nevertheless, you succeed in snarling, like one predator to another, and make it clear (you hope) that, while you recognize his dominance, crossing you or harming your son will lead to an unsheathing of claws.  You're having no more of this, and while you were quite capable of having a weak dark lord inhabiting a young boy's body assassinated discreetly while on his way to the platform, you can't be sure that he's all *that* weak.  He'd know it was you if you failed.  Of course he would; like you ever managed to keep any secret from him.  You're certain he knows you're considering this.

And then he goes and retrieves that damned madwoman Bellatrix from Azkaban.  The less said about that the better.  Sometimes it seems like the entire rest of the world must be blind.

After the events between Hermione Granger (a filthy mudblood likely being taught dark magic to raise her as the next Bellatrix with power comparable to her master) and Draco, everything breaks down.  You can't even understand what his plan could *possibly* have been.  Was he trying to further the blood purist cause by having a deranged mudblood girl attempt to assassinate your son?  Was Draco's survival supposed to be a gracious *gift*?  Is this some way of striking at *you*?  By turning your beloved son to Dumbledore's side?  Is Draco just going to be used as a weapon to weaken you in the eyes of his servants so you can be executed as a traitor later? Will *Mister Potter* shed crocodile's tears as he consoles his 'friend' in his grief, and becomes the sole trusted advisor to the heir of the Malfoy family?  It doesn't matter, but any doubts you might have had are dispelled as he presents, as a *Riddle* in front of the full view of the Wizengamot, that even Dementors are now afraid of him. 

Now he owes *you* a debt, which you *definitely* didn't intend for him to accept, and despite holding *his* fate in *your* hands you can't help but feel a crushing despair as it seems you're just being maneuvered into *another* one of his incomprehensible plans, AGAIN, despite *everything* you've done to prevent it.  He then kills the young mudblood, discarding her as a liability.  Is this another message?  Is *Draco* now a liability?

Somehow he's managed to accomplish ALL OF THIS and yet end up under Dumbledore's *protection*.  Dumbledore, who burned your wife to death, and then let your son *freeze*, and now shelters his attempted murderer; there's no way he could be *blind* to all of this!

-----

So what does Lucius do?

The stakes are already as high as a hundred thousand galleons and the life of his child.  Does he escalate, and unsheath his claws, or does he submit?  Will Harry respond differently than he did to Lesath if Lucius comes to bend his knee and pledge the support of the Death Eaters?

1375744386.0,85,self.HPMOR,1jrv29,Let's restart the discussion about the Nature/Source of Magic with emphasis on the available data. (Spoilers),108,23,146,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1jrv29/lets_restart_the_discussion_about_the/,"I've noticed a *lot* of people who are theorizing about the source/ultimate nature of magic in HPMOR without paying due attention to the data we got all the way back in Chapter 22, the super duper Lake Woebegone effect experiment.

&gt;Harry had thought about the nature of magic for a while, and then designed a series of experiments based on the premise that virtually everything wizards believed about magic was wrong. You couldn't really need to say 'Wingardium Leviosa' in exactly the right way in order to levitate something, because, come on, 'Wingardium Leviosa'?...

&gt;...But (Harry had reasoned) it didn't have to be that way, it wasn't built into the universe, it was built into *you*...

&gt;...what if you didn't know what the original spell had been like? What if you gave Hermione a list of spells she hadn't studied yet, taken from a book of silly prank spells in the Hogwarts library, and some of those spells had the correct and original instructions, while others had one changed gesture, one changed word? What if you kept the instructions constant, but told her that a spell supposed to create a red worm was supposed to create a blue worm instead?

&gt;Well, in that case, it had turned out...

&gt;...Harry was having trouble believing his results here...

&gt;...if you told Hermione to say ""Oogely boogely"" with the vowel durations in the ratio of 3 to 1 to 1, instead of the correct ratio of 3 to 1 to 2, you still got the bat but it wouldn't glow any more.

&gt;Not that belief was *irrelevant* here. Not that *only* the words and wand movements mattered.

&gt;If you gave Hermione completely incorrect information about what a spell was supposed to do, it would stop working.

&gt;If you didn't tell her at all what the spell was supposed to do, it would stop working.

&gt;If she knew in very vague terms what the spell was supposed to do, or she was only partially wrong, then the spell would work as originally described in the book, not the way she'd been told it should.

So. Let's start from the ground up and examine all of the in-story evidence we have about all the different sorts of magic we know of, seeking to understand everything we know about the problem- and the questions it raises- without necessarily proposing any solutions up front. I'll go from the sorts of magic we have the *most* information about to the sorts of magic we have the *least* information about.

Judging from the above, magic, in the form of **Charms**, depends on a *combination* of the user's intent and some specific formal spell actions- wand movements and incantation. Specific, reproducible changes to the spell actions (syllable length changes) produce specific, reproducible changes to the spell effect (lack of bat glow). Some rare, specific, reproducible changes to the spell actions appear to produce improvements (*Stupefy* to *Stuporfy*, Chapter 86). 

These altered spell effects brought about by changes in the spell actions are not generally in the habit of being dangerous, since schoolchildren practice spells by repeating an instructor's pronunciation and wand movements until they see them work right and are not regularly killed or turned into catgirls. Known exceptions to this general rule include Apparition and Oblivation.

Seriously incorrect intent or lack of specific intent produces total spell failure: mildly incorrect intent results in the spell acting in the 'conventional' way. (But note that mere knowledge that a spell is to be directed at an enemy is sufficient for the six-year Gryffindor to cast a powerful Dark curse in Chapter 26.) 

Charms are fatiguing to use (off the top of my head there's a clear example in Chapter 78 where Draco exhausts himself casting many Locking Charms in succession.) There is such a thing as 'raw magical strength', and many Charms pit this against another's spell (Alohamora vs. Densaugeo in Chapter 78 again). Some Charms are simply impossible to perform for the average person of a certain age to perform (see the explanation of why the Patronus is a difficult Charm that remains learnable by young children at the beginning of 43.) Raw magical strength seems correlated with raw intelligence, academic achievement, the user's age, and with the frequency with which they practice. 

Unanswered questions: 

* The specific permutations of failure associated with specifically mistaken or incomplete intent about what the spell should do. 

* The specific permutations of change associated with specific sorts of change to the steps (known changes: wand movements, syllable length alterations, syllable alterations. Others?) 

* The exact determinants of magical strength: in particular, how does academic achievement increase it? What *sorts* of academic achievement- will learning calculus increase it? Will writing an essay about World War II increase it? Will writing an essay about the Goblin Revolts increase it? Will writing an essay about *Alohamora* increase it?  What if I go through the equivalent of a year of Hogwarts *theoretical* education without ever picking up my wand? It doesn't seem like a simple repetitive-skill-practice thing, otherwise we'd see 'magical jocks' who train their raw power just by casting Charms over and over again but don't have a broad base of magical knowledge. 

* Some spells require an *emotional state* in addition to formal  spell actions and a specific intent for success. These include Avada Kedavra (caster must want the target dead as a terminal value) and the Patronus (caster must have a certain special kind of warm fuzzies.) They are both notable for being exceptionally powerful/breaking rules: AK can't be blocked or deflected, the Patronus can repel otherwise-invincible Dementors. Are there more such spells? Are they also exceptionally powerful/rulebreaking?

* One spell (the Patronus 2.0) appears to uniquely require an *ideological conviction* to cast (rejection of Death as the natural order). It breaks more rules harder and faster than the above two spells. Are there others? Are they similarly powerful?

* Why is the Charm of the Most Ancient Blade, uniquely, a full sentence? Do 'Tonare', 'Ravum Calvaria', and 'Lucis Gladius' have independent effects?

* Wordless Charms exist- see Bahry One-Hand 'thinking wordless spells to put more layers on his shields'. Are these an entirely separate class of Charm, or existing ones subjected to some unusually difficult degree of practice? They're ordinary Charms made wordless in at least some cases: see Dumbledore's wordless Patronus in 56.

* The means of creating new Charms is unknown at present. It may be as simple as trying permutations on existing Charms until a beneficial variant is discovered, as may have been the case with *Stuporfy*- but if Quirrell in 90 is to be believed, it's more complex and mysterious than that. (Many think that he isn't.)

Then there is **free Transfiguration.** Here, one fully general action (touch wand to target) in combination with varied intent (specifically expressed as a subject form, a target form, and the transformation between them) can produce widely varying effects, all of which are generally describable as turning one whole thing into another thing. Larger objects are harder. Attempts to turn something into an ill-defined general class of something else fail, even when backed with a great deal of focus and willpower (the failure to Transfigure an Alzheimer's cure or a desktop nanofactory in Chapter 28). Attempts to turn something into a specific example of something else, with detailed knowledge of its structure, succeed (carbon nanotubes in Chapter 28 again). Focused intent backed with detailed and accurate knowledge of physics-as-timeless-quantum-probability-distributions can break the 'whole objects into whole objects' rule. (again, the end of 28.)

Unresolved questions: 

* To what extent is free Transfiguration similar to Charm use in the use of 'raw magical Strength'? Harry is fatigued after completing his Free Transfigurations of water to rocket and wall-section to oil in Chapter 58, but does that mean Free Transfiguration is draining in the same sense as Charms, or is it simply mental fatigue from the stress he's under and the difficulty of focusing that hard for that long?

There's also **potions**. The traditional law here is that a potion 'spends that which is invested in the creation of its ingredients.' In an odd manner not associated with thermodynamics, but instead *apparently* associated with the perceptions of the wizard in question about what was invented in a potion's ingredients: nobody is going around accidentally unleashing the potency of the supernova that formed the atoms in their potion, they're unleashing the potency of *what they think of* as what created the ingredients. Here again is intent. 

Again, a specific formal set of actions is required, the stirring pattern: getting *this* wrong is not generally safe, like mispronouncing a Charm. It can kill people, or turn them into catgirls. But it's possible to come up with a Potion on the basis of what went into it, then look up the proper stirring pattern.

Potions are explicitly *not* dependent on 'raw magical strength' as Charms are.

Unresolved questions: 

* What happens if you have a mistaken idea about the potency of what created the ingredients- what if you precipitated some copper from solution, then cold-forged it into a Knut? 

* What happens if you have a different idea about the creation-potency- you want the supernova that made the copper atoms in the first place, not the heat that forged the Knut?

Then we have **wandless magic.** This is a broad category including Legilemency, Occulumency, childhood accidental magic, Parseltongue and Generalized Impressiveness. Commonalities: no sequence of steps, no tool, not apparently prone to being terribly unsafe to experiment with because Harry is not warned about liquefying his skull or going mad when practicing Occulumency. (This may be an unsafe generalization.) 

Types of wandless magic:

* Legilemency/Occlumency: Specific skills that must be learned independently, from each other and from other magical skills. Occlumency appears almost entirely psychological and decoupled from 'raw magical power', since Harry starts learning it early in his first year.

* Childhood accidental magic: I can't find any mentions of the classic canon examples- Harry's teleportation, Neville's bouncing- nor can I find a single instance of accidental magic happening 'onscreen.' Sprout writes off Harry's time-turned Invisibility Cloak pie trick as accidental magic from a threatened child in Chapter 13, a frightened child spontaneously Disillusioning themselves is mentioned as a possibility in Chapter 78. So: no spell actions, intense emotional distress required, specific intent for a particular effect *not* necessary. Also presumably not generally unsafe, since we have nobody talking about magical kids' heads exploding under stress. 

* Parseltongue: Apparently inborn, tied to a specific magical line, can't be learned, can't apparently be improved through practice and study. No spell actions, no intent, no emotional state required: if there's a snake, you can talk to it. An oddball here. Intuitively 'feels' like a spell effect, not a sort of usable magic.

* Generalized Impressiveness: Whatever it is that Quirrell and Dumbledore can do. Seems generally reducible to telekinesis which can also affect some spells, catching and manipulating them (as with Quirrel and Bahry One-Eye's Stunner in 54) or dispersing them (as with Quirrel's sneeze in 79), often but not always accompanied with wand gestures. Some of this may not in fact be wandless magic, but nonverbal Charms that require a wand to be in-hand but need no gestures- but Quirrell had *apparently* surrendered his wand at 79. 

Then there are **rituals**. From Quirrell's explanation of basic principles in Chapter 74, a ritual requires 'specific actions, significant choices', most often but not *always* a permanent sacrifice, and there's a night-and-day power difference compared to ordinary Charms. He goes so far as to say that the field of ritual magic 'contains all the furthest and most interesting reaches of wizardry'. Each ritual requires a 'chant' of what is to be sacrificed, and what is to be gained. They require wands (Chapter 23: '...the accursed Muggles had invented rituals that didn’t need wands...'). Known effects include multiple different kinds of better-than-Imperius mind control, Horcruxes, the bone of the father/flesh of the servant/blood of the enemy resurrection ritual, the spell of cursed fire/Fiendfyre. If Quirrell in Chapter 90 is to be believed, creating a new one is *incredibly* difficult and risky: many are unsure as to how trustworthy he's being there. Note that they don't have to be *slow*: there is a 'spell of cursed fire' that permanently sacrifices a drop of blood in the caster's body that Quirrell (allegedly) cast on-the-fly. It requires both raw strength of magic- enough that Harry can't cast it- and strength of will, or else it will consume you. Whether other rituals behave similarly is unknown.

There are **magic items**. We know very little about how these are made. At least some of these appear to function in accordance to the understanding of physics of those who construct them- Aristotelian broomsticks, for instance. Some are reproducible- such as, again, broomsticks. Some are not, such as the Invisibility Cloak and Philosopher's Stone. At least in canon, small-scale magic items of the reproducible type do not appear exceptionally difficult to make, since Fred and George were able to make some in their bedrooms as young schoolchildren and make a sufficient number and variety of 'joke' magic items to go into business immediately upon graduation. Also, there exist Charms that can create a one-time device that can reproduce another Charm- Harry got one from Flitwick to win the 'fight' with Moody in Chapter 86.

Finally, there are sorts of **magical creatures** other than wizards, each of which appears to have their own innate set of magical powers. We haven't seen a lot of this onscreen.


Now, just laying things out like this has me leaning heavily towards a few interesting conclusions already- but I'm not going to mention them. Let's try an experiment here:

**This thread is not for proposing any theories about magic, as a whole. This thread is *only* for bringing in additional data about how magic functions in the HPMORVerse, and to a limited extent attempting to figure out specific rules that underlie specific *kinds* of magic.

&gt; HARRY JAMES POTTER-EVANS-VERRES grew up in a house filled to the brim with books. He once bit a math teacher who didn't know what a logarithm was. He's read Godel, Escher, Bach and Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases and volume one of The Feynman Lectures on Physics. And despite what everyone who's met him seems to fear, he doesn't want to become the next Dark Lord. He was raised better than that. He wants to discover the laws of magic and become a god.

&gt; HERMIONE GRANGER is doing better than him in every class except broomstick riding.

&gt; DRACO MALFOY is exactly what you would expect an eleven-year-old boy to be like if Darth Vader were his doting father.

&gt; PROFESSOR QUIRRELL is living his lifelong dream of teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts, or as he prefers to call his class, Battle Magic. His students are all wondering what's going to go wrong with the Defense Professor this time.

&gt; DUMBLEDORE is either insane, or playing some vastly deeper game which involved setting fire to a chicken.

&gt; DEPUTY HEADMISTRESS MINERVA MCGONAGALL needs to go off somewhere private and scream for a while.

&gt; Presenting:

&gt; HARRY POTTER AND THE METHODS OF RATIONALITY

&gt; You ain't guessin' where this one's going.

**Oh, another crappy self-insert. Goodbye.**

Yes, we know, most fanfics suck. This one is different. How about this snippet from the Ch.33-34 Author's Notes:

&gt; A word on the rules this fic follows. It is *not* a strict single point of departure. Changes from the original Harry Potter universe may occur for any of the following reasons:

&gt; 1) Changes growing out of the fic's single point of departure - a single event that happened differently, at some point in the past. For example, Petunia seems to have married a scientist.

&gt; 2) Changes that smooth over the seams of the universe. When Rowling wrote the first book, it seems likely that she had not yet decided that there was a systematic, reliable curse on the Defense position. But of course, if the curse really had been operating for decades, everyone would have noticed and would be expecting something to go wrong with Professor Quirrell.

&gt; 3) Changes that result from taking a hypothesis more seriously. For example, if Harry Potter had really saved the whole nation on October 31st, 1981, wouldn't politicians invite him to ceremonies marking the 10th anniversary?

&gt; 4) Changes to the laws of magic so that, y'know, there are some. There are stories which can get away with having the laws of magic be unclear, because they are part of the background setting rather than the plot. This is not one of those stories.

&gt; 5) Changes that result from this not being a children's book. Writing a children's book is much harder than writing a story for grownups. I can't do it. Therefore this is a story for grownups... and that means it is impossible that an evil Peter Pettigrew is hiding out as Scabbers, the pet rat of an enemy wizarding family. In a children's book, this can be taken in passing. In a story for grownups, it would mean Pettigrew was holding the Idiot Ball. It is a general law of MoR that no one is ever holding the Idiot Ball.

&gt; 6) Changes that result from a general philosophy of upgrading obstacles to match the more powerful protagonist. One illustration of this is that in *Goblet of Fire*, there is a point where canon!Harry on a broomstick faces a dragon called the Hungarian Horntail... which in Ch. 16 of Methods is said to breathe fire quickly and accurately enough to melt a Snitch in midflight, implying that canon!Harry would have gotten roasted in an instant if he'd tried the same thing in this universe. But of course the Triwizard Tournament could not possibly take place the same way in this universe, because this is not a children's story, and in a grownup story that plan would require Lord Voldemort to be holding the complete set of all seven Idiot Balls.

&gt; 7) Changes that are required to make the fic artistically complete when seen against the background of Harry Potter fanfiction, such as including at least one completely wrong ship.

**But I haven't read the original books!**

Don't worry. If you watched a couple of the movies, you'll be fine. `This is a rationalist story; its mysteries are solvable, and meant to be solved.`

**Okay, that sounds interesting. Anything I should know before reading?**

- Read the preface to Chapter 1.
- Do *not* skip past Ch.13.
- The internet is dark and full of spoilers. Come back when you've read the whole thing.

[Spoilers through 96],89,11,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1j6koo/does_the_fidelius_charm_exist_in_hpmor_spoilers/,"I'm very confused. My understanding has always been that Eliezer is on the record that the Fidelius Charm is too much of a game-breaker and so has been omitted from the HPMoR universe. I cannot at the moment, however, find a citation for this belief.

From Chapter 29:

&gt; ""Okay, first the background. There's a whole chapter in this book about Sirius Black conspiracy theories. You remember who that is, right?""

&gt; ""Of course,"" said Hermione. Sirius Black was a traitor, a friend of James Potter who'd betrayed the location of Harry's parents to Voldemort.

That was all well and good until Chapter 96:

&gt; Others had remained. Godric's Hollow was older than Hogwarts, older than Godric Gryffindor whose name it had taken, and there were families which would reside here until the end of the world and its magic.

&gt; The Potters had been one such family, and would be again, if the last Potter so chose.

So everyone knows that the Potters lived in Godric's Hollow. They had always lived there and would have continued to always live there and may still yet always live there.

And yet somehow, the common knowledge of Sirius Black is that he betrayed the Potters by telling Voldemort their location. Which was their normal, inherited ancestral home.

I think even the Wizarding world isn't oblivious enough to hold these two blatantly contradictory beliefs at the same time.

I can only conclude that I'm wrong about the Fidelius Charm having been omitted from *Methods*. Or, at least, that there is something *very like* the Fidelius Charm, by which people's location can be magically concealed from everyone except a secret-keeper. But I *really, really* would have sworn that it was common knowledge that Eliezer had scoffed at the Fidelius Charm. Plus, if the Potters were going to have a secret-keeper, why wouldn't it have been Dumbledore?

(In Book 7, Rowling screwed up and made it so one of the people protected by the Fidelius Charm can be the secret keeper; I'm assuming that this rule would be stomped on even if the Fidelius Charm does exist.)

So: Am I just crazy? Long-time *Methods* readers, has Eliezer ever made a statement like the one I could swear he had?",,False,self,t5_2t5xf,1375044963.0,,,True,t3_1j6koo,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1j6koo/does_the_fidelius_charm_exist_in_hpmor_spoilers/,

It starts about halfway through the chapter (Ctrl+F for ""Samuel Hahnemann""):

&gt;And more than that - Samuel Hahnemann had shown that atoms retained properties of other atoms they were exposed to. On the deepest level, all of reality was entangled. That's why you could dilute medicine in water a hundred million times and actually make it stronger - but wizards didn't know that yet.

I'm not sure how accurate that is. Then a few paragraphs later:
&gt;Quantum mechanics - real quantum mechanics - proved that reality only really existed under observation. When you walked through a park, the immersive world that surrounded you was something that existed only as your consciousness collapsed the wave function around you. 

And it goes on like that.

I have a working hypothesis that one of the properties of Parseltongue is that it is a language without the ability to lie, and that Quirrell knows this, and that Quirrell uses it to his advantage vs. Harry. 

Currently, there are two conversations that PQ &amp; HP have in Parseltongue. The first takes place in Mary's Room, 7 days before the Azkaban breakout.


&gt;""We will tesst in sseven dayss. Will not sspeak of planss beyond thiss. You ssay nothing, to no one. Give no ssign of expectancy, none. Undersstand?”

&gt;Harry nodded.

&gt;“Ansswer in sspeech.”

&gt;“Yess.” (816)

What reason would Quirrell have to demand Harry answer in speech, rather than gesture? It's possible that Quirrell takes Harry's nod as a hasty formality, as not signifying agreement. It's also possible that in this moment the act of speech is somehow more weighty than gesture, and that Harry's speech-act constitutes some sort of magical binding.

Note that Quirrell's only stated reasons for speaking in Parselmouth are to confirm that Harry knows it, and to be secretive. But Quirrell has said he's known HP is a Parselmouth since Day 1. And no sensitive matter is discussed, other than planning to meet again in 7 days: encoding this info in parseltongue is not important enough to justify the risk of an observer breaking the scrying protections and learning that Quirrell is an animagus. There must be a third, unspoken reason that Quirrell wishes to communicate in Parseltongue.

The second conversation takes place after the breakout. Harry has just rejected PQ's plan to fake a Harry vs. Voldemort battle.


&gt;For a moment the dark pitted eyes seemed to gleam blackly, for a moment the scaled mouth gaped to expose the fangs. “Think you have learned wrong lessson, boy, from previouss failure. My planss are not in habit of failing, and lasst one would have gone flawlesssly, but for your own foolisshnesss. Correct lessson iss to follow ssteps laid down for you by older and wisser Sslytherin, tame your wild impulssess.”

&gt;“Lessson I learned is not to try plotss that would make girl-child friend think I am evil or boy-child friend think I am sstupid,” Harry snapped back. He’d been planning a more temporizing response than that, but somehow the words had just slipped out. (1066)

""Somehow the words had just slipped out"" is an *incredibly* suspicious phrase. Maybe we can write Harry's impetuousness off as due to post-Azkaban stress, combined with an in-character propensity towards being a smart-ass and saying what's on his mind. But, we see Quirrell acting on this information in the next two arcs, making moves against Hermione (H&amp;C dictionary attack; false-memory charm) and Draco (blood-cooling charm; eventually forced to withdraw from Hogwarts). Master plotter Quirrell would not form his plans so specifically around a single comment of Harry's without a high degree of certainty that Harry's seemingly impetuous statement is in fact truthful. 

If it is impossible to lie in Parseltongue, what we have here is the villain cleverly tricking the hero into revealing his weak points, which really seems like a Quirrellmort sort of plot.

---

I admit that the evidence is not conclusive. I submit, however, that it is certainly *suggestive*, and definitely cause for further attention and discussion.

1366705043.0,58,self.HPMOR,1cxal0,There is a slightly unusual focus on Gregory Goyle,65,7,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1cxal0/there_is_a_slightly_unusual_focus_on_gregory_goyle/,"So I had picked up on this a little while back, and after a recent re-read began taking note of the majority of things that were of interest.

Mainly that Gregory Goyle gets far more attention than Crabbe (not exclusive, but seemingly disproportionate) as well as a couple moments of character development which are of interest. Particularly it shows often Goyle having far more inward inflection and thought about himself, Malfoy, and various things, as well as a bunch of moments of interest that simply focus far more on Goyle over Crabbe. 

Some of these are very mundane, others are slightly more interesting. I tried to ignore the completely mundane (such as Goyle blocking harry Ggoing to Malfoy rather than Crabbe, and there seems to be more moments such as this, although I haven't taken a hard count, just taking a mental note/estimation)

Either way here is a short list of the more interesting moments involving Goyle.

* ""Goyle, Gregory!""....There was a long, tense moment of silence under the Hat. Almost a minute. **Ch.9**
* Goyle finds remebrall and hordes it **ch. 17.**
* Goyle knows combat for fighting with Quirrel in **ch19.**
* Goyle takes initiative and thinks/tells Crabbe they need to alert Malfoy about Hermione's and Harry's kiss **ch46.**
* Goyle is the one who has a possible realization of the changes in Malfoy, **ch. 72**
* Calls Malfoy out on the lack of a plot to protect another **ch77.**
* Cries and breaks down to Malfoy about the changes going on in him, as well as wondering on how Malfoy sr. will respond **ch.77**
* Goyle is the one on the broom stick in the battles, with a lot more focus on him over Crabbe

Some of these, such being a good flier being a nod to him being a beater in the later books. The remembrall though was re-written, with Malfoy originally being the one to take it. The very first note about the sorting hat is very strange, and I wonder why it was done, if it could be hinting at anything in particular.

Also as a minor note, somewhere (later half? I couldn't find it when I just remembered it) it is mentioned that the Crabbe family has been with the Malfoys longer than the Goyle family, although the Goyle family has been just as loyal/useful. Or something to that affect. I don't know if that is relevant or not though.

Anyways, just something to notice about what appears to be a very minor character. Some of this could maybe be disproven with a more thorough count on how often Goyle has a very minor/mundane action over Crabbe, but it is definitely the case that Goyle has more character involvement. That and the sorting hat business is really interesting me.",,False,self,t5_2t5xf,False,,,True,t3_1cxal0,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1cxal0/there_is_a_slightly_unusual_focus_on_gregory_goyle/,

1372989183.0,59,self.HPMOR,1ho1y6,[Spoilers through Ch. 90] Clues to Quirrell's identity in his conversations,61,2,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1ho1y6/spoilers_through_ch_90_clues_to_quirrells/,"There still seem to be some people who aren't convinced that Quirrell is Voldemort. Beyond his overt actions, what really clinches Quirrell's identity as Voldemort is his constant allusions to his own past, which we know from canon (but which many of the characters do not). Since many people miss these on a first reading, the typical response to people skeptical of Q=V is ""reread the fic."" But in an attempt to be more helpful and reduce the number of people who are wrong on the internet, I just did a scan through the story to try to find the ones I remembered.

-----

Chapter 12

Quirrell: 

&gt; ""Believe it or not, I have long wished to someday try my hand as the Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts here at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. ...""

This is a known ambition of Voldemort in canon. Voldemort lays the curse on the Defense position when Dumbledore refuses to hire him for it.

-----

Chapter 19:

Quirrell: 

&gt; ""So while there's no point in asking any of you, it would not surprise me in the slightest if there were a student or two in my classes who harbored ambitions of being the next Dark Lord. After all, *I* wanted to be the next Dark Lord when *I* was a young Slytherin.""

-----

Chapter 19 also contains Quirrell's description of how he learned to lose at a dojo in Asia. He had to submit while his fellow students abused him verbally and physically. Later, that same dojo was destroyed by Voldemort. Quirrell claims that Voldemort came, seeking to learn, but was denied and destroyed the dojo in anger, murdering the Master. Supposedly this demonstrates a weakness of Voldemort: he does not know how to lose.

Two strong pieces of evidence give a different interpretation to Voldemort's attack on the dojo:

One: Chapter 49: 

&gt; ""Rule Twelve,"" Professor Quirrell said quietly. ""Never leave the source of your power lying around where someone else can find it.""

Two: Later in Chapter 19, before he teaches Harry to lose, Quirrell discusses how a Dark Lord loses:

&gt; ""... do any of you wish to show your dominance over the Boy-Who-Lived? Shove him around, push him to the ground, hear him beg for your mercy?""

&gt; Five hands went up.

&gt; ""Everyone with your hand raised, you are an absolute idiot. What part of pretending to lose did you not understand? If Harry Potter does become the next Dark Lord he will hunt you down and kill you after he graduates.""

Thus it seems that Quirrell returned later to the dojo as Voldemort, both to avenge his humiliation and to deny others access to one source of his power.

-----

Chapter 20:

&gt;""Other people have done huge amounts for me!"" Harry said. ""My parents took me in when my parents died because they were good people, and to become a Dark Lord is to betray that!""

&gt;Professor Quirrell was silent for a time.

&gt;""I confess,"" said Professor Quirrell quietly, ""when I was your age, that thought could not ever have come to me.""

In canon, Voldemort's father left Voldemort's pregnant mother, who then died in childbirth. Voldemort was raised in an orphanage.

-----

Chapter 20:

&gt; ""Precisely,"" said Professor Quirrell. He was grinning. ""So I am going to violate rule two - which was simply 'don't brag' - and tell you about something I have done. I don't see how the knowledge could do any harm. And **I strongly suspect you would have figured it out anyway, once we knew each other well enough.** 

&gt; [...]

&gt; ...when I discovered that Pioneer 11 would also be leaving the Solar System forever,"" Professor Quirrell said, his grin the widest that Harry had yet seen from him, ""I snuck into NASA, I did, and I cast a lovely little spell on that lovely golden plaque which will make it last a lot longer than it otherwise would.""

&gt; [...]

&gt; A further thought occurred to Harry. ""You didn't add any extra information to the plaque, did you?""

&gt; ""Extra information?"" said Professor Quirrell, sounding as if the idea had never occurred to him before and he was quite intrigued.

&gt; Which made Harry **rather suspicious**, considering that it'd taken less than a minute for Harry to think of it.

&gt; [...] maybe you could've turned an existing part into a portrait of yourself? Or you found a volunteer dying of a terminal illness, snuck them into NASA, and cast a spell to make sure their ghost ended up in the plaque -""

&gt; ""Mr. Potter,"" Professor Quirrell said, his voice suddenly sharp, ""**a spell requiring a human death** would certainly be classified by the Ministry as Dark Arts, regardless of circumstances. Students should not be heard talking about such things.""

[emphasis mine]

Quirrell turned the Pioneer Plaque into a horcrux. While this does not necessarily mean that he is Voldemort, it sure sounds exactly like Voldemort's style. Quirrell expects that eventually Harry will know of his Voldemort backstory. 

-----

Chapter 40:

&gt; ""Anyway,"" Harry said hastily, ""I did think fast enough not to suggest the obvious idea about the Resurrection Stone in front of Dumbledore. Have you ever seen a stone with a line, inside a circle, inside a triangle?""

&gt; The deathly chill seemed to draw back, fold into itself, as the ordinary Professor Quirrell returned. ""Not that I can recall,"" Professor Quirrell said after a while, a thoughtful frown on his face. ""That is the Resurrection Stone?""

&gt; [3 paragraphs later]

&gt; ""By the way, Mr. Potter, I fear we shall have to cut short today's visit to Diagon Alley. I was hoping it would - but never mind. Let it stand that there is something else I must do this afternoon.""

Quirrell did not know what the Resurrection Stone looked like before Harry told him (right after Quirrell warned him against inadvisably giving up important information for free!). In canon, the Resurrection Stone is set in the ring of one of Voldemort's relatives, and Voldemort takes it (ignorant of what it is) after meeting and murdering that relative. It seems that Quirrell recognized the Stone from Harry's description and cut short their visit to Diagon Alley to go and retrieve it and probably try it out. 

This is foreshadowed in Chapter 26:

&gt; Professor Quirrell's expression became more serious. ""Mr. Potter, one of the requisites for becoming a powerful wizard is an excellent memory. The key to a puzzle is often something you read twenty years ago in an old scroll, or a peculiar ring you saw on the finger of a man you met only once.

Much later, in Chapter 90, Quirrell brings up the Resurrection Stone again:

Harry:
&gt; ""I mean to bring Hermione back. Because there isn't an afterlife, and I'm not about to just let her - just not be -""

&gt; [...]

&gt; ""How?"" [Quirrell] said finally.

&gt; ""However I have to.""

&gt; [...]

&gt; ""What of the Resurrection Stone of Cadmus Peverell, if it could be obtained for you?""

""Obtaining"" it would be easy, of course, since Quirrell already has it.

-----

Chapter 46:

Quirrell:
&gt; ""Tell me, Mr. Potter, if you wanted to lose something where no one would ever find it again, where would you put it?""

&gt; Harry considered this question. ""I suppose I shouldn't ask *what* you've found that needs losing -""

&gt; ""Quite,"" said Professor Quirrell, as Harry had expected; and then, ""Perhaps you will be told when you are older,"" which Harry hadn't.

An allusion to Voldemort's horcrux(es?). Again we see that Quirrell expects Harry to eventually learn that he is Voldemort.

Amusingly, one of the hiding places Harry suggests is to launch the object out of the solar system. Quirrell has already done this with the Pioneer Plaque.

-----

Chapter 49:

After a vivid description of what Quirrell ""thinks"" is in the Chamber of Secrets:

&gt; ""One might even regret your infant self's victory,"" said Professor Quirrell. His smile twisted. ""If only You-Know-Who had lived, you might have persuaded him to teach you some of the knowledge that would have been your heritage, from one Heir of Slytherin to another."" The smile twisted further, as though to mock the obvious impossibility, even given the premise.

Quirrell is amused by his own joke, since he is You-Know-Who and also Harry's teacher.

-----

Chapter 49:

Quirrell has turned into a snake and begun speaking in Parseltongue:

&gt; ""*This iss mosst ssecure way to sspeak. You ssee? No otherss undersstand uss.*""

&gt; ""*Even if they are ssnake Animagi?*""

&gt; ""*Not unlesss heir of Sslytherin willss.*"" The snake gave a series of short hisses which Harry's brain translated as sardonic laughter. ""*Sslytherin not sstupid. Ssnake Animaguss not ssame as Parsselmouth. Would be huge flaw in sscheme.*""

Quirrell implies that he can only understand Parseltongue because Harry wills it. But note that Quirrell only says ""heir of Slytherin,"" which could mean himself as much as Harry. Presumably he can understand Parseltongue because he is an heir of Slytherin, and Harry would not actually be able to talk to other snake Animagi in Parseltongue. There is a credible theory that it is impossible to lie in Parseltongue, which would explain why Quirrell has to be literally truthful.

-----

Chapter 49:

Quirrell:
&gt; ""You really care about that girl.""

&gt; ""Yes,"" Harry said quietly.

&gt; [...]

&gt; ""I did not have any friends like that when I was young."" Still the same emotionless voice. ""What would have become of you, I wonder, if you had been alone?""

*Voldemort*, Quirrell imagines.

-----

Chapter 60:

Quirrell:

&gt; ""Call it a whim, Mr. Potter. It has sometimes amused me to play the part of a hero. Who knows but that You-Know-Who would say the same.""

A little joke of Quirrell's, since he *is* You-Know-Who.

-----

Chapter 70:

Quirrell:

&gt; A cold chuckle. ""I suspect it happens more often than any dare suggest, in the proudest pureblood families. Some lonely witch spies a handsome Muggle; and thinks how very easy it would be, to slip the man a love potion, and by him be adored alone and utterly. And since she knows he can offer her no resistance, why, it is only natural for her to take from him whatever she pleases -""

Possible opposing arguments:

1370378260.0,54,self.HPMOR,1fobl8,"Hermione may have very well ""pulled the trigger"" on Draco",61,7,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1fobl8/hermione_may_have_very_well_pulled_the_trigger_on/,"It seems almost everyone is convinced that Hermione has been framed. I think she may have been ""set up"", but it seems entirely plausible to me that she did intentionally try to murder Draco.

I'm always shocked and infuriated by heroes in stories who throw their loved ones into the maws of psychopaths and murders because they can't be bothered with a quick consequentialist calculus. I've read multiple books where a hero is holding a gun and watches a villain calmly walk away after that villain has promised to murder/rape/torture his lover/child/family, AND has already demonstrated a willingness and ability to do so! Often times in situations where there would likely be NO repercussions is he simply shot the bastard (in the most recent case, in the middle of a low-level civil war occurring in the city!) This is the height of stupidity, IMHO.

I also figured Hermione wouldn't have ever tried to kill anyone. This was before I read Chapter 87. Specifically:
&gt; ""- the sort of things Malfoy has been saying about me? What he said he'd do to me, as soon as he got the chance? ... It's unspeakable in the completely literal sense that I can't say it out loud!""

and

&gt;the second time I met him, he talked about doing it to a ten-year-old girl

Recall for a moment the violent physical reaction you (probably) had the first time you read Chapter 7. Now imagine that YOU are the target of Draco's rape-threats, *and* that you are an 11-year-old girl. If you're as smart as Hermione you've probably also come to the same conclusions Harry did in Chap 7 - Draco is politically untouchable. He can rape you, and you cannot stop him or get justice for it in any way. The only thing you can do is hope that he *doesn't want to*.

Now imagine you've been mind-hacked by Mr Hat-and-Cloak, and you believe that not only does Draco intend to rape you, possibly repeatedly, but he has the backing of a major Authority Figure at Hogwarts - Professor Snape. They can overcome you with magic, maybe just physically hold you down, and do whatever they want. Practically whenever they want, you've gotten to the point where you jump at shadows even in the middle of a televised event in a large public park surrounded by friends.
&gt; Even now, when all the Sunshine General's focus should've been on the coming battle, the Ravenclaw girl's gaze was constantly darting in all directions, as though she expected Dark Wizards to jump out of the bushes and sacrifice her.

She probably falls asleep terrified every night. It's likely she's thought of all sorts of ways to stop Draco, including murder, but there's never a way to execute any of them. No one listens to a little girl, certainly not a mud-blood with no family accusing a noble of intent-to-rape.

Out of the blue an opportunity falls in your lap - Draco wants to meet. But he wants to meet in secret, in a place no one will see or hear anything, in a place she can put her blood-cooling plan into action. Maybe she's not sure she'll do it. Maybe she just goes to duel with him, to show him again that she is NOT powerless and he can NOT simply abuse her. But then she loses the duel, and he's standing over her triumphant and grinning down at her, and she realizes that she has no recourse at all, she can't even defend herself in a fair one-to-one fight, he could rape her right now if he wanted to. So he turns and leaves and Hermione does the SMART thing that every dumb-ass hero never did. She picks up her wand and she shoots him in the back and she escapes unseen. She will no longer live with that threat over her head. Draco will never threaten any girl at all that way - she's rid the world of a vile man who does evil, and the world is better off for it.

It's entirely possible Hermione would've confessed after the fact anyway, because she's a good person. But that doesn't matter, because the Puppet Master (possibly Quirrell) erases the instigating belief of imminent-rape-assisted-by-Snape from her mind, clears up some other odds and ends, and arranges it that Quirrell finds Draco's body just in the nick of time. This is *much* cleaner than Harry's proposed situation of tons of Memory Charms on both Hermione and Draco and then Obviations afterwards to remove evidence. It requires less access to Hermione and no access at all to Draco. If some time-turned individual *did* manage to observe or avert the duel, he'd see these events rather than the Puppet Master working intricate Memory Charms on two subdued students. It is elegant and... ""delicious"", in a sense.

The Puppet Master would still be primarily to blame, and a case could be made for self-defense.

I've come up with the following:

1.  Check to see the strength of a spell around the globe.  Is there an area where magic is especially powerful?  That could indicate the location of the magical central computer.
2.  Run an extremely energy intensive spell and see if that affects a second spell in the vicinity.  E.g. use a potion to get extremely high level energy reaction - does that indicate a dip in the magical field in the area?
3.  Is the momentum or kinetic energy of a transfigured object preserved after the transfiguration is complete?  E.g. if Harry transfigures his large rock into a tiny pebble, throws it, and releases the transfiguration in flight - will the large rock with its much larger mass keep flying at the same velocity?  Or will it come to a virtual stop because the total amount of kinetic energy is the same?
4.  What exactly determines which energy is used when a potion is created, and how far back in time the system goes?  For example, if you use a gold coin in a potion, you extract the energy that went into making it.  But why don't you get access to the energy of the star that combined the protons and neutrons into gold atoms that make up the coin?  Is it a question of a stirring pattern or what?
5.  Is all of the mass of an object that was transfigured returned after it is transfigured back?  Or is some of it used up to power the reaction?
6.  We know that the state of the ""form"" during transfiguration is preserved - if you transfigure something into glass and then break it, then the original object will also be broken.  What happens if the intermediate object is modified without breaking it?  For example, if you transform a crystal vase into a aluminium spoon, bend the spoon, and then transform it back - what happens to the vase?
7.  How exactly does technology stop working around magic?  Is it EM interference of some sort?  Are components becoming magnetized?  What if you introduce a strong magnetic field to a spell - will the effect go in the other direction?

If this has been proposed or written about elsewhere, please point me towards the discussion regarding it. 


I have a theory about how Harry can save/revive Hermione. At the core of this theory is a means through which Harry may time-turn more than six hours. It also explains some (not necessarily all!) of the suspicious obliviations and false memory charms which we have seen in the story. It also offers a possible explanation of why Quirrel pointed Harry in the direction of learning obliviation instead of researching spell creation. 


The rest of this post is contingent upon questioning the following idea: we currently believe individuals carrying information cannot travel more than six hours into the past. In the HPMOR-verse, this has been presented as a hard fact upon several occasions. Most importantly and notably when a time-turned Amelia Bones asked Dumbledore if he wished to know information from some amount of time into the future. This is the moment where we learned that not only is an individual incapable of time-turning six hours backwards but also that information cannot fundamentally be time-turned back more than six hours through any combination of individuals. (This brought up a meta discussion of what exactly constitutes information)


So here is the crux of my theory: what if the fundamental limiting step of six-hours of information time-turning may be circumvented by obliviation? Depending upon the depth and scope of the oblivation, the individual is no longer carrying information from the future at all. That individual would - with respect to time - be the same as the non-time-turned version of themselves which resides elsewhere. So you would be unable to send information further back than six hours, but you would have two of the same physical individual with which to act.

For dealing with this situation, I have always recommended a good pair of running shoes.”

Also the popular theory appears to be that magic was created/discovered by the ancient Atlanteans, whoever they were, but they managed to erase themselves from time along with knowledge of the SoM.

However, this seems to contradict The Rules so far as EY has let us know them, and he goes to great lengths to illustrate them with The Game in chapters 13-14.
&gt;""Oh, you can't change time!"" Professor McGonagall interrupted. ""Good heavens, Mr. Potter, do you think these would be allowed students if that was possible? What if someone tried to change their test scores?""

&gt;Harry: ""--what you're saying is that reality somehow self-consistently computes in one sweep using information that hasn't... happened... yet...""

RULE NUMBER ONE: The past cannot be changed (but can be visited).

RULE NUMBER TWO: Every effect has a cause.

RULE NUMBER THREE: Effects may BE causes.

But if these three rules are, as they appear to be, Laws of Time, then how could Atlantis have been ""erased from time?"" A past effect can have a future cause, but an effect cannot have NO cause; you cannot pull the bottom blocks out of Time's Jenga Tower without wrecking the whole thing, and a hypothetical civilization that rose, developed magic, and then erased itself from time seems to violate The Rules. And just try explaining how the Atlanteans managed to erase themselves while leaving descendants and the SoM behind.

There is, however, another possibility: the God Machine that is the Source of Magic may in fact not have been built yet. Unlike the Three Rules of Time, the 6-hour limit for Time Turner travel seems more like a technological limit, or one of those conceptual limits Harry likes to sneer at.

So, hypothesis: Harry's life is The Game writ large. He dedicates his life to hacking the sourcecode of the SoM to achieve godhood, and realizes that the SoM hasn't been built yet. Once it exists, it is temporally omnipresent, but he has to create it in the same way that he created The Game while participating in it. It exists, so he, or his heirs, make it.

Atlantis wasn't written out of Time; it hasn't happened yet and is the new world eventually created by Harry. After all, an ending is always the beginning of something else and
&gt;""He will end the world.""

Of course this is pointless speculation; it is doubtful that Harry is going to discover the SoM in the course of the story, and he shouldn't. Reviving Hermione will be quite enough and doesn't require hacking the Sourcecode of Magic; leave the poor boy something to accomplish in his adult life.

Phoenixes are extremely useful. Their tears have strong curative powers; their teleportation ability seems nigh-unblockable; they have a built-in good alignment _and_ apparent morality detector; they are extremely loyal; they're apparently immortal (which could be _extremely useful_ for research if your long-term goal was universal immortality); they seem to provide strong emotional support in times of distress...and the list goes on.

Oh, and you only have one chance to get one, which usually involves undertaking a spur-of-the-moment suicide mission, which you aren't even told until after the trial.

That's an obviously-broken system if ever there was one. Why _shouldn't_ Harry try to circumvent the ""rules"" here, and try to acquire a phoenix anyway?

Let's examine the evidence we have on phoenix acquisition mechanics:

* According to Dumbledore, a phoenix will present itself a maximum of once in any given lifetime
* According to Dumbledore, this presentation will occur when a hero is contemplating undertaking an incredibly dangerous , but virtuous, task
* According to Dumbledore, the phoenix will not present itself if the hero knows about the above mechnics ahead of time
* According to Dumbledore, only 3 other students have had phoenixes present themselves
* No other current wizards besides Dumbledore, that we know of, have a phoenix (?)
* There are no organized attempts by anyone else to acquire phoenixes despite their very useful abilities (again, that we know of)

Let's assume that Dumbledore's explanation of phoenix acquisition mechanics is correct as far as wizards know (though Harry should research this question to confirm anyway). Immediate questions:

* How is the decision to send a phoenix made?
* Is there a collective phoenix conscience? A phoenix master? Is phoenix distribution directly controlled by the same force that implements magic?
* How does the phoenix collective keep track of heroic decisions, who has already rejected a phoenix, etc?
* Alternate hypothesis: Phoenix opportunities are very rare, but not necessarily maxed to one/person - it's just that their rarity makes double chances _extremely_ unlikely, like winning the lottery twice?
* Related to all of the above: What exactly constitutes a decision worthy of a phoenix invite? What heroic efforts and ideas are not rewarded by a phoenix invite? Is the phoenix invite process deterministic, or do certain decisions just generate a _chance_ of getting a phoenix invite?
* What happens to a phoenix after its owner dies?
* Are there any wild phoenixes? How do they behave?

Possible means for Harry to acquire a phoenix subject to above answers:

* Die and come back (in a manner that resets the ""has rejected phoenix offer"" variable)
* Acquire Fawkes after Dumbledore dies
* Just keep making heroic decisions (assuming the one-phoenix/life rule is not an actual rule)
* Make phoenixes smarter/behave differently
* Get access to whatever controls Phoenix distribution
* Occlumency (to appear to be someone who has neer rejected a phoenix - how are phoenixes reading his brain-state anyway?)

The Headmaster can feel when a student dies in Hogwarts. That's how he showed up the moment Hermione died.

But the Headmaster can also feel when a creature unknown to Hogwarts is in Hogwarts. That's how he showed up when Harry rejected his phoenix.

But so why didn't Dumbledore feel the troll and intercept it much sooner? I expect before long the Dumbledore-haters — both those in the story and those on Less Wrong and Reddit — will latch on to this as proof that Dumbledore has been evil all along.

The problem is, we know a thing or two about Hogwarts's wards by now. We know, for instance, that Salazar Slytherin was the one who wove them:

&gt; or by some entity which Salazar Slytherin keyed into his wards at a higher level than the Headmaster himself.

Salazar Slytherin's wards. Salazar Slytherin, who left a basilisk that knew all his secrets. Secrets that Quirrellmort now knows.

Dumbledore will try to tell the wizarding world that the only explanation of Hermione's death is that Voldemort was behind the attack. This will be seen by the world as the same thing Headmaster Dippet actually did when Myrtle died: the accusation of an unlikely — ""preposterous!"" — scapegoat.

And now, Lucius Malfoy is there to stir up the opposition:

&gt; Lucius Malfoy controls Minister Fudge, through the Daily Prophet he sways all Britain, only by bare margins does he not control enough of the Board of Governors to oust me from Hogwarts.

Those bare margins are about to be erased. For the first time in fifty years, a student has died in Hogwarts, and there is reason to suspect Dumbledore of involvement. Dumbledore is not going to be Headmaster for very much longer.

And the Philosopher's Stone is there, in Hogwarts, in the place, until now, of Dumbledore's own power.

1. Turning into a cat violates Conservation of Energy [because of E=mc^2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence): a 60kg woman turning into a 5kg cat would free up about 5 exajoules of mass-energy, and we don't see it being transferred anywhere.

Harry whispered. It should have been funny, but it wasn't. The name burned with a cold feeling, ruthlessness, diamond clarity, a hammer of pure titanium descending upon an anvil of yielding flesh. A chill swept over Harry even as he pronounced the word, and he resolved then and there to use safer terms like You-Know-Who.

The first time I read this I was confused that Harry wouldn't use Voldemort's real name, unlike in canon.  I brushed it off because it wasn't enough of an oddity given what I knew at the time, but now it just seems really weird to me, and his reaction to it raises serious alarm bells.  Just saying that name produced the strongest negative reaction he'd displayed so far, and a fear reaction that seems way out of proportion to what I consider normal for him, to the point where I feel I have to explain it.

The only other time I can even think of that he acted superstitious was, arguably, when he refused to come out of his trunk until the first week was through as if things would stop once the calendar moved into the new week.  But he'd had a really long week and I can understand just wanting an excuse, even a ridiculous one, to just hide for a little while.  I can't understand him still saying 'You-Know-Who' when he actually believes he's dead for good, but at the same time it doesn't seem to indicate much.

There's no evidence besides this feeling to suggest such a thing, so I'm actually looking for other alternatives, but if there were a [Taboo](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Taboo) curse on Voldemort's name as was suggested by some to have happened in canon, do you think that would count as an interaction between Harry and Voldemort's magic enough to give Harry a sense of doom whenever he says the word?

[Voldemort's Motivation? [Sp. up through 94]](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hvymk/voldemorts_motivation_sp_up_through_94/cayjwqs). Here is his theory:

&gt; [Summary] 
&gt; 
&gt; Riddle misread the prophecy in arrogance, he isn't Harry's opponent Death is.
&gt;
&gt; [Prophecy condition 1] 
&gt;
&gt; Born to those that thrice defied him: The Percivel brothers creating the Deathly Hallows.
&gt; 
&gt; [Prophecy condition 2] 
&gt; Power that he knows not: rationality, death is not a rational being, like rain he falls on the just and the unjust. Or like smallpox, he won't fight back.
&gt; 
&gt; But a remnant is left as an exercise for the student, but is answered in the Bank's novel Surface Detail if Harry wins, and Chaos Legion if Harry loses.

A few posts down /u/Brotep notes that it fits the second prophecy very well too: 
&gt; The second prophecy--he is coming/he is here--the one who will tear apart the very stars in heaven, etc. then must refer to death! Of course death was there when Hermione died!

The rest of the 2nd prophecy fits too. Death (entropy) will tear apart the stars in heaven. Death is the end of the world. 

Overall, I think this suits the story really well, explains a lot of foreshadowed details, and ties humanism and the dementors into the central conflict of the story. 

In Bayesian terms, I think the story thru ch94 is significantly more representative of a story in which Death is the central enemy than a story in which LV is the central enemy. Because LV is central in cannon, his major role in the plot is representative of stories in which Death is the main antagonist. But, the dementors could have easily been left out; arcs like humanism are far more likely in the story if death is the main antagonist. Likewise the unlikely match between the 2nd prophecy and Death. So, these arcs are significantly more likely in a HPMOR with death as the central conflict. 

I think that it's reasonable to take a posteriori confidence level of &gt;~80-90% that Death is the central antagonist. Here is my reasoning
&gt; P(S) = a priori probability of seeing this particular story (out of possible stories)
&gt; P(V) = a priori probability that Voldemort is the central antagonist
&gt; P(D) = a priori probability that Death is the central antagonist
&gt; P(D|S) = conditional probability that Death is the central antagonist given the evidence of the story seen so far
Assuming:
&gt; P(S|D) / P(S|V) (the likelihood ratio) = 50
&gt; P(V) = 70%
&gt; P(D) = 10%
Then:
&gt; P(V|S) ~ 12%
&gt; P(D|S) ~ 87%

1375881750.0,45,self.HPMOR,1jvqll,Marauder's map errors + troll's origin theory [spoilers ch 25-94],51,6,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1jvqll/marauders_map_errors_trolls_origin_theory/,"In chapter 25 we were presented with the mysterious errors of the Marauder's map (see ""Act 5"" of this chapter). Well it was mysterious in the eyes of the twins, unknowing of the Time Turners.

Still, problem solved? I think not, there's a twist. The exact wording of George describing the 2 errors was:
&gt; ""Intermittent one fixed itself again. Other one's same as ever""

Was does that mean? There's an intermittent error and an other one. Which is to say a permanent one.

The intermittent one is consistent with the usage of a time-turner. It's probably Harry it concerns: the twins would pay more attention to him than others and he uses it as much as he can everyday. Other lesser candidates would be Dumbledore, we know he has one too (~~but probably does not use it as outrageously as Harry~~ wrong according to McGonagall in ch. 65) and Margaret Bulstrode, as her possession of one is revealed in the aftermath of TSPE (then again, she does not use it as much as Harry, and is probably less of an interest to the twins. She may even have gotten hers later than ch. 25).

So what's the permanent error on the map? I think it's fair to assume it's of the same nature as the intermittent, likely the same person showing up at 2 different places. You wouldn't notice someone not showing up at all unless standing next to him, nor would blame (exclusively) the map if some area stayed blank or inscrutable.

What we also learn in chapter 25 is the map is part of Hogwarts security system. Ie: the wards. What else did we learn about the wards, in chapter 94? They detected the Defense professor killing Hermione. Hint: we know it was really a troll which did it, the professor was burning through walls at the time.

Imagine the professor had a troll, registered to Hogwarts as himself, put in a stasis cell at the bottom of his desk. Then the permanent error would be the Defense professor and its troll showing up with the same label on the map.

All of this is consistent with and reinforce the theory that Quirrell slipped a troll through the wards of Hogwarts by registering it along himself (see chap. 84, end of discussion between Bones and Quirrell).

But there's more! What happens to the Marauder's map and the twins in chapter 88? The former is presumably stolen and the latter are obliviated. About everything concerning the map. It matters very much to a certain professor who would not want others to discover that the permanent error about him fixed itself once a troll was killed. And that this error appeared since, let me guess, the beginning of the year?

So it looks more like the Defense professor erasing all traces than just him preventing Harry and/or the twins from saving Hermione.

It did not seem to me all these elements had been previously linked together, sorry if I missed an earlier post explaining the same theory.

Also for the sake of completeness, some counter arguments I came with but rejected:

* The errors on the map are not about duplicate people. Then I don't see what to do with the information that there are errors on the map. It might be relevant later but the ward tampering problem is now (ch. 88-94), not later.

* Quirrell did not consciously slipped the troll through the wards, someone else tricked him into doing him. Hm. Really. Someone tricked Quirrell... Huge complexity penalty for this hypothesis.

* The troll was not slipped along Quirrell and Quirrell/some other bad guy really took control of the wards. For instance using the secret knowledge of Slytherin transmitted by his basilisk. The map problems are unrelated. Possible, but brute forcing things is not in character with 'the enemy'. And like the first counter argument, we're left with mysterious map errors which currently fit well the puzzle.

Bonus: crazy theory on how to get a troll into Hogwarts! Step by step:

* 1 - Go on an diet to stabilize your stomach acidity to a precise pH level.

* 2 - Hunt a troll!

* 3 - Eat a spoonful of his brain, yum yum! Burn the rest.

* 4 - Hurry to meet Dumbledore and be introduced to Hogwarts, while your stomach acid exactly balances the regeneration of the troll.

* 5 - Resist being offered a cup of Chianti as a complimentary toast for your new position, as the consequences could be... adverse.

* 6 - Reach your office, spit it up, store it safe, savor it later.",,False,self,t5_2t5xf,1375980371.0,,chaos,True,t3_1jvqll,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1jvqll/marauders_map_errors_trolls_origin_theory/,

Then Harry shook his head, dismissing the gloomy line his reasoning had been going down. The question was whether there was a significant probability of facing anything so terrible as a Dark Rationalist in the first place.""

Eventually there will be, if Harry succeeds.

Muggles currently have only a few methods for immediately destroying most of the humankind in order to slave the rest (namely, nukes and perhaps some biological weapons), and you’d need a great arsenal in order to pull it off. That’s why it’s possible to prevent such a fate by seriously limiting the availability of such technologies. Also, living in a closed system like our planet, it would be difficult for the supercriminal to escape the effects him/herself. However, if we live in a magical world where all you need for accomplishing such a feat is being smart enough and understanding the scientific method… Voldie might not be the feared Dark Rationalist, but if Harry manages to introduce science to the magical community, the probability of one being born approaches 1 with every passing second, and fast.

I bet there are no spacefaring magical species, because they all annihilate themselves shortly after their Magical-Scientific Revolution. Magical cosmic apocalypses must end the existence of whole universes with magical sentients in them – either through endemic evolution or alien wizards crossing over from parallel universes. Perhaps some day in the future (pardon the temporally naïve expression) a Dark Super-Rationalist manages to wipe out the whole Multiverse including all the alternate timelines, and nothing really existed, ever. If Harry knew that, I bet he’d have trouble sleeping at night.

The only way I can think of suppressing the possibility of a victorious Dark Rationalist is setting up a thought-controlling Magical Big Brother system, which would totally make Orwell an optimist. And if the only way to defeat Evil is to become Evil, there is no future for Good. If there's a future, or even a present or a past, for the multiverse at all...

I hereby wish to suggest a more jocular interpretation of the Diadem, for inclusion in the story ;-).

It increases your *wisdom*, not your intelligence at all.  At some point, Harry puts it on, expecting to enhance his intelligence and become the Greatest Ravenclaw Ever.  Instead, it pours into his mind all the reasons (I'm too lazy to link the appropriate LessWrong post) why intelligence enhancement without keeping the mind as a whole in-balance, especially in the case of a dangerously unbalanced individual like Harry, is a *horrendous* idea.

In fact, it starts explaining to Harry why most of his ""action hero"" and ""wannabe God"" courses of action are terrible ideas.  It explains that his ignorance of advanced magical lore doesn't mean wizards are stupid and there isn't any.  It explains why he really ought to be listening much more closely to the adults and scarfing down books of advanced magical lore by the dozen before he gets himself killed trying something too big for him.

How would Harry be able to accomplish that with what we know about how magic works and what would be his motivation? A hint comes from when Harry overheard a discussion of the first iteration of that prophecy in the 21st chapter:
&gt;""Not to mention, tear apart the very what? ""

&gt;""I thought I heard Trelawney start to say something with an 'S' just before the Headmaster grabbed her.""

&gt;""Like... soul? Sun?""
&gt;
""If someone's going to tear apart the Sun we're really in trouble!""

&gt;That seemed rather unlikely to Harry, unless the world contained scary things which had heard of David Criswell's ideas about star lifting.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_lifting

Star lifting requires quite a lot of technical know-how and capability for a Type II civilization to accomplish, but for the physics-breaking capabilities of magic, it might only need a play on words to accomplish it and Harry's discovery of Magic's law of conservation to give him a reason. 

Chapter 78 took a few words to explain that ""A potion spends that which is invested in the creation of its ingredients."" For the most part, this meant the creation of its *magical* ingredients. But Harry found an exception. The Sun, apparently, is considered ""magical"" by Atlantis/the magic source code/whatever. Therefore its magical energy may be able to be tapped directly to power Harry's magic as he sees fit. Sort of like getting electricity through PV panels vs. oil or coal power plants. 

The limb that I would like to step out on is that all magic stems from that big ball of fire in the sky. As Harry put it in that chapter:

&gt;A light bulb was fueled by electricity, fueled by a nuclear power plant, fueled by a supernova... You could play the game all the way back to the Big Bang. 

Except that this game is played back to the Sun. If Harry gets another *eureka* moment that makes that connection, then the world definitely does contain a scary thing that has heard of David Criswell's ideas. 

How then would Harry tap directly into this infinite source of magical energy; a fusion nuclear reactor vs. those PV panels, so to speak? He would take a bit of the sun directly from its heart to power his magical innovations. The best way to do that is to create a portal directly to that point so that one would not need to travel there and get burnt to a crisp. 

Luckily, the Floo Network would work perfectly as a portal. It is connected through mundane fireplaces and the Sun happens to be The Fire Place (hence, the play on words). According to canon, you could ""add a fireplace to the Network"" without physically going there. Create a very small fireplace designed to contain a bit of ~1.57×10^7 K plasma, add it and ""the Sun"" or ""Betelgeuse"" to the Network, and now you're cooking with Crisco! Or point that fireplace at Azkaban and we won't need to figure out what would happen if you threw a dementor into the Sun, he'd just bring the Sun to the dementors!

1. Baby Harry's nascent personality (hah!) merged with the incoming Voldemort personality. The result is the Harry we see today.

2. Incoming Voldemort personality completely wiped Baby Harry's nascent personality. The Harry we see today is what Voldemort would've been if he'd been brought up by loving parents. And Science.

3. Incoming Voldemort personality and Baby Harry's nascent personality vie for control at night. This is the cause for Harry's sleep disorder, just like Quirrell's occasional zombie mode is because he's got Voldemort in his head.

Let's start with two givens, based primarily on story structure (as acknowledged by Harry and Dumbledore).

1- Voldemort is still alive/active, whether or not we have met him in disguise.

2- Voldemort is, if not a true dark rationalist, at least clever enough to challenge MOR!Harry. 


Now, from those, it's the second that interests me. Harry asked Dumbledore about Voldemort's motivation, and there was no mention of blood purity, even as a possibility or factor, despite that prejudice being a cornerstone of canon Voldemort's agenda. It united the Death Eaters, but there's no suggestion that Voldemort truly believed in it. EY, then, seems to be preparing his dark lord to represent some other motive for conquest (world *optimization*, perhaps). 

Now, let's consider, as Harry did, a clever/rational dark lord. Governmental overthrow via the Death Eaters is obviously an untenable plan. Even without considering the actions of the rest of the wizarding world, or the muggles, 50 Death Eaters could not hope to rule all of Magical Britain. So why would a clever Voldemort waste his time with revolution?

We return to point 1. Voldemort knew he would survive his death through his horcruxes. He knew he would be able to return in a new body, with a new face. 

And that's when I thought of Quirrell's end-of-semester speech. He wants to unite all of Magical Britain under Harry's banner, and he's been grooming Harry for a very particular type of leadership, through the armies, his mentorship, and the Azkaban incident.

Conclusion: Either disguised as the defense professor, or behind him in some capacity, Voldemort is in the process of enacting phase two of his original long-term plan for conquest. He created a monster to terrify and destabilize the wizarding world, and now that it lurks in the shadows, and everyone braces for a second war, he intends to become the true power behind the next ruler (dictator?) of the nation. Like the first million, the first country is the hardest to acquire. After that, however, he would have a significant amount of power and freedom.

From chapter 38:

&gt;""You don't look half that,"" the vendor said amiably.

65 is a very specific number. 

According to the Quibbler, Harry is 65. Harry, having started at Hogwarts at 11, would graduate in 7 years, or at the age 18. Harry is currently 11.

If Harry has already lived three 'full hogwarts-lives', he would have lived 18 years three times, plus the 11 years of this current timeline.

Would EY have just mentioned this randomly? It does serve to illustrate that Harry scrutinizes the prophecy very very carefully, yes, but does it serve another purpose? If Harry had lived three timelines before this one, that would give his parents exactly three chances to defy him, assuming once per timeline.

Chapter 38, again:

&gt;""And I'm betrothed to Hermione Granger, and Bellatrix Black, and Luna Lovegood, and oh yes, Draco Malfoy too...""

Longest shot as far as meaningful evidence goes, but what if each betrothal represented one timeline? In one timeline, Harry was betrothed to Black, and in the next Lovegood, and then Malfoy, and then I guess in this timeline Granger?

1360387421.0,32,self.HPMOR,186gn7,What were we supposed to figure out from Chapters 1–3? [Spoilers for everything],37,5,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/186gn7/what_were_we_supposed_to_figure_out_from_chapters/,"(This is an expanded response to [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/17vs8n/right_at_the_beginning/).)

Eliezer is on record as saying that he thought people would guess the entire plot to the book after the third chapter, and possibly after the first. My initial thought was that it's clearly impossible for those chapters to contain enough foreshadowing for the whole book. But I eventually realized that ""the entire plot"" of a book doesn't have to contain lots of detail; it can just be a rough outline. So let's assemble the best rough outline we can from Chapters 1–3.

The thread I mentioned above deals with this bit:

&gt; ""And Lily would tell me no, and make up the most ridiculous excuses, like the world would end if she were nice to her sister, or a centaur told her not to

…And by my current reckoning that's probably 80% of what Eliezer was talking about. Let's add to that the following facts from the first three chapters *and* the permanent section of the Author's Notes:

- Petunia forgave Lily and raised Harry in a loving home, and therefore Harry is a creative genius and a scientific polymath.
- McGonagall's two-second demonstration of Animagus powers makes a complete mockery of the whole of known physics; magic has potential far, far greater than *anything* science has done so far — and science gave us nuclear weapons.
- Harry intends to start ""the March of Reason"" all over again.
- ""If you make Frodo a Jedi, you have to give Sauron the Death Star."" Harry is massively buffed from canon; so will Voldemort be.
- ""Like meeting someone who had been a friend, once, before something went drastically wrong…"" There once was something, some small aspect about Voldemort that was Light-sided.

So just from that, can we write a single paragraph that encompasses a potential ""entire plot"" of the book? Let's try:

&gt; Harry Potter applies the Scientific Method to the domain of magic, slowly yielding more and more power of more and more types hitherto unknown to Muggle or Wizard. Harry is the nemesis of Voldemort, still evil but somehow also a fallen hero, with whom he shares a strange magical connection. The war between them, when it comes in earnest, will threaten to escalate to cataclysmic proportions.

That's a start, anyway. 

There are a couple of further details that may warrant inclusion somehow. First, the epigraph to Chapter 2:

&gt; Of course it was my fault. There's no one else here who could be responsible for anything.

I'm a bit obsessed with this line, because it fits in with the later epigraphs, sounding like something we should already have heard Harry say by now, but we haven't.
  
To me, it sounds like something Harry would say when he's just done something terribly destructive and he's still in his Dark Side. Like, he's just hurt or killed a bunch of people, and the authorities come to him in disbelief that he would do it, and he says this line, dripping with disdain for all the peons around him. Perhaps we can use this to say that terrible things *will* happen in their war, not just ""will threaten to"".

Second, this bit when he hears McGonagall's version of Godric's Hollow:

&gt; (And somewhere in the back of his mind was a small, small note of confusion, a sense of something wrong about that story; and it should have been a part of Harry's art to notice that tiny note, but he was distracted. For it is a sad rule that whenever you are most in need of your art as a rationalist, that is when you are most likely to forget it.)

I feel like I'm overthinking this. I feel like Eliezer really intended the answer to this to be obvious, but maybe we haven't figured it out yet. It could be the thing Harry figures out later, when he goes in front of the Dementor: ""Dark Lords were not usually scared of infant children."" Eliezer specifically mentions Harry's rationality failing him here, so perhaps it simply refers to him not asking Question #1: ""How could anyone *know* that?"" Or maybe it's an actual inconsistency in the details, which Eliezer has privately screamed at us for not finding obvious.

So: is there anything else from the first three chapters that we might use to modify that paragraph? Can it be made more specific somehow?

You can find the lesswrong article on it [here](http://lesswrong.com/lw/nc/newcombs_problem_and_regret_of_rationality/) if you find you want a refresher.

I would like to propose a twist on this scenario. In my problem, you walk into a room with Omega and a box. The box either contains a million dollars, and you may pick it up and leave, or it is bolted to the floor, electrified, locked, and empty. This is determined randomly prior to you entering the room (For the purpose of this problem, we may assume 50-50, though it is also interesting when it is an arbitrarily small likelihood that the box is electrified), and Omega knows which case it is. You may leave without the box at any point.

If you touch the box and it is electrified, you will experience a very painful, very unpleasant, though non-lethal shock. You may assume that Omega has constrained the terms of your entry such that the only way to test if the box is electrified is to get shocked. It is a superintelligence, after all.

After you enter the room, Omega will say, ""You will leave without the box,"" if it predicts that upon saying that, you will leave without the box. Otherwise, it will say nothing.

It is now your turn to play the game. To your dismay, upon entering the room, Omega tells you, ""You will leave without the box."" Do you touch the box, or simply leave the room?

In the case where the likelihood of the box being electrified is arbitrarily small, does your answer change if the shock is lethal?

I note that it seems to be the case that you must precommit to always touching the box (and follow through) if you want to be able to ever play the game. Otherwise you can never win (or lose). 

The reason this is relevant is that the answer to this problem has to do with how you should act in the presence of Time-Turners. If you receive information that something bad has happened and then don't try to prevent it, that may be the only reason it happened. So if you want to be an effective agent with your Time-Turner (by which I mean one that can actually use the Time-Turner to affect things in your favor), you must expend all the resources you would have been willing to, regardless of information about the outcome (including that of success, as you might then fail because you did not think it necessary to really try, since you had already succeeded, thus invalidating that as a possible stable time-loop).

&gt; Dumbledore got up again and began heading towards the podium. Apparently they were about to be treated to a speech -

&gt; And Harry was struck by the inspiration for a *brilliant* experimental test.

&gt; Hermione had said that Dumbledore was the most powerful wizard alive, right?

&gt; Harry reached into his pouch and whispered, ""Comed-Tea"".

&gt; For the Comed-Tea to work, it would have to make Dumbledore say something so ridiculous during his speech that even in Harry's state of mental preparedness, he would *still* choke. Like, all the Hogwarts students had to not wear any clothes for the whole school year, or everyone was going to be transformed into cats.

&gt; But then if *anyone in the world* could resist the power of the Comed-Tea, it would be Dumbledore. So if this worked, the Comed-Tea was literally *invincible*.

&gt; Harry pulled the ring on the Comed-Tea under the table, wanting to do this a bit unobtrusively. The can made a quiet hissing noise. A few heads turned to look at him, but soon turned back as -

&gt; ""Welcome! Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts!"" said Dumbledore, beaming at the students with his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.

&gt; Harry took a first mouthful of Comed-Tea and lowered the can again. He would swallow the pop a little at a time and try not to choke no matter *what* Dumbledore said -

&gt; ""Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Happy happy boom boom swamp swamp swamp! Thank you!""

&gt; Everyone clapped and cheered, and Dumbledore sat down again.

&gt; Harry sat frozen as pop trickled out of the corners of his mouth. He had, at least, managed to choke *quietly*.

&gt; He really really *really* shouldn't have done that. Amazing how much *more obvious* that became *one second* after it was *too late*.

&gt; Realization struck Harry a pile-driver blow.

In Chapter 17, Dumbledore gives Harry his mother's potions book, in which he asked her what would happen if you used Thestral blood instead of blueberries in the potion of eagle's splendor. She replies that you would get really sick and maybe die. Compare that with Petunia's reported symptoms after taking Lily's permanent beauty potion.

Similarly, the Deathly Hallows, remarkable for their longevity (eg, the Invisiblity Cloak is different from others, which are temporary), have Thestral blood marks on them. The Invisibility Cloak has the Deathly Hallows symbol on it drawn in blood. The Elder Wand, even in canon, is the only wand with a Thestral-hair core. (The Resurrection Stone also has the symbol drawn on it, but the material isn't specified.)

So, it seems that Thestral blood is linked to longevity, not just in potions but also in transfigurations. If and when Harry realizes this property and that Hogwarts is (probably) England's largest Thestral reservation, in what ways could he apply this?

People talk about transfers to/from other schools like Durmstrang or Beauxbatons occasionally; if 'Wingardium Leviosa' sounds silly to us, what about to native French/German speakers?  Or, for that matter, Chinese?  If magic was something that could be 'home-grown' after Atlantis, it would seem like the Chinese would probably be pretty far up there when looking for magical societies with power rivalling Britain unless all magic descended from Atlantis and Britain somehow got the best of it.

It was mentioned, when discussing the tales of the line of Merlin:

&gt;The Line of Merlin continues, unbroken.

&gt;(Or so say those of Dumbledore's faction. Lord Malfoy would tell you otherwise. And in Asia they tell other tales entirely, which may not make Britain's version wrong.)

They tell other tales *entirely*?  If the whole Merlin thing just wasn't that important to them then do they have their own super-wizards in their past, like Lao-tzu or Zhuge-Liang?  Do they completely dispute the succession of Merlin in Britain and have their own rival succession?  Do they have a sort of Church of Latter-Day Saints-style Merlin fanon succession story?  Despite the fact that people teleport down to China, we have nothing about them except that Quirrell appears to like their tea.  Do they have different spells, or are the Chinese forced to laugh their way through ""Locomotor Wibbly"" when they want to put a jelly legs jinx on someone, or ""Oogely Boogely"" if they just *have* to have glowing bats?

This brings me, roundabout, to my other question; when Quirrell is casting seriously, like in Azkaban, Harry utterly fails to recognize the languages the spells are from.  This could mean he's using old spells gained from the Chamber of Secrets, but if those spells aren't faux-english that Harry can recognize then does that mean that the really old spells had entirely different etymologies, and the rest of our spells have been developed/bastardized from that original source?

Now Quirrell is in panic mode, his long-term plan has backfired drastically, and he doesn't think Harry's breakdown in 93 is going to be enough to fix it.

I can think of at least two options I would be contemplating if I were Quirrell:

1. **Tell Harry about the prophecy.** Harry doesn't *want* to destroy the world, and he doesn't see destroying the world in his future. Perhaps if Quirrell told Harry what he heard, it might make Harry stop and think really hard about moderating his resolve.

  Further, Dumbledore heard the first prophecy, which was almost certainly identically phrased save for the word ""coming"" being replaced with ""here"". When Dumbledore finds out that Quirrell spent time alone with Trelawney and immediately got scared out of his wits, there's at least a *chance* that Dumbledore will put that together. So even if he would have some motive to keep the prophecy secret, his archenemy already knows it, so what comparable harm would it do to tell Harry?

2. **Kill Harry.** Quirrell's plan for Harry has backfired. His #1 desire is to not die. He would flush all his other plans down the toilet if it meant he would not die. Without some incredibly strong *other* reason to want Harry to live, just punting on the whole Dark Harry business should be sounding pretty reasonable about now.

  Why would he not consider killing Harry? Probably the best reason would be if he knows or suspects that the connection between them would react badly to Harry's death, that Harry dying would kill him as well. Or if the outcome at Godric's Hollow was *not* his intent, and is guaranteed to repeat if Quirrell tries. (But Quirrell is obviously clever enough to arrange for Harry's death by someone else's hand, or get around the Godric's Hollow curse/ritual/pact/whatever-it-is somehow.) Or maybe Harry is a horcrux, and destroying a piece of himself is just something Quirrell could never bring himself to do, side effects be damned.

If this is really the next-to-last arc, the revelation of Quirrell as Voldemort has to be drawing near.

For the purposes of this discussion a 'soul' is the intelligence and identity of a person located somehow outside of the physical brain.  Harry, trained in rationality using a muggle's understanding of the world, is used to thinking of souls in much the way that his father thought of magic, as a low-class concept.  It may be that he's right in doing so, but evidence seems to suggest that at least to magic users, there might be some source of identity that is not tied to the brain.

- A woman can turn into a cat with a very small brain and maintain her own memories and intelligence.  This seems to suggest that there is something to identity other than neural pathways.

- A powerful dark wizard can remain alive after the apparent death of his physical body.  This is admittedly weak evidence given that 1 Harry is less than completely convinced Voldie's still alive and 2 the circumstances surrounding Voldie's apparent death are reported by unreliable sources.

- Ghosts, the resurrection stone and the veil all probably or definitely exist.  While these could both have completely acceptable explanations without the possibility of souls, they all become more likely in a reality in which souls exist.

- The burst of magic that happened when Hermione died is similarly possible in worlds without souls but becomes more likely if souls do exist.

I will grant that the priors are low enough on the existence of souls that none of this pushes the probability particularly high (I suppose it's still under 50%.)  On the other hand, magic exists, the laws of physics are general guidelines and everything Harry once thought he knew before learning about magic should be considered suspect.

Thing is, the only evidence they have that there is even a phenomenon to explain rests on the existence of very, very few truly extraordinary individuals: Merlin and the four founders of Hogwarts.

It seems to me that all of Harry's and Draco's energy is put into figuring out why current wizards are *weaker*, not why these five specific individuals were *stronger*. There are multiple possible explanations for this:

1) They had access to more powerful artifacts - or more likely shared the secret of one incredibly powerful artifact. The question, however, then becomes why the secret to creating this artifact was lost, which is basically the same theory as Harry ends out with.

2) They were somehow half-breeds of extraordinary power. This hyopthesis would lead to the conclusion that four of this type of half-breed appeared at the same time. This would not likely be a coincidence, which means that there would have to be a specific reason why. 

Also, there has to be a very limited amount of magical humanoids that it was sufficiently rare for humans to crossbreed with. If no obvious option existed, one would have to study theories of magical humanoids somehow hidden from the magical society, and with all the information present, it is not unthinkable that a testable hypothesis were to present itself.

There may be other reasons why a select few mages would be especially powerful. These are just the ones most obvious to me.

A horcrux allows the soul of the caster to remain on the Earth after their body has been destroyed. This is done by splitting the soul, and placing a fragment into an object. As long as a fragment of the soul exists in a Horcrux, the main portion of the soul in the body can not be destroyed. For example, Voldemort had created five Horcruxes when he went to Godric's Hollow. When the killing curse hit his body, his body was destroyed. His soul, however, remained fine. Weakened, he fled to Albania, where he had found Ravenclaw's diadem, but where there was no Horcrux currently.

Basically, the Horcrux acts as an anchor. While it exists, the fragment of the soul in the original body can not be destroyed.

The Horcruxes themselves have some level of being. The soul in the Riddle diary attempted to revive himself using Ginny, and the soul in the Locket was reading Ron's thoughts. It is unknown if the soul fragments in the Horcruxes can be revived independently. 

Having a Horcrux available is not needed for the resurrection. When Voldemort was revived, there was no Horcrux in the potion that did it. There was the original fragment of soul, that was in a temporary body created from dark magic, but no Horcrux. So basically, there is no need to be able to get to a Horcrux after you have made it, as you can still be revived if you do not know where it is.

I noticed something odd right off the bat that I had not seen discussed. Petunia, when explaining to her husband, had said that she had always been cruel to Lilly out of envy for her beauty. She describes begging her sister, since Lilly could not share or teach her magic, to make her beautiful. But...

""And Lily would tell me no, and make up the most ridiculous excuses, like the world would end if she were nice to her sister, or a centaur told her not to - the most ridiculous things, and I hated her for it.""

Now, it has been established that there was probably little affection between the two of them. So Lilly has every reason to refuse her sister out of spite, making up ridiculous rationale to twist the knife. On the one hand, this seems to contradict the canon Lilly's generally sweet and kind demeanor; on the other, we have not seen enough of HPMOR Lilly to know her personality.

Petunia then meets Vernon, the only man who would pay her any attention because of her appearance. She imagines her life with him and becomes desperate. She writes Lilly and it implied that she essentially took herself hostage, threatening suicide. Given the ultimatum Lilly does as asked and concocts some sort of permanent beauty potion. That potion, and EY, is the only reason we are reading HPMOR instead of ""Harry Potter and the Disappointing Conclusion"".

But what if the excuses she had made were not her own invention? Petunia specifically lists only two of Lilly's excuses. That the world would end, and that a centaur told her not to. Now I cant imagine her discussing this with anyone, to relay these excuses to Petunia, if her objection was spiteful. (But it is still possible, and in that case, case closed.) But if I were to guess one person that she had access to who's opinion she might not immediately discard would be her divination instructor. Trelawney, to my knowledge, should not be on the scene yet; but if she were it would fit her favored predictions of doom and gloom. In canon I remember her saying that the castle had been her home for 15 years in OotP, but I could be wrong or EY could be using artistic license.

The second excuse mentions nothing of the world ending, but does say that Lilly should not interfere with her sister. This is from a centaur, supposedly, which we know from canon and a few mentions in HPMOR are powerfully insightful and perceptive of the future.

We know from both source materials that certain positions in Hogwarts attract certain sorts of witches/wizards. The divination instructor may not have been Trelawney herself, but someone of a similar bullshit-to-prophetess ratio. Lilly may have taken the centaur's apprehension of the subject and lumped it in with the divination teacher's theatrics, dismissing them both in the face of losing her sister.

My thought is that either of those predictions, and possibly other unstated excuses, could have been legitimate premonitions. The Harry Potter of canon had a pretty easy job. Most people wear their white or black hat more or less on their sleeves. Befriend the good guys, defeat the bad and do so whilst being saccharine sweet and making superman look corrupt. Rationalist!Harry is now in such a grey area that the other would call him dark. That darkness could have been what was foretold with the tellers trying to steer the life of he-who-would-stop-voldi into a morally unambiguous black/white mindset, lest he be tempted as we see in HPMOR. To me this theory reinforces the idea that Dumbledor's motives and actions could be more sinister and authoritarian than canon, since it was his intention that rationalist!Harry be raised by the bitter Dursleys.

Edited: grammar, punctuation, wording.

Addendum:For anyone worried about the conspicuous use of magic in-front of a muggle, James potter was a member of a noble house. Lilly could have reduced Petunia to ashes and James could probably get her off with his connections, given there were no other witnesses. Professor Verres himself came up with an explanation for her transformation that is non-magical and therefore non-conspicuous.

[Discussion up to current]",35,4,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/120ihr/okay_now_im_thinking_about_the_fidelius_charm_is/,"So after some discussion in another thread now I'm thinking about the Fidelius charm.  Anyone who has a better grip on canon feel free to chime in and correct me.

This seems to be a powerful spell, and if I read it right it can keep a piece of info completely hidden, even if it's right in front of your nose.  This holds unless the secret is revealed, and if the secret keeper dies then the secret is lost forever (unless they shared it with others), right?

The question I had in canon was why Voldemort didn't use this on his horcrux's location, make a servant the secret keeper, then kill the servant.  Everything I read tells me that should work.  If I remember correctly, canon Dumbledore basically said that he didn't do this because of his arrogance and he didn't believe anyone would find it anyway.

I... don't think Quirrelmort would make the same mistake, although he would play the persona of Voldemort AS IF he would.  So here's the question:

I think the whole 'hiding the horcrux' thing is, even if possible, kind of moot in this story at this point, as knowing where his horcrux is/are doesn't really change anything for us.  But could he put his secret identity as Voldemort under the Fidelius charm in a similar manner?  No matter how hard people are looking, they can't seem to make the connection, although very few have reason to suspect, he seems to have at least fooled Dumbledore, which looked very suspicious to me from day one.  If he were to look deeper, he might find him hidden as the noble hero, which looks less suspicious than being completely rebuffed by the Charm.

Quirrell was identified as ""The Defense Professor"" to the security system, but in canon it recognized Crouch Jr., presumably not identified by that name, anyway.  This is a stronger spell than polyjuice, so could this interfere with the Marauder's Map revealing his true identity, causing the constant error Fred and George referred to?  

EDIT: Assuming that it only hides locations and not any piece of information unless someone else has a reason to believe otherwise.  What else could be hidden besides the location of a horcrux?  If it's location-based it couldn't be the probe, or else it wouldn't still be transmitting/detectable.  We know there's a map error in Hogwarts.  Could Dumbledore hide the philosopher's stone in such a way, causing the error in the map as the room becomes unplottable?

EDIT2:  I am told that Eliezer has said that Fidelius is not a tool in the HPMOR universe, and, to be honest I think that's a very good idea.

(warning, spoilers ch. 95+)",36,4,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1ires8/harry_potter_and_the_undiscovered_country_warning/,"HPMOR has been an absolute treat to read, not least for the puzzle involved, and I have high hopes that EY will deliver an ending elegant in its setup and dramatic conclusion. I've also been enjoying the reddit threads, and even contributed to a couple of them, and I would like to make an observation for everyone who has been thredding on the subject is Harry's rejection of the possibility of an afterlife.

A few posters have accused Harry of holding the Idiot Ball in regards to this question, especially since the most powerful--therefor knowledgeable--wizard he knows firmly believes in the existence of the soul and the Undiscovered Country.

I think it's important to remember that Harry James Potter-Verres has been raised a rationalist and therefor a materialist; for him the soul is the mind is the brain, as he so eloquently explained to Dumbledore. He does NOT believe that the soul, as a disembodied consciousness, naturally exists, even though this is precisely what Dumbledore believes ghosts are.

Since being introduced to magic, has Harry seen anything to contradict his rationalist disbelief? Not so much. He has seen that, with the intervention of magic, the mind can function without its natural brain (animagi, where wizards and witches remain substantially themselves while thinking with animal and even insect brains). He has also met a true artificial intelligence (The Sorting Hat) and seen a temporary brain created from nothing (McConnegal's transfigured desk/pig). Ghosts actually shook Harry when he first saw them, until they were explained as ""psychic echoes""--an explanation he accepted because (in the HPMOR universe) ghosts don't seem to learn and change. Neither do otherwise apparently sentient paintings.

But knowing that magic can apparently map and emulate a brain just as easily as it can map a cat does not, for Harry, point to the existence of souls; he has no reason for confidence that--absent the intervention of magic--Hermione Granger's soul/mind has survived her death.

And this is vitally important to the plot; if Harry became convinced of the possibility that Hermione still exists, as a disembodied soul, it would seriously change the trajectory of his resolution. Elsewhere in these threads I have explained my belief that, given the foundation of magic that EY has postulated (basically a psionic Krell Machine?) and simple human nature, the lost Atlantians would have secured their own immortality and possibly everyone else's by also creating a mind-mapping function that preserves a recording of every human being's mind at the time of death; this may be the source of the ""soulexplosion"" Harry felt when Hermione died and other readers have pointed to.

But there is no reason for Harry to suspect this--for all he knows what he felt was perfectly natural, the last burst of power from a wizard's magical core when they died--and whether or not a magically sustained afterlife exists, it will not change what Harry has to do to repair and revive Hermione. He has no interest in questing for an Undiscovered Country that centuries of wizards have not discovered; he seeks to make Hermione live again in the only world he knows.

In [Chapter 4](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/4/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality), Harry thinks, ""So not only is the wizarding economy almost completely decoupled from the **Muggle** economy, no one here has ever heard of arbitrage."" This is the first occurrence of ""Muggle"" in the story. It is reasonably clear that Harry didn't learn very much about the wizarding world in the two months between Chapters 2 and 3 (in 3, he doesn't know what ""Ravenclaw"" means and McGonagall has to explain what Gringotts is). Crucially, there are no time-skips between the start of Chapter 3 and this sentence in 4. So, where did Harry learn ""Muggle"" from, and (more importantly) why is it already appearing in his thoughts, instead of ""non-wizard""/""normal""/""ordinary""/etc.? A small thing, but the rest of the story carefully tracks who knows what (e.g. Harry picks up the reference to Lucius Malfoy from conversation, and he mentally files away ""horcrux"" after hearing it).

2. In [Chapter 28](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/28/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality), ""Atoms were held together by a quantum mist of shared electrons, for covalent bonds, or sometimes just **magnetism** at close ranges, for ionic bonds or van der Waals forces."" In this sentence, ""magnetism"" seems really inaccurate. While Harry isn't perfectly knowledgeable about science, and often takes shortcuts with his descriptions, this seems uncharacteristically inaccurate for him. [Ionic bonds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_bond) and [van der Waals forces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waals_force) are electrostatic. Saying ""electromagnetism"" here would be reasonable.

3. In [Chapter 78](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/78/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality) there are a couple of missing-space typos: ""tried to brew **Polyjuiceso** she could borrow"" and ""it was how difficult the potion was to brew **preciselyand** what happened to you if you screwed up.""

4. In [Chapter 93](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/93/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality), it would be wonderful if ""Normalcy bias, like that plane crash in Tener-something where a few people ran out and escaped but most people just sat in their seats not moving while their plane was literally on fire. Look at how long you took to really start moving."" came with a **citation** in the Author's Notes. Wikipedia's article on the [Tenerife disaster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife_airport_disaster) does not mention this.

5. In [Chapter 94](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/94/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality), ""The Sorting Hat might not be able to detect a **lich-prophylactery-thingy**. Obvious problem 1, the Dark Lord is supposed to have made his **lich-prophylactery-thingy** in 1943"" doesn't match [Chapter 86](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/86/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality) where ""Harry certainly intended to forge a road to magical immortality someday, but it would be a lot harder and require much more ingenuity than just binding an already-existent soul to a **lich's phylactery**."" is mentioned accurately. Although 86 is speaking in paraphrased-Harry-thought-mode, unlike 94's verbatim-Harry-thought-mode, there is no reason for Harry to be confused about this word. [Chapter 3](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/3/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality) makes it clear that Harry is quite familiar with AD&amp;D's rules: ""It was like walking through the magical items section of an Advanced Dungeons and Dragons rulebook (he didn't play the game, but he did enjoy reading the rulebooks).

Ch. 15 was restored to the first division by zero joke. I didn't get a snapshot of the original chapter, but I found a quote from the review section for the chapter and used that instead.  
Ch. 19 has been restored as best I can, but the copy I saved had no formatting, only plain text. My solution was to copy the formatted text from a later version of chapter 19, and then replace the new text with the old text as appropriate, but some formatting from the old text might have been lost.

I take the position that he has since changed his mind, and [revised](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revision); Quirrell is not Voldemort.

There is as yet no conclusive evidence for or against my position, but then the whole point of Bayesian reasoning is to establish probabilities in the absence of conclusive evidence.

**Points against my position**

The most consistent alternate hypothesis is that the person born as Tom Riddle discovered young that his identity was unusually flexible:

&gt; But for such as you and I, anyone we can imagine, we can be, in reality and not pretense. [[63](http://hpmor.com/chapter/63)]

In this interpretation, Tom Riddle became famous as Voldemort, the unnamed hero [[84](http://hpmor.com/chapter/84)], and Quirrell, in addition to having an unknown number of additional identities for the bits of time during which he was relatively anonymous. He can switch between these identities fluently and rapidly, as in [[54](http://hpmor.com/chapter/54)] and [[59](http://hpmor.com/chapter/59)]. He has matured greatly over time and overcome much of his youthful trauma; Quirrell is a demonstrably much better-adjusted individual than Voldemort ever was. Even so, despite the ease with which he can assume a new identity, he remains the same individual. Points raised in favor of this theory often include the following.

* Quirrell planned [[25](http://hpmor.com/chapter/25)] and accomplished the murder of Rita Skeeter [[26](http://hpmor.com/chapter/26)], and seemed to enjoy it. Though he claimed to have hoped to find a different lever to influence her behavior, he certainly appears not to have searched very hard.
* Quirrell has similar views to Voldemort as regards effective means of gathering power, as evidenced by the speech given in [[34](http://hpmor.com/chapter/34)].
* Quirrell's certainty about the fundamental innocence of Bellatrix Black [[51](http://hpmor.com/chapter/51)] is never explained; it is inferred that he knows first-hand how she was corrupted.
* Quirrell states that he was the unnamed hero, and left the job for more enjoyable pastimes [[84](http://hpmor.com/chapter/84)]; it's plausible that as Voldemort he could have done the same thing, faking his own death for reasons unknown.

In short, Quirrell's morality is dubious, his motives are opaque, his powers are sufficient, he was Voldemort in canon and as we haven't seen V elsewhere yet, the simplest explanation is that he is in fact him. 

**Points in favor of my position**

It is impossible to prove a case by seeking out the arguments that support it; you must instead disprove the arguments that falsify it. All of the above arguments are of the sort which support the assumption that Quirrell was in fact Voldemort, but in no way prove that Quirrell cannot have failed to have been Voldemort. 

Consider instead the alternate hypothesis that Quirrell and Voldemort are entirely different people. Quirrell, in this hypothesis, was in fact the unnamed hero; his life story runs more or less as presented in [[84](http://hpmor.com/chapter/84)]. Quirrell is the individual with the mental flexibility to be whoever he can imagine; Tom Riddle became only Voldemort and died in 1980 as per canon. There are several strong arguments to support this hypothesis.

The most direct argument is the case of the Oni Affair. When we as readers are introduced to it in [[19](http://hpmor.com/chapter/19)], it's an illustrative parable about why Harry has to learn to lose. However, it's strong evidence that Quirrell and Voldemort are in fact separate people. We know that Quirrell wasn't simply making the entire story up, becuase Amelia Bones references it in [[84](http://hpmor.com/chapter/84)]. There is simply no good reason why Voldemort would ever visit that monestary if, as Quirrell, he'd already mastered the arts taught there. Going to learn makes no sense; he had already spent the time and acquired the skills. Going to spread his terror makes no sense; it was an isolated incident, hushed up. Going for revenge for the humiliation makes no sense; even if in his persona as Voldemort he couldn't keep his temper and felt the need to revenge something that in his Quirrell persona he felt ""was one of the most valuable lessons [he] had ever learned,"" his demonstrated fluency in switching between personas should have let him avoid going to all that trouble and effort. No, the only reasonable solution here is that two different people went up to that temple, that Quirrell is not Voldemort. 

There is also the question of motive. If Quirrell was in fact Voldemort, then in both personas, as both the unnamed hero and as V, he spent huge quantities of money and effort fighting a lethal public sham war against himself for years. If we assume that they're the same person, then Riddle would have had to kill the hero, presumably at the beginning of his disappearance, then assume his identity 25 years later, expend all these resources, then abandon the pretense again just three years later to no gain. If we assume they're the same person, then Riddle is still Quirrell, who seems way too smart to squander all that energy to no gain, yet in neither persona did he gain by it. It is a much, much simpler hypothesis to assume that Quirrell is not Riddle, was never Voldemort, and lived a life pretty much as described. 

So what about the arguments above, which state that they are the same individual? I'll answer them point by point.

* *Quirrell murdered Rita Skeeter*. This is both undeniable and somewhat troubling, but it's hardly conclusive evidence that he was in fact Voldemort. He could just have a generally low respect for human life, particularly in those cases of humans who annoy and oppose him.
* *Quirrell values the strength of unity over the flexibility of independence*. Anyone who'd lived through the Wizarding War could have drawn those conclusions after thinking them through, particularly after seeing the Death Eaters almost win.
* *Quirrell rescues Bellatrix Black*. Frankly, this is the moral thing to do in the face of the horror that is Azkaban; though Harry's plan to eliminate it entirely is an even better solution, Quirrell does not have the resources at the moment to carry that plan out. In the meantime, rescuing someone he is utterly convinced to be innocent is a reasonable thing, and he could well have known Bellatrix personally as the unnamed hero before her enslavement to Voldemort. Being convinced of her innocence is no reason to claim that he is in fact Voldemort.
* *Quirrell quit being a hero and could have quit being Voldemort*. While technically true, this is no argument at all that Quirrell actually is Voldemort. I personally no longer live in New Hampshire, and I have a friend who has also moved from that state; nobody in their right mind would suggest that secretly I am she, based only on that common bit of history.

In short, though Quirrell's morality is dubious, his motives are opaque, and his powers are sufficient, known recorded history is evidence against assuming that Quirrell is Voldemort. Without Chapter 84, this argument is much harder to make; it's easy to understand why that hypothesis held a lot of attention for a long time. That said, we now have the new evidence; it's time to update our models and stop assuming that Quirrell is Voldemort. EY said right from the beginning that this fiction has multiple points of departure from canon, and the evidence available suggests that this is one of them.

You could drop it into the Mariana Trench, that's the deepest depth of ocean on the planet - or just pick some random other ocean trench, to make it less obvious.

This had me thinking. Assuming that Quirrel is Voldemort, Voldemort is certainly more intelligent that his Canon counterpart.  In Canon, Voldemort had 5 horcruxes made when he went to the Potter house, all besides the snake. 
I believe that Harry is a Horcrux, and Quirrel knew that he had made him into a Horcrux by accident. This would lead to him knowing that his ""soul"" was split into 7 already, which would prevent him from making another one.

&gt; Enrico Fermi and his colleagues started by bombarding hydrogen atoms with neutrons, and gradually worked their way through the periodic chart. They had no results until March 21, 1934, when after bombarding fluorine with neutrons, they ended up with a radioactive fluorine isotope. Soon they began to synthesize other radioactive isotopes. Initially, they thought that high-energy fast neutrons would work the best for nucleosynthesis. Then they discovered an interesting phenomenon. They got different results when using a wooden table than when using a marble table. The results were better if the neutron source was placed on the wooden table. Fermi had a hunch that the neutrons were slowed down by the wood in the table. Afterward, he used water and paraffin to try to achieve the same result, slowing down the stream of neutrons. He was surprised to learn, contrary to their expectations, that the slow neutrons had a greater probability of interacting with the nuclei, and so produced better results.

Harry attempted to investigate what have effects on magic (experiment with bats) but it is more than likely that there are some completely unexpected variables that are important (first year students, Hermione in particular, the spells they tried in particular, because the moon was in Aquarius on that day or maybe magic works in a different way in this single classroom[*](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1c8uzt/is_it_possible_to_cast_spells_without_knowing/c9fjb8m)). It is even possible that magic works in a different way because Harry attempts to analyze it.

I also wonder about possibility of unknown unknowns - for example completely unexpected dangers. Marie Skłodowska-Curie, pioneer of research on radioactivity is a good example here. She was unaware about damaging effects of ionising radiation. Her death was caused by long-term exposure to radiation (aplastic anemia).

&gt; Because of their levels of radioactivity, her papers from the 1890s are considered too dangerous to handle. Even her cookbook is highly radioactive. Her papers are kept in lead-lined boxes, and those who wish to consult them must wear protective clothing.

My chain of examples begins in chapter 24, where this paragraph happens:
&gt; Then Draco mentally kicked himself. All he had to do was write Father and explain that the money was gone because he had managed to loan it to Harry Potter, and Father would send him a special congratulatory note written in golden ink, a giant Chocolate Frog that would take two weeks to eat, and ten times as many  Galleons just in case Harry Potter needed another loan.

I am assuming that Draco was roughly correct, and that Lucius sent him some amount of Galleons much larger than this, but it is possible that he did not and should adjust the probability of this hypothesis downward moderately.

Second comes in chapter 47:
&gt; ""Draco, I'm an Occlumens -""

&gt; ""OH THAT IS SUCH A LIE -""

&gt; ""I was trained by Mr. Bester. Professor Quirrell set it up. Look, Draco, I'll take one drop of Veritaserum if you can get it, I'm just warning you that I'm an Occlumens. Not a perfect Occlumens, but Mr. Bester said I was putting up a complete block, and I could probably beat Veritaserum.""

&gt; ""You're in your first year at Hogwarts! That's just crazy! ""

There are two cases under which this conversation could have occurred. The first is that Draco is already an Occlumens, or is learning to become one. In this case, the conversation would reflect his unwillingness to tell anybody, including Harry. Additionally, he never brings up the idea that he himself is not an Occlumens as proof that Harry could not be one, and so is not lying to Harry.

The second case is that Draco is not an Occlumens; this would make my hypothesis less probable, but there is still an important progression in this conversation, as Harry mentions the name Mr. Bester. While Draco had likely never heard this name before, he could now reasonably do something like arrange lessons with Gringotts without seeming ignorant enough for them to suspect that he was asking without his father's permission. In either case, he would have had somewhere in the neighborhood of 400 Galleons to pay for the lessons.

There are two more developments to note in chapter 97. The first one is minor:
&gt; A boy who was also Harry's creditor to the tune of forty Galleons

At the very least, Draco did not use the extra money he likely received for its intended purpose of being loaned to Harry.

Second is the fact that except for mentions of Hermione, the point of blood purity does not come up at all in the meeting. While there are other reasons that this could have happened, such as Lucius simply setting the issue aside while there are more important matters at hand, the best fit for his actions seems to me that he simply did not know about this element of Harry's corruption of Draco.

So, the sequence of events which I am proposing goes: Draco receives an excess of money from his father. He realizes that it would be massively to his advantage to be able to beat Veritaserum. With or without the small amount of guidance which Harry later gave to him, he seeks out instruction on Occlumency. Later, when Lucius questions him under Veritaserum, Draco is able to tell him enough to give Lucius a sense of what Harry's ideals are, but keeps the genetics research out of the conversation.",,False,self,t5_2t5xf,1376584865.0,,,True,t3_1kfdnm,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1kfdnm/ch_97_spoilers_theory_re_draco/,

I am going to assume that ""magic gene"" in inherited in normal way (DNA, no significant influence of magic) - otherwise we cannot make any analysis.

So what we know: there are people

  * able to use magic (wizards/witches, I will use wizards to keep it short)
  * unable to use magic, born to parents able to use magic but they have higher than normal affinity to magic (squibs)
  * unable to use magic, without knowledge about magic, higher than normal affinity to magic (supposed to be muggles, not appearing in original books but they are in HPMOR and out-of-book materials by Rowling) - for example Petunia.
  * completely unable to use magic, lower affinity to magic (true muggles) - for example professor Michael)
  * able to use magic, born to parents unable to use magic (""muggle-born"")

It seems that everybody regards squibs and ""pseudomuggles"" as single group and there is no evidence against this.

Additionally, from HPMOR - among twenty-eight children from squib + squib marriages six were wizards.

Based on this evidence Harry proposed theory that magicalness is a recessive trait, determined by single gene, and gene coding lack of magic is inert (++:wizard, +-:squib, --:muggle).

But there is significant problem - this theory is unable to explain how wizard and witch may have squib children (++/++ will always result in ++).

Based on available evidence I suggest that magicalness is determined by a single gene, appearing in three variations: recessive magic (+), dominant magic (!) and inert lack of magic (-). So we may have wizards with following genotypes: ++, +!, !! and !-; squibs with +-, muggleborn with ++ and muggles with --. This is quite simple model that explains all situations and is not contradicted by available evidence:

magical parents, magical children 

  * ++/++ resulting in ++
  * !+/!+ resulting in ++ or !+ or !!
  * !!/++ resulting in +!
  * !+/!! resulting in !+ or !!
  * !-/!- resulting in !- or !!
  * !-/!+ resulting in !- or !+ or !!
 
squibs

  * !-/!+ resulting in +-
  * !-/++ resulting in +-

muggleborns (or rather squibborns)

  * +-/+- resulting in ++

squib may marry muggle and have squib children

  * +-/-- may result in +-

note that with my theory magical parents may have true muggle children

  * !-/!- resulting in --

muggleborn married to muggleborn will never have squib children

  * ++/++ will always result in ++

and muggleborn are unable to have true muggle children (one + gene is guaranteed)

  * ++/?? will always result in +?

but muggleborn married to pureblood may have squib children (it may be more or less likely than in pureblood/pureblood marriage, depending on ratio of ! and - genes in population).

  * !-/++ may result in +-

and muggleborn married to true muggle will have always have squib children

  * ++/-- will result in +-

but muggleborn/squib marriage may have magical children

  * ++/+- will result in ++ (or +- - squibs)

Moreover as squibs have the same genes as ""only recessive theory"" data collected by Draco is not disproving my theory (not that it is important*).

*this data is really poor - extremely small sample size (28 children) and may be heavily biased.

Harry thinks of death primarily as an event, which it is, but death can also be a process. Dumbledore sees only one possible form of immortality, not having a death event and just going through the 'dying' process. If life is the corridor the dementers chased Harry down in his nightmare, the both agree that to be trapped forever running, no matter how tired you got, eternally fleeing 'the coming night' would be a horrible fate, and Dumbledore thinks that is the only option. He no longer fears death as an event, because the alternative he sees is so much worse. I think this is why Dumbledore is still hurt by the dementers, because while he doesn't fear death as an event, he fears the eternal tiredness and exhaustion, so the dementers attack through that, which is slower, as it won't be as immediate of a problem. He spoke of grasping at life, and he wishes to as long as it doesn't turn into a living death in his hands (which is a valid worry), but he has never considered an actual victory. Instead of running or waiting, actually turning and fighting the dementers as they come down that metal corridor. Harry himself said he was worried about living in a universe that had run out of negentrapy, which is a valid concern as 'living' eternally as part of such a world would be horrible.

Bear in mind though that it must not be something of a pure scientific entertainment and should have some potential benefits for you on your way to the *world optimization*.

Here is what comes to my mind:

* time magic:

 * why are time turners capable of travelling only 6 hours per a day? Given that the concept of time measurement by those units is a human invention, it’s unlikely to be a natural law. So if it is a technical restriction, cast by other wizards, then what are the actual restrictions and how do they work (and can the human-made ones be circumvented)?
 
 * find out more about the time police, how they work, how they learn to do their job and practice at doing it etc.

* the political system of the Magical Britain — for instance, it seems like many noble houses are on the verge of extinction — even the Malfoys. Maybe that can come as handy in changing whose voice matters in the political arena?

* social analysis of the magical population — how inert wizards really are and why are they being like that? Even with death eaters and the lot being so frightening, why weren’t there any guerilla terrorists appearing to fight against them? I can easily imagine death eaters killing someone’s family but leaving (accidentally or intentionally) him\her alive, which would’ve likely caused that person to go on a one-person terrorist missions against his aggressors, attacking their families etc. In fact, why aren’t there analogues of Breivik in the magical communities, given that destruction through magic is much easier then the same done through modern technology (e.g. transfiguration alone can be a devastating technique if intentionally misused). Maybe there is some kind of a secret mental inhibitor\development modifier that is being cast upon all the wizards of a certain age? 
 
* other magical communities — it seems like each country has its own magical community, which can be drastically different even from its close neighbours. Given that, wouldn’t it be more productive to find a better magical society and use it as a lodgement  to gain power first and then change the structure of the Magical Britain (and other similar places) second?

* other races — there are centaurs as an independent creature race, so maybe there are other communities too, that are usually being ignored by the snobbish wizards? Maybe some of them could’ve shared with some useful knowledge with a genuinely interested person?

* magical wands — are there any alternatives to them, what are the principles of their work? Maybe it will be possible to use some other kind of an amplifier instead of the wand if you get captured by an enemy?

* parallel dimensions — it is possible that wizards know something about them.

* animagi: is it possible to design your own animal, which has no analogues in Earth’s natural habitat? If so, how much potential benefit is in it? For instance, can the animagi form be specifically developed as an intermediary life form (as in, human→animal→human) which has a very short lifespan by itself but instead gives its owner the advantages of not having to care about digestive and reproductive systems? If designing a unique animal form is possible, then one can even transform himself into some sort of a biological tank or a jet.

* wizard eugenics — if I got that part right, muggleborn wizard’s parents are in fact squibs who were lost from the attention circle of the magical community. So there is the possibility that there are far more unknown squibs out there, about whom nobody actually cares. So for someone with time and resources (which Harry, as a young boy, wizard, noble house scion an the-boy-who-lived has) it would be possible to learn how to identify them, find them out, explain the situation to them and persuade them to bore these exceptional children (with a 25% success of having a wizard and a 75% success of creating additional future “breeders”) who will be taught how to use their exceptional abilities. As a long-term strategy, this could’ve provided Harry not only with a personal army of wizards but also with a core for a new magical society (if the children were to be taught social sciences as well during their Secret Education).

a lot weaker than usual. “Sit down, Mr. Potter, it’s just a dizzy spell.
Sit down.”[...]

heavy, and opened the door. 

Let's repeat. 

Observations:

* Quirrel gives Harry a probably neigh-indestructible item.
* Quirrel kills somebody.
* Quirrel is exhausted immediately after that.

Thoughts: 

* The physical act of killing would not have exausted him.
* Him being a magician, it is *likely* that he is exhausted from some kind of magic.
* We know he can do wandless magic (cannot exactly cite a source for that, though.)

Given the situation, it was either:

* some kind of detection spell for Rita. Unlikely, since he presumably already knew she was there. Plus, *this is the man that can overpower [spoiler](/s ""some of the best Aurors by sneezing"")*. A simple detection spell would not have drained him like this.
* some kind of powerful ward-breaking (maybe of protective wards that Lucius put around Skeeter). Possible, but not likely.
* a kind of powerful ritual which corelates with the death.

Conclusion:

* The diary is a freaking Horcrux.

It now appears likely that he became an incredibly powerful wizard, assumed or took over multiple identities, possibly played a lead roll in _both_ sides of the Wizarding War, tortured and killed countless people, created an incredibly powerful curse to ensure that British Wizards would be ill-equipped to defend themselves from Dark Wizards, did Something at Godric's Hallow, disappeared for a decade, returned to Hogwarts to teach Defense under the nose of his supposed arch-enemy, trained many students to become formidable militaristically-capable wizards, maneuvered to put Harry in a position to become Wizard Dictator of Britain, broke into Azkaban to extricate Bellatrix..._why_? What, in the end, is he trying to accomplish?

Canon!Voldemort just wanted immortality - which this Voldemort appears to already have via horcrux, and could continue to have indefinitely if he just didn't provoke anyone. Power for the sake of power? Quirrellmort doesn't seem concerned with power for the sake of power (or I could be grossly misreading him). What passion could _possibly_ be driving him to such extreme lengths?

Consider, one of the few times we've seen the Defense Professor become emotionally engaged:
&gt;""Those fool Muggles will kill us all someday!"" Professor Quirrell's voice had grown louder. ""They will end it! End all of it!""

&gt; Harry was feeling a bit lost here. ""What are we talking about here, nuclear weapons?""

&gt;""Yes, nuclear weapons!"" Professor Quirrell was almost shouting now. ""Even He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named never used those, perhaps because he didn't want to rule over a heap of ash! They never should have been made! And it will only get worse with time!"" Professor Quirrell was standing up straight instead of leaning on his desk. ""There are gates you do not open, there are seals you do not breach! The fools who can't resist meddling are killed by the lesser perils early on, and the survivors all know that there are secrets you do not share with anyone who lacks the intelligence and the discipline to discover them for themselves! Every powerful wizard knows that! Even the most terrible Dark Wizards know that! And those idiot Muggles can't seem to figure it out! The eager little fools who discovered the secret of nuclear weapons didn't keep it to themselves, they told their fool politicians and now we must live under the constant threat of annihilation!""

Consider: HPMOR takes place in 1991-1992.

Consider: The Cold War effectively ended in 1991, radically reducing the immediate odds of global nuclear annhilation.

Consider: Quirrell/Voldemort/Riddle/OtherIdentity was missing in the decade leading up to this.

Consider: He have already established the close ties between Muggle and Wizarding wars in the 20th Century (Dumbledore/Churchill, Grindenwald/Hitler).

I propose an outlandish theory: Quirrellmort's goal has _always_ been reducing existential risk, specifically by unifying the magical world in a crusade to get rid of nuclear weapons (among other things). When his initial attempt failed, he instead ""died"" so he could spend a few years systemically weakening the Soviet Union and ending the Cold War, to reduce if not eliminate the risk. This accomplished, he returned to Hogwarts to begin preparing the Magical World to unite for a war against Muggle civilization to eradicate nuclear weapons (and possibly reduce/eliminate other existential threats).",,False,self,t5_2t5xf,False,,sunshine,True,t3_tmgp4,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/tmgp4/whats_quirrells_endgame/,

(Or because of the horcrux ritual going wrong in some way).

Harry has four other internal voices. Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. What objects does Voldemort like to make horcruxes out of? Artifacts of those wizards and witches!

What if those four voices are another four of Voldemort's horcruxes? Specifically, Hufflepuff's cup, Ravenclaw's diadem, Slytherin's locket and either Gryffindor's sword or something new. I think it would be rather plausible that a fragment of Voldemort's soul stored in Ravenclaw's diadem, for example, might start taking on some of Ravenclaw's traits.

In this theory, it might make sense that the dark side is actually the diary horcrux. It displays many of the same attributes as the teenage Tom Riddle. It's perfectly possible that the adult voldemort is still out there, then.


Two slight variations/additions:

If Harry's dark side were to be the resurrection stone horcrux, then it would certainly make sense for it to be very very afraid of death, as in the Azkaban chapters. We don't need both this and the diary - presumably one is replaced by the Gryffindor horcrux.

If Nagini's a horcrux, then that could explain Harry's parseltongue in a more concrete way than it just being an ability passed from Voldemort.

The implication is that Moody can see everyone, everywhere. Nothing can block his gaze. The human eye has a physical limit to how far away it can be from an object in order to resolve that object, but is the Eye of Vance limited in such a way? (Pure speculation, but interesting to think about)

Other speculations:

- Does the eye see only humans, or can it spy on other living creatures? That is, would the Eye be useful in fighting a horde of angry monkeys? :P

- If the eye did see every living creature, then is there a problem of selecting data from noise, given that most of the world abounds in microorganisms?

- Can the eye detect other frequencies of electromagnetic radiation, such as radio, UV, or infrared?

&gt; Harry was examining the wizarding equivalent of a first-aid kit, the Emergency Healing Pack Plus. There were two self-tightening tourniquets. A Stabilisation Potion, which would slow blood loss and prevent shock. **A syringe of what looked like liquid fire, which was supposed to drastically slow circulation in a treated area while maintaining oxygenation of the blood for up to three minutes, if you needed to prevent a poison from spreading through the body.** White cloth that could be wrapped over a part of the body to temporarily numb pain. Plus any number of other items that Harry totally failed to comprehend, like the ""Dementor Exposure Treatment"", which looked and smelled like ordinary chocolate. Or the ""Bafflesnaffle Counter"", which looked like a small quivering egg and carried a placard showing how to jam it up someone's nostril.

From Chapter 89:

&gt; ""Fuego!"" / ""Incendio!"" Harry heard, but he wasn't looking, **he was reaching for the syringe of glowing orange liquid that was the oxygenating potion**, pushing it into Hermione's neck at what Harry hoped was the carotid artery, to keep her brain alive even if her lungs or heart stopped, so long as her brain stayed intact everything else could be fixed, it had to be possible for magic to fix it, it had to be possible for magic to fix it, it had to be possible for magic to fix it, and Harry pushed the plunger of the syringe all the way down, creating a faint glow beneath the pale skin of her neck. Harry then pushed down on her chest, where her heart should be, hard compressions that he hoped was moving the oxygenated blood around to where it could reach her brain, even if her heart might have stopped beating, he hadn't actually thought to check her pulse.

*The oxygenation potion also slows circulation.* Did Harry accidentally kill Hermione? Would the potion have unintentionally prevented blood flow to her brain, while unhelpfully oxygenating her neck? It makes sense that a potion designed to prevent the spread of poison would prevent movement of the blood. It's also stated that it works on ""a treated area.""

So, Chapter 54:

&gt; The greater danger had passed, and now Harry was just trying not to collapse, to keep the spell going at the lower level. He'd drained something, hopefully not lost something - he should have known, should have remembered, that it wasn't mere magic that fueled the Patronus Charm —
&gt;
&gt; …
&gt;
&gt;Otherwise his Patronus would wax until it burned away every Dementor in Azkaban, blazing bright enough to destroy them even at this distance...
&gt;
&gt;Otherwise his Patronus would wax until it burned away every Dementor in Azkaban, taking all of Harry's life as fuel.

'Kay, so Harry casts a really powerful version of his Patronus and it drains him. Extrapolating out, he thinks that if he made it powerful enough to complete his quest, it very well might kill him.

Except I don't think he paid enough attention to his own thoughts the first time he ever cast his Patronus. Chapter 46:

&gt; Harry felt... well, normal again. Sane-ish. The spell hadn't undone the day and its damage, hadn't made the injuries as if they had never been, but his hurts had been... bandaged, meliorated? It was hard to describe.
&gt;
&gt;Dumbledore was also looking healthier, though not fully restored. The old wizard's head turned for a moment, locked eyes with Professor Quirrell, then looked back to Harry. ""Harry,"" Dumbledore said, ""are you about to collapse in exhaustion and possibly die?""
&gt;
&gt; ""No, strangely enough,"" Harry said. ""That took something out of me, but a lot less than I thought it would."" ***Or maybe it gave something back, as well as taking...*** ""Honestly, I expected my body to be hitting the ground with a thud about now.""

When Harry casts his Patronus powerfully to no effect, he loses HP. When he casts his Patronus powerfully and kills one Dementor, he loses HP but also maybe gains some HP back.

So what happens if he casts his Patronus powerfully and kills a dozen Dementors? A hundred? Maybe he gains HP for every Dementor he kills. Maybe some percentage of the life force that a Dementor takes during its existence is absorbed back into whoever kills it.

This is why it hurts my heart so much for Harry to have turned down his phoenix: because both we and Harry have possible clues that wiping out the Dementors of Azkaban would actually be the *opposite* of deadly. Because maybe Harry really did fail on top of the tower that night, because he didn't put two and two together in time.

There was a short HPMoR fanfic about Harry going with the phoenix, falling unconscious at the end of his spell, and the phoenix being unable to revive him. That's not how I would have written it. I would have had Harry start to weaken, but then, as more and more Dementors fell within his Patronus's radius, be strengthened, buffed beyond full health, ultimately blazing with phoenix fire himself as the last Dementors of Azkaban ceased existing.

&gt; Mr. Potter is an Occlumens? ***You* gave him an invisibility cloak** and he is immune to Veritaserum and he is friends with the Weasley twins? Albus, do you have any idea what you have unleashed upon this school?

So, Dumbledore gives Harry the cloak, and also gives him a note asking him to be wary of Dumbledore. Anyone have any ideas why he asks Harry to suspect him?

Harry gets another note in chapter 21, from ""Santa Claus"" (who we realize later is Dumbledore) which says

&gt; Dumbledore only pretends to be insane. He is extremely intelligent, and if you continue to step into closets and vanish, he will certainly deduce your possession of an invisibility cloak if he has not done so already.

1348122106.0,27,self.HPMOR,106irn,Outstanding mystery from ch. 27-28 that's really been bothering me lately.,29,2,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/106irn/outstanding_mystery_from_ch_2728_thats_really/,"In celebration of the conclusion of the re-readthrough, I've been pondering the mysteries that prey the most on my mind from throughout the whole fic-so-far. Here's a biggie.

The course of events went as follows:

Chapter 27, Harry and Snape have their momentous unless-you-know-exactly-what-you're-both-talking-about conversation:
&gt;Harry: ""Tell whoever it was that she wasn't worthy of him and he needs to get over it and move on and next time date girls who are deep instead of pretty.""
&gt;Snape: ""Your father was the bully, and what your mother saw in him was something I never did understand until this day.""

Then in chapter 28, a presumably still-unnerved Harry (though he's got bigger worries in that chapter!) asks Dumbledore and McGonagall about Snape:
&gt;Harry: ""As long as we're here, have either of you noticed anything different about Professor Snape? [...] I mean, has his behavior changed recently in any way?""

Finally, in a chapter 28 aftermath, the author gives us readers a snapshot of Snape's recent behavior that Harry, Dumbledore, and McGonagall are not privy to:
&gt;Snape: ""Miss Cornfoot, I do not return your affections, I begin to find your stares disturbing, and you will restrain your eyes henceforth. Is that quite clear?""

Clearly, we are meant to get something out of this aftermath scene. Harry asks about Snape's post-confrontation behavior, and not 3 pages later said behavior is shown to us. But the author's note following chapter 28 stated, ""Literally *no one* seems to have gotten Aftermath 2 to Ch. 28, so I guess I made that one too subtle. Sigh. Still learning, I guess.""

1376848285.0,25,self.HPMOR,1km5i0,What was Harry thinking? [Spoilers through 91],33,8,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1km5i0/what_was_harry_thinking_spoilers_through_91/,"Originally I wanted to title this ""Did Harry think Hermione to death?"" but that would be way too spoilery.

In Chap 90 Harry has his Time-Turner unlocked, with Hermione's death having happened less than six hours ago. As soon as that happened we as readers should have thought ""Why did we see Hermione die?"". Our mental model of Harry would have him going back in time to save Hermione, and our understanding of [Novikov's Self-Consistency Principle](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1km2fu/spoilers_through_91_harrys_superstitious/) informs us that what we SHOULD have read in chapter 89 is how Harry stumbled across the corpse of troll, and a few minutes later came across future-Harry and Hermione talking about closed-timelike-loops and being told by future-Harry that he needs to convince McGonagall to unlock his Time Turner and go back in time to kill this troll or Hermione will die. Chapter 90 should have been about the social manipulation Harry had to pull off in order to make this happen, and 91 would have been the troll-battle itself.

But we didn't read any of that. We got what we got instead. Which means that Harry decides not to go back in time to save Hermione.

What? How?

When his Time Turner was unlocked Harry faced the exact same dilemma as we did, except on an even more epic scale. We can shrug it off as author's intent or the demands of narrative. Harry is left thinking ""Why the hell isn't ten-minutes-from-now-Me going back in time? What the hell is going to prevent me? Because I already know something is going to stop me! Otherwise I would have seen (events described above)!""

So he sits down to think. His Time Turner was only unlocked because Hermione Granger died. If he uses it to prevent her death, his Time Turner will not be unlocked, and this will lead to a paradox. His knowledge of Novikov's lets him know that paradoxes are impossible. His first-hand experience from Chapter 17 (DO NOT MESS WITH TIME) scared him into realizing that insanely unlikely events can be forced into existence if its the surest way to preserve the timeline. He's been told by Dumbledore that far worse consequences can result from trying to change the past.

His resolve starts to waver. He begins to doubt.

There is much he does not know about what happened in the hours leading to Hermione's death. He saw her die, this is good evidence that the result of all future/past interventions will result in her death. But he didn't see what she was doing up to that point. Is it his going back in time that *causes* her broomstick to malfunction? Her cloak to be missing? Her feet to be bitten off first? Is it he who delays the Headmaster?

His father's rock is no longer on his finger... if he goes back in time will he be without that weapon and be the appetizer before the troll gets to Hermione? Maybe all her artifacts actually ARE in working order, but she rushes the troll to save future-Harry, and is killed trying to save him! He may be the cause of her death.

Or maybe even worse things happen. He has no knowledge of the state of most of the world outside Hogwarts. It is entirely possible that right now Draco could be dead, due to actions of future Harry trying to stop the troll. But its possible that he's alive too, because future-Harry doesn't go into the past, doesn't involve him, and everything is fine. He's scared to find out. If Draco does die, that could send magical Britain into civil war. Two friends dead and a civil war - that would be worse, as Dumbledore warned. *And it could already be happening!*

That's only just the start. Harry has a very vivid imagination. For all he knows, the world outside Hogwarts walls could be in flames. Best not to risk it.

And so Harry is paralyzed. Slowly, six hours pass. And then it's too late.

Hermione is not rescued. We do NOT read the events postulated at the top, not because they were physically impossible, but because they were psychologically impossible given what Harry's been led to believe.  Harry holds the [""I must close my eyes in order to change it"" superstition](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1km2fu/spoilers_through_91_harrys_superstitious/) not because it makes any damn sense, but because him holding that superstition is a Novikov self-consistent result. Not having that superstition would result in paradox and is not allowed, even if it is as insanely unlikely as unfolding a piece of paper and reading ""DO NOT MESS WITH TIME"".

Which is the narrative essence of all Novikov Self-Consistency-utilizing stories.

Voldemort was killed by a wizard who was not even a year old.

So Quirrell is Voldemort. This has been said by many to be ""obvious"", [Spoiler](#s ""including one particularly important person""). It wasn't obvious to me, however, despite all the signs: his admitted Dark ambitions, his multiple identities, killing Rita Skeeter, freeing Bellatrix, the zombie mode, the sense of doom, Harry's magic not working on him, the fact that he was possessed by Voldemort in canon, etc. 

The reason why it wasn't obvious is that it's really hard for me to assign Quirrelmort plausible motivations that describe both Quirrell's behavior and Voldemort's. 

If we can imagine that Quirrell and Voldemort are separate, clear motivations for the two characters emerge that explain almost all of their actions so far.

Quirrell: A hyper-intelligent sociopath of the CEO variety, who mostly travels the world and learns things. After finding Harry, he decided that he wanted to mentor the boy into becoming a strong leader who would defeat Voldemort and unite Britain. 

Voldemort: A cartoonishly evil sociopath of the serial killer variety, who mostly kills people and desires power for his own sake. Is fairly incompetent. Is currently out there somewhere, not necessarily in a physical body, trying to get his minions to kill Harry's friends and get his hands on the Philosopher's Stone. 

But now that we know they are one and the same, we have to answer the following non-trivial questions:

* Why is Voldemort forging such a close relationship with Harry? Why is he training him? Why doesn't he just use any of the infinite opportunities to kill him that have presented themselves? 
* If Voldemort is incredibly intelligent, then how do we explain his previous utter incompetence in the First Wizarding War? 
* Why is he going around acting blatantly evil in front of Dumbledore and co.? Why did he tell his class on the first day that he used to want to be a Dark Lord and even assembled an Evil Overlord List? Wouldn't it be better in pretty much every way, especially for someone so Machiavellian, to keep a low profile?
* It seems to me like Quirrell is not merely hosting Voldemort like he was in the books. His personality is not that of a man torn in two. So... if he's in the body of a highly powerful magic user, what is he waiting for? Why doesn't he just mobilize the Death Eaters now?

There's no way I can think of to assign motivations to Quirrelmort that aren't absolutely *weird*. This story doesn't do convoluted Triwizard-Cup-as-a-Portkey plots, and Quirrelmort is so powerful in both intelligence and power that he could do most things he wanted a conventional way. 

I also don't think he's secretly good or neutral. (Or, at least, I hope not). Eliezer says: 

&gt; If you do anything to increase the protagonist's power, or make their life easier, you must also amplify their opponent or add extra difficulties to their life. You can't make Frodo a Jedi unless you give Sauron the Death Star. 

Even if the real opponent is Death, an ending where Voldemort turns out to not be a major antagonist would be really dramatically unsatisfying and go against the reason Eliezer powered him up in the first place. 

I guess Voldemort's real motivations will be revealed in a crazy twist in a few chapters, but until then, I am confused... ",,False,self,t5_2t5xf,1375051713.0,,,True,t3_1j8l3i,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1j8l3i/voldemort_quirrell_motivations_spoilers_through_96/,

Why did she need to be awake? Why was Harry required to put up the pretence?

Sure, while Harry had a plausible reason to be overtaken by the dark lords soul, they could have had that part AFTER they escaped Azkaban. And just say he went there, and got her out, which would have been the case. That way Harry could put his whole mind to the Dark Lord impression, and not have to juggle the patronus/dark-lord mindset.

The part where Harry had to pretend to be the Dark Lord, because they brought her out concious just seems like someone is holding an idiot-ball...

Yes, I know that would have been much more boring than the events that happened, but half the point of this FanFic is that almost nothing is happening only for the sake of storytelling. Most stuff has to be sensible to be in the story, but this just seems... stupid somehow.

My understanding of events: Voldemort gets defeated(ish), and has a horcrux out on the pioneer plaque.  Bits of him remain on earth, but the prophecy says a remnant remaining behind are fine. He's had ~40 years to stew, but in this world he's almost as much of a rationalist as Harry, and certainly as smart. He wants to see his vision of a unified magical world, and has recognized the bad PR he had as a primary cause of his downfall. If we're going with the Quirrellmort theory, a lot of the earlier chapters  had him going on about how learning to loose &amp; having humility is important.  Additionally, he had that big speech where he essentially said that what Voldemort was trying to do was a good idea, but people weren't a fan of his flavor of unification. 

My guess: He's trying to mold Harry in to his successor to unify the magical world, to be a man not like himself, but like who he wishes he could have been and succeed where he failed.

What if AK was designed to be part of a process for backing up, or uploading, or otherwise transferring a person's personhood out of their body without destroying it?

What if Quirrellmort has uncovered the process and uses AK properly?

People have been talking about Hermione being horcruxed or somesuch, and it occurred to me that Quirrellmort might well prefer to take backups of the people he apparently murders. Why delete a file when you can just archive it and the immediate effect is the same? Maybe he has some use for their souls, nefarious or no, or maybe he just wants the contingency plan of restoring someone, or maybe he's *intending* to restore everyone he's ever apparently murdered and is actually working, at least he thinks, ethically.

Imagine the ramifications if every AK Quirrellmort has ever cast was actually just recoverably storing his victim's soul.

The 'wanting the person dead' thing might make sense since you're killing their body, ending their natural life, and taking their 'soul'. As for the cracking of the caster's soul, it could just be straightforward murder that does that, but if AK itself has some such effect integral to it, could it be something to do with adopting the mindset that the body's death is irrelevant? Most people would call that cracked. Harry's considered pretty crazy for holding ideas of that class.

I'm not sure that this squares with information we've got as a result of Harry's Patronus 2.0 and Dementors though. If AK's preference for death over life is translated to ""brain in a jar over constrained to a body"" then Patronus 2.0 probably needs an equivalent translation, and where does that leave Dementors? It *could* be that Harry's Patronus is actually, yet unbeknownst to him, antitranshumanist, and that Dementors are...? What? I don't know.

Why they are inactive?

* They are no more powerful than a typical person (maybe they are Muggle/Squib alchemists)
* They created colony somewhere (maybe on the Mars) and they invite selected people
* They are active, but in style of grey eminence
* They are active but not under their name (Dumbledore=Flamel etc)
* They are dealing with things more important than Grindelwald/Hitler/Stalin/Global warming
* There is some other entity that would react for their activity, therefore both sides do nothing (MAD style situation)
* There is some extremely long-term plot that requires their inactivity

Why they keep the Stone for themselves?

* Supply of magic/materials used by The Stone is limited
* Revealing secret would end in disastrous catastrophe
* Only some people may make The Stone (it may be purely random selection or something in the style of HPMOR!phoenixes)
* Stone is received in the same way as HPMOR!phoenixes
* They are unable to reveal the secret (The Stone was created by accident, it is blocked by reverse version of Fidelius, they are under oath)
* ""World is not ready"" - they think that revealing the stone would be unethical 
* Production is highly unethical/dangerous/causes really bad effects
* Stone is not real, Flamels are not human but some other long-living entity/being

Both

* Weird ethical system - maybe there are not caring about anybody else? They consider extending lifespan of everybody as a bad thing?
* To keep stone working they must not interfere with world
* Flamels are a fictional entity it is a cover for wizards trying to avoid fame or using it as alter ego

You probably do not know who this man is; I cannot give a full account, but he has used his talents to give much, in the form of [open-source free software](http://drupal.org/user/33420), and has asked for nothing in return.

Because the universe does not care about what people deserve, he has been stricken with ALS, a debilitating disease which will kill him very soon.

[He objects to this state of affairs and wishes to opt out.](http://aaronwinborn.com/blogs/aaron/open-source-software-developer-terminal-illness-hopes-opt-out-death)

There is, at the moment, one method that humanity has come up with to possibly ward off death in circumstances this dire. It is not proven, though the principle is sound: We are starstuff, carefully arranged in a certain pattern that makes us who we are. Physically, there is very little difference between that pattern right before we die and right after - it's just a matter of blood not getting to the right place, or a particular subsection of neurons not firing correctly. The structure that determines who we are is still there, just not functional. If the physical structure that determines who we are can be preserved, then one day someone could read it out and give that structure a working body again.

The process involves perfusing the brain with preservative chemicals and gradually cooling it until it becomes essentially glass, which is then stored in liquid nitrogen. The process preserves the information in the brain almost exactly as it is at the moment of death, and ensures that it will remain preserved in that state indefinitely. As brain imaging techniques continue to improve, that information may one day be read out and given function again.

This got me thinking about how much utility is left unused in potentially *combining* muggle technology with magic. HJPEV uses some ideas, but there is tons left, and plenty of muggle-borns who could have come up with them.

Here is a couple that were obvious to me, please post your own:

1 (from the other thread): Any gun firing bullets enchanted with shield-breaking charms. Duh.

2: A mechanical sprinkler system throughout Hogwarts. Incredible utility for quickly dosing everyone with one potion or another - whether there's the flu going around or you would want to 'flashbang' everybody with [spoiler](/s ""Harry's sun-potion from the latest army-battle"") in case of an invasion (as happens in the canon).

3: Wireless headsets, cell phones or just walkie-talkies. Seriously, their communication technology is laughable. [spoiler](/s """"Patronus, ask Dumbledore if he's busy"". It then has to relay the message to the recipient, get an answer, *and* relay that answer back to you. It takes twice the time for any message to get through than it would with a simple two-way radio. It's still useful, when you don't want your message intercepted, but it should be a niche function in a world with cell phones."")

4 (from the other thread): Owls are incredibly handy, and extremely underused. If you can teach it a couple of different warning signals and it can distinguish between people, you'll never have to be surprised by anyone ever again. If you want a further information advantage over someone, there's plenty of spells to make sure that you're the only one hearing the message, or even knowing that the owl is there.

5: With modern lie-detection technology, you usually look for changes in heartbeat, skin conduction, eye movement, pupil size, etc. This requires a number of machines, but with just a few charms, you should be able to acquire all of this information from someone easily. Being an occlumens wouldn't help you one bit.

&gt;""Harry Potter,"" said a silken voice that sent a shock of adrenaline jolting through Harry's blood.

&gt;Harry looked up.

&gt;""Lucius Malfoy,"" Harry said, his voice weary. Next time he was going to do the smart thing, and wait outside in the Muggle part of King's Cross until 10:55am.

&gt;Lucius inclined his head courteously, sending his long white hair drifting over his shoulders. The man was still carrying that same cane, lacquered in black with a silver snake's head for its handle; and something about his grip silently said this is a weapon of deadly power, not I am feeble and leaning on this. His face was expressionless.

&gt;Two men flanked him, their eyes continuously scanning, their wands already gripped low in their hands. The two of them moved like a single organism with four legs and four arms, the senior Crabbe-and-Goyle, and Harry thought he could guess which was which, but then it didn't really matter. They were merely Lucius's appendages, as certainly as if they'd been the two rightmost toes on his left foot.

&gt;""I apologize for disturbing you, Mr. Potter,"" said the smooth, silken voice. ""But you have answered none of my owls; and this, I thought, might be my only opportunity to meet you.""

&gt;""I have received none of your owls,"" Harry said calmly. ""Dumbledore intercepted them, I presume. But I would not have answered them if I had, except through Draco. For me to deal with you directly, without Draco's knowledge, would trespass on our friendship.""

&gt;Please go away, please go away...

&gt;The grey eyes glittered at him. ""Is that your pose, then..."" said the senior Malfoy. ""Well. I shall play along a little. What was your purpose in maneuvering your good friend, my son, into a public alliance with that girl?""

&gt;""Oh,"" Harry said lightly, ""that's obvious, right? Draco's working with Granger will make him realize that Muggleborns are human after all. Bwa. Ha. Ha.""

&gt;A thin trace of a smile moved over Lucius's lips. ""Yes, that does sound like one of Dumbledore's plans. Which it is not.""

&gt;""Indeed,"" said Harry. ""It is part of my game with Draco, and no work of Dumbledore's, and that is all I will say.""

&gt;""Let us dispense with games,"" said the senior Malfoy, the grey eyes suddenly hardening. ""If my suspicions are true, you would hardly do Dumbledore's bidding in any case, Mr. Potter.""

&gt;There was a slight pause.

&gt;""So you know,"" Harry said, his voice cold. ""Tell me. At which point, exactly, did you realize?""

&gt;""When I read your response to Professor Quirrell's little speech,"" said the white-haired man, and chuckled grimly. ""I was puzzled, at first, for it seemed not in your own interest; it took me days to understand whose interest was being served, and then it all finally became clear. And it is also obvious that you are weak, in some ways if not others.""

&gt;""Very clever of you,"" said Harry, still cold. ""But perhaps you mistake my interests.""

&gt;""Perhaps I do."" A hint of steel came into the silken voice. ""Indeed, that is precisely what I fear. You are playing strange games with my son, to a purpose I cannot guess. That is not a friendly act, and you cannot but expect me to be concerned!""

&gt;Lucius was leaning upon his cane with both hands now, and both those hands white, and his bodyguards had suddenly tensed.

&gt;Some instinct within Harry claimed that it would be a very bad idea to show his fear, to let Lucius see that he could be intimidated. They were in a public train station anyway -

&gt;""I find it interesting,"" Harry said, putting steel into his own voice, ""that you think I could benefit from doing Draco harm. But it is irrelevant, Lucius. He is my friend, and I do not betray my friends.""

&gt;""What?"" whispered Lucius. His face showed sheer shock.

&gt;Then -

&gt;(Longbottom interruption...)

&gt;Lucius turned his back on her dismissively, and faced Harry again. ""Will you request this harridan to depart, Mr. Potter?""

&gt;""I think not,"" said Harry in a dry voice. ""I prefer to deal with the part of House Malfoy that's my own age.""

&gt;There was a long pause, then. The grey eyes searched him.

&gt;""Of course..."" said Lucius slowly. ""I do feel the fool now. This whole time you were just pretending to have no idea what we were talking about.""

&gt;Harry met the gaze, and said nothing.

&gt;Lucius raised his cane a few centimeters and struck it hard on the ground.

&gt;The world vanished in a pale haze, all sounds went quiet, there was nothing in the universe but Harry and Lucius Malfoy and the snake-headed cane.

&gt;""My son is my heart,"" said the senior Malfoy, ""the last worthwhile thing I have left in this world, and this I say to you in a spirit of friendship: if he were to come to harm, I would give my life over to vengeance. But so long as my son does not come to harm, I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors. And as you have asked nothing more of me, I will ask nothing more of you.""

&gt;Then the pale haze vanished, showing an outraged Madam Longbottom being blocked from moving forward by the senior Crabbe; her wand was in her hand, now.

&gt;""How dare you!"" she hissed.

&gt;Lucius's dark robes swirled around him, and his white hair, as he turned to the senior Goyle. ""We return to Malfoy Manor.""

&gt;There were three pops of Apparition, and they were gone.

&gt;A silence followed.

If Harry can play the Game with himself, then Time-Turners allow you to do anything you could possibly think of doing *before you know you need to do it*.

&gt;  
&gt;Dumbledore had leapt out of his throne and run straight over the Head Table and seized hold of the woman speaking those awful words, Fawkes had appeared in a flash, and all three of them vanished in a crack of fire.""  

*Chapter 62*  
&gt;""Bellatrix Black has been taken from Azkaban, she has escaped from a prison inescapable,"" the old wizard said. ""It is a feat that bears Voldemort's signature if ever I have seen it; and she, his most faithful servant, is one of three requisites he must obtain to rise again in a new body. After ten years the enemy you once defeated has returned, as was foretold.""  

.  
.  
.  
This prophecy in 21 is also referred to by the Defence Professor in 86, asking Harry to share what he knows of it. Note that in 62, Dumbledore specifically states that the ""enemy you once defeated"" was foretold to return - this info isn't in the original prophecy (the one for Snape, call it P1) so we must assume it was in the recent one (call it P2).

From this we learn that Dumbledore - who heard the whole of it - has assumed that P2 refers to Voldemort as the one who is to come. From his perspective this seems pretty reasonable, and indeed from ours too. One wonders whether Dumbledore thought this before the raid on Azkaban, and whether we can infer anything about the unheard remainder of P2.

To borrow the Defence Professor's analysis, it seems that P2 was intended for either him or HJPEV, and I think (knowing what else we know about each character's dominance/optimisation plans) that whichever of the two it is not 'addressed' to is probably the one who is being described. Quirrelmort being warned about HJPEV, while possible, seems initially to be less probable than the inverse.

However, could it be that it is HJPEV who is going to TEAR APART THE VERY something? It certainly sounds like something he'd have no qualms doing to say... Azkaban? Or even Death itself? Maybe the the Defence Professor is being targeted by this prophecy as he is the only one who could stop HJPEV causing some chaos (Dumbledore likely would not stand in the way of his Hero). Even if Harry's tearing apart of things seems Good in his (and, likely our) view, maybe it is being warned against in this instance due to time/magic/seers having some preference for the status quo? Could it be that fate is opposed to a technomagical singularity (which surely would eventually come about as a result of HJPEV's optimisations)?

In either case, it would seem (if the chain of reasoning is correct so far) that either Quirrelmort or HJPEV would be able to view this prophecy, should they choose to visit the Dept of Mysteries, and HJPEV at least (possibly Quirrelmort also) knows that phoenixes may travel there.

He may believe he's doing it for a better world, and so may the fans, but the evidence says otherwise. He didn't need to kill many of the people he did for his better world. He did it to show off how smart he was and how insignificant they were to him.

Harry is L, probably the smartest man in the world. He's the good guy: not a paragon of virtue, but he's not really evil either. He believes in liberal concepts like rule of law and trial by jury, in direct opposition to one man setting himself up as an unstoppable dictator. He's lonely, regarded as strange, keenly rational, and uses probability as a reason not to believe the only person who's ever understood him isn't his enemy.

I don't think the analogy can be extended to the rest of the cast, but I think the repeated question of ""Is Quirrell *really* Voldemort?"" can be traced to ""I like Quirrell and don't want him to be evil, so he can't really be the evil Voldemort.

In chapter 3, Harry notes Quirrell, eye twitching, in the corner of the Leaky Cauldron.  Seemed reasonable enough at the time, given the prior probability of a person hanging out in a tavern.  Now that we know some stuff about Quirrell, it seems likely he was there to accomplish something besides food and drink.

First thought involved waiting for Harry, since his arrival was an event of high importance for him, and he's shown the ability to keep track of him in the Muggle world.  But just to watch him enter Diagon Alley?

What could he have accomplished here?  I'm rereading this again so I may answer my own question soon, but in chapter 6, there was this excerpt as McGonnagal was saying goodbye:

&gt;""I am unlikely ever to forget it. Thank you, Harry, that does make me feel better about entrusting you with certain things. Goodbye for now.""

&gt;Harry turned to go, into the Leaky Cauldron and out towards the Muggle world.

&gt;As his hand touched the back door's handle, he heard a last whisper from behind him.

&gt;""Hermione Granger.""

&gt;""What?"" Harry said, his hand still on the door.

&gt;""Look for a first-year girl named Hermione Granger on the train to Hogwarts.""

&gt;""Who is she?""

&gt;There was no answer, and when Harry turned around, Professor McGonagall was gone.

This was always suspicious to me since it almost seemed written forcibly disconnected from McGonnagal.  When I read it first I actually thought it was someone else speaking, though I eventually decided it must have been McGonnagal after all, though I couldn't IMAGINE why she would be whispering.  But we know it's possible to change your voice (hat and cloak's ambiguous whisper) and there's Ventriliquo...

The parallel is always drawn between Hermione and Bellatrix Lestrange, and although it makes me feel guilty to raise this suspicion above others, would it make sense for Quirrell to have drawn this parallel if he was there in the Leaky Cauldron specifically watching for promising students to investigate and draw into Harry's confidence?

Who could he be if not Sirius Black? Peter Pettigrew is the obvious choice, but I can't see how that would work. Polyjuice'd into Sirius for the 'trial'?

",32,8,112,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1124ao/an_argument_that_quirrell_is_a_good_guy_in_the/,"I have noticed that most people here have the assumption that Quirrellmort is continuing his plan to take over the world as a bad guy.

So to quote ""I notice I seem confused""  about that assumption. 

Here's my thinking so far.  I would be glad to see if others noticed this or not.

First some meta-analysis about the story.

Eliezer Yudkowsky (EY) has explicitly stated in the text that one of the major powers and ramifications of being rational is to be able to change your mind.  This is an example &gt;""The Enlightenment, that was what it was called in the Muggle world. It has something to do with seeking the truth, I think... with being able to change your mind from what you grew up believing""
&gt;
Eliezer Yudkowsky (EY) has explicitly made every significant adult take a level up in competance and intelligence.  McGonagall, Snape, Quirrell, Dumbledore, Malfoy, straight down to the Aurors are all shown being competant in ways that the cannon equivilents aren't. i'll dig up examples if this seems controversial 

EY has demonstrated that all those adult characters are capable and actively using rationality, although not explicitly stated in such away.  examples would be: &gt;""Harry felt like throwing up, or cheering, or fainting, or something. That was the first time his careful reasoning had ever worked on anyone. Maybe because it was also the first time he had something really serious that an adult needed from him, but still - Minerva McGonagall, +1 point.""  or from snape/dumbledore's time turner conversations &gt;""But Severus, if I had received reports from you and Minerva of Harry's safety, I would not, in the first place, have gone backward in time to -"" ""Headmaster, I think we must draw diagrams for this."" ""I agree, Severus.""  or pretty much any of the subtle conversations that Harry participates in with an adult.   Every single major character as an adult is rational enough to understand and reason out likely outcomes and likely motivations from scraps of information.  They are however not train directly in it, and they all show a very human tendancy to have blind spots in the concept.  McGonagall and experimentation,  Dumbledore and his treatment of people as stories or an afterlife, etc.   if need be I can fill in more examples of the characters acting rationally, and being able to successfully reason.  

EY has shown the adult characters to have been both ""bad"" and ""good"" from a utilitarian point of view.  Dumbledore and his repeated battles with Dark Wizards contrasted with his allowing repated abuse of children,  Snape and his unackowldeged heroism versus Voldemort versus his abuse of children.  Quirrell who's Voldemort past included indiscrimante slaughter and terrorism, also included such amazing teaching prowess that the entire school is recieving their first decent chance to learn to defend themselves from everything bad (including another Voldemort like Dark Lord).

One of the defining characteristics of good fiction is that a character must undergo change as a response to the circumstances of the story. 

I repeat I notice I am confused by the assumption around here that Voldemort is attempting to take over the world.

Putting those thoughts together and a few starting assumptions.

*Quirrellmort goes out of his way to avoid lying if at all possible. 

*Quirrellmort knows that his current body will not survive much longer for reasons that he can't not stop.

*He had childish desire to be the next dark lord but recognizing through his list and being rational, that being the dark lord isn't actually fun/worth it, 

*his pessimism about people is true and tends to suggest that he his desires are counter to ruling and obscured but orthagonal to that idea.

*Quirrellmort stated actually truths in the following quotes:

&gt;""&gt;Sometimes,"" Professor Quirrell said in a voice so quiet it almost wasn't there, ""when this flawed world seems unusually hateful, I wonder whether there might be some other place, far away, where I should have been. I cannot seem to imagine what that place might be, and if I can't even imagine it then how can I believe it exists? And yet the universe is so very, very wide, and perhaps it might exist anyway? But the stars are so very, very far away. It would take a long, long time to get there, even if I knew the way. And I wonder what I would dream about, if I slept for a long, long time...""""

&gt;""I will say this much, Mr. Potter: You are already an Occlumens, and I think you will become a perfect Occlumens before long. Identity does not mean, to such as us, what it means to other people. Anyone we can imagine, we can be; and the true difference about you, Mr. Potter, is that you have an unusually good imagination. A playwright must contain his characters, he must be larger than them in order to enact them within his mind. To an actor or spy or politician, the limit of his own diameter is the limit of who he can pretend to be, the limit of which face he may wear as a mask. But for such as you and I, anyone we can imagine, we can be, in reality and not pretense. While you imagined yourself a child, Mr. Potter, you were a child. Yet there are other existences you could support, larger existences, if you wished. Why are you so free, and so great in your circumference, when other children your age are small and constrained? Why can you imagine and become selves more adult than a mere child of a playwright should be able to compose? That I do not know, and I must not say what I guess. But what you have, Mr. Potter, is freedom.""

&gt;""you need not fear me for having discovered your secret. I am not going to tell you to give up on becoming the next Dark Lord. If I could turn back the hands of time and somehow remove that ambition from the mind of my child self, the self of this present time would not benefit from the alteration. For as long as I thought that was my goal, it drove me to study and learn and refine myself and become stronger. We become what we are meant to be by following our desires wherever they lead.""

now let's put some if/then statements into this.

*If we assume that Tom Riddle is Voldemort, the unnamed hero and Quirrell in roughly that chronology 

*if each of those are ""anyone we can imagine, we can be, in reality"" 

*then each of those Characters are in fact real and whole characters separated from one another in actions as well as desires.  

*If EY has the goal of demonstrating that rationality gives you the ability to change your mind 

*Quirrellmort is actually very well versed in Rationality

*if Quirrell is really as powerful at rationality as he seems to demonstrate, 

*then is it rational to assume that Tom Riddle's desires are the same through out each character shift that he has undergone, or is it more rational to assume that the desires have changed?

More to the point,  assuming that the origin story of cannon!Riddle is still true for hpmor!riddle, then we have an immensely powered young abused boy showing the classic symptoms of AntiSocial Personality Disorder (Voldemort) to an exponential increase that would be expected of an long term abuse survivor who hasn't been helped to heal. ..... and then we have the current Quirrell who does not do very much that could be considered APD, in fact seems to have built an enduring relationship with harry, protected multiple people from the abuses of the system (""One hundred points to Miss Granger for doing what is right.""), to teaching hundreds of children how to personally protect themselves while being in reality """"Professor Quirrell could be the only competent Defense Professor we get in all seven years at Hogwarts"" ""we cannot lose Professor Quirrell now, we cannot! If he but stays through January our fifth-years will pass their OWLs, if he stays through March our seventh-years will pass their NEWTs, he is remedying years of neglect in months, a whole generation will grow up able to defend themselves in spite of the Dark Lord's curse""

and at that point I am confused about how I am supposed to read Quirrellmort other than he is potentially the most powerful emotional anchor as well as potentially the most changed character from the start to the end of the story .

my guess is that Quirrellmort has in fact undergone personally growth and his real desires while clouded could be considered good.

Professor McGonagall transformed a desk into a pig and explicitly forbade students to transfigure humans or part of their body. But she said nothing about transfiguring something into a person or a human body. You would think it's a rather important point not to forget telling your students about...

Am I missing something? This seems to big to be ignored or unexploited in the story. I did not find a previous discussion on this topic in particular, but this seems an (yet another) area of magical-aided research which is grossly overlooked by the wizarding world.

I mean if it's possible to create human bodies or even live humans (and why not, considering pigs are not biologically really different from us), it raises... A lot of questions and possibilities.

Has a transfigured human a soul? Can it be killed by Avada Kedavra? Can you transfigure a desk into a live Hermione to help you with your school assignments? Can you then raise an army of transfigured clones of yourself to aid you in battles? Can a clone use magic? Why not?

However, we learned in chapter 86 that *Avada Kedavra* is ""a magically embodied preference for death over life"".  And *that* is the exact opposite of what the True Patronus Charm is.  What does Harry know, and why does he think he knows it?  He knows that using magic on the Defense Professor would be really *bad*.  Why does he know it?  Because he gets this weird feeling whenever they get near each other, and this one time two spells that are exact opposites of each other reacted strangely.  I suspect that the same reaction would occur no matter who cast the Killing Curse if Harry blocked it with his big silver dude.

 -

Secondly, I'd like to update an older theory about the first prophecy that made the rounds now that we have some newer information.  Or really, now that I've been *reminded* of some old information.

We have seen a lot of evidence that the true antagonist to Harry James Potter-Evans-Veres is Death itself, rather than any of the potentially evil super-powered wizards in his life.  And ridding the world of death is kind of a big deal, so it would make sense that a lot of prophecies would talk about it if it might happen.  So the idea is that all of the prophecies that have been relevant to MoR are directly talking about Death.  ""Three shall be Peverell's sons, and three their devices by which Death shall be defeated.""  Well that one's pretty blunt.  ""He is coming. The one who will tear apart the very-""/""He is here. The one who will tear apart the very stars in heaven. He is here. He is the end of the world.""  It's *not* Harry.  The stars, given time, will die (without magical intervention).  The world, given time, will die (without magical intervention).  Hermione is dying *as* the second version of this prophecy is spoken.  ""He"" is Death.

Which brings us to the big one.  The most important prophecy from canon.  ""The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.  Born to those who have thrice defied him.""  Harry is a direct descendant of the thee Peverell brothers, who each defied death by building their bridge.  (This was the bit that the most recent chapter reminded me of.)  ""Born as the seventh month dies."" I know prophecies are prone to strange, convoluted wording, but that's just a silly way to describe the last day of a month.  It is alluding to the nature of its subject matter.  ""And the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal.""  Step 3: profit.  ""But he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not.""  We've seen from the Humanism arc that dementors are not even *aware* of the True Patronus Charm.  It is beyond their ken.  ""And either must destroy all but a remnant of the other, for those two different spirits cannot exist in the same world.""  Anyone capable of casting the True Patronus Charm *cannot* abide by the existence of dementors.  The *only* way to cast it is to reject death as the natural order.

The first one was the moment where the flashback showed Lily pleading with Voldemort for her son's life as shown in chapter 43 I wondered if it was considered that she may have met the requirements of a ritual described in chapter 74, first stating what was to be sacrificed (her life) what was to be gained (her son's life). Voldemort accepted before she turned on him. After he killed her, wouldn't he have completed the terms of the ritual? Thereby making Harry's survival a condition and not terribly surprising at all.

The second exposed issue seems to be between QM's claim that he was fully expecting the auror to dodge in Azkaban in Chapter 54, when he later on indicated in 86 that to cast Avada Kedavra you need actual killing intent, to prefer the target to be dead to living in order to cast the spell at all.

There's strong evidence that the same is true in HPMOR (I know I should be quoting it, but I'm on my phone and I'll find the sections later or someone else can be awesome and do legwork! Basically, Dumbledore says he's invincible in Azkaban and his wand gets strong adjectives once in a while, Quirrell mentions the stone specifically when discussing them with Harry and then changes the subject, and of course Harry has the cloak.)

So, if we can assume that's right and Harry is meant to unite the hallows and defeat Death, which I know is something of a stretch - how is he going to do that? Quirrell already said he'd be willing to help Harry in ch. 95, but I just don't see Dumbledore as ever rejecting the ""natural order"" of Death.

On the other hand, we got possibly-Draco's-patronus showing up at the end of ch. 96 after a long absence. And in canon, Draco WAS the master of the elder wand after stunning Dumbledore, but he couldn't bring himself to kill him and what's more, he never wielded the wand. He rejected murder. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but what if a similar scenario occurs, maybe something to do with vengeance for his mother? Draco wields the elder wand but doesn't kill with it, because he's with Harry and thinks that yes, death in general is sad, especially the death of mothers - and of Hermione.

With the release of the new chapters, I inevitably start to ponder about this phenomenon I'm not used to of reading a story over *years*, with *months* of delay between each update.

I ask myself: is this effective? How am I supposed to be reading this? How are others reading it? How does the author think his readers are reading this? Should I be reading it a certain way? What if I'm not? Should I just stop reading it and come back to it in a year or two when there's more there? Or is it supposed to be read bit by bit? Or is that how *some* people like to read it but isn't best for me?

It's undoubtedly the case, if you ask me, that it's not going to be the same as reading it in one go, as most books are read. But I don't know whether I think it's a good, bad, or neutral difference.

My instinct is definitely that it's *not* actually good for my experience of the story that it takes so long to get new chapters, and out of curiosity I did some number crunching to either see if I couldn't find something interesting or just distract my brain enough to realise something interesting internally.

[I posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hc5vv/chapter_88_time_pressure_pt_1/casw6yr) in another thread a related comment, and this is more in the same vein.

###Analysis

When I first starting reading HPMOR it was being updated regularly, and then shortly afterwards slowed, and now tends to get new arcs with large delays in between.

The end of the initial spurt seems to have been with the release of Chapter 69, on January 28 2011, putting the fic at about 1000 pages long.

That's 70% of the progress so far, accomplished within a year.

After that EY started updating noticeably less frequently, and these days we tend to get large breaks and large updates.

I worked out that if EY had maintained his initial slower pace after Chapter 69 (before he started leaving big gaps between updates) to this day we'd now be at nearly 1500 pages. We are actually about that.

So he hasn't at all slowed down since The Great Slowing, although he has adopted the practice of holding back completed chapters until he has a few to publish. He just wrote it at 1080 words a day for 0.9 years, and then 160 for the next 2.4.

---

###Postamble

It puzzles me that this can have happened, really. 2 and a half years is a long time to be writing at such a markedly slower pace than his first year. If he hadn't slowed down after 11 months he'd have written to this point in the fic 133 days later rather than 2 years and 5 months.

I would *totally* understand if he'd stopped writing it altogether, life changes, he could have gotten bored of it, there are plenty of reasons for that. But he's had the whole story in his head this whole time and isn't, as far as I know, not interested in writing it any more.

I'm not saying his initial pace was manageable in the long term, but the difference is quite striking.

You still here? Good. I decided to make this thread as any new discussion would likely be drowned out in the main thread.

&gt;""HE IS HERE. THE ONE WHO WILL TEAR APART THE VERY STARS IN HEAVEN. HE IS HERE. HE IS THE END OF THE WORLD.""

For purposes of this discussion I will assume that this is a prophecy and not simply someone shouting really loud, that it is spoken by the a real Seer, that it is a new prophecy and not, say, someone suddenly releasing a stored recording of an earlier prophecy, and that the Defense Professor hears it.

Thoughts roughly in order of the wording:

* The Defense Professor need not be the intended recipient of the prophecy. There could be someone around both of them who is (unlikely).
* If the Defense Professor is the intended recipient, why he? 
* The fact that ""HE is here"" is mentioned twice with the same wording. Does that possibly mean that the two instances do not refer to the same ""HE""?
* The term ""here"" is not well-defined in terms of scale. Does this refer to a few meters around the Seer? Hogwarts? Britain? The World?
* The prophecy says that the HE will tear apart the very stars in *heaven*. I am not familiar enough with the English language. Can ""heaven"" really be used thus interchangeably for sky (or space)? Or does it perhaps refer to something more metaphysical, like afterlife (if such a thing exists in HPMORverse)? If so, what would stars be in this context? Maybe this means drastically altering the nature of afterlife?
* What might qualify as a star in context of a prophecy? Would, say, a certain probe flying through space qualify as a star to be torn apart? *evillaugh*
* What ramifications would tearing apart a physical star have? You might get a huge amount of energy out of it to power whatever you want, but if you are in a position to be able to do this, you probably don't worry about lack of energy. I don't have a real understanding of gravity wells. Could messing with tearing apart a star for whatever reason enable unrestricted time travel shenanigans?
* ""THE END OF THE WORLD."": World is not well-defined in this scope. The end of Earth? The end of the universe? The end of the ""world as we know it"", such as exterminating Death?
* As I stated somewhere else, the Defense Professor *likes* stars. They are more or less his Berserk Button, insofar that he has one. He will likely not take kindly to someone tearing apart his precious toys.
* The prophecy says that ""HE"" *will* tear apart the stars. No ""the power to"", no ""can"", *will*. No ifs, no buts.

&gt;Professor Quirrell was laughing, without pause. ""So be it, Mr. Potter. Your will be done."" The Defense Professor paused deliberately. ""Of course, I only promised one cunning plot. And that is all that the three of you will get.""

&gt;Draco had been half-expecting the words earlier, but now they still came as a shock; Draco exchanged rapid glances with Granger, they would have been the obvious allies but their wishes were directly opposed -

&gt;""You mean,"" said Harry, ""we have to all agree on a wish?""

&gt;""Oh, that would be far too much to ask,"" said Professor Quirrell. ""The three of you have no common enemy, do you?""

&gt;And for one brief moment, so fast that Draco thought he might have imagined it, the Defense Professor's eyes flicked in the direction of Dumbledore.

&gt;""No,"" said Professor Quirrell, ""I mean that I shall grant three wishes using a single plot.""

&gt;There was a confused silence.

&gt;""You can't do that,"" Harry said flatly from beside Draco. ""Not even I can do that. Two of those wishes are mutually incompatible. It's logically impossible -"" and then Harry cut himself off.

&gt;""You're a few years too young to tell me what I can't do, Mr. Potter,"" said Professor Quirrell, with a brief dry smile.

The solution (Game between S and R without Snitch ends in tie) seems obvious, but I still can't think of any way to make it *possible*. Quirell could manage to remove the snitch from the official version of the game, but he would have to manipulate every player of every house into playing at exactly the right level of performance to cause the very last game to be between Slytherin and Ravenclaw, and that's not even counting House Points which may be gained outside of Quiditch.

Worse, he may take the the wishes for Ravenclaw and Slytherin to mean that they must *win*, not tie, so fulfilling the wishes may require a bit of a paradox with the House Cup.

Does anyone have any ideas? I cannot fathom what's coming, whatever it is.

And yet Harry's memory in Ch43:  ""And the boy in the crib saw it, the eyes, those two crimson eyes, seeming to glow bright red, to blaze like miniature suns, filling Harry's whole vision as they locked to his own""

Harry's memory also makes no mention of Voldemort directly attacking him in his crib, just the eyes. If Voldemort was going to kill baby Harry, why lock eyes? If he was going to Legilimens, and he was so skilled at it, why would he lock eyes for a baby with no Occlumens training?

Is there any evidence at all that Voldemort attempted the Avada Kedavra spell at baby Harry? If not, what else could've occurred there?

Considering how skilled Moody says Voldemort is with Legilimens, could he have purposefully permanently affected his mind some how? Moody was able to push a burning body thought into Harry during Ch86. Maybe Voldemort pushed his entire mind into Harry, leaving behind a husk of a body?

In canon he accidentally created a horcrux from a killing curse here, so I don't think it's too far fetched.

This could be a reason for Harry's views on death, and even a reason for his dark side.

It happens after the sorting hat when Quirrell is invited by Dumbledore to speak.

&gt; Professor Quirrell made his way up to the podium and stood there, blinking. ""Ah..."" he said. ""Ah..."" Then his courage seemed to fail him utterly, and he stood there in silence, occasionally twitching.

Then he has his awsome speech and then:

&gt; Then the vigour and confidence seemed to drain away from Professor Quirrell. His mouth gaped open as if he had suddenly found himself facing an unexpected audience, and he turned with a convulsive jerk and shuffled back to his seat, hunched over as if he was about to collapse in on himself and implode.

So, in this scene it appears that Quirrell has two personalities, one valiant and one coy. I am just going to assume here that EY follows canon and that Quirrell is possessed with Voldemort. In HPMoR we see a lot of the smart Voldemort but the second personality seems to have completely disappeared in the rest of the story.

So, my theory is that Voldemort was dissatisfied with Quirrell's lack of acting skills. He knew that he would quickly be discovered if he kept displaying two different personalities. So, even though it would leave him vulnerable for long periods of time, he destroyed Quirrell's mind. Whenever he enters zombie mode, Quirrell is in control of the body.

We've seen Dumbledore specifically mention it to Harry in a not-so-subtle, wink-wink-nudge-nudge kind of way. And Snape brings it up in conversation with Quirrell. Also a healthy percentage of Hogwarts students have been through it all, suggesting that 1) EY doesn't think much of JKR's original corridor set up, and 2) nothing between the door and the mirror is very difficult or dangerous.

Given all that, I feel like we can safely assume that the corridor is more than a red herring. Why would Dumbledore mention it to Harry if it was just a Gryffindor playground? It also seems clear that the mirror is the actual defensive (or offensive?) measure, and it's equally clear that it's a defense Dumbledore feels adequately protects whatever's hidden. An HPMOR Occlumens would be able to brute-force the right kind of desire for the canon!mirror, so I feel confident predicting that EY changed the mirror mechanics (unless the mirror just ignores Occlumency and Hermione/Draco/Whoever is the one intended to pick up the stone in this version) if the mirror isn't just part of some more elaborate shell game.

So all that said, what's the probability that Dumbledore's plan is actually a good idea? Why have none of our protagonists or antagonists made any move for it so far this year? And when will Harry put it all together?

Ever since reading the book and hearing the Narrator say that Harry, upon having the events of Godric's Hollow explained to him, failed to notice his confusion, I have been going over it each time and coming up more and more muddled.

There's a popular belief that I subscribe to that suggests Riddle did not intend to kill Harry that night and certainly did not cast the killing curse on Harry.  If that's the case, we can assume that anything Harry relived during his Dementation may be inaccurate/charmed to suggest a false chain of events.

Riddle came as Voldemort and killed his parents, possibly sacrificing a victim to create another horcrux.  Then there is a body, burnt beyond recognition, and a child with a scar. There was only One witness; Harry Potter.  No one ever asked him about the event, but everyone knew what happened; even though everyone was COMPLETELY certain that the killing curse could not be blocked, they believed it had here for no adequately explained reason.  The only reason they would have for even believing it was Voldemort who had died was the prophecy, which is not exactly a trustworthy thing.  Unless...

There is at least one possibility though.  A skilled legilimens (Dumbledore?) reads baby Harry's mind and gains the event recording that way.  However, assuming Riddle wanted to end Voldemort's career for now, we can assume those memories were planted, because they are incompatible with that desire.  This suggests Riddle was preying on peoples' storybook instinct to give them a satisfying end, even though it was completely implausible.  This, at least, makes sense to me.  A sappy end to a grimdark villain.  Quirrellmort was extremely cynical about the affair, suggesting that no one would even think it odd if he came back to life and tried for a second shot, because of how perfectly fitting it seemed.  This would imply that he arranged the whole thing just to hijack the prophecy and make it look like it was fulfilled.

At some point after that, Bellatrix retrieved Voldemort's wand from the rubble.  Also at some point, Harry was rescued.  Depending on the order, this means that either Bellatrix came in and took the wand, ignoring her master's body and the baby, or that Harry's rescuer (was it Dumbledore or Hagrid that rescued him in this story?) came in and took Harry, ignoring the wand. I am confused here.  I suppose if Hagrid came he wouldn't have tried to locate the wand, but while it's possible Dumbledore wouldn't have done a quick spell-check for it, I just don't see it.

I am confused and I want more information.  What happened that night at Godric's Hollow?

EDIT: One extra part that I can't remove from my head but doesn't really belong with the rest as it has a wild leap of faith; I always assumed that the first words of the story:

I can see that Dumbledore serves a thematic purpose in the story, perhaps to show the folly of good intentions without rational analysis.

But even given that, I'm getting a little annoyed by the way he is on the losing end of every single conversation with Harry.

&gt; The chicken's beak opened, but it didn't have time for so much as a single caw before it began to wither and char. The blaze was brief, intense, and entirely self-contained; there was no smell of burning.

&gt; And then the fire died down only seconds after it had begun, leaving behind a tiny, pathetic heap of ashes on the golden platform.

&gt; ""Don't look so horrified, Harry!"" said Dumbledore. ""Fawkes hasn't been hurt."" Dumbledore's hand dipped into a pocket, and then the same hand sifted through the ashes and turned up a small yellowish egg. ""Look, here's an egg!""

I haven't seen much discussion about the chicken other than it being proof for Dumbledore's insanity, so apologies if this theory is not new.

I believe that setting the chicken on fire was Dumbledore's way of hinting at Harry what really happened to Narcissa. One body is replaced for another and burnt, in a magical fire with ""no smell of burning"". This might imply that the chicken was Transfigured from an inanimate object and the fire contained in a protective bubble, so no real chickens were harmed, which could be what really happened to Narcissa. Or it could be that an unimportant, unintelligent creature was sacrificed, but I think the Transfigured option is slightly more likely.

Later on, Dumbledore gives another small hint:

&gt; The door swept open, and Harry Potter entered. Minerva almost gasped out loud. The boy looked cool, collected, and utterly in control of himself.

&gt; ""Good mor-"" Harry's voice suddenly cut off. His jaw dropped.

&gt; Minerva tracked Harry's gaze, and she saw that Harry was staring at Fawkes where the phoenix sat on its golden perch. Fawkes fluttered his bright red-golden wings like the flickering of a flame, and dipped his head in a measured nod to the boy.

&gt; Harry turned to stare at Dumbledore.

&gt; **Dumbledore winked at him.**

I think Dumbledore is hoping Harry will be clever enough to work this out without explicitly saying anything that would blow his cover.

Even later on, Harry tells everyone gathered for the SPHEW protest about the chicken:

&gt; ""I didn't know about Fawkes,"" Harry's voice said rapidly, ""so **he told me that Fawkes was a phoenix, while he was pointing to a chicken on Fawkes's stand so I'd think that was Fawkes, and then he set the chicken on fire** - and also he gave me this big rock and told me it had belonged to my father and I ought to carry it everywhere -""

This, to me, is the most obvious evidence for the chicken being an allegory for Narcissa. Replace every instance of ""chicken"" with ""a body"" or ""that person"" and every instance of ""Fawkes"" with ""Narcissa"".

After Hermione's trial, Harry ponders his oath to Draco to take as an enemy whoever burned Narcissa alive, along with all its caveats, but he doesn't remember Fawkes and the chicken. Yet.

They all have no counter, and remove your personal autonomy (by death, bodily hijacking, or sensory overload).

Obliviation clearly meets this criteria, especially if it's done improperly and ""removes ten years of memory"". To someone who considers memory to be identity, this would act would be akin to murder.

Let's look at possible good-aligned uses of this spell.

To remove trauma from a victim? It clearly leaves behind echos in reflexive actions, it's highly unlikely this spell has much use in therapy. Even if it did, Mcgonagall offered a memory lock, which presumably is more suited to this purpose, and has the advantage of being reversable.

To use on a convict to, for example, delete the identity of a witness to protect him? Too easily worked around from anyone who planned a step ahead, or simply has close contacts on the outside. Magical witness protection would be far more effective.

To use on yourself, so you can go back and read the best fanfic for the first time again? Waaay too vulnerable to getting yourself caught in a loop. Do it twice, and you're likely to have no reason to stop. I would agree with a clause to mandate therapy rather than incarceration for the rare serial auto-obliviator, under the initial premise that it isn't the spell itself that's unforgivable, but the undefendable removal of another's autonomy through magic.

If you're willing to stretch the definition of good, obliviating muggles because they're muggles. Now this one is, what I suspect, the true reason it's a permitted spell. It's simply too useful to the ministry's masquerade efforts. If every human had the potential for magic (they probably do, likely all it would take is commenting out a line of code on the magic engine), there would be no reason to cover things up, or have a two-tiered justice system where non-practitioner witnesses are something to clean up rather than debrief. 

That last one seems to be strong enough to hold it off the list, cynic that I am. Anyway, I've never been a fan of any zero tolerance policies, AKing a consenting, dying wizard to a painless end seems more than forgivable to me, as does using the imperious to gather intel of a cultist's den. I would support a reclassification of the unforgivable spells to first degree murder, some class of greivious bodily harm, and abduction, and bring it back into line with the rest of the british system of punishing one for what is done, not the tools used.

At the very least however, it's a spell that should trigger the Hogwarts security at the highest level, regardless of who cast it, because seriously, I wouldn't want the valedictorian to be dropped back to first year by a jealous salutatorian, only for him to get away with blaming another.",,False,self,t5_2t5xf,1373423874.0,,chaos,True,t3_1hzba4,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hzba4/is_there_any_rational_reason_obliviation_shouldnt/,

First, let's see what the public knows (from chapter 87):

""the six-century-old Nicholas Flamel, the only known wizard to succeed at the incredibly difficult alchemical procedure for creating the Philosopher's Stone, which enables the transmutation of base metals into gold or silver as well as... the Elixir of Life which indefinitely prolongs the youth and health of the user...""

To which Harry responds:

""Um, Hermione, this seems obviously false."" He argues that the existence of a Philosopher's Stone would make the world go nuts either trying to replicate Flamel's achievement or get a hold of him to produce more of it. From the perspective of the general public it seems like a conspiracy theory.

However, we as the readers have very solid evidence that Flamel is real. First of course there's his existence in canon, which is a nice clue, but more importantly we get two references:

Chapter 77, Quirrell says: 

""there are Charms laid there of ancient power, magical constructs of which I have heard not even rumors, techniques that must have been disgorged from the hoarded lore of Flamel himself.""

So Quirrell, as a pretty brilliant guy, seems to believe that Flamel is around and allied with Dumbledore. 

Next, we move to Chapter 84, where in response to Harry's demand to get whatever is attracting the attention of all these dark wizards out of Hogwarts, Dumbledore tells Minerva:

""I asked as much of Flamel,"" Albus said, the pain clear in his voice. ""But Master Flamel has said - that even he can no longer keep safe the Stone - that he believes Voldemort has means of finding it wherever it is hidden - and that he does not consent for it to be guarded anywhere but Hogwarts. Minerva, I am sorry, but it must be done - must!""

So Flamel is alive (or something approximating life enough that he can communicate with Dumbledore) in 1991, after having been born in 1340. Now there are other possibilities besides straight immortality - he could have been in some kind of suspended animation or whatever, but I'd say the simplest explanation is that the 700 year old man rumored to have created the elixir of life probably did so.

The next question thus has to be what is the nature of the Philosopher's Stone. Put aside the gold aspect, the truth of falsity of which is pretty irrelevant compared to immortality. If the Stone doesn't come with some sort of limiting factor, it's pretty much a game breaker. Everyone can have consequence free eternal life just like Harry wants. If this is the case, I'd expect Harry to be pretty freaking outraged when he discovers the Stone's existence, and basically accuse Flamel and everyone who cooperated with him of being the greatest mass murderers in history, having held back life from the billions of people who have died in the last 600 or so years since the Stone's creation. In this scenario Flamel presumably agrees with Dumbledore that death is necessary, and excludes himself from that either through selfishness or as a needed sacrifice to keep the world safe rather than 'embark on the next great adventure.'

On the other hand, maybe the Stone does have a limitation that makes it more acceptable to keep it secret. Possibilities:

1) It requires some awful sacrifice to create or use: Horcruxes are a bad way to achieve immortality because they require a murder, sort of defeating the altruistic purpose. Maybe the Stone is similar. However, this seems somewhat unlikely given that Flamel seems to be on Dumbledore's side.

2) Only a limited amount can be made: In Chapter 87 Hermione says the method of creating the Stone is widely known, it's just so difficult that only Flamel has accomplished it. If it's true that no one else can make the Stone (and Flamel can't mass-produce them), and presumably each Stone can produce only a limited amount of elixir, the world might tear itself apart competing to be one of the lucky few immortals. Most extreme case would be that Flamel's Stone only produces enough elixir to keep himself, and maybe his wife (only mentioned in regular HP, not HPMOR) alive. Of course that's problematic because he apparently has enough of a stockpile to leave the Stone in Hogwarts for a while. Still, somewhat plausible.

3) The Stone can only be used by it's creator: creates the best moral argument for Flamel just chilling, but then why are we worried about Voldemort? Unlikely.

4) The Stone has side-effects: Maybe using the Stone saps a wizard's power or has some other bad side-effects. This would explain why Flamel apparently doesn't feel confident defending himself from Voldemort, but on the other hand side-effects would have to be REALLY awful for death to be preferable, and given what we've seen that seems unlikely.


Ultimately, given the definite existence of the Stone, the fact that references to it and Flamel have increased recently, and it's role in canon, I predict that both it and Flamel will be vital aspects of the final act of HPMOR. Unless the Stone can raise the dead it doesn't solve ALL of Harry's problems with the world, but it's a pretty good start.

So what do you think? What role will the Philosopher's Stone play in the rest of the story? How will Harry react to it?

1. They also need the headmaster's permission;

2. They can can do it by themselves.

The fact that the Restricted Section is poorly guarded suggests that it's either the second option or wizards are stupid. Another reason why it's more probable that any professor can access those books is that otherwise it would be simpler to put them in the headmaster's office. Thus, I think that it's the second option.

That invokes a question: what kind of information unrelated to studies, banned for students, but available for professors would be stored there and why (unless, of course, it's the world's largest collection of porn novels)? Not all of the professors are Dumbledore's allies. Not all of them are sensible even by the standards of the magical world.

1365805408.0,22,self.HPMOR,1c8i43,The 27 privacy spells revisited,25,3,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1c8i43/the_27_privacy_spells_revisited/,"The conversation earlier piqued my interest. I've written a small document about what ensuring privacy does.

Goals: to ensure that no-one is able to listen into a conversation as it happens. It does not protect against:

1. people knowing about the conversation (e.g. you can be seen entering and leaving Mary's Room) (Specifically: i'm not concerned about mechanical cameras.)
2. a participant sharing the information later (willingly or otherwise, via truth serums, legilimency, pensives, etc)

I've classed the magics required into two categories: wards and detection. The wards are spells that are required to last for the whole meeting - you don't want someone to unknowingly appear during your conversation. ""Detect"" spells are require to detect if the specified object (or magic, or ...) is present.  It is required that the ""detect"" spells last until all of the detect spells have been cast. It is assumed that the caster will automatically know if any of the magics fail before they are released at the appropriate time.

There is a good reason for the requirement for the detect spells to last until all detect spells have finished. This is to protect against changes while the privacy spells are going up. For example, assume that the order of the spells is: detect animagi followed by detect disillusionment. In this case, a person could be hidden under the disillusionment charm until just after the detect animagi spell is cast, at which point they change into their insect animagi charm, dropping the disillusionment charm. This person has now successfully infiltrated the meeting.
  
The list

1. ward: (travel) apparation
1. ward: (travel) port-key
1. ward: (travel) floo (new connections)
1. ward: (travel) portals (ala vanishing cabinet) (new connections)
1. ward: (travel) phoenix travel
1. ward: (travel) time travel
1. ward: (travel) physical (e.g. walking through the door, broom sticks)
1. ward: (travel) house-elf popping
1. ward: (travel) anti-taboo (under travel b/c taboos allow for traveling to the location, but is also to help protect against leaking information regarding the topic of conversation)
1. ward: (travel) ghosts, poltergeists
1. ward: seers
1. ward: patronus
1. detect: ghosts, poltergeists
1. detect: patronus
1. detect: paintings
1. detect: concealments (harry's invisibility cloak)
1. detect: concealments (""normal"" invisibility cloak)
1. detect: concealments (dislillusionment charm)
1. detect: concealments (other?)
1. detect: animagi
1. detect: metamorphmagus
1. detect: sentient life forms (humans, goblins, house-elfs, centaurs, gnomes, dwarfs, etc)
1. detect: open floo connections
1. detect: open portals
1. detect: familiars (see note below about animals)
1. detect: electronics
1. ward: magical connections from this area to outside the area (e.g. protean charms / magic mirror)
1. detect: magical connections from this area to outside the area (e.g. protean charms / magic mirror)
1. detect: transformed objects (don't want a transformed recorder to revert to its natural form in the middle of the conversation)
1. detect: stealth magics
1. detect: listening charms
1. detect: recording charms
1. other: break/remove mind-control magics
1. detect: undead (added after edit)


Assumptions:

1. I've also assumed that the wards protect against new/incoming magics, and not against existing magical connections. This may or may not be accurate.
1. I don't believe that the order of the casting is important (due to the assumptions about wards/detect spells), but I'm not 100% sure about that.
1. I assume that the physical ward prevents all physical interactions accross the boundaries.  This includes blocking sound, light, and radiation from traveling through the boundary. This avoids the need for locks, sight-blocking spells, globe of silence)
1. Some of the spells to detect one thing my work for the others (e.g. detect sentient life forms be sufficient to detect metamorphmagus)
1. I don't think a detect animals spell is required. I don't recall that animals can understand/reproduce human conversations. Not even snakes. I believe that it would be inherently impossible to use a pensive to view an animal's memories to reproduce the conversation. However, a wizard with a familiar might be able to listen through the mind of the familiar. If animal memories *can* be viewed to reproduce the conversation, then there would need to be two spells: detect animals (larger than a specific size), kill life-forms smaller than the specific size. You would have to kill all insects in the area, and there would be too many than the detect animals spell would be useless.
1. The detect spells inform the caster by directly imparting the knowledge to the caster instead of causing the detected item to glow. This is so that physically hidden/shrunken items are noticed.
1. The extendable ears provide a physical presence inside of a globe of silence (or mufflato spell), thus bypassing the spell. If present from the start, it would be detected (listening charm), and can not be added in later (physical ward) (which I believe is how it is done in canon).
1. A ""detect magic"" is not possible, or too easy to hide from.
1. ""Thief's downfall"" magic can't easily be used

Unknown how to protect against:
Non-electronic recording methods (e.g. phonograph cylinder, mechanical movie cameras)

Notes:

1. I suspect that, for many of the listed items that one needs to check for, there needs to be more than one spell cast. Two examples: I doubt there is a spell to detect all sentient life. I suspect that there may need to be at least one spell for each life form. E.g. there is apparently a need for separate ""detect transformation"" and ""detect animagi"" spells. So, I assume to detect all types of (non-animagi) transformations, you need to cast more than one spell.
1.  Due to lack of knowledge about the mechanics, some of the spells (e.g. ward for floo-blocking) may be sufficient, and you don't need the associated ""detect"" spell

It showcases Quirrell's raw power, and it gives a demonstration of the level of dueling that exists at the highest levels of wizardry. However, those are just nice literary reasons for it to exist. I am under the impression that Quirrell could have downed the auror much faster than he did, and he was in a situation where it (I think?) mattered that nothing go wrong. He also casts the Killing Curse, claiming that he would have pushed the auror out of the way in case of an unsuccessful dodge. Why not just push the auror outright, assuming that is something he cares about at all? Why go through the theatrics of this whole battle? He was just going to Memory-charm the auror anyway, there's no reason to put on a show.

I just find myself extremely confused about the whole affair. Quirrell not playing to win makes no sense, so I can only assume that he was playing to win, and i just don't know what it was he wanted to win. It is worth noting, I think, that the main difference between a world where Quirrell duels the auror against one where he does not is that Harry witnesses Quirrell dueling an auror.

In addition to violating the laws of physics, magic also seems capable of creating devices which are minor miracles of AI, like apparently sentient animated paintings which seem to be able to pass the Turing test. The combination of such capabilities with the rigor, speed, and repeatable automation, not to mention a dependable way to interface magic with muggle technology would seem to bring a lot of power. 

What if there was a way to combine magic with Computer Science and computer programming? If magic is capable of creating something like an artificial painting or even wards which can detect certain conditions, it would seem to be capable of creating something like a high speed switch or a NAND gate. If it's capable of creating a NAND gate, then it should be possible to create a computer operating on magical principles. Given the affinity of the Harry Potter universe's magic for diagrams like the Marauder's Map, I suspect that a diagram of an existing microprocessor could be inscribed onto a suitable substrate for a spell component then activated as a magic powered processor. 

Such a magical computer by itself could revolutionize the combination of magic with technology. Such devices could be built into magical tomes which interface with the Internet (*), networking through infrared or optical links to get around the problem of magic/EM interference. This by itself could make the wizard or witch who introduced it fabulously wealthy. Given the general pattern of older generations not understanding digital technology, it would be unlikely for established magical commercial interests to compete. Such technology would also spark a number of social revolutions in the magical world, much as it did in this one, resulting in greater and greater awareness of the potential in combining the powers of the magical and muggle world. 

However, this is just the tip of the iceberg. If magic is capable of enabling computation and is also compatible with miniaturization, then it would also be capable of producing [machine phase nanotechnology](http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~rau/phys600/drexler.htm). Use magic to create the first programmable molecular manipulator arrays. Magically enhanced molecular manipulator arrays could then produce their equivalents in normal matter. Since the control mechanisms and control programs of the magic-enhanced nanotech devices could be expressed digitally, in a particular Instruction Set Architecture, the same program could be used to run the normal matter nanotech manipulator arrays. (Probably with parameters reflecting reduced capabilities because of a lack of things like magically enhanced heat dissipation.) 

Once muggles have nanotech as envisioned by Drexler and Feynman, the combination of such muggle technology with magic will undoubtedly be colonizing the solar system in short order and heading for the stars.  

(*) - Back then, would it be the ARPAnet? Perhaps in the world of HPMOR, the Internet could arise contemporaneously with the integration of muggle and magical society. 

(Also, it has been proposed elsewhere in /r/HPMOR that all you'd need to combine magic and computers would be a Faraday cage with optical conduits, but I suspect that the magic/EM interference is subtler in nature than that. No evidence, it just seems to feel better that way.) 

EDIT: [Notmyrealaccount264 also came up with the notion of magically enabled nanotech.](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/152xfx/the_strategic_dark_lord_threat_highlevel_us/c7j8geb) I came up with the idea independently and also fleshed out the pathway to achieving it.

Considering Quirrell knew this person (and was a friend), likely implies this person was magical.

This could also explain Bellatrix's seemingly partial insanity, if she was crucioed before being allowed to live.

From determining that DNA was the source of inheritance in living creatures through the use of radioactive sulfur-35 incorporated into the protein capsule of a bacteriophage and phosphorous-32 incorporated into the DNA to culturing bacteria in a medium of nitrogen-15 and transferring them into a medium contain nitrogen-14 and using the change in density per cell as a means of differentiating between conservative, semi-conservative, and dispersive models of replication, heavy elements and radioactive isotopes have played a major role in science.

And now they're back again, but this time the test is different, yet the same.


## ***Space, Time, and Matter: Differentiating between Change and Physical Displacement***

Clearly, magic must be capable of either actively transforming or translating different kinds of elements from one location to another and either assembling them into some*thing* new, as is the case with transfiguration; some*where* new, as is the case with apparation; or some*when* new, as is the case with time-turners.

The mechanisms behind these various techniques remains shrouded in mystery given the difficulty in differentiating between exactly what goes in one end and comes out the other, whether it be the original form of a particular object after maintaining a transfiguration for an extended period of time or the apparent translation of one object across space and time via either apparation or the previously mentioned time-turnering. Something is clearly happening, but we have no idea what, exactly.

But not for long. As shown above, the creative use of radioactive isotopes can readily differentiate between different means of transmission and/or replication, and depending on exactly *how* this sort of thing is happening, we can make 2-3 concrete predictions regarding what exactly may of may not happen.

Transfiguration is the best means of testing these three mechanisms in general, specifically *partial* transfigurations. While other forms of transfiguration change the entire target, partial transfiguration does not, it only changes a *part* of the whole.

That in mind, say you were to transfigure a glass sphere into diamond made of pure carbon-11, a rare isotope with a half life of 20.334 minutes. Ten minutes later, you transfigure *half* of the sphere into something else and maintain that transfiguration for the next ten minutes. Now, half of the half of the sphere that was composed of the pure carbon-11 for the full twenty minutes will under go radioactive decay no matter what, making it our control, while 3 possible events will take place for the half that unwent the partial transfiguration.


## Scenario 1

Half of the carbon-11 that composed the partially transfigured half will also have undergone radioactive decay.

This would be known as the *spacial-translative theory of transfiguration*, where the original form of a transfigured object is used as a template for the new object while the original is spacial displaced until the transfiguration can no longer be maintained. 

Thus, the original is maintained as a real physical object whose state is somehow entangled with the that of the newly transfigured object.


## Scenario 2

Half of the carbon-11 that composed the partially transfigured half will not undergo radioactive decay for ten more minutes.

This would be known as the *temporal-translative theory of transfiguration*, where the original form of a transfigured object is used as a template for the new object while the original is temporally displaced until the transfiguration can no longer be maintained. 

Thus, the original is also maintained as a real physical object whose physical state is somehow entangled with the that of the newly transfigured object itself but skips over the time in between.


## Scenario 3

Half of the carbon-11 that composed the partially transfigured half will not undergo radioactive decay for twenty more minutes.

This would be known as the *transformative theory of transfiguration*, where the original form of a transfigured object is used not only as a template for the new object but also as a sources of the raw materials necessary to create such.

Thus, the original form is use only as a template for initial creation and otherwise ceases to exist following any given transfiguration and the original substance is re-instigated as a limiting factoring on the spell itself.

----------

Again, these same translative and transformative theories can be readily applied to apparation and time-turners as a means of determining the precise mechanisms behind each process as whole and answer a lot of different questions about these magical processes.

Do people who apparate really become physically displaced or are they just being remade from the ground up every time? Do you really travel through time or does your time-turner just spit out a copy of you that knows what you were going to do in the future and believes he is in his own past? What processes are really at work here?

Now, we have a way to test something like that.

___________________________________________________________
As we are aware, last week fellow conspirator MadScientist14159 brought to attention the need for empirical measurements as a means of quantifying magic and magical outputs in general.

Now obviously this is a difficult issue to deal with. I mean, at a fundamental level we know, for the most part, that magic, in its capacity to perform work and what not, transforms and makes use of energy in a variety of forms and thus has real world quantitative values associated with it at every level.

And, as aspiring rationalists, we wish to interrogate those values, to determine what they are and to see how they relate to the HPMoR universe in general as well as the long speculated of Source of Magic itself.

Still, the question remains, how do we go about doing it?

Magic can exert its influence in a variety of ways, from the production of *heat* and *illumination* to *transfiguration* and *teleportation*, not to mention *time-travel*, although that can be considered a separate issue for the time being.

Still, that is quite a repertoire and it will be no easy task determining just how a witch or wizard works their magic.

Our original poster did offer the possibility of measuring this in the form of *mana*, a classic measurement of quantitative magical resources necessary to perform a given task and derived from a pre-existing, measurable quantity, often associated with a particular individual and/or magical artifact.

He proposed to measure such by determining just how long one can sustain a *lumos* with a luminosity of 1 candella before succumbing to magical exhaustion.

The number of seconds over which said *lumos* could be maintained would then be considered the amount of *mana* associated with said individual.

While this particular definition of *mana* is  very simple and elegant it’s also fairly limited, giving us only one equally limited window through which to gauge magical strength for a given user.

And that’s where Randall Monroe comes in.

In the XKCD What-If article “Yoda”, Randall answers the age-old question of “[h]ow much Force power can Yoda output?”, proposed by Ryan Finnie.

Limiting his investigation to the original trilogy, Randall Monroe was able to quantify just how much force Yoda was outputting when he lifted Luke's X-wing fighter in *Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back*, and we can do much the same for Harry when he performs a *wingardium leviosa*.

As stated in the article, ""the energy it takes to lift an object to height h is equal to the object’s mass times the force of gravity times the height it’s lifted"".

In the case of Yoda, the approximate mass of the X-wing fighter, its rate of ascent, taking into account the .9g surface gravity on Dagobah, this feat came out to about 19.2 kW.

However, as displayed in both the HP canon and the original Star Wars trilogy, magic and/or the Force can also be mediated in the form of electrical arcs of varying strengths and intensities which, if constantly sustained as ""a continuous arc of pure electrical energy”, ""the power could easily be in the megawatts"".

However, if we really mean to quantify *all* spells we need to identify a shared property associated with *all* magical systems and magical environments in general.

Thankfully, there *is* one. As has already been established in canon, magical environments such as Hogwarts tend to have a negative affect on electronic devices in general, most likely due to electromagnetic interference (EMI).

EMI comes in multiple forms, from continuous interference [in the form of audio frequency, radio frequency interference, and broadband noise] to pulse or transient interference [in the form of isolated and/or repetitive electromagnetic pulse (EMP) events].

Furthermore, coupling mechanisms between the source and victim include conductive, capacitive, magnetic/inductive, and radiative coupling.

By testing how magical environments affect other known objects that are sensitive to these different coupling mechanisms, methods of better quantifying and or visualizing secondary magic influences in general might become possible. 

For initial investigations I'd propose something involving iron fillings or a magnetic compass given Harry’s general preparedness just to keep things at a minimum without introducing unnecessary variables, such as maintaining a tranfiguaration and what not.

If the iron filings align with a transient electrical field or the magnetic compass were to become deflected or begin spinning, identifying the intensity of these various episodes could help to better visualize and calculate some universal real world values associated with magical systems.

These baseline measurements could also help to establish a more direct correlation between magical exhaustion and work done in general.

Furthermore, this in some ways raises the question of just what kind of role magical users really play in magical outputs and what we should consider magical users to actually be.

While magical users do act as means of directing magical processes, does that imply they are the source of the energy driving that process, explaining the feeling of fatigue experienced after performing a particularly demanding spell?

Conversely, should magical users be considered something more or less analogous to electrical conductors and magical exhaustion is a consequence of resistance produced while trying to channel different kinds of magic?

Depending on one or the other, we could predict more calories burned for a less skilled wizard performing a new incantation or the same number of calories burned for all wizards but that the body itself may not be developed enough to deal with the additional strain.

Once we are able to better determine a possible correlation between magical output and these potential limiting factors, a better means of determining what mana and the Source of Magic actually are within the HPMoR universe may become possible.

Still, this all merely speculation on my part and I am generally biased towards my own opinions regarding matters such as this. Which is why I submit these ideas to you, my fellow Conspirators.

What are your thoughts on how we can better quantify and interrogate the Source of Magic as a whole and how might we best perform such actions within the pre-existing and possible future HPMoR canon?

I don't know how to add one of those ""Up to ChX"" tags to my post, though.

This has been bothering me for a while: why is Prof. Quirrell so damn powerful? Sure, he's Voldemort, but according to Dumbledore, his apparent method of resurrection (possessing Quirrell) should have left him weak. Here are the three methods which Dumbledore assumed Voldemort could have used to return to life:

1
&gt;I have studied many books I wish I had not read, seeking his every possible avenue of return, and I have found only three. His strongest road to life is the Philosopher's Stone, which Flamel assures me that not even Voldemort could create on his own; by that road he would rise greater and more terrible than ever before. I would not have thought Voldemort able to resist the temptation of the Stone, still less because such an obvious trap is a challenge to his wit. 

2
&gt; His second avenue is nearly as strong: The flesh of his servant, willingly given; the blood of his foe, forcibly taken; and the bone of his ancestor, unknowingly bequeathed. Voldemort is a perfectionist -"" Albus glanced at Severus, who nodded agreement, ""- and he would certainly seek the most powerful combination: the flesh of Bellatrix Black, the blood of Harry Potter, and the bone of his father. 

3
&gt; Voldemort's final avenue is to seduce a victim and drain the life from them over a long period; in which case Voldemort would be weak compared to his former power.

So that leads to several questions:

a) *Did* Voldemort use method 3 to become QuirrellMort? It appears to be the only way he could have done it, but Dumbledore may have missed another potential resurrection method.

b) If he used method 3, why is he so powerful? He showed himself to be a supreme duelist in his fight against Bahry One-Hand in Azkhaban. And this despite being Polyjuiced *and* (supposedly) possessing a victim. Then later, he displayed the ability to ""literally *sneeze* at all attempts to uncover his true identity,"" without even using a wand.

c) Maybe he used method 3 to become QuirrellMort, then stole the Philosopher's Stone (as he claimed he did in his post-SA conversation with Snape) before showing off his power in Azkhaban? But if that's true, why is he still going into ""zombie mode"" more and more often? (this was mentioned by Amelia Bones during her interview with him)

And all of this makes me realize that I am confused. I certainly don't claim to be a good rationalist... but the evidence suggests something impossible: powerful possessed QuirrelMort. And *that* lead me to this question:

x) Did Voldemort really die when he attacked baby Harry? We know about the magical resonance between them, but it may not have *killed* Voldemort that night. Recall the description that McGonagall gave of that night, way back in chapter 3:

&gt; ""The Dark Lord came to Godric's Hollow,"" Professor McGonagall said in a whisper. ""You should have been hidden, but you were betrayed. The Dark Lord killed James, and he killed Lily, and he came in the end to you, to your cot. He cast the Killing Curse at you, and that was where it ended. The Killing Curse is formed of pure hate, and strikes directly at the soul, severing it from the body. It cannot be blocked, and whomever it strikes, they die. But you survived. You are the only person ever to survive. The Killing Curse rebounded and struck the Dark Lord, leaving only the burnt hulk of his body and a scar upon your forehead. That was the end of the terror, and we were free. That, Harry Potter, is why people want to see the scar on your forehead, and why they want to shake your hand.""

The narrator then notes:

&gt; (And somewhere in the back of his mind was a small, small note of confusion, a sense of something wrong about that story; and it should have been a part of Harry's art to notice that tiny note, but he was distracted. For it is a sad rule that whenever you are most in need of your art as a rationalist, that is when you are most likely to forget it.)

Perhaps the thing that was wrong with that story that his *burnt body* got left behind, despite the fact that the Killing Curse merely severs the soul from the body. What better way to disguise the identity of a corpse than to burn it?

The burned corpse could be explained by the ""wizardry gone wild"" that Bahry saw happening during the resonance from Quirrell's Killing Curse hitting Harry's Patronus.

However, this discussion will most certainly spoil the ending of **Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire**, so don't read this thread if you don't want spoilers for that novel.

&gt; ""Bahl's Stupefaction,"" Moody said, naming an extremely addictive narcotic with interesting side effects on people with Slytherin tendencies; Moody had once seen an addicted Dark Wizard go to ridiculous lengths to get a victim to lay hands on a certain exact portkey, instead of just having someone toss the target a trapped Knut on their next visit to town; and after going to all that work, the addict had gone to the further effort to lay a second Portus, on the same portkey, which had, on a second touch, transported the victim back to safety. To this day, even taking the drug into account, Moody could not imagine what could have possibly been going through the man's mind at the time he had cast the second Portus.

This appears to be Eliezer bashing on the (apparently stupid and incomprehensible) actions of Barty Crouch Jr. from the end of book 4 (putting two Portus spells on the cup, one of which Harry used to get to safety). At first glance, it might make sense to assume that Crouch made an utterly idiotic mistake in placing that second Portus... but I think Eliezer missed an important plot point regarding the maze task.

The original purpose of the cup was to Portkey the first to touch it from the center of the maze and into the winner circle outside it. So, it *already had* a Portus spell on it (cast by someone else), over which Crouch layered his own Portus. That Portus which brought Harry and Cedric to the Little Hangleton graveyard. Then, with Crouch's Portus expended, the original became active, which is what brought Harry, and Cedric's corpse, back to Hogwarts.

I realize that this is an incredibly trivial thing to bring up, but Moody's internal monologue about Bahl's Stupification has always bothered me because of this.

The Peverell brothers were three powerful wizards who faced a great loss--Cadmus' fiancee, beloved of all three brothers--and together they resolved to defeat death, thus triggering the speaking of the prophecy:
&gt;Three shall be Peverell's sons and three their devices by which Death shall be defeated.

Spurred on by the prophecy, they created the Deathly Hollows but met dead ends: invincibility in combat didn't protect against murder, mischance, and old age; the power to hide from all enemies was likewise limited; the ability to speak to the dead did not bring them back.

After Antioch was murdered and the Elder Wand lost, and despair drove Cadmus to suicide, it was obvious that either the three sons of Peverell in the prophecy were not the three brothers, or they were but it would not be they who used the Hollows to defeat death.

In order to preserve their purpose, Ignotus placed a charm on his gravestone; when each succeeding generation of Peverells--now Potters--is presented in Godrick's Hollow, the stone ""speaks"" the prophecy. When Harry declared himself,

&gt;""I am Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, the son of Lily and James, of the house of Potter, and I accept my family's quest.""

he triggered the charm and heard the words of the prophecy although he does not yet understand them.





So, what are the three ""devices"" of the prophecy? Although there are other devices out there (the Philosopher's Stone being the most impressive Maguffin), since EY has gone to great lengths to put all of the Deathly Hollows in play and focus our attention on them, anything else would feel like a cheat. But what are the Deathly Hollows in MoR? I hypothesize that they are a bit different than the ones we see in canon.

The Elder Wand: how would a Wand of Invincible in Combat help defeat death? I would suggest that the Elder Wand is ""simply"" a powerful magic amplifier; using it in combat makes your shields unbreakable and your curses unstoppable, but drains your magical core more quickly to do it. Thus Grindewald needed the Dark Magic of sacrifices to sustain his continued use of it.

The Resurrection Stone: in MoR, souls appear to be copies much like the ""brain tapes"" familiar to science fiction. If this is the case, then the Resurrection Stone may be (narrowest interpretation) a ""brain tape recorder"" capable of mapping a dying subject's mind/brain and emulating it as a virtual mind, or (broader interpretation) a receiver/transmitter capable of tapping into some artificially created virtual Atlantean afterlife/database and projecting a true mind-emulation of anyone who has ever lived.

The Cloak of Invisibility: renders the wearer undetectable by and impervious to Dementors. I have no idea what its significance as a prophesied tool for defeating death is.

Conclusions: none yet. The Elder Wand and the Resurrection Stone together may be enough to wholly recreate a subject through transfiguration, but Transfiguration Is Not Permanent. A solution involving repairing Hermione's body and saving her from transfiguration sickness seems unlikely given the elements we have so far. So I'm working on it, and obviously it will involve elements that are unique to Harry Potter-Verres. Speculation is appreciated.

ADDITIONAL NOTE:
I am coming around to the theory that the devices in the prophecy may not refer to the Deathly Hollows, either. The three Sons of Peverell may bring their own devices in conquering death. Also, ""device"" may mean a clever plan as easily as it means a tool.

However, way back in ch. 13, during Harry's first transfiguration class, there is a highly stressed emphasis made upon the limitations of so-called ""free"" transfiguration by McGonagall.

&gt;Harry raised his hand and tried to signal Professor McGonagall with his eyes.

&gt;""Yes, Mr. Potter?""

&gt;""Is it possible to Transfigure a living subject into a target that is static, such as a coin - no, excuse me, I'm terribly sorry, let's just say a steel ball.""

&gt;Professor McGonagall shook her head. ""Mr. Potter, even inanimate objects undergo small internal changes over time.

This is the evidence we have against Harry doing something like transfiguring Hermione's body into a diamond. Discussion to the contrary necessitates that for certain substances the changes must be insignificant, or that a dead body isn't as susceptible, etc.

However, in that very same chapter there is emphasis on another point. That of *non-free* transfiguration like Animagi

&gt;""And above all,"" said Professor McGonagall, ""you will not Transfigure any living subject, especially yourselves. It will make you very sick and possibly dead, depending on how you Transfigure yourself and how long you maintain the change."" Professor McGonagall paused. ""Mr. Potter is currently holding up his hand because he has seen an Animagus transformation - specifically, a human transforming into a cat and back again. But **an Animagus transformation is not free Transfiguration**.""
  
&gt;Professor McGonagall took a small piece of wood out of her pocket. With a tap of her wand it became a glass ball. Then she said ""Crystferrium! "" and the glass ball became a steel ball. She tapped it with her wand one last time and the steel ball became a piece of wood once more. ""Crystferrium transforms a subject of solid glass into a similarly shaped target of solid steel. It cannot do the reverse, nor can it transform a desk into a pig. The most general form of Transfiguration - free Transfiguration, which you will be learning here - is capable of transforming any subject into any target, at least so far as physical form is concerned. For this reason, free Transfiguration must be done wordlessly. **Using Charms would require different words for every different transformation between subject and target**.""

above emphasis mine, but the following emphasis is from the original text.

&gt;Professor McGonagall went on, ""it is *free* Transfiguration which you must never do to any living subject.

and finally, emphasis mine

&gt;There are Charms and potions which can **safely, reversibly transform living subjects in limited ways**.

So, we have several paragraphs explaining that while free transfiguration has certain constraints (that make it very unsafe to do certain things), there are safe ways to do those things.

More interestingly we see a rule of transfiguration that I don't believe is ever made explicit in the original canon.

&gt;Using Charms would require different words for every different transformation between subject and target

**NOTE**: From here on is a possible conclusion I've drawn from the above facts, however this is but one possibility, there are many others, even considering these passages.

So safely performing a transfiguration of Hermione-&gt;diamond would effectively require a new spell. This is unfeasible within a mere six hours, but what if we combine this with something else? After all, Harry does know a way to explore humongous solution-spaces in minimal time, but he's never used it because ""Do not mess with time"" carries potentially big consequences. If Harry is truly ""censors-off"" and willing to do anything to achieve his short-term goal of Hermione-preservation, universe be damned, perhaps he's using the six hours he has to create a stable time-loop where he produces the needed non-free transfiguration spell.",,False,self,t5_2t5xf,False,,,True,t3_1hryrd,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hryrd/spoilers_ch_1393_free_vs_nonfree_transfiguration/,

I have a question about the study of blood. My grasp of biology ends at the high school level so someone please correct me if any of the following is wrong...

When Harry and Draco study blood, they find that the children of squibs follow the Mendelian 1:2:1 pattern of magicians, squibs, and muggles.  However, since squibs can't perform magic, this implies that the gene for magic is recessive, since you have to have both copies in order for magic to be expressed.

However, this leads to a weird place.  If the magic gene is recessive, then when two wizards have kids, they can only pass on the recessive allele. Thus, it should be impossible for squibs to be born from two wizards. However, it seems that in canon there are squibs born in wizarding families.

Also, if a wizard and a muggle have kids, unless the muggle is secretly a squib (carrier of recessive magic gene) the kids are guaranteed to be squibs. MM x mm = Mm, right?

Also, this would also strongly support the blood purist argument that interbreeding with muggles is bad. While it wouldn't necessarily make the magician offspring weaker, it is a huge risk because unless they are a squib, you're dooming your kids to squibdom.

It wasn't so much that he was babbling and semi-coherent--that just makes sense, given the emotional context--but *what* he was babbling that threw me:

&gt; ""- and besides I've been reading about evolutionary psychology, and, well, there are all these suggestions that one man and one woman living together happily ever afterward may be more the exception rather than the rule, and in hunter-gatherer tribes it was more often just staying together for two or three years to raise a child during its most vulnerable stages - and, I mean, considering how many people end up horribly unhappy in traditional marriages, it seems like it might be the sort of thing that needs some clever reworking - especially if we actually do solve immortality -""

That's an awfully strange chain of reasoning from a kid who was raised by a loving family, one that had to go to extraordinary lengths to raise and socialize him. The idea that a pre-pubescent boy with Harry's background would decide that the sole purpose of marriage is resource-sharing to increase the success of procreation, well, it doesn't seem like the kind of mistake he'd make. 

It's particularly surprising now, since not ten days ago he and Hermione essentially entered into a non-sexual, non-procreative marriage deal, with the House of Granger swearing fealty to the House of Potter. I guess it really hadn't occurred to him to think very deeply about the institution of marriage, and he was just blurting out whatever random thoughts popped into his head.

I'm really, really hoping that, from this point on, Harry starts to buckle down and look into communication, negotiation, and conflict resolution techniques. Surely by now it's been thoroughly demonstrated to him to be his greatest weakness. I also think it's long past time he takes Hermione aside a teaches her the secret to a True Patronas: there are many outside benefits there, but the biggest would be that it would help them both gain a little more perspective into each other's thought processes, which they both sorely need at this point.

1. There's just no freaking way Harry can have a memory of something from when he was a year old, unless there's some magic-based phenomenon that gives wizards better memories or something.

2. Maybe I've missed something, but it seems to me that the Potter House had two floors- the ground floor and a floor above that one. Voldemort enters the premises, James tells Lily to flee upstairs with Harry. She does so. James ""attacks"" Voldemort in this time and gets killed.

Setting aside the problem of clear memories (both sight and sound) from when he was a year old, how could Harry remember this event so clearly? He was either out of the room or leaving very quickly. Unless Lily ran backwards up the stairs so Baby Harry could watch Voldemort kill James, how could Baby Harry have seen anything? This means that the memory probably isn't Harry's. It's either a memory of Voldemort's which was automatically dumped into Harry when he was made into a Horcrux or a memory Harry obtains from Quirrellmort's mind somehow when experiencing the Dementor attack.

Harry tells the tale to Snape. Do you think Snape knows now? He's a smart guy, isn't he?

And HPMOR - so why not combine it and make that shit epic. Literally, I tend to read a lot on the loo. 

Other places too, just saying. Where was I? Oh, yeah. Book. Help me out here.

**1. End of the book.** 
HPMOR is long, so I need to cut it in parts and I'm not sure where Book 1 should end. 
Regarding the thickness of the book I concluded that about 200 sheets/400 pages are comfortable to hold. I'm not fixed to this number, but it shouldn't be over 500 pages.
Now, at the moment I am formating the text, fitting it into book form and as of chapter 9 about 120 pages are full so I guess the end for book 1 will be between chapters 20 and 30. Where should I stop?


**2. Science explained** 
My enormous sample size of 5 people, including me, came up with inconclusive results regarding the question of further information about the scientific references in the book. 
Should I 
a) leave it out (franky...I won't) 
b) do it like Pratchett with giant footnotes and a link
c)  put whatever references are in the chapters for book 1 at the end or
d) make a seperate booklet for it


**3. Making it look pretty**
Three main things to do: The sleeve, the cover and everything inside.

Cover: I'm quite terrible at handiwork, but i do have an aunt quite able to do some embroidery for the cover, probably a hand snapping fingers. Other ideas would be nice, but I don't want to torture auntie, so it shouldn't be overly complicated.

Sleeve: Should be different from the cover. I am OK in photoshop, but OK means it probably still will look like shite. If a kind soul would help me out with that, I'd be grateful. Some high-resolution pictures that fit the theme would be great too.

Inside: Klicked myself trough some fanart of varying quality and style to put it at the start of each chapter. Should I do that or not? May look strange...

**Week #10: Would you rather HPMOR got extended or have Eliezer give what we've got so far a good ending and write other fiction?**

Eliezer has written quite a bit of fiction in the past (see http://yudkowsky.net/other/fiction), but HPMOR is by far his longest piece. You may like HPMOR (or not), but do you like it enough that you'd like it to continue indefinitely? Or perhaps you wish Eliezer would get on with finishing HPMOR and write some more short stories.

Note that I have no idea how close HPMOR is to finishing, or how many times it has been extended, or how likely Eliezer is to write other fiction post-HPMOR. If you really can't answer the question as written, choose the last option and leave a comment explaining why.

1350386645.0,21,self.HPMOR,11kcwj,"Something just struck me in Chapter 84 WRT the Prophecy (spoilers thru 84, rampant speculation)",24,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/11kcwj/something_just_struck_me_in_chapter_84_wrt_the/,"""My dear,"" said Dumbledore, ""had you not pledged yourself to the House of Potter, Harry would have attacked Azkaban singlehandedly, and quite possibly won. That boy may choose his words carefully, but I have never yet known him to lie; and **in the Boy-Who-Lived there is power that the Dark Lord never knew**."" [emphasis mine]

Re-reading this today - essentially a re-statement of part of the prophecy - I'm struck by another interpretation of the line, which makes sense given what we know so far.

* Probable: Harry's Mysterious Dark Side is a piece of Voldemort.

* Known: Harry has had a better childhood than was expected and a *much* better childhood than Tom Riddle did - hence, empathy, compassion, the ability to cast Patronus 2.0, etc.

So, I look back at the line -

""power the Dark Lord knows not"" 

and Dumbledore's rephrasing of it, which may or may not be suggestive on Dumbledore's part, but I can't imagine the author chose the words less than carefully--

""power the Dark Lord never knew""

Contemplate the meanings of the word *know*. Power the Dark Lord doesn't understand? Power the Dark Lord doesn't possess? Power the Dark Lord is not familiar with, or is incapable of?

""Never knew"", the past tense, makes me think about missed opportunities to know love and compassion. Present-tense Harry carries with him a piece of Voldemort that is beginning to know these things. That is beginning to *change*.

Witness in Ch. 56: 

""*It's all right,* thought Harry, *it's all right.*

Visualizing himself cradling his dark side like a frightened child in his arms.

*It's right and proper to be horrified, because death is horrible. You don't have to hide your horror, you don't have to feel ashamed of it, you can wear it as a badge of honor, openly in the Sun.*

It was strange, to feel himself split in two like this, the track of his thoughts that gave the comfort, the track of his thoughts that followed his dark side's incomprehension at the alienness of the ordinary Harry's thoughts; of all the things that his dark side associated with its own fear of death, the one thing it had never expected or imagined that it might find, was acceptance and praise and help...

*You don't have to fight alone*, Harry said silently to his dark side."" 

And the outcome:

""*Take my hand*, Harry thought and visualized, *come with me, and we will do this thing together...*

There was a lurch in Harry's mind, like his brain had taken one step to the left, or the universe had taken one step to the right.

And in a brightly lit corridor in Azkaban, the dim gas lights far outshone by the steady and unwavering light of a human-shaped Patronus, an invisible boy stood with a strange small smile on his face, shaking only slightly.

Harry knew, somehow, that he'd just done something significant, something that went beyond just strengthening his resistance to Dementors.""

So, then we turn to the final part of the prophecy. 
""AND EITHER MUST DESTROY ALL BUT A REMNANT OF THE OTHER,
FOR THOSE TWO DIFFERENT SPIRITS CANNOT EXIST IN THE SAME WORLD.""

Which two different spirits, then? 
Harry and the original Voldemort?
Harry and his Mysterious Dark Side?
Or, the original Voldemort and Harry's Mysterious Dark Side?

This last option seems to make the most sense to me, because if Voldemort were to, as it were, ""merge in"" the backup from Harry, the viewpoints of one part or the other would be DRASTICALLY altered. That ""power the Dark Lord never knew"" would change the Dark Lord simply by virtue of his knowing it.

I was surprised to learn that a lot of people came away from TSPE believing in Harry's initial hypothesis, that Dementors had no minds of their own and were controlled by the expectations of the people nearest them. To me, this seemed conclusively disproved by something Harry isn't aware of: the fact that the dozen Dementors he scared away went back to their hundred-plus brethren in the central pit and thereafter all of them refused to tell the Aurors where Harry was, despite the fact that there were quite a lot of Aurors believing very strongly that they would.

Another part of the theory- that Dementors can't really talk or think- is contraindicated by the bit at the beginning of TSPE where the alarm is raised by a Dementor telling the Aurors something they didn't already know (and were greatly surprised by). 

Several times in TSPE and Taboo Tradeoffs Harry does some mental gymnastics by attempting to manipulate his own expectations and projecting ""silver emotion"", but this is never shown to have any effect *unless* it accompanies something that would cause independent-mentors to react (saying ""stop"", credibly threatening them, saying ""boo""). 

If there's something I'm missing that rescues this hypothesis, I'd appreciate it being pointed out. At this point, I have to believe that whatever ritual (or possibly ""law of magic"", if we believe Harry) creates Dementors also imbues them with at least some independent decision-making ability, and that they have goals which include 'continuing to exist'.",,False,self,t5_2t5xf,False,,dragon,True,t3_z11iy,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/z11iy/on_the_nature_of_dementors_spoilers_up_to_ch81/,

Lucius Malfoy is all he's claimed to be, blood purist, born killer, evil with a capital 'E', etc... except for him being a Death Eater. 

What Lucius told Neville is almost entirely true, Lucius refused to join, likely because he quite clearly does not favor the wands blazing approach to politics, was put under the Imperius and, after the presumed demise of Voldemort he exploited his former position to unite the former Death Eaters under new, more subtle, leadership. He has to pretend, not to the general public, but to the loyal Death Eaters.

This would explain Lucius interactions with (who he thinks is) Pottermort. He is not a loyal servant, more resentful if anything. Lucius believes to be more or less the equal of Pottermort (one presumes he used the 11 years to hone his own magical abilities and we indeed don't know how powerful he is) with his political influence giving him the upper hand. Of course that still means Pottermort is very dangerous, so Lucius is willing to let him play whatever game he wants as long as it does not sacrifice Draco and, the unspoken assumption, is that since he has not called on his Death Eaters, that his current game does not interfere with Lucius' one too much.

When Prof. McGonagall turned into a cat in Chapter Two, Harry wigged out:

Faster than light signaling. Ohhhh boy. Who can blame Voldemort for thinking the Pioneer plaque, presently ten billion miles or almost 15 light-hours from Earth, would be safe for at least as long as it took for humans to construct some awfully advanced spaceships? But Harry has already started wondering:
&gt;Had anyone even measured the speed of a portkey, or a phoenix? 

ALL horcruxes are under threat if he can find them. And I think he can. This will give him a tremendous bargaining chip with Voldemort.

Also, the prophecy says ""the two spirits cannot exist in this world,"" or words to that effect. This could be solved by somebody leaving Earth? Prediction: Harry reads Watchmen, burns a hydrogen atom into his forehead.

Also: Harry's sleeping problem is a CLUE.

Quirrell's zombie problem is a CLUE.

From chapter 15:

There would be no visible changes to your body afterwards, and for the first minute, you would notice nothing wrong. But in an hour you would be sick, and in a day you would be dead.""

While Hermione is not living, minor changes could still be bad for resurrection. Part of the brain shifting by a few millimeters would be catastrophic for brain function.

So what are some theories of what happened to Hermione's body that don't involve it being transfigured? Off the top of my head I have:

1. Harry snuck it out by leviosa-ing it under his invisibility cloak. (Unlikely)

Conventional knowledge tells us that getting to and dealing with the pioneer plaque is a pipe dream, and can most likely be ignored. The only way of travel currently known that could have realistically dealt with such enormous distances is through using a phoenix, and after the events in chapter 85, that road appears blocked to Harry. In effect, Voldemort has a horcrux that can not be dealt with.

Considering this, it appears the correct answer to the horcruxes is to not attempt to deal with them, but instead deal with the user.

&gt;During his reading, Harry
had discovered with considerable horror that some books claimed the
Dementor’s Kiss would eat your soul and that this was the reason for
the permanent mindless coma into which it put the victims. And that
wizards who believed this had deliberately used the Dementor’s Kiss to
execute criminals. It was a certainty that some called criminals were innocent, and even if they weren’t, destroying their souls?

-Chapter 43

While most knowledge known to most wizards appear to be in error, this seems like a possible way to sidestep the issue of horcruxes. If someone has split their soul into 8 pieces, why bother hunting them down to be destroyed when you can simply have a dementor eat them?

Possible issues: Are the separate pieces of soul destroyed when one is eaten? If not, this requires having a dementor eat Voldemort 8 times. It also doesn't deal with the Harrycrux unless a dementor can kiss a specific portion of a soul, and Harry isn't particularly liable to test that.

* Before Harry stopped to consider if he should actually tell anyone about Patronus 2.0, he explained it as his absolute rejection as death as the natural order of things

* During TSPE, near the beginning the Defense Professor complains of noticing the Dementors effects too early, and Harry tells him to use an image of the stars set in the void as an occulmency barrier

Considering Harry's reactions after point 1, it is likely that Quirell would deduce that Patronus 2.0 is, in fact, partially derived by the caster's natural rejection of death.

Since Patronus 2.0 destroyed a Dementor, it is possible that Quirell could then proceed to deduce that Dementors are not fear, but instead death.

From Harry's reaction to the Dementor before Patronus 2.0, Quirell believes that Harry is especially sensitive to Dementors for some reason. At point 2, Harry and Quirell are around the same distance from the Dementor, but Harry does not feel the effect at all. The only difference that Quirell can notice here is the image Harry gives him to use as an Occulmency barrier, and it is therefore probable that this is a part of the thought that would let Harry cast Patronus 2.0.

We, as the readers, know that Harry uses his rejection of Death and the realization that Dementors are Death to be able to cast Patronus 2.0, and that the source of Patronus 2.0 comes from Harry's (for lack of a better word) soul. Quirell
 has the information that Harry rejects Death as the natural order, what Harry uses as a large part of his thought to cast Patronus 2.0, and his own deductive reasoning skills. It feels plausible that Quirell may have all of the knowledge
 to cast Patronus 2.0, since he has had almost the entire spell explained to him by Harry.

The two issues I'm having with this theory are that Quirell would have to be quite impressive in his deductions to be able to figure this out, and that he may still be lacking the moral capability/soul neccesary to cast Patronus 2.0. Quirell
 still seems severely affected by the Dementors towards the end of TSPE, around when he wakes up when they are ready to escape. Quirell also may simply be unable to cast it due to Horcruxing his soul to pieces.

The only other major use that this theory has if Quirell has the knowledge of Patronus 2.0, but not the ability to cast it would be to weaponize Dementors/keep others from being able to cast Patronus 1.0(blatantly stolen from Harry's darkside).

The topic will be Dumbledore's sanity or lack thereof. **Probable spoilers up to the most recent chapter.**

I'm not sure what I think yet even, so I won't make any final conclusions, but I will point out a couple things.

* Dumbledore certainly shows obvious moments of lucidity, such as discussions with Snape about time turners and who could have broken into Azkaban, discussions with Moody in the most recent chapters, etc.

* The majority of ""crazier"" things from Dumbledore are far closer to just a practical joke rather than any sort of serious insanity. Examples include the flaming chicken being just a chicken.

* His closer companions (Minerva, Snape, Moody) all seem to have a certain trust and reverence for him. This can be attributed to Dumbledore's skill outweighing any insanity he may have, or they just know he is a practical joker.

* He does believe in a sort of ""story book"" logic/lifestyle to a degree. Having a cruel potionmaster (possibly just a front for deatheaters though) having the potions class in the dungeon, etc. More if I could remember them off the top of my head.

* Counter point to the above, he does reject some story tropes, citing Gandalf should have taken the ring and frodo to rivendell immediately rather than risk it.

* As Quirrel has said, Dumbledore could be an insane man putting on the front of a sane man being insane.

*As I've realized, the first question/statement to any response should be a statement of what it means to be insane in this context.*",,False,self,t5_2t5xf,1368662049.0,,,True,t3_1eer9y,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1eer9y/is_dumbledore_sane_or_insane/,

In short - what you see before the time travel is the same as what you see after the time travel, even though what happened before the time travel is caused by the time travel itself.

The primary assumption is that the A-Theory of time is wrong (ie: there is no special ""present"") and that present Effects can have Causes in the *future* (as opposed to what we normally experience - all present Effects have had Causes in the *past*).

Chapter 91 is great, but one particular line rubs me so wrong that I can't stop obsessing over it, even though it's been weeks.
&gt; Maybe a basic guideline of working with time-travel was to make sure you never risked learning you were too late, if you hadn't yet gone backwards

Harry is showing a lack of knowledge here that we already know he has, and it's frustrating. Back in Chapter 14:
&gt; SO THAT'S HOW THE COMED-TEA WORKS! [...] IT ALL MAKES SENSE ONCE YOU DRAW THE CAUSAL ARROWS GOING BACKWARDS IN TIME! 

He already knows that future causes can have present effects. Since we see the present before we see the future, seeing how the present unfolded is good evidence that it has already been affected by the future as much as is possible. [As per Bill &amp; Ted](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgAidW5YOXc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=5m45s) - finding your dad's keys behind the sign is proof that you will later remember to go back in time, steal them, and hide them behind the sign. Likewise, seeing Hermione die is proof that after all interventions from the future her death was the final result.

By saying that perhaps he could change what happens by restricting his observations, Harry is making the original Heisenberg Collapse Error all over again. If Harry were to prevent himself from finding out what happened to Hermione all that would change is *his state of knowledge*. NOT the actions happening in the future, nor the actions happening in the present. Closing your eyes changes nothing outside of your own mind.

Tinfoil: offscreen h&amp;c has directed Hermione towards books describing the horcrux creation ritual.

Tinfoil redux: h&amp;c is the way Hermione perceives the possession of the diary. In this manner, the major canon plot point of diary possession is kept intact. Hermione perceives it as h&amp;c presenting guidance. H&amp;c illusion changes appearance in order to better manipulate her. 

My followup to this train of thought is what does volde-diary have to gain by teaching Hermione how to create a horcrux?",,False,self,t5_2t5xf,False,,,True,t3_1hk25v,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hk25v/how_did_she_spoilers_8890/,

Maybe it was all an elaborate death plot by the person who tried to frame her the first time, but in canon it was just a decoy. A way of distraction so Quirrell could get to the third floor. 

It has been said that the philosopher's stone is in the castle and we could assume that the third floor is still where it is being held. (Wonder why Harry never went and explored even after Dumbledore told him to use Alohamora on the door? But that is another discussion)

When we learn of the troll there is a lot of confusion going on throughout the great hall and it is all chaotic, but we get a lot from McGonagalls view...

&gt;Of course, Minerva thought, the third-floor corridor - this could be a distraction -

&gt;She mentally consigned all such matters to Severus's care, drew her wand, raised it high, and let out five sharp cracks of purple fire.

So we know McGonagall thinks of Snape going and taking care of the third floor. But it is never actually said that he leaves or heads that way. McGonagall makes Sybill go with Quirrell, I am guessing because she expects him to go to the third floor and doesn't leave him alone. BUT again she left it to Snape to go to the third, and we never hear of him actually leaving or getting orders to go. So is this what he is actually doing? We have not gotten his account yet! If so who is he trying to protect it from since Quirrell is already occupied, who is trying to get into the third floor? Or was it all just a plot to kill Hermione?

So what exactly is Snape doing while all of this is going on?

1372688172.0,18,self.HPMOR,1hfd4y,Restriction on the Time-turner [spoilers chapter 89],21,3,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hfd4y/restriction_on_the_timeturner_spoilers_chapter_89/,"If you care about spoilers, read the new chapters, chapter 88 and 89, posted June 30th 2013, before reading this thread please.

In some of the discussions about the latest chapter I have read a suggestion that Harry might be unable to undo the big tragedy because a smart villain would have blocked the use of time-turners by first going back six hours.

As far as I know, that is not how those restrictions work. From Chapter 61:
&gt;""(...) Now, Amelia, I beg you, if you have learned anything whatsoever upon this matter, please share it.""
There was another pause, and then Madam Bones's voice said, ""I have information which I learned four hours into the future, Albus. Do you still want it?""
Albus paused -
(weighing, Minerva knew, the possibility that he might want to go back more than two hours from this instant; for you couldn't send information further back in time than six hours, not through any chain of Time-Turners)
- and finally said, ""Yes, please.""
""We had a lucky break,"" said Madam Bones's voice, ""one of the Aurors who witnessed the escape was a Muggleborn, and she told us that the Flying-Fire spell, as we were calling it, might be no spell at all, but a Muggle artifact.""

It is not enough for somebody else to have knowledge of the future. It is not enough to have knowledge in a meta sense, that is, that you know somebody else has knowledge of four hours in the future. Being blocked from going into the past is a personal matter and is based on concrete information.

If we look at the kind of information that blocks Dumbledore in chapter 61, it appears that 4 hours from that point a witness was heard and a report was sent back. At the time that Bones speaks, that information was present in the witness' mind, it just had not been recorded yet and sent back.

So, keeping all this in mind, what are potential pieces of information that somebody intentionally sent back from the future six hours in order to prevent the use of the Time-turner?

For me, the most likely suspect would be:
&gt; ""Troll -"" gasped Mr. Filch. ""In the dungeons -""
Argus Filch staggered forward from the huge doors, his upper body streaked and dotted with small crimson dots as though someone had spattered steak sauce over his face. ""Troll - grey - twice as tall as me - it - it -"" Argus Filch covered his face with his hands. ""It ate Mrs. Norris - ate her all up, in just one bite -""

This could potentially be information from the future. Six hours from that point, the bad guy made a troll eat Mrs. Norris and got rid of the troll. He or she then goes back in time and either false-memory charms Filch, or polyjuices into him. That way everybody who knows about the troll, is also blocked from using a time-turner.

The only thing, I think, that Quirrell has said that could be considered information from the future, if his warning that 'home does not mean safe' is not meant generally, is this:
&gt; ""Adequate, for being put on the spot,"" the Defense Professor said. ""Twenty Quirrell points to you. But you neglect the still simpler point that home does not mean safe, and a troll is strong enough to rip a portrait door off its hinges -""

But the price you pay is ultimately greater; the moment a phoenix hears your call, you have already lost more than you could gain. Allow me to explain, by listing the options:


1. You charge in and you die. The price is death.
2. You do not accept the challenge. You are acutely aware that you have given up on the ability to be purely on the side of light for life. You will never have a phoenix at your side, and have only yourself to blame.
3. You are victorious, and now have a phoenix. You are now a true hero of good; but you are a reflection of the phoenix. You have went against all odds and won, and will try it again and again until it fails you. And you will hear the call of the phoenix again and again.

Dumbledore had nearly lost the war, and had to send his own brother to his death and see him tortured to death because he could not make the rational choice, because Voldemort escalated in pushing his weakness, caused from the third option.

In this case, Dumbledore has already forced Harry to choose the second option by showing him his memories. He forced Harry to accept that his mother had been wrong in not giving him up, though it was not said in those words. He took away the last bastion of good and evil Harry had before the phoenix's choice was made. My understanding is that when Harry said ""Human beings can't live like that."" he had already known it was a lie.

When the phoenix arrived to attack Azkaban, Harry knew he made the right choice *because he was not a good person*. Not his dark side, he himself. Not like his mother was. Not like pre-Voldemort Dumbledore was. Prior to this, he had rationalized it to himself. He knew story-book heroes were stupid and wrong in the way they did things. But that is on intellectual level.

Albus then came out and told him that was his one chance. That Harry would never be the type of hero he had wanted to be. That knowledge broke a previous student (unnamed). Trying to cheer Harry up, he gave the example of Godric Gryffindor, though to a rationalist, that makes things worse (Godric had done good because of guilt / shame, had learned humility and failure, etc).

Harry immediately felt the implication. He did not understand it on an emotional level prior. Prior, he rationalized it (for Dumbledore), now he was forced to internalize it. Now, in chapters 86-87, Harry seems to have moved on *immediately* since then. That seems cold, not just rational. He moved from ""Human beings can't live like that"" to ""well, I can"" in under a day.

&gt;The text contains many clues: obvious clues, not-so-obvious clues, truly obscure hints which I was shocked to see some readers successfully decode, and massive evidence left out in plain sight. This is a rationalist story; its mysteries are solvable, and meant to be solved.

&gt;The pacing of the story is that of serial fiction, i.e., that of a TV show running for a predetermined number of seasons, whose episodes are individually plotted but with an overall arc building to a final conclusion.

&gt;The story has been corrected to British English up to Ch. 17, and further Britpicking is currently in progress (see the /HPMOR subreddit).

&gt;All science mentioned is real science. But please keep in mind that, beyond the realm of science, the views of the characters may not be those of the author. Not everything the protagonist does is a lesson in wisdom, and advice offered by darker characters may be untrustworthy or dangerously double-edged.

He's only appeared twice, and very fleetingly, so we don't know much about him. However, I have yet to see this theory anywhere else, so I want to call it. Let's start with what we DO know about Mr. Hat and Cloak:

We know that he is a mysterious individual who works behind the scenes. He seems to observe more than he acts. The main supports for this statement are that we have only seen him act twice (to our knowledge), and that he knows every layer of every plot and secret going on in Hogwarts (although we only have his word on that matter). 

We also know that he is very handy with Memory Charms. Every time he has appeared so far, he has erased that encounter from the spectator's memory. He did it apparently multiple times to Hermione. Thus far, those Memory spells, and whatever spell changed his appearance in his encounter with Hermione, are the only spells he's been seen to use.

Finally, we know that whoever he is, it's someone whom Hermione recognizes. In the brief moment in between memory charms, we are told, ""She (Hermione) saw the face beneath, and recognition sent a jolt of terrified adrenaline bursting through her."" So whoever Mr. Hat and Cloak is, we know that it is somebody whose face Hermione would have recognized during her first year of Hogwarts. That could be any of the main characters, but there is another option...

We can rule out Quirrel, Dumbledore, Blaise Zabini, and Hermione. Quirrel and Dumbledore because they were the ones H&amp;C was setting against each other, and we can rule out Blaise and Hermione because they encountered him. There is one character from the original series, who was noted as being exceptionally talented at Memory charms. Somebody who was generally not a man of action. And most importantly, somebody whom Hermione would have recognized.

For those of you who haven't pieced it out, that person was Gilderoy Lockhart.

Now, I know it seems somewhat absurd. Gilderoy certainly wasn't known for being an evil puppet-master genius in the original series, but then again, neither was Quirrel. This would also make it understandable as to why he conceals his face, when he intends to memory-wipe the people he meets anyway. He also was known for having a flair for the dramatic, and if a big, black, billowing cloak, a broad brimmed hat, and black mist doesn't qualify as ""unnecessarily dramatic"", then I don't know what does.

Like I said, I may not have enough evidence to justify this claim, but I do think that it is certainly possible, and maybe even likely. I just want to call this theory so that if it does wind up being true, I can have my moment of triumph.

So, in HPMOR universe you can make a thing that casts a spell.

Magic without a magician.

The ""one-time"" remark suggests that it's possible to make multiple-use ones. Now, is it possible to make a device that would cast a spell any amount of times?

If yes, there is your Godhood.

Pick a sufficiently orthogonal set of simple, easy first year spells, make a device with each of them, link the devices with some sort of a computer (organizing spell?), program the computer to trigger the devices in such a way as to get an arbitrary spell effect out of the sequences of simple ones, take over the world.

Point against #1 - doing so would mean ripping off a well known book by Rick Cook.

Point against #2 - it's very likely that a charmed device would produce exactly as much power as you put into it. Not a show-stopper since you could accumulate the amount of uses over time, but severely limits the capability.

However, what if the human sacrifice needed for the horcrux creation could be a self-sacrifice? You would accept to die in order to save your own soul (or consciousness, brain state, etc.) for later. Then, the usual devices could be used to come back to life (unicorn blood, philosopher's stone, bone-flesh-blood ritual...).

Maybe the horcrux spell cannot currently work that way, but it looks like all the building blocks are there. It could also be something that someone else can to for you: kill you to make a horcrux of you, not them. Or, you could kill your time-turned, future self.

So, maybe Hermione did it to herself, and was not actually killed by the troll? The ""soul explosion"" explosion we witnessed could have been the horcrux creation. If the ritual was performed by the defence professor on behalf or Hermione, that would explain why the wards recorded he was the killer.

I would assign a low probability to the last paragraph, because I don't see a way Hermione would have had the time to prepare for that and acquire the necessary knowledge.

Her voice sounded dull in her own ears. ""That was private.""
&gt;
&gt;Albus flickered his fingers at the door behind her. ""I was afraid Mr. Potter might do you some harm.""

Albus believed that Harry might harm Minerva. Why? Recall in chapter 82:

&gt;""Is Minerva's life also of infinite worth?"" the old wizard said harshly. ""Would you sacrifice Minerva to save Hermione?""
&gt;
&gt;""Yes and yes,"" Harry snapped. ""That's part of Professor McGonagall's job and she knows it.""

This indicates that Albus Dumbledore, at least, believes that Harry may be willing to murder McGonagall in exchange for fooling Time into believing that it was she, not Hermione, who died before that troll. This in turn implies that Dumbledore believes that Harry will at least perceive the possibility to exchange another's life for Hermione's (since Dumbledore already received the information that a student has died at Hogwarts and cannot be altered) to be feasible enough to possibly attempt it.

I believe this gives credence to some of the theories floating around that this in fact will happen, or at least an attempt in the direction will be made. Dumbledore does claim that he lost another friend attempting to fool Time similarly, and perhaps this will only lead to a double tragedy. Besides, with all those mega hints about Time that Yudkowski's been dropping in recent chapters (not to mention the blatantly obvious unlocking of the protective shell and the more subtle implications of Harry memory charming the Weasley twins, quite probably with their consent) there's no way we won't see a twisted adventure through time in the coming chapters, successful or not.

Lesath Lestrage's name is also tossed around frequently. I think given the choice, Harry would do it, honestly.

On a lighter note, Quirrell asks a curiously revealing question:

&gt;""What of the Resurrection Stone of Cadmus Peverell, if it could be obtained for you?""

Recall that in canon the Gaunt ring is not only in possession of Voldemort, but is a horcrux. And then there's this bombshell:

&gt;""When a certain ancient device in my possession informed me that Miss Granger was on the verge of death""

Of course, as some people seem to believe, Quirrell could just be lying to cover up Harry's emotional feed. But why ancient? Why not just say a device, or a protective ward he placed on her?

Conclusions:

 One. A student will be murdered to deceive Harry and co. into believing Hermione has been killed by the troll, when in fact she has been safely hidden away before the troll announcement was ever made by Filch. No predictions on the success of this effort.

Additional possible maybe support:

Also, if I need to add spoiler tags within this post please let me know. I usually just lurk here, not used to posting.

I have a theory regarding a combination of the importance of Harry's patronus and some of the advice which Quirrel gave Harry in Chapter 90. 


We should consider a couple of facts in sequence first. 

We are aware that someone has infiltrated Hogwarts and been casting obliviations and false memory charms to great effect. More importantly, this person has gone unnoticed by Hogwarts's security systems, directly implying these acts were performed by a student or by someone with enough knowledge and magical oomph to circumvent these securities. As of Chapter 90, we know that Quirrel is directing Harry to begin to learn how to cast obliviations and false memory charms, and just as importantly, he is simultaneously steering Harry away from other magical means. I think Quirrel has noticed something which we have not: Harry has been the one doing the obliviating and false memory charmings throughout the story with the aid of time travel which is unconventional even within the wizarding world.

The second thing to consider is the unexplored potential of Harry's patronus. We have seen in the story that Harry is able to not only ask questions and receive information from it, but also that the patronus can travel ridiculously quickly in order to obtain this information. I believe that his patronus is either capable of transporting Harry arbitrarily through spacetime or that his patronus can carry itself through spacetime and cast spells on Harry's behalf. If either of these mechanics evolve to be possible, Harry/patronus!Harry can be responsible for the memory magics we have seen throughout the story. 


But neither of those points are the crux of this tinfoil hat theory. I believe that the whole underlying point here is that Quirrel has concluded based upon information he has experienced that Harry will at some point discover how to semi-arbitrarily travel through time and Quirrel is attempting to steer Harry towards discovering that a combination of his already invented patronus and accessible memory magic are tools enough to undo Hermione's death and that Harry otherwise discovering/inventing another means to circumvent her death causes the timeline we have seen to become an unstable time loop and consequently destroyed. This is why Harry's patronus shattered. Harry's resolution to resort to other means made it unstable.

In this case isn't it still possible to get Harry to tell the truth using the Imperius curse? Using the curse allows you to control any person at will so and if Harry was controlled isn't it possible to get Harry to tell anybody everything? I know people can break free of the curse through sheer will but what about cases where he willing allows himself to be cursed.

So much gold in this chapter, I just wanted to share:

http://hpmor.com/chapter/39

---

""Death is bad,"" said Harry, discarding wisdom for the sake of clear communication. ""Very bad. Extremely bad. Being scared of death is like being scared of a great big monster with poisonous fangs. It actually makes a great deal of sense, and does not, in fact, indicate that you have a psychological problem.""

The Headmaster was staring at him as though he'd just turned into a cat.

""Okay,"" said Harry, ""let me put it this way. Do you want to die? Because if so, there's this Muggle thing called a suicide prevention hotline -""

---

""Do you want to live forever, Harry?""

""Yes, and so do you,"" said Harry. ""I want to live one more day. Tomorrow I will still want to live one more day. Therefore I want to live forever, proof by induction on the positive integers. If you don't want to die, it means you want to live forever. If you don't want to live forever, it means you want to die. You've got to do one or the other... I'm not getting through here, am I.""

---

""What would you do with eternity, Harry?""

Harry took a deep breath. ""Meet all the interesting people in the world, read all the good books and then write something even better, celebrate my first grandchild's tenth birthday party on the Moon, celebrate my first great-great-great grandchild's hundredth birthday party around the Rings of Saturn, learn the deepest and final rules of Nature, understand the nature of consciousness, find out why anything exists in the first place, visit other stars, discover aliens, create aliens, rendezvous with everyone for a party on the other side of the Milky Way once we've explored the whole thing, meet up with everyone else who was born on Old Earth to watch the Sun finally go out, and I used to worry about finding a way to escape this universe before it ran out of negentropy but I'm a lot more hopeful now that I've discovered the so-called laws of physics are just optional guidelines.""

...

""Life is not a finite list of things that you check off before you're allowed to die,"" Harry said firmly. ""It's life, you just go on living it. If I'm not doing those things it'll be because I've found something better.""

---

""...two hundred years would be entirely too much of a good thing.""

""Yes, well,"" Harry said, his voice a little dry as he thought of his Mum and Dad and their allotted span if Harry didn't do something about it, ""I suspect, Headmaster, that if you came from a culture where people were accustomed to living four hundred years, that dying at two hundred would seem just as tragically premature as dying at, say, eighty."" Harry's voice went hard, on that last word.

---

""All right,"" Harry said, trying to keep his voice calm, ""I'll hear out your evidence, because that's what a scientist does. But first, Headmaster, let me tell you a little story."" Harry's voice was trembling. ""You know, when I got here, when I got off the train from King's Cross, I don't mean yesterday but back in September, when I got off the train then, Headmaster, I'd never seen a ghost. I wasn't expecting ghosts. So when I saw them, Headmaster, I did something really dumb. I jumped to conclusions. I, I thought there was an afterlife, I thought no one had ever really died, I thought that everyone the human species had ever lost was really fine after all, I thought that wizards could talk to people who'd passed on, that it just took the right spell to summon them, that wizards could do that, I thought I could meet my parents who died for me, and tell them that I'd heard about their sacrifice and that I'd begun to call them my mother and father -""

""Harry,"" whispered Dumbledore. Water glittered in the old wizard's eyes. He took a step closer across the office -

""And then,"" spat Harry, the fury coming fully into his voice, the cold rage at the universe for being like that and at himself for being so stupid, ""I asked Hermione and she said that they were just afterimages, burned into the stone of the castle by the death of a wizard, like the silhouettes left on the walls of Hiroshima. And I should have known! I should have known without even having to ask! I shouldn't have believed it even for all of thirty seconds! Because if people had souls there wouldn't be any such thing as brain damage, if your soul could go on speaking after your whole brain was gone, how could damage to the left cerebral hemisphere take away your ability to talk? And Professor McGonagall, when she told me about how my parents had died, she didn't act like they'd just gone away on a long trip to another country, like they'd emigrated to Australia back in the days of sailing ships, which is the way people would act if they actually knew that death was just going somewhere else, if they had hard evidence for an afterlife, instead of making stuff up to console themselves, it would change everything, it wouldn't matter that everyone had lost someone in the war, it would be a little sad but not horrible! And I'd already seen that people in the wizarding world didn't act like that! So I should have known better! And that was when I knew that my parents were really dead and gone forever and ever, that there wasn't anything left of them, that I'd never get a chance to meet them and, and, and the other children thought I was crying because I was scared of ghosts -""

The old wizard's face was horrified, he opened his mouth to speak -

""So tell me, Headmaster! Tell me about the evidence! But don't you dare exaggerate a single tiny bit of it, because if you give me false hope again, and I find out later that you lied or stretched things just a little, I won't ever forgive you for it! What's the Veil? ""

---

""You are not fooling me, Harry,"" said the old wizard; his face looked ancient now, and lined by more than years. ""I know why you are truly asking that question. No, I do not read your mind, I do not have to, your hesitation gives you away! You seek the secret of the Dark Lord's immortality in order to use it for yourself!""

""Wrong! I want the secret of the Dark Lord's immortality in order to use it for everyone! ""

---

""Well obviously I'm not going to popularize a method of immortality that requires killing people! That would defeat the entire point! ""

There was a startled pause.

Slowly the old wizard's face relaxed out of its anger, though the worry was still there. ""You would use no ritual requiring human sacrifice.""

""I don't know what you take me for, Headmaster,"" Harry said coldly, his own anger rising, ""but let's not forget that I'm the one who wants people to live! The one who wants to save everyone! You're the one who thinks death is awesome and everyone ought to die!""

""I am at a loss, Harry,"" said the old wizard. His feet once more began trudging across his strange office. ""I know not what to say."" He picked up a crystal ball that seemed to hold a hand in flames, looked into it with a sad expression. ""Only that I am greatly misunderstood by you... I don't want everyone to die, Harry!""

""You just don't want anyone to be immortal,"" Harry said with considerable irony. It seemed that elementary logical tautologies like All x: Die(x) = Not Exist x: Not Die(x) were beyond the reasoning abilities of the world's most powerful wizard.

---

The old wizard's face was peaceful. ""I am not perfect, Harry, but I think I have accepted my death as part of myself.""

""Uh huh,"" Harry said. ""See, there's this little thing called cognitive dissonance, or in plainer English, sour grapes. If people were hit on the heads with truncheons once a month, and no one could do anything about it, pretty soon there'd be all sorts of philosophers, pretending to be wise as you put it, who found all sorts of amazing benefits to being hit on the head with a truncheon once a month. Like, it makes you tougher, or it makes you happier on the days when you're not getting hit with a truncheon. But if you went up to someone who wasn't getting hit, and you asked them if they wanted to start, in exchange for those amazing benefits, they'd say no. And if you didn't have to die, if you came from somewhere that no one had ever even heard of death, and I suggested to you that it would be an amazing wonderful great idea for people to get wrinkled and old and eventually cease to exist, why, you'd have me hauled right off to a lunatic asylum! So why would anyone possibly think any thought so silly as that death is a good thing? Because you're afraid of it, because you don't really want to die, and that thought hurts so much inside you that you have to rationalize it away, do something to numb the pain, so you won't have to think about it -""

---

""Do you want to understand the Dark Wizard?"" Harry said, his voice now hard and grim. ""Then look within the part of yourself that flees not from death but from the fear of death, that finds that fear so unbearable that it will embrace Death as a friend and cozen up to it, try to become one with the night so that it can think itself master of the abyss. You have taken the most terrible of all evils and called it good! With only a slight twist that same part of yourself would murder innocents, and call it friendship. If you can call death better than life then you can twist your moral compass to point anywhere -""

---

""Funny thing, you know, I thought Draco Malfoy was going to be this impossible to talk to, and instead, in his childish innocence, he was a hundred times stronger than you.""

A look of puzzlement crossed the old wizard's face. ""What do you mean?""

""I mean,"" Harry said, his voice biting, ""that Draco actually took his own beliefs seriously and processed my words instead of throwing them out the window by smiling with gentle superiority. You're so old and wise, you can't even notice anything I'm saying! Not understand, notice! ""

""I have listened to you, Harry,"" said Dumbledore, looking more solemn now, ""but to listen is not always to agree. Disagreements aside, what is it that you think I do not comprehend?""

That if you really believed in an afterlife, you'd go down to St. Mungo's and kill Neville's parents, Alice and Frank Longbottom, so they could go on to their next great adventure, instead of letting them linger here in their damaged state -

---

""I'll answer your original question, then. You asked why Dark Wizards are afraid of death. Pretend, Headmaster, that you really believed in souls. Pretend that anyone could verify the existence of souls at any time, pretend that nobody cried at funerals because they knew their loved ones were still alive. Now can you imagine destroying a soul? Ripping it to shreds so that nothing remains to go on its next great adventure? Can you imagine what a terrible thing that would be, the worst crime that had ever been committed in the history of the universe, which you would do anything to prevent from happening even once? Because that's what Death really is - the annihilation of a soul!""

---

""There is no justice in the laws of Nature, Headmaster, no term for fairness in the equations of motion. The universe is neither evil, nor good, it simply does not care. The stars don't care, or the Sun, or the sky. But they don't have to! We care!

[Revised Ch. 85],21,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/15qvne/what_are_we_now_supposed_to_think_really_caused/,"So when Chapter 85 was first posted, we all speculated that the seer freakout was due to Harry making an Ominous Resolution that he didn't realize was ominous. Supporting evidence was the fact that Trelawney's earlier aftermath vignette came right after Harry made a similar internal decision.

Now, with the new Chapter 85, that decision is out the window and replaced with the phoenix bit. But the seer premonitions were left untouched.

So, here are the possibilities I can think of:

1. Since the phoenix bit was the original intended ending, the premonitions were always supposed to be due to Harry turning down his phoenix.
2. The premonitions never had much to do with what Harry did on the Ravenclaw tower and were simply due to some horrible upcoming event.
3. Harry sending his phoenix away and Harry's original Ominous Resolution are somehow equivalent as far as future events are concerned.

I don't really believe (1), because in that case I don't think Eliezer would have decided to go ahead and publish that codetta at the same time as he decided *not* to publish his intended ending.

(2) is certainly possible, and if it's true I feel better about originally being completely oblivious to any logic behind the placement of the seer stingers.

(3) is very interesting, if true. Perhaps both decisions end up with Harry deciding it's okay to kill a bunch of people; like, if he had accepted his phoenix, the phoenix would have yelled at him later on when he decides to test his new Dementor Genocide technique. (**EDIT**: Or, more obviously, if he had accepted his phoenix and gone to Azkaban, there wouldn't have been any Dementors left for him to use in such a way.)

1. If (and this is a big if) Quirrill didn't do it, the only real ""antagonist"" I could think of is Lucius.
2. However, it seems too ~~impossible~~  improbable that Lucius could have possibly arranged for it to happen - unless he somehow snuck into Hogwarts... THEN it hit me! Lucius was at Hogwarts for the forest battle! And the forest battle is the first time Hermione showed signs of being angry and confused.

&gt;""Susan Bones kept throwing worried glances toward the Sunshine General as they marched through the grayly illuminated forest. Professor Snape's going after Hermione seemed to have really shaken her. Hermione had even missed her Sunshine Regiment Official Planning Meeting, which seemed understandable enough; but when Susan had offered her sympathy afterward, Hermione had stammered that she'd lost track of time, which wasn't at all a usual thing for her to say, and the girl had looked exhausted and frightened like she'd just spent three days locked in a bathroom stall with a Dementor. Even now, when all the Sunshine General's focus should've been on the coming battle, the Ravenclaw girl's gaze was constantly darting in all directions, as though she expected Dark Wizards to jump out of the bushes and sacrifice her.""

So basically my only basis for this theory is that Lucius and Co. were at Hogwarts during the forest battle and that gave him access.

I mean what is the probability of parents coming to Hogwarts on the same day that an attempted murder occurs?!
&gt;""Ordinarily it was the ancient tradition of Hogwarts that mere parents were to Stay Out""

I think the whole 'parents coming to Hogwarts' is simply a device for the author to give Lucius access to the school.

Any additional points of interest or improved accuracy will added for further completeness. Thank you.

In 1926, Tom Marvolo Riddle's mother died giving birth to him prior to his eventual abandonment by his muggle father during the mid-1920s and appears to have grown into a troubled youth in the 1930s while living in an orphanage during the Great Depression in 1930 and the Rise of the Third Reich in the 1933 prior to the outset of World War II in 1940.*

Beginning in the 1940s, the European Wizarding Revolution also came to Europe and was spearheaded by Gellert Grindelwald with the intents and purposes of dissolving the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy and toppling the European Ministries of Magic to make way for an International Wizarding Empire, having recieved early support by childhood friend Albus Dumbledore.

This Empire would reign over the entire Wizarding World and enslave Muggle populations for their crimes against wizardkind throughout recorded history, all ""For the Greater Good"".

However, after Grindewald had successfully established his supremacy throughout the rest of Magical Europe Dumbledore refused to concede control of Magical Britain to the Dark Lord and would come to defeat Grindewald in 1945, coinciding with the end of World War II.

During the same time, Tom Marvolo Riddle began attending Hogwarts, opening the Chamber of Secrets in 1943, amassing many devoted followers, and carrying out extensive research into the Dark Arts.**

Throughout the early years of the Cold War, 1950s-60s, Riddle experimented with and reportedly began, ""push[ing] the boundaries of magic further [...] than they had been pushed [before]"" while European nations became divided along the lines of the Iron Curtain.***

In the 1970s, Riddle, now Lord Voldemort, along with his Death Eaters took control of much of Magical Britain and had supporters elsewhere as he attempted to take over the Ministry of Magic while facing opposition by Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix.

However, after receiving intelligence from Snape regarding the Prophecy, Voldemort supposedly died attempting to kill Harry Potter, leaving only a charred corpse and the ruins of a once happy home in his wake as the Reign of the Death Eaters came to an end in 1981.

As strange as this final scenario may seem, I've noted a few possible points of interest, starred below, and would like the input of my fellow Conspirators for further highlighting possible additional points of interest. Thank you. 

* The Nazis have been confirmed to have carried out research into Secrets Weapons from 1930-1942 involving the Occult, psychic research, and early rocketry. This may have relevance to Voldemort and his later researches depending on what they may have discovered and how it relates to the Wizarding Community as a whole.

* Riddle had many different influences while attending Hogwarts and may have learned much about the Muggle and Magical worlds while observing these two conflicts unfold around him. This may explain his obsession with taking over Magical Britain in general as he was likely drawing inspiration from these conflicts early on.

* Throughout his original attendance at Hogwarts it was never stated that Riddle had been adopted nor how his absence at the orphanage was explained while attending. This may imply that Riddle had multiple places of residence while attending Hogwarts, although this may not be the case.

* Given Voldemort's tendency towards Third-Reich-style take over strategies, the Dark Lord was likely aware of advanced exploration technologies during the 1950s and 1960s as he researched the Dark Arts while travelling the world. This may further support the idea that riddle made use of muggle artifacts, such as Sputnik, Challenger and the Pioneer probe while creating horcruxes due to the limitations on apparition capabilities.

* Riddle may also have made use of the conflict between the US and USSR to further himself in a variety of different was.

Similarly, a wide variety of wizards are ignorant of rockets; Draco, Amelia Bones, etc, don't know that muggles have been to the moon.

How could the wizarding community be ignorant of such notable developments that are common knowledge among muggles? Any number of muggleborn students attending Hogwarts would reasonably know about nuclear weapons and the Apollo missions, or would learn about it during their summer breaks. Given how shocking and easily verified this is, why would it not spread throughout the Wizarding community? 

I'd expect that the blood purist community would seize on this knowledge to rally wizards around fear of muggles (e.g. Quirrell's fear that muggles will destroy them all).

I'm having trouble putting it into words. If nobody trusts the police, the police can't do their job. A person reporting a crime can't be ethically obligated to oversee the entire investigation and the entire court process and prison conditions if applicable. All of those would be the consequences of the reporter's actions, but that doesn't make the reporter responsible, because there are other people involved. If you claim all that responsibility for yourself, you're treating all other people involved, including the higher authority figure(s), as just conditional behavior: results and probabilities instead of people.

I feel like I'm making a straw man fallacy here, though not maliciously, because I don't fully understand Harry's position.

* Dumbledore may have engineered for the Weasley twins to summon the hat for inscrutable reasons. I don't really think he's responsible for the troll though.

* It was kind of ineffective vs. the troll. There was some kind of mental shenanigan and it gave him a sword. The magic sounded impressive though, it's probably not totally useless in combat.

* I don't think that's the last we'll see of it. I think and hope Harry's going to speak with it again, despite moral ambiguity with sentience. It was really good at forcing self-introspection. Harry probably took note of Fred's summon.

The other part to shrink would be the bits with Hermione's heroines etc. which seemed to go on for too long without adding much to the story progressing the plot.

He goes so far as to have Amelia say “I shall not name any names” in conversation with Quirrell, which is sufficiently unnatural to make me wonder whether the Noble Hero’s identity is a solvable puzzle we’re supposed to be working on.

The dossier Amelia reads gives us just about everything we know about him:

- Born 1927
- Sorted into Slytherin 1938
- Graduated 1945
- Grandmother was Lady of his House in 1971
- Of “Cadet line” (the blood line of a non-firstborn son of a patriarch)

But then he gives us a very interesting fact:

&gt; “But your House — there are not many Ancient Houses remaining&amp;nbsp;—”
&gt;
&gt; “It shall matter little to this country whether eight Ancient Houses remain, or seven.”

There are only eight Noble and Most Ancient Houses remaining, including the Noble Hero’s. I’m wondering if we know them all. The definite ones I can think of:

- Potter
- Malfoy
- Longbottom
- Greengrass
- Black

Two other candidates I found:

- Jugson (probably)
- Astorga (doubtful)

Chapter 78 mentions an “aristocratic man” named Lord Jugson. I assume that if you’re called “Lord” then you’re of a Noble House.

I mention “Astorga” because of this passage:

&gt; “It is well that you had the good taste to be defeated by a little girl who is a fellow Slytherin of a Noble House, Astorga, or I would deduct points from you myself!”

I’m not sure whether it’s *(fellow Slytherin) of a Noble House* or *fellow (Slytherin of a Noble House)*. “Jaime Astorga” isn’t very Ancient-British-sounding, so this is doubtful.

[In canon there are many other pureblood families][pureblood], and there the distinction between “pureblood” and “Noble and Most Ancient” is not as clear as it is in *Methods*. The Weasleys are pureblood, but it seems most unlikely that they’re Noble and Most Ancient here.

So: Do we know any of the other Noble Houses? Are there any clues from canon that would help us distinguish between Pureblood and Noble in *Methods*? Are there any obscure canon characters who might be candidates?

Thats when he stopped me.

Then I started thinking about the silver, originally I thought it was a spell but the only silver spells mentioned in canon are Expecto Patronum and Rictusempra (a tickling spell), certainly nothing 'dark'. Other magical silver things include patronus projections and memories but neither fit.  

I also found myself confused about the 'blood spill[ing] out in litres' and was starting to believe my original hypothesis of it being Voldie’s apparent downfall was wrong.  

It is entirely possible that the silver glint is completely non-magical, if it was for instance a glint of light on a gun at least that would explain the blood.

The far right column (“Interesting relevant topics”) is intended for such unique materials (books, lectures, public events, etc) that you're sometimes discovering on your way. Such materials either foster a great interest in the mentioned subject or just are too good as an information source, helping you understand the topic almost intuitively. So I thought they deserve their own column in the document.

Crouch Sr. was a rising star in the ministry during the First Wizarding War, as head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. He was a leader in the fight against Voldemort, and was more willing than Dumbledore to take more extreme actions up to and including killing Death Eaters. However, Crouch's prestige took a nosedive just after Voldemorte's when his son was caught in the company of three known Death Eaters. The four had tortured Frank and Alice Longbottom into insanity looking for information on the Dark Lord's whereabouts. Crouch Sr. disowned his son and sentenced him to Azkaban, but his reputation never recovered and instead of becoming Minister for Magic as many had expected, he was shunted into the Department of International Magical Cooperation.

Some years later, after much pleading from his dying wife, Crouch agreed to break his son out of Azkaban. Crouch Sr. and his wife went to visit their son with two vials of polyjuice potion. Crouch Jr. and his mother switched appearances; the father and son left, the mother died soon after, a funeral for the wife was staged, and everyone believed Crouch Jr. and his mother were both dead.

In fact, Jr. was being kept in his father's home under an Imperious curse and the care of the family house elf, Winky. Eventually, Voldemort learned of Jr.'s location and used him to impersonate Alastor Moody during Harry's fourth year of Hogwarts.

What can we take away from this in regards to HPMOR? Firstly, Crouch Sr. is a candidate for the mysterious hero of the First Wizarding War that Bones recognizes Quirrel as. His age is unspecified in canon, so the dates could well line up. This would however represent a noticeable divergence from canon, as Crouch never disappeared, but it's still a possibility.

Second, if the sequence of events is playing closer to canon (again, by no means a certainty, but a possibility), Crouch Jr. has escaped from Azkaban some time ago and is being held in his father's house.

Crouch Jr. is among the most competent characters in canon: despite being captured at the age of 19 or so and spending the next 14 years in Azkaban or imprisoned by his father, he is nevertheless capable upon his release of subduing Alastor Moody (with help from Wormtail, but Wormtail was not a particularly skilled combatant), then keeping Moody imprisoned for most of a year while impersonating him so flawlessly that he fooled Dumbledore and the rest of Hogwarts for almost the entire school year. He also managed to successfully tamper with the Goblet of Fire, a powerful magical artifact, causing it to choose Harry as a fourth champion. He then proceeded to precisely orchestrate the entire tournament to ensure Harry's victory.",,False,self,t5_2t5xf,False,,,True,t3_vlyph,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/vlyph/speculation_what_is_the_status_of_the_crouches/,

This is three things as far as I am aware.

1. Snape helped SPEW find bullies and then helped them win the fights.
2. Snape burned the notes he sent Hermione.
3. The conversation he had with the girl he used in the SA arc. Probably genuinely unguarded since he was about to obliviate her. 

One could be seen as helping Hermione build character or skill or whatever, but as Dumbledore pointed out the escalation put Hermione in greater and greater danger, and we do not know what would have happened if Quirrell had not intervened in the final battle. Also consider that the description of the origin of the final battle would be consistent with the idea being memory charmed into the instigators.

As for two, Snape held his secret as a higher value than Hermione's life. If his motives were truly benevolent why not admit it at that point? Harry, Dumbledore and the Weasly twins all gave up their secrets in order to help the investigation, but Snape burned his evidence. This is not someone interested in helping Hermione. 

Three does not really help either way as far as I can tell. It is mostly Snape expressing regret for the past and trying to figure out the prophecy. 

That is not a lot of evidence, but it is literally all of the true evidence we have about Snape, and it does not look good. So what could his motive be? In chapter 22 Snape says that he almost killed Harry because of what Harry said to him. We cannot trust that this true, but canon Snape was only Harry's protector our of respect for Lilly's sacrifice. If he really did have a rage inducing revelation in that conversation it could be enough to cause him to abandon that role. If he abandons that role the obvious thing for him would be to go back to fighting for the dark lord who will soon be returning. Which means fighting against Harry and his allies.

If we assume that Snape was plotting against Hermione in the SA arc then he also becomes a prime suspect for being H&amp;C. Hermione was mind raped and the Taboo Tradeoffs plot was set in motion immediately after Quirrell's intervention in the final SA battle. 

Also, Harry believes something significant happened in the conversation in chapter 22(end of chapter 28), and Quirrell is suspicious of Snapes true motives(chapter 77: Aftermath: Professor Quirrell)

And finally, Eliezer said that whenever you increase the power of the protagonist you have to also increase his challenges. Flipping the allegiance of someone as tenuously on Harry's side in canon as Snape would be a good way to do that.

However, this one seemed too important to keep to myself.

Chapter 84, after Dumbledore visits Hermione in the infirmary:
&gt; Professor McGonagall cleared her throat. ""Is it done, Albus?""

&gt; The old wizard nodded in affirmation. ""If any hostile magic is cast on her, or any spirit touches her, I shall know, and come.""

So, Dumbledore has cast wards on Hermione that will alert him if she comes to harm. *How was he not warned immediately when she came under attack from the troll?*

Despite his specific wording, I find it hard to believe that he only cast wards for hexes/curses and posession, but not for physical attack/injury and death, such as Quirrell previously cast on Draco Malfoy. Yet he turns up *after* Hermione's death and only knows that ""a student"" has died but not specifically her. Surely if he has cast these wards on Hermione he should know that it was her?

Much has been made of the Hogwarts security wards being compromised, but how could Dumbledore's own charms also be hoodwinked? Some people might claim this as proof that Hermione didn't really die, but I think the story has progressed too far after the event for her to suddenly pop out and say ""Hi! I was fine all along!""

Evidence: 
A) """"And Lily would tell me no, and make up the most ridiculous excuses, like the world would end if she were nice to her sister, or a centaur told her not to - the most ridiculous things, and I hated her for""  -&gt; Lily was aware of a prophesy that her choices could lead to the end of the world. Note the additional detail of a centaur, which would have meant nothing to petunia, but we know are prophetic figures. Dumbledore was teaching at Hogwarts and was an extremely important figure, if not Headmaster at the time. It seems quite believable he was made aware of the situation.

B) ""she gave in. She told me it was dangerous, and I said I didn't care any more, and I drank this potion and I was sick for weeks, but when I got better my skin cleared up and I finally filled out and... I was beautiful, people were nice to me""
+ 
""The yellowing pages seemed to be describing something called a potion of eagle's splendour, many of the ingredients being items that Harry didn't recognise at all and whose names didn't appear to derive from English. Scrawled in the margin was a handwritten annotation saying, I wonder what would happen if you used Thestral blood here instead of blueberries? and immediately beneath was a reply in different handwriting, You'd get sick for weeks and maybe die.

""I see them,"" said Harry. ""What about them?""

Dumbledore pointed to the second scrawl. ""The ones in this handwriting,"" he said, still in that low voice, ""were written by your mother. And the ones in this handwriting,"" moving his finger to indicate the first scrawl, ""were written by me. I would turn myself invisible and sneak into her dorm room while she was sleeping. Lily thought one of her friends was writing them and they had the most amazing fights.""

Eagle's splendour is Dungeons and Dragons reference to a potion that enhances beauty. Dumbledore admits he helped lily construct a potion to enhance petunia's beauty. Furthermore, Lily suddenly changed her mind, despite her previous refusals to help Petunia. This strongly suggests that Dumbledore was aware of the centaur prophesy as well, otherwise, what motive would he have for intervening? And why would he happen to show this particular intervention to Harry, if there were a large number of other random interventions? Checkhov's gun.

C) Dumbledore has received professor trelawney's prophesy concerning  ""HE IS COMING"", which occurred just as harry entered the cafeteria. He heard it in full. Given his prior on harry being a central figure, plus his likely prior knowledge of the centaur prophesy, he knew the prophesy in question was about Harry.

D) Dumbledore warns Hermione that there are dire consequences if things go awry with Harry:
""Hermione Granger, I shall be less subtle than is usual for a mysterious old wizard, and tell you outright that you cannot imagine how badly things could go if the events surrounding Harry Potter turn to ill.""
To some extent, this revelation is already screened off by harry's basic ""thrice defied"" prophesy. However, it is arguably hyperbolic to say that Hermione ""cannot imagine how badly things could go"". This might purely be referring to Voldemort's rise, but in reality this is quite imaginable for hermione, given the historical information available at that time. I consider this fairly weak evidence though.

E) Dumbledore persuades Harry not to enter the Department of Mysteries: 
""Harry was staring directly at Albus. ""Can I go to this Department of Mysteries place and hear the recorded prophecy? The original tone of voice might be helpful, from what I've heard.""

Light glinted from the reflection of Albus's half-moon glasses as the old wizard slowly shook his head. ""I think that would be unwise,"" Albus said. ""For reasons beyond the obvious. It is dangerous, that place which Merlin made; more dangerous to some people than others.""""

One very prominent possibility here is that Dumbledore is aware of other prophesies relating to Harry, but doesn't wish him to learn of them (note he is already aware of the ""thrice defied"" prophesy). Supposing Dumbledore didn't know the end of the world prophesy related to Harry, it would have been very natural to take him there (allowing dumbledore to discern if the prophesy was actually about harry, which would at least be a good shot of being the case, but if dumbledore thought that wasn't the case, then all the less reason to keep harry out). However, if Dumbledore believed that Harry was the subject of the prophesy, he would most certainly want to keep him out, which he did.

(I'd also note that it seems bizarre for Dumbledore to think it possible that he is the Dark Lord, given he could confirm or deny this by going to the Department of Mysteries and seeing if Harry's original ""thrice defied"" prophesy also related to himself.)

This all leaves the question of Dumbledore's motive for bringing about the end of the world. Perhaps, like Minerva said in Chapter 93, in the last resort, when faced with extreme uncertainty, Dumbledore resorts to doing what he considers to be the right thing (giving Harry as happy a life as possible, helping petunia, etc.)",,False,self,t5_2t5xf,1373584964.0,,,True,t3_1i4121,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1i4121/dumbles_and_prophesy_spoilers_through_94/,

It is of Greek origin, and the meaning of Hermione is ""messenger; earthly"".

&gt;rienne, bri(en)-ne\ as a girl's name is a variant of Brianna (Irish, Gaelic, Celtic), and the meaning of Brienne is ""high, noble, exalted"".

Now, I didn't re-read any of the chapters before diving in on the updates, and I actually skimmed some of the horrors of Hermione's death a bit.  But I actually have more fun being confused and surprised by story elements and coming up with crazy theories than trying to actually figure them out, so while my thoughts here might be stupid I'm just going with it.  (In real life I'm analytical, but it's not as fun for me with stories.)

What the hell is with Brienne?  She appears out of nowhere, and claims to have a dozen ELIZA-like programs in her trunk?  Harry didn't pick up on this complete oddity, because Things started happening, but story-wise I would think this bit of info is hugely relevant.

Lots of theories abound as to how Harry will save Hermione (and he better, because I started reading this fic to be entertained, and if Hermione stays dead, this fic will be, in my eyes, a complete and total failure, I didn't come here for this surprise Bridge to Terebithia shit), but I haven't seen a lot of mention of Brienne.

Now, EY obviously didn't name Hermione, but suppose he looked up her name's meaning (or just knew it, as an obvious derivation of Hermes).  She's named after the Greek god who is dispatched to earth as a messenger.

Hermione is now dead, but her soul (or mental state, whatever) will be rescued and given an entirely new body.  Religion speaks of the resurrected having a new and improved incorruptible body.  Brienne is therefore Hermione resurrected, gone from messenger sent to earth, to return to her natural godhood, high, exalted, noble.

Why is she there, speaking to Harry at all?  Who knows?  But if it isn't Hermione, who the hell is it?  Why is she speaking to Harry asking about his thoughts?  Why is she making a weird comment about AI programs?  Was it supposed to be a joke?  Or a witch bluffing about something she doesn't understand?  Storywise it makes no sense to introduce a completely new character at this point with no relevance for the next several chapters of events.  Ergo, she *is* relevant.

She is described as ""a young-looking witch with short hair.""  Now, Newtonian Conversation implies that for every concept there is an equal and opposite one.  If she's young-*looking*, that could mean she isn't young at all, but *looks* like she is.  So an older, resurrected, ascended-to-godhood Hermione from the future, has cut her hair (as a disguise) and returned to Hogwarts (the six-hour limit on time travel probably having been broken by Harry in an attempt to resurrect Hermione).",,False,self,t5_2t5xf,False,,,True,t3_1higxp,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1higxp/meaningful_name_spoilers_up_through_chapter_90/,

I used the Python webscraping framework[ Scrapy](http://www.scrapy.org/) to collect information on every Harry Potter fanfiction published to Fanfiction.net. I then analyzed the 601,203 fanfictions that were published before 2013. Below are what I think were the most interesting results.  

[Average Number of Favorites Gained vs Starring Character Included Pruned](http://i.imgur.com/pHbwkFT.png)

On average, fanfictions in which one of the starring characters is both female and obscure in the original series are favorited the most. I use the word ""pruned"" in the graph's title because this ranking only considers characters that were in at least 101 stories. Otherwise, a very rare character that starred in a very successful fanfiction would throw off the results. The popularity of previously obscure characters makes sense. Fanfiction authors have more flexibility with characters' whose personalities were ill-defined in the original series. Also, we should expect female characters to dominate as [3/4 of fanfiction.net users are female](http://ffnresearch.blogspot.com/2011/03/fan-fiction-demographics-in-2010-age.html). With that said, there is still gender balance in that [Harry Potter was almost always the co-star.](http://i.imgur.com/FSXSHYZ.png)


[Here](http://i.imgur.com/Sw5lM3w.png) are the number of fanfictions published that contain some starring character.
The primary surprise is the popularity of Severus and Draco, both antagonists in the original series, and the unpopularity of Ron W., who was one of the 3 main characters in the original story. (Okay, maybe Ron’s relative unpopularity actually isn’t surprising.)
Looking at [groups of starring characters vs publishing amounts](http://i.imgur.com/144OTK2.png), shows that Draco is a co-star in the two most common groups. 

This graph shows how [the number of fanfictions published per year has increased over time](http://i.imgur.com/q437v6I.png). 
Not only has the number of fanfictions published increased, but so has their [popularity](http://i.imgur.com/Geh3xMI.png). Perhaps this means that the reader to author ratio has increased. Most strikingly, the number of [favorites](http://i.imgur.com/Geh3xMI.png) and [follows](http://i.imgur.com/tlv0Qs4.png) has increased each year, but the average number of [reviews](http://i.imgur.com/z8nLQWj.png) per fanfiction has not increased since 2005.

What we have seen was mostly from Harry's perspective. On the other hand, it's obvious the Headmaster would've engaged in a thorough investigation already, most likely there are/were a number of copies of Dumbledore running around in Hogwarts since 6 am. this day. 

Unlike the previous incident, during which Draco was discovered more than 6 hours after the actual event thus barring all time-travels, this time the Headmaster was aware of Hermione's death instantly. Given his previous reaction in TPSE, we should assume the Headmaster would not hesitate to use an extra six-hour time window. 

Yet at the time Hermione was killed Dumbledore did not receive any warning from his future self, and had to witness her soul departing the body as a surprise. Come to think of it, this was quite unusual. Even if Hermione's fate cannot be changed, he should have been told by a future self: ""Miss Granger was will be killed by a troll today, get back to Hogwarts now."" 

Well, what would the Dumbledore-went-back-in-time be doing instead of warning himself? Possibly finding out everything he can about the origin of the troll and who was behind it (and of course, why was Hermione alone, and how did the troll find her). The rational choice for the Headmaster after he saw Hermione dying would be go back in time ASAP before being told any specific information about the troll and the staff's reaction to it. We have no idea, whether this was the same troll in canon and brought into Hogwarts for the same purpose, if not (most likely), given it was a large, noisy, dangerous and unaccounted creature at Hogwarts, how could the Headmaster now find it before Filch? Or perhaps he did find it, but had to allow it running freely and kill a cat then a student for some reason. Unless of course, due to the nature of his business outside Hogwarts on that particular day, Dumbledore wasn't able to time-turn at all.


Now from the plotter's stand-point, smuggling a troll into Hogwarts unnoticed suddenly became a lot harder. His/her challenge was not just evading the wards, but also doing so under the nose of the most powerful wizard in the world who would be actively seeking out a troll six hours in advance. The plotter had to at least smuggle the troll into the school, hide it for more than six hours before its existence could be confirmed by anyone else, so that no one could go back in time and catch him with the troll. Then set it free remotely leaving no trace (magical or not), and had it locate and kill the target in a very short time-period. The difficult parts are: how to conceal it for as long as six hours and have it accomplish the killing quickly. He could possibly paralyze the troll and transfigure the whole creature into something small and unnoticeable (well this takes some powerful magic obviously, but not impossible as we have seen a desk becoming a pig), and have this small thing hidden on a path where he knew Miss Granger will cross (or just casually put a book in Hermione's bag and sustain the transfiguration until she's absolutely alone). This plan solves the above difficulties, yet it is inconsistent with what had happened: mainly one thing, Filch discovered the troll before Hermione was killed. This is somewhat confusing, suppose the plotter intended the troll to do some assassination, why would he have the troll's existence exposed before the job was done? Granted, without the time pressure from the announcement of the troll to the death of Hermione, the story would be less dramatic and interesting. Yet in universe, having the troll encounter Filch and the cat almost ruined the plan. Harry's 1000 possible things he could have done are also 1000 different ways the plotter's plan could've easily failed. It's possible due to limitation in resources, the plotter did not have full control over the troll and had to put a flawed plan into execution. However, suppose Filch's encounter with the troll was somehow connected to Hermione's death and part of the plan, the explanation could be the plotter wanted Harry to witness Hermione dying, instead of just hear the news of her dead. This would be a lot more difficult than simply killing her, as it requires almost exact control of the timing of events, and runs a higher risk of failure (which could be acceptable, as long as nobody can trace the troll back to the plotter).

First the WoW bit.

The Lich King is not a necessarily evil being, despite being portrayed as so. In Azeroth, there is a infective and destructive force known as the scourge created by fel magics and without guidance or leadership: think the BORG. The Lich King steers that force of scourge with his will on its every endeavor. The last, and current, Lich Kings were paladins who sacrificed themselves to steering the will of the scourge to its least damaging directions, rather than leading a full on assault against the other forces of the world. Over time that willpower is corrupted, and the lich begins to feel the same mindless destructiveness as his minions until he leads a charge against the world en masse. Then a new champion is called to throw down the lich king and assume his role of controlling the scourge, a supposedly endless cycle.

Relevant points,

1 There are anti muggle factions within the wizard community created of simple ignorant prejudice.

2 Those factions have access to magic, and no respect for human life to not use these powers against muggles. (great power, great corruption)

3 These factions seek each other, looking for acceptance, like any radical group, who would wish violence on those they view as lesser or persecutors. (think ss, kkk, wbbc, etc.)

Now, just as any prejudice that may exist in a society, there are both people who profit from that prejudice and seek to eradicate any judgment against them, and their opposites. My theory, is that Tom Riddle sought to, in his admittedly ignorant youth (Ch 18) become a dark wizard, defined by not conforming to the status quo. He voluntarily donned the mantel of Voldermort to take control of the factions that would have changed the makeup and landscape of Magical Britain, who would otherwise run rampant, in order to steer the war towards defeat. He used magical means and his minions to kill enough muggles and sow chaos to create a black-and-white delineation of alliances.The magnitude of his transgressions carefully calculated to make sure that anyone affiliated with him would have to completely commit to his insane and barbaric notions, but also abandon their shared goals once he fell. He then tanked the death-eater alliance on a flimsy premise, leaving them shattered and leaderless. He chooses a pair of the greatest champions against him (per prophecy) to be his undoing, killing them to make it believable but leaving a corpse doll (Stanford prisoner experiment pt3) burnt to a cinder as his body and a boy messiah, a symbol of hope and renewal. Then he fades into obscurity...

Years later he hears of his old factions realigning, Lucius calling the others to take up the senseless charge. So he, in his nearly Dumbledore-ish level of power, ingratiates himself to the headmaster of Hogwarts in order to preen the boy he allowed to live to be not black and white, but grey. Allowing him to fully see both the evils and virtues of each opposing side and try to unite the two under their more virtuous characteristics.

I know it is not the strongest of theorys, but it nicely explains Quirlmort's current attitude and actions.

I did a couple searches for keywords like debt, money, galleons, what not. I did skim, but i didn't see this come up. Everyone that brings up the debt brings it up as a thing to do actively like using the time turner or Harry's precious metal/currency exchange plan. Im thinking that EY has left a MASSIVE [chekhov's gun](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun) hanging out stuffed with potentially thousands of galleons. 

&gt; Professor McGonagall shook her head. ""Your father was the last heir of an old family, Mr. Potter. It's also possible..."" The witch hesitated. ""Some of this money may be from bounties placed on You-Know-Who, payable to his ki- ah, to whoever might defeat him. **Or those bounties might not have been collected yet. I am not sure**."" 

Earlier in the same chapter 

&gt; The Dark Lord had raged upon wizarding Britain like a wilding wolf, tearing and rending at the fabric of their everyday lives. Other countries had wrung their hands but hesitated to intervene, whether out of apathetic selfishness or simple fear, for whichever was first among them to oppose the Dark Lord, their peace would be the next target of his terror.

There could possibly be any number of uncollected bounties even outside magical Britan on Voldemort. It says that they did not intervene directly, but maybe they instead [placed an add in the paper](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlordList) via rule 49. Common sense is rare, but not unheard of. Refuted: [thedoctor2031](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/17wafg/another_possible_find_near_the_beginning/c89ifa9)
  I would think the celebrity of Harry Potter would prevent anyone from failing to fulfill any bounty on record. If not, the wizarding world does have civil legal system. 

Lucius has strong sway, but he's still in a position of conflicted interests arguing that the bounties in question were one or more of the following: never posted, never fulfilled, fulfilled by another, invalid since voldi is back, violates statute of limitations on unpaid debts or just plain dickery. And arguing these flimsy excuses against an orphan that he himself bankrupt, who is THE Harry Potter? Political self destruction.

His gaze grew more distant. ""Oh,"" Severus breathed, ""he was very cunning indeed...""

Readers are generally interpreting this as a hint that revealing the secret of the Dark Mark triggered another effect of the spell, one that Severus didn't know about until now, and either can't or won't reveal. There are other interpretations, of course--Severus could have just happened to remember something right at that moment, and realize some subtlety to Voldemort's past actions.  But I think the ""second layer"" interpretation is the most likely.  So what was it, and why was it there?

I've been puzzled for a while by the Dark Mark. Characters talk about it as though it had loyalty-enforcing properties, but at the same time there are disloyal Death Eaters who bear the Dark Mark, and the only effect seems to be intermittent pain.  Obviously, a permanent tattoo is a credible loyalty *signal*, and the Mark seems to allow bearers to voluntarily meet up together more easily, but it still isn't living up to the way it's discussed.  And, I mean, if canon!Hermione can hex everyone so that they'll be permanently disfigured if they betray her...

It seems clear that Riddle was either unable or unwilling to build a ""betray Voldemort -&gt; die horribly"" or ""betray Voldemort -&gt; get mindwiped and minionized"" trigger into the Mark.  I can think of a few possible reasons for this.

  * Fine-tuning exactly how much disloyalty counted as ""betrayal"" would burn through too many Death Eaters.
  * At the time he invented the Dark Mark, Riddle was still hoping that Monroe would be made a dictator (probably with a Light Mark), and he wanted to ensure that Death Eaters could still defect to him (as it seems at least one did).
  * Magically-enforced loyalty always requires a large permanent sacrifice no matter how clever you are, and he just didn't have the resources, so he made do with a few cheap triggers.
  * He wanted Death Eaters to be able to sincerely defect, but still be brought back into the fold later to act as triple agents.

So, if we assume that Riddle wanted a betrayal predicate in the Mark but couldn't pull it off, the next best thing would be to hardcode a collection of behaviors, each of which most likely indicates betrayal, and trigger off of them. As Monroe, he could warn defectors not to do any of those specific things.  One of them, naturally, would be ""gleefully revealing everything you know about the Dark Mark as soon as the prohibition is lifted.""

As for what the trigger does...I still don't understand why it isn't ""die horribly"" or ""become a brainwashed minion of Voldemort,"" but perhaps it merely put Snape into telepathic contact with Voldemort so that Voldemort can try to talk him into switching teams again...you could maybe imagine Riddle being arrogant enough to assume that that'd be enough.

I want to see more discussion about a post that GHDUDE17 made in another thread.  Here's the post:

&gt;So. Riddle enters Godric's Hollow, ready to rid himself of this hideously evil Voldemort persona he's had for a while now. He hijacks some random muggle and heads towards the Potter house. He quickly disposes of James, and leaves Lily the option to run away. She's stubborn, so he kills her and then turns on Harry. He preforms the horcrux ritual, which (in one of my pet theories) just so happens to leave nothing left of the sacrifice (the random muggle) but a burnt husk of a body, and leaves Harry a piece of Riddle's soul, presumably part of some weird megaplan that he's got going that we don't know about yet. He also etches a little scar for Harry for aesthetic purposes and to make the rebounded avada kedavra story more believable. He disappears silently into the night.

However I wouldn't be surprised if it weren't a random Muggle but instead someone important.  Who?  And why is Harry a good target for being made into a horcrux?

Also, with all of Harry's talking about how he has four parents, I would love it if it turned out that Harry was actually not Lily and James's son...not sure if there's any evidence supporting that he *is* their son.

_________________________________

So, I'm re-reading the fic for the N'th time, waiting for the next chapter and lo! A wild puzzling thought appears: 

&gt;And by similar logic: The words a wizard spoke, the wand movements, those weren't complicated enough of themselves to build up the spell effects from scratch - not the way that the three billion base pairs of human DNA actually were complicated enough to build a human body from scratch, not the way that computer programs took up thousands of bytes of data.
&gt;
&gt;**So the words and wand movements were just triggers, levers pulled on some hidden and more complex machine. Buttons, not blueprints.**

From ch. 25. (emph. mine).

The question is, if this is so, why does casting a spell drain magical energy from the wizard? I thought it was clear (from the quote and from other observations on what wizards can do) that the actual energy to perform the tasks (that the spell was cast for) does not flow from the wizard himself/herself (but maybe I misinterpreted this). I figured it was more of a Jedi thing, where the wizard only guided ambient ""energies"" (sorry, I feel dirty saying that - hence the quotes) 
towards a specific task. 

So, why the drain on the wizard if it is simply the equivalent of pushing a button (or otherwise activating machinery already in place)? The ""magic gets exhausted"" part feels like an artificially added limitation rather than a part of the universe (barring future explanation of course).

Together they manipulated Harry into releasing someone who may or may not be the second most evil person in the world from azkaban.

My theory is thus:

Snape set up the entire meeting with Lesath with the express intention of forcing Harry to dwell on how horrible azkaban is. He knew that Harry would empathise with Lesath and that Lesath would beg Harry to save Belatrix. Harry may have discarded these thoughts but afterwards Snape put him in an exceptionally dark mood by making him work out that his parents were horrible people as teenagers. A person in a dark mood thinks about dark things. The darkest idea Harry has been recently exposed to? Azkaban. Harry now contemplates Azkaban in detail and has already had the idea of saving Belatrix from it planted in his mind.

Not long afterwards Harry gets a chance to save her guilt-free because Quirrelmort gives some unprovable hypothesis that she was forced to be evil by a dark ritual. Harry, already inclined to believe anything that lets him save someone from Azkaban doesn't think this over as well as he normally would and jumps at the chance to do something **entirely illegal that would certainly ruin all his future plans if it went even slightly wrong**. Does this sound rational? No. Harry is being manipulated.

It's too much of a coincidence that Harry was mentally programmed so perfectly as to deactivate his rationality to such a high degree by Snape and Quirrelmort working independently and oblivious of each others moves. I notice that I am confused. The most likely explanation, therefore, is that this is not the case.

(CH 23 + regular HP canon spoilers),18,6,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/15smk4/squibs_as_the_result_of_witch_infidelity_ch_23/,"So this came up in [a reply to another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/15rvv8/dna_squibs_muggleborns_and_chapter_23/c7pb39m).  I started typing out my own response but it ended up being far longer than I intended, so I'm posting it as a thread of its own.  Less clutter that way.

As /u/pedanterrific pointed out in a reply, a definition of terms is in order.  I am using a social designation of muggles and squibs, rather than using Harry's allele-based one:

*Muggle* - A person incapable of using magic, born to a family that is also incapable of using magic.  The family probably also has a long history of not being able to use magic.  
*Squib* - A person incapable of using magic, born to a family that *is* capable of using magic.

All magical people must have 2 copies of the recessive magical gene, so you would not expect *any* magical parents to have non-magical children.  This raises the question, 'why do squibs exist?'  The idea posited by /u/pedanterrific in the other thread was that maybe it can be explained by a certain amount of magic-muggle sex.  Specifically 'are witches cheating with muggles?' since non-illicit magic-muggle sex just results in 'half-bloods'.  So we have a magic-muggle infidelity hypothesis.

In trying to find an answer, I'll make one more main assumption; that the HPMoR universe is very similar to the regular HP canon unless specifically stated otherwise in HPMoR.  With that in mind, here are some qualitative observations that I think are relevant.

* All people capable of using magic have 2 copies of the recessive magic gene.
* Squibs exist, and are born to witches.
* Squibs are realtively rare(1).
* Even pure-blood families can produce squibs.
* Some muggles produce magical children.
* Such children are uncommon, but not apparently as rare as squibs(2).

(1) *I believe we only learned of 3 specific squibs in the regular HP canon - Filch, Mrs Figg, and the Weasley accountant cousin*  
(2) *In HPMoR, McGonagall tells Harry that there are ~10 students per year (so ~70 in the school) who are muggleborns.  In regular HP canon, I* think *there are around ~1,000 students at the school, which means that muggleborns make up somewhere around 7% of the student population in HPMoR.*

It seems to me that there are two main issues.  First, how common is it for magic users to cheat on their spouses with muggles in the first place; and second, are the above observations consistent with that level of infidelity?

In order to get an estimate of the level of magic-muggle infidelity, I'm going to look at muggleborns, specifically asking the question 'can the existence of muggleborns be explained by illicit sex between wizards and female muggles?'  If it can, then the magical gene needs to be common enough in the muggle female population that however much cheating actually happens is enough for ~7% of all magical children in Britain to be muggleborn.

Without wanting to bog the thread down with the actual numbers, it just doesn't seem possible for them to add up.  Either too many wizards would have to have too much sex with muggles for the rate of infidelity to be at all likely, or the gene would have to be so abundant among the muggle population that the number of magical children born to two non-magical parents would dwarf the number of muggleborn children with wizard fathers.  Simple genetics, on the other hand, *is* a sufficient explanation for the existence of muggleborns.  It requires only a low abundance of the gene among the muggle population, and we don't need to invent an inflated level of infidelity among magical people to explain the existence of muggleborns.  Occam's razor suggests that muggleborns really are the children of muggles.

We also note a trend among magical people to completely separate themselves from the muggle world.  With this and the fact that it is unnecessary to think of infidelity to explain muggleborns, it seems likely that magic-muggle infidelity is actually quite low among wizards.

Which finally brings us to squibs.  I will assume that witches are not substantially more or less likely to cheat than wizards.  If we do accept a low rate of witch-muggle infidelity, then the observations that squibs exist, and that they are rare, seem consistent with the idea that squibs are actually the result of cheating witches.  It seems unlikely that squibs would come about 'naturally' if magic were genetic.

Clearly none of this is definitive, but I'm wondering if there's anything obvious I've missed, or any assumptions that seem unreasonable/unlikely to be accurate.  I can't immediately think of anything that I would expect to be qualitatively different if the magic-muggle infidelity explanation of squibs was incorrect.

--addendum--

Also thanks to /u/--o for pointing out that matters are complicated by the question of how common it is for magical people to be unfaithful with squibs.  It adds an alternative source of new squibs, so we can be less confident in the theory that witches are cheating specifically with muggles, but it does seem likely that they are cheating with *somebody* who has at least one copy of the dominant no-magic gene.",,False,self,t5_2t5xf,1357137967.0,,sunshine,True,t3_15smk4,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/15smk4/squibs_as_the_result_of_witch_infidelity_ch_23/,

&gt;So with all that strangeness, how do you recognize a person? Not by the shape, not by how many arms or legs it has. Not by the sort of substance it's made out of, whether that's flesh or crystal or stuff I can't imagine. You would have to recognize them as people from their minds. And even their minds wouldn't work just like ours do.

That might appear as a tough criterion of beings having right to live, but there is a problem: newborns. I suppose, it would be reasonable to assume (assumption 1) that they are not sentient in any meaningful sense. Even though that does not necessary exculpate infanticide completely, that makes it much less immoral than killing an adult, who can understand their existence. That contradicts common morality, which considers (assumption 2) killing a child to be much worse than killing an adult.

An obvious solution (solution 1) for this problem is to state that it's not only sentient beings, who have intrinsic right to live, but also anything, which can become sentient in the future. However, the problem is obvious as well: that makes abortion on any stage of pregnancy equivalent to murder. That does not seem to be a good moral principle to me, especially toward a bunch of cells without even neurons (assumption 3).

[spoilers through Ch. 85],17,4,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/10sfhg/what_couldve_happened_between_dumbledore_and_the/,"One of the great things about *Methods* and about Quirrellmort in particular is that here he has rational motivations for his hatred, unlike the canon Voldemort. Whereas in canon, Voldemort hates Muggles for the sake of hating them, Quirrellmort in *Methods* hates them because of their recklessness with power.

Voldemort's other great hate is Dumbledore. In canon, Voldemort hates him simply because he's his greatest opponent. But we've already had hints that this hate runs deeper as well.

So we think we know (or at least *I* think *I* know), at this point, that Tom Riddle played both sides in the first Wizarding War. He created the character of Voldemort, and he created the character of the Noble Hero, and he pitted the two against each other so that no matter which side won, he would be the leader, who could unify Wizarding Britain and the Wizarding World against the Muggles. But he was flabbergasted at how the Noble Hero, ""the next Dumbledore"", met with resistance at every turn.

But Dumbledore himself was already around and powerful back then; he's been the Chief Warlock since the forties. It stands to reason that Quirrellmort hates Dumbledore so much because Dumbledore was the primary one standing in the Noble Hero's way.

But why? Dumbledore was already fighting off-the-books battles with the Order of the Phoenix. Why would he not have welcomed such a good fighter? And even if the Noble Hero had no interest in joining the Order, why would Dumbledore have opposed him?

The Dumbledore-haters among us will probably say that Dumbledore felt threatened by the new upstart. Indeed, Quirrell hints at as much to Hermione, though he only named the vague ""they"", not Dumbledore himself. But I don't buy that. I don't think we're *supposed* to hate Dumbledore. I think Eliezer intends us to see Dumbledore as being *more flawed* than he is in canon, but still as being generally *good* in the same sort of way as in canon. Suddenly coveting his power would seem very out-of-character, even for a more-flawed Dumbledore.

So what could have happened back then? What could Dumbledore's attitude and actions have been toward the Noble Hero back then, that would make Quirrellmort hate him so?

1347769562.0,15,self.HPMOR,zyivw,Who will be framed for recent events (ch 85 spoilers),15,0,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/zyivw/who_will_be_framed_for_recent_events_ch_85/,"This whole post is based on the idea that Quirinus Quirrell == Tom Riddle == Hat &amp; Cloak == the person responsible for what happened to Hermione and Draco. I think that the evidence in favor of this is pretty damn strong, but if you disagree then just treat the whole thing as a hypothetical.

Chapter 85 shows Harry starting to make a list of suspects, and both Quirrell and Voldemort are on the list. Quirrell wouldn’t want Harry to conclude that either of those two is responsible. Himself for obvious reasons, but Harry concluding that it was Voldemort would make Harry a lot less likely to ever agree to fake another encounter with the Dark Lord, plus it would probably make him more sympathetic to Dumbledore.

We have seen the level of preparedness in Quirrell’s plots before. When he thought that no one would ever know that Bellatrix had been taken from Azkaban, he still left behind an Animagus potion. Just in case her escape was discovered, so that there would be a plausible explanation other than the truth. I can’t imagine that he would fail to do the same thing to deflect suspicion in this latest plot. So the question isn’t if Quirrell is going to frame someone, but who.

If he could pull it off, the obvious answer would be to frame Dumbledore himself. We have seen Hat &amp; Cloak try to make Harry distrust Dumbledore before, when he has Blaise Zabini tell Quirrell in front of Harry that Dumbledore blackmailed him into creating the three way tie in the Christmas battle. If Harry thought that Dumbledore had tried to kill Draco and frame Hermione for it, that would be the end of any chance of Harry ever working with Dumbledore again.

There are two problems with framing Dumbledore that I can see. The first is that Dumbledore himself would know that he didn’t do it, and no matter what Harry thinks Dumbledore would still be in a position to investigate the matter himself. The second is a lack of motive. Draco himself poses no threat to Dumbledore, and framing Hermione doesn’t seem to benefit Dumbledore in any way. If, say, Robert Jugson had been the one who appeared to have cast the blood cooling charm on Draco, things would be different. It would weaken the blood purist faction. But a mudblood witch killing the last scion of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy doesn’t do that. Lucius would crush her without expending any political capital, and afterwards the blood purists would have more supporters, not less.

The other obvious target is Severus Snape. Harry already dislikes Snape, and knows that Snape doesn’t like him.  And Quirrell knows that Snape was interfering in S.P.H.E.W’s battles, without the knowledge of Dumbledore. So he can present evidence of that true fact, plus some other faked evidence. We have already seen Harry come up with the logical hypothesis that whoever was leaving the notes for Hermione was doing so to setup what happened later. Snape will be in the unenviable position of trying to convince Harry and Dumbledore that some of the evidence against him is fake, and the rest isn’t what it looks like.

Snape also has a plausible motive to kill Draco and frame Hermione. He has decided to break with Dumbledore, and is working to undermine Dumbledore’s position. He can’t hurt Harry directly, so he is targeting Harry’s friends (I would be surprised to learn the Dumbledore didn’t cast the same spells he did on Hermione to detect hostile magic/possession as soon as Harry got to Hogwarts. I would be shocked if he still didn’t do so after Azkaban). 

Harry believing that Snape was responsible for what happened wouldn’t be as good as him blaming Dumbledore, but it would still serve Quirrell’s interests. Dumbledore is the one who has allowed Snape to continue teaching at Hogwarts, so Quirrell would expect Harry to blame Dumbledore for Snape’s actions. If Dumbledore also believed that Snape was responsible, he would certainly not be allowed to stay in Hogwarts. And in any case it would take suspicion off of Quirrell himself.

Does anyone have any other suggestion for who Quirrell might frame? Or any other ideas on how he might deflect suspicion from himself? Is there anyone who thinks that Quirrell doesn’t have some sort of a plan, and is going to just let Harry and Dumbledore investigate without interference?

- Yes. Magical creatures can have offspring which do not have magical properties (that is to say they do not interact with the source of magic). This means that whatever genetic marker is used to establish a link to the source of magic is not specific to humans because it is present in all magical creatures (which means they can randomly mutate to not have it and therefore produce ""squibs""). This indicates that the creators of the source of magic were not humans or they would surely have used a marker specific to humans (and also specific to *them*).

- No. All magical creatures always have magical properties no matter what mutations may arise. This indicates that to interact with the source of magic does not require the presence of a single gene, rather the similarity of a genome.
The programming for such a system would be as follows:

    If organism's genome is 99% identicle to genome labeled ""Pheonix"" apply the following properties:

     -When the tears of this organism are in direct contact with damaged tissue repair the damaged tissue.
 
    -When the neuron cluster labeled ""A"" is active teleport the organism to the location encoded in neuron cluster labeled ""B"".

    -When the organism produces sound by manipulation of its larynx search for organisms which match 99% of the genome labeled ""Human"". Of found ""Humans"" Search brain patterns for signs of altruism and of greed. If more signs of altruism are found produce emotion labeled ""Happiness"". If more signs of greed are found produce emotion labeled ""Fear"".

This would indicate that the creators of the source of magic were humans. This is because a magical creatures connection to the source of magic is determined in a different way than to humans. The creators didn't care whether a pheonix was from one bloodline or another, only that it *was* a pheonix. Humans conversely, can only be connected to the source of magic if they come from the bloodline of Atlantis (or if they happen to mutate the gene), therefore they would retain control of their creation.",,False,self,t5_2t5xf,False,,dramiones,True,t3_wudyy,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/wudyy/magical_creature_squibs/,

What I'm trying to say is:

* painting Draco as a creature who is both not a complete sociopath as well able to discuss atrocities without batting an eye makes the concept of his redemption much more meaningful. If he is painted as less terrible, then he's merely a bully and not worth special attention or further attempts of redemption beyond what Harry extends to other bullies.
* Alternatively, simply changing the *type* of atrocity does nothing more than render him more palatable to parents in the U.S., but still equally frightening and *potentially* inappropriate for child readers. (Depending on how much faith a given parent has in their own child's judgement, of course.)

Harry has deduced that magic is some sort of computery thing that pays attention to a genetic maker, a single gene. The computer thing lets wizards open up a console for the universe and to input commands to alter it to their whim. However, there is a major problem with this. Namely, the presence of both muggleborns *and* squibs. Think about it; it's never specified that the gene for magic is dominant or recessive. There are problems with both.

If the gene for magic is dominant than muggleborns would be impossible (but squibs wouldn't) because having one copy of the gene would make you a wizard, so all muggles have two non-magic genes and can only pass on non-magic to their kids. But if the magic gene is recessive, then squibs are impossible (but muggleborns aren't), because wizards would have two copies on the gene, and couldn't pass anything except magic to their kids. There is, however, another simple genetic solution.

Imagine that, instead of one gene allowing you to open and command the console, you have two; one that opens it, and one that gives you the ability to input commands. Magic doesn't work unless you have both of these. One is dominant, and one is recessive. This allows for both squibs and muggleborns: A muggleborn has two parents with the recessive console-opening gene and one parent with the dominant command-gene, or perhaps two parents with the dominant gene. Regardless, she has the genes to cast magic. A squib, on the other hand, is missing a gene; his parents both had only one copy of the dominant gene, and he missed both copies.

I've heard the theory that the single recessive gene for magic can be flipped into the non-magic gene by the (presumably radioactive) check ups of the source of magic, during pregnancy. However, if this was true, then you would also expect to see abnormally high rates of other mutations and genetic diseases among squibs.

1376870478.0,14,self.HPMOR,1kmuco,The Board of Governors and the Wizengamot (Spoilers through Chapter 97),18,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1kmuco/the_board_of_governors_and_the_wizengamot/,"Hypothesis: Harry will propose the first steps towards a stronger central government for magical britain.
An Alternate Hypothesis: Dumbledore will be ousted as Headmaster of Hogwarts

Harry has proposed a plan to Lucius and Draco concerning his next steps should House Malfoy and House Potter unite. What information do we know about this plan?

1. Harry was reluctant to tell Lucius + Draco of it in advance (Harry waited until it was clear Draco could not convince his father to join with Harry independently of the plan)
2. Lucius finds the plan to be a strong incentive to join with Harry
3. The plan involves the noble houses of Potter, Malfoy, Longbottom, and Bones at the least acting in concert. Possibly other Houses aligned with Lucius would be involved as well.
4. Dumbledore will very possibly oppose the plan
5. The idea would appear suspicious if Lucius proposed it
6. We know this idea is compatible with the idea that Draco could be ruler of Magical Britain by the end of his term at Hogwarts.

Additional Facts:
1. We know that the Wizengamot is very closely balanced between Dumbledore's faction and Lucius's. The same is true for the Board of Governors of Hogwarts.
2. We know Noble Families are voters in the Wizengamot. These same parties likely have influence for the Board of Governors
3. We know Neville's grandmother, head of House Longbottom, supports the idea of a stronger central government (as seen in her reaction to quirrel's speech)
4. We know Amelia Bones is supportive a strong central figure for the light and as chief auror, it might be presumed she's a supporter of centralized authority in general.
5. We know Dumbledore opposed Quirrel's call for a stronger, centralized magical government
6. We know Dumbledore has lost a great deal of face by having a student die in Hogwarts. This is certainly a major issue, given that Hogwarts is known for the security it provides to students.

Reasoning:

1. The interest in obtaining support from other Noble Houses suggests a Wizengamot vote is involved (we have no evidence that Neville's grandmother, for instance, is powerful in any other sense). This is further aided by the parity of factions in the Wizengamot, which suggests that small imbalances caused by a few members changing their votes can cause changes in the outcome of votes.

2. How can Harry have any confidence in convincing Longbottom and Bones (assuming this is referring to the house seats, not Neville and Susan) on a matter he has never discussed with them? In the case of a stronger government, he has discussed the issue with Neville's grandmother (after christmas break), and with respect to Amelia, he perhaps has some conception of Amelia through Susan and the Wizengamot trial. Alternately, with respect to an ousting of Dumbledore, Harry is possibly aware through Susan of Amelia's hardline support of the direct confrontation of abuse that has been permitted inside Hogwarts (bullying). Similarly, we know that both can imagine Neville or Susan being in Hermione's same position, and might be far more sympathetic to appeals to restore Hogwarts to its role as a neutral middleground, rather than having the principal wizard of the light as the headmaster. 

3. The set of actions Harry is capable of and interested in, that would be passed in the WIzengamot, and that benefit Lucius strongly are fairly minimal. By and large, our understanding of Lucius's goals revolve around weakening Dumbledore. This can occur via weakening his position at Hogwarts (via the Board of Governors or having Dumbledore ousted as Headmaster) or weakening his political roles.

They're a very interesting bit of magic, and canon only really scratches the surface in that arena. Here's what canon tells us:

1. You need to kill to create a horcrux.
2. The act of killing fractures your soul, and presumably the fractured piece goes into the horcrux.
3. You can technically make more than one, but the idea horrifies Slughorn (who is, granted, not the most powerful wizard), so we can assume it's very difficult and takes a lot of magical power. Hence, why Voldemort is the only known wizard to make more than one. 
4. No matter how many horcruxes one makes (or at least up to 7), part of the soul stays within the body. 

Okay. Now let's apply this to MOR. 

1. What, precisely, is the ritual like? Do you have to kill them with the intended object nearby? Is there a special ritual killing spell? We know that every ritual ""names that which is to be sacrificed, and that which is to be gained."" Presumably this is ""someone else's life"" and ""an extension of my life."" 
2. What does fracturing the soul do? If it decreased one's magical power I doubt Voldemort would have done it--and in canon it certainly doesn't do that, since canon Voldemort didn't seem to have a seventh of his former power. 
3. So what, precisely, is stored in horcruxes? The nature of the soul in MOR is obviously a big question. Is a horcrux just imprinted with an image of the person's soul--like a murderous copy machine rather than a pair of scissors and a safe deposit box? I could easily see soul-fracturing as just speculation and superstition. Is that sort of language actually used in MOR? 
4. Are horcruxes sentient? The diary certainly seemed to be so in canon. It seems more likely that an imprint or image of the soul could pass for sentient than a fragment of one. 

What do we think?

Does HJPEV have the same aptitude? It's stated that Hermione is ""beating Harry in every class but transfiguration"", which must include Battle Magic. And that's not just Quirrell Points; Granger casts a working stunner on her first attempt, and is shown to be a top-form combatant when angry. Draco is of course the one to beat, with years of experience and training from his father I think the probably would have beaten Granger if they were both in peak condition.

So my question is, could Harry beat either of them in a fair fight? No Time-Turner, no Cloak, etc. Just Wand vs Wand. He's been taking lessons from Diggory, and he's capable of casting Stuporify as well as using transfiguration in combat. And of course he's got his natural seeker's reflexes.

Professor Quirrell had immediately dispelled the Charm, cast stabilizing spells on Mr. Malfoy, and levitated him to his office to Floo him to St. Mungo's for further treatment.

Assuming Quirrell was behind the whole fiasco, wouldn't it have made more sense to let Draco die (seemingly by Hermione's hands), so that Draco would be permanently separated from Harry? It would also result in Hermione probably getting a more severe punishment or the Wizengamot reacting even more furiously than how they did, thus making it more difficult for Harry to get her out of the mess.

It is a game which pits an informed minority against an uninformed majority.

The game, [Mafia(partygame)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_%28party_game%29), was originally designed to be playable with just people and a way to secretly decide teams but I much prefer the computerized version.

.

To play the tabletop version of Mafia there are two teams. 

Players are secretly assigned roles: either mafia, who know each other; or townspeople, who know only the number of mafia amongst them. In the game's night phase the mafia covertly ""murder"" a townsperson. During the day phase, all of the surviving players debate the identities of the mafia and vote to eliminate a suspect. Play continues until all of the mafia have been eliminated, or until the mafia outnumber the townspeople. A typical game starts with seven townspeople and two mafiosi.

Getting back to the title, it is the job of the mafia to lie and pretend to be town.  It is the job of the town to see through their lies and lynch the mafia before it's too late.

Time constraints limit the complexity of the tabletop version which is why I like the computer version more.  In the computer version everyone gets a role which is beneficial to their team and some neutral players are thrown in to add even more misinformation.

All role abilities can be found here:

This game requires the game starcraft2 to be played.  It is a custom game using the starcraft 2 engine.

I've had a lot of fun plotting and trying to unravel plots.  Some plots going right over less intelligent players heads.  If anyone would like to play with me some time I'd be more than happy to offer tips and suggestions.

* Somehow screwing with the rules of time travel to create a world-destroying temporal paradox.
* Destroying all dementors, leading to a cataclysmic war when all the dark wizards escape Azkaban (and possibly wizarding prisons in other countries).
* A loophole in the rules of magic allowing for arbitrarily large explosions (any idea what that might be?)
* Discovering the secret of Atlantis, thus gaining ultimate magical power.

Harry concludes in Chapter 86 that a powerful, ruthless, intelligent Voldemort would have been able to win the Wizarding War in short order; or, barring that, would at least have been able to do far more damage than was observed. He concludes that Voldemort is therefore probably not as intelligent as rumored, as his ruthlessness is apparent and magical power is easy to subjectively measure.

But we as readers know better^(1) - if the Dark Lord was anywhere near Quirrellmort in cunning and overall competence, he'd be more than capable of winning. Since he did not, the only thing left to question is motive: namely, *Voldemort was not trying to win the Wizarding War*.

Even if 'Munroe' and Voldemort were both aliases of Tom Riddle, he still had eight years of free reign as Voldemort to pursue any goals he chose. What was he doing in that time?

1354334245.0,14,self.HPMOR,14372i,Best excerpt to show potential readers ,17,3,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/14372i/best_excerpt_to_show_potential_readers/,"An attempt at trying to spread the gospel of rationality to a friend who I believe will love HPMoR once he starts reading got me thinking: **what would be the best excerpt to show someone to convince him/her to give the book a try?**

It's hard for me to describe the book to people who aren't familiar with the term 'rationality', or at least not the LW accepted meaning. The book is also about a *lot* more: unique and well worked out characters, interesting, complicated but  *rational* plots, hidden answers to questions you most likely even forget to ask first time reading, etc, etc..  It seems to me that these aspects of the book are not best reflected in the first few chapters, so although I definitely agree that if you *hate* those chapters you probably will not like the rest either, it's presumably not true that if you're ambivalent about them you won't love the rest.

So now the hard part.. how do you show of as much of the clever schemes, characters and humour in an as little text as possible. A second consideration would be that it should not contain any large spoilers, as not to ruin it for those who'd be convinced to read the book after reading the excerpt.

Also: first post on reddit, whoohoo! Love the MoR (two read-throughs and the podcasts.. what a timesink..) and this subreddit - without which I would've missed a lot of the more subtle gems. So thank you guys and most of all EY, who in my opinion should sort out his priorities and spend a bit less time on engineering friendly AI, spreading rationality and other noble tasks and a bit more on writing for my entertainment ;)

**Current spoiler policy**

This is how it currently stands:

&gt;* No spoilers in thread titles
* Threads marked in the title as discussing details from a certain chapter can openly spoil anything that has occurred up to that chapter, but must use spoiler tags for details from later chapters
* Any information from Eliezer later retracted should always be spoiler-tagged
* Don't spoil things from outside of HPMOR, except canon Harry Potter

&gt;In addition to the above, anything spoiling details revealed within the last few weeks should be very clearly labelled as such and spoiler-tagged. Untagged posts and comments that spoil recent developments will be EXTERMINATED on sight, with a polite notice to the conspirator about the importance of secrecy in maintaining a good conspiracy.

**Proposed change**

It seems to me the third bullet should be:

&gt;* Any information from Eliezer later retracted should always be spoiler-tagged **and accompanied by a clear warning**

After all, if you're going to spoil something the author thinks new readers shouldn't know, it should be clear what's at stake for someone coming across your spoiler, shouldn't it?

Alternatively, perhaps it should be a requirement that *all* spoiler tag use should include an indication of the level of spoiler? (e.g. *""Did you know [spoiler](/s ""This story is about Harry Potter"") (Ch1 spoiler)?""*)

**Discuss!**

Do you agree with this change?

Do you think the current policy is problematic in some other way? I imagine some of you have noticed me marching around removing comments and adding flairs to spoilery posts.

1343819320.0,15,self.HPMOR,xi19m,Rewriting Chapters 1-2,27,12,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/xi19m/rewriting_chapters_12/,"HPMoR's beginning is the most poorly-written part of the story, and likely scares many readers off before the good stuff. It's certainly the only thing that ever makes me hesitate to recommend the fanfic.

The Ch. 1-2 plot is overly linear and to-the-point — very little of that zigzagging clash of vibrant personalities we soon grow to expect. It's as though the author is rushing through the requisite setup out of boredom with all things nonmagical — a tragic error, since bored writing makes for bored reading, and since the opening of this story is actually one of the most literarily and pedagogically promising sections of the book. Here we have a one-time-only opportunity to convert Rowling's intrusion of the preternatural into a much more psychologically realistic sequence, a unique opportunity to flesh out Harry and his parents in a context mundane enough to bring their personalities, rather than the setting, into the foreground. But instead we get completely flat depictions of Harry's folks, and even Harry seems like a caricature, absent foreshadowing of the more interesting traits that will come to define him (e.g., his utopian humanism, his unique blend of arrogance and self-criticism, his mischievousness...).

I'd like to hear other assessments of the chapters, and suggestions for how to improve them. I don't want to nitpick without giving constructive ideas, so here's 7 things I'd change:

1. First maxim of storytelling: Show, don’t tell. Second: Exploit your audience’s expectations. Open with a boy sifting through books in a cupboard under some stairs. His father finds him and — shock! — is supportive and non-abusive. Turns out Harry was just looking for a quiet, private place to read and think.

2. To make the narrative less dull and linear, add an episode where Harry’s family visits an ailing uncle. The car trip will give Harry and his dad time to interact (see 4), being out can offer Harry a glimpse of some peculiar anomalies (owls?... in a flock?... in the *day*??!), and seeing someone ill will give Harry a chance to ponder how absurd and wasteful death is (hinting at his most defining motivation later on), and will give Petunia a chance to offer some healing crystals!

3. That’s right, Petunia should be into woo woo flimflam pseudo-magic. It will help give her an actual personality, makes perfect sense as an overreaction to her belated acceptance of real magic, gives Harry and his dad something *important* to argue with Petunia about, and offers us a more natural segue into her backstory. (When offered one of Petunia’s ‘healing crystals’ later, McGonagall can remark that it is ordinary quartz, giving Harry a chance to note the misleading nature of categories like ‘magic.’)

4. Give Harry’s dad some real dialogue. His personality’s fine; he just needs time to show he’s not a bland, generic father figure. (Why invent a whole new character and not give him any quirks or charm?) For starters, he could give Petunia a great talking-to about magical thinking and counting the hits, hinting at whence Harry gets his habit of lecturing people about their cognitive biases. And it would be lovely to see him nerdishly bonding with Harry in the car, e.g., giving him a pop verbal exam or answering Harry’s endless strings of questions with impromptu lessons about old-growth forests and macroeconomics. That would be *adorable*. At the same time, Harry’s dad is a lot older than Harry, more set in his ways. He’d seem a bit more human if he subtly demonstrated that he still, on some level, just couldn’t accept that magic is real, even after seeing what he himself would characterize as good evidence. Humans are *astoundingly* good at cognitive dissonance of that sort.

5. The family returns home to find their house stuffed full of letters. Harry learns that his father has been burning scores of letters from people he takes to be con artists. (Note the parallels with the Dursleys; two people can do the same thing, and yet one have good reasons where another has only bad reasons.) This triggers Petunia’s Ch. 1 explanation of her backstory, but her conversation with Mr. Verre should be much more confused, angry, and chaotic, given that to all appearances Petunia suddenly seems to be having a psychotic breakdown. Harry should even help gang up on his mother.

6. As the fighting gets ugly, have him run away to hide and read somewhere, perhaps a tree. He has a nice chat with a cat about how superior empiricism is to ideological sword-fighting. But the cat suddenly talks back, causing Harry to fall — but, somehow, not hurt himself. At this point, he’s still sure it’s just a prank, but is starting to notice his confusion. And then he walks inside and sees a self-proclaimed witch…. These incremental anomalies help prime Harry much better than leaping right into ‘oh, this woman claims she’s a witch’ for taking the hypothesis even somewhat seriously. At the same time, they show Harry’s not crazy or a rube, which is crucial to establishing his character – Harry *never once* acts in later chapters like how he acts in Ch. 1-2 as they’re presently writ.

7. Keep Chapter 2 mostly the same, with a bit more introspection and disoriented, realistic human interaction. Add an aftermath to Chapter 2 in which Harry stays up late contemplating the nature of fantasy, reality, science, magic. He’s interrupted by his mother, whom he proceeds to interrogate at length about whatever she half-remembers of the magical world. Petunia warmly offers what she can, and the two are interrupted only by the pre-dawn stirrings of birdsong.

Obviously this is just a sketch, and I didn't try to change too much. But I think even this much could do a great deal to help humanize Harry and his parents — all three now have reasonable, but *error-laden*, perspectives. Mr. Verres is too set in his ways, Petunia is too credulous, and Harry puts too much faith in authorities and in the domain-generality of his father's rationality.

Notably, Harry is much harder to convince in my version than in HPMoR, allying himself much more strongly with his father (even when he *feigns* being an unbiased observer), which resolves what Eliezer calls the single biggest problem of HPMoR — the fact that Harry suffers no major losses in the early chapters, steamrolling over everyone else and every obstacle. Ch. 1-2 is a perfect time for Harry to suffer a big loss, since he's invested his whole life into a magic-free world-view. Sure, he can be more open-minded than his father, but he should still be rather more shellshocked by the whole affair than he lets on. It will then count as at least an embarrassment, rather than a triumph, when he learns the truth. Making Harry more skeptical and self-questioning also in one fell swoop makes him a better teaching tool (*extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence!*), far more believable, and far more in-character.",,False,self,t5_2t5xf,1343819778.0,,chaos,True,t3_xi19m,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/xi19m/rewriting_chapters_12/,

1373563329.0,13,self.HPMOR,1i3c5c,Speculation (spoilers up to ch 94),13,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1i3c5c/speculation_spoilers_up_to_ch_94/,"I have several speculative ideas with varying degree of credibility. Some of these have probably been posted before, but here they are:


**Speculation 1**
Harry will (did?) travel back to before Hermione died. When McGonagall unlocked his time turner, he was less than six hours past the time of her death. I believe. I don't know why he wouldn't go back to before and try to change things. Because Dumbledore told him it wouldn't work? That doesn't seem like it would stop someone who vowed to 'open any gates or break any seals necessary'. This may be a minor point, but in chapter 89 there is a line break between 'dropping' and 'into' (12th line down). When this was pointed out in the discussion thread for that chapter, Yudkowsky said, ['Intentional'](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hc6x6/spoiler_discussion_thread_for_ch_8889/caswa7m). What was being intended, I do not know. But it does appear to suggest that something was amiss regarding the flow of events.


**Speculation 2**
The ultimate showdown between Harry and Quirrell (in whatever form that takes) will involve Dementors. Quirrell is particularly weak to them and cannot cast a Patronous to shield himself from these indestructible, unstoppable shadows of death. Harry is the only one who can destroy them and therefore has complete control over them. If Harry is expecting a direct battle with Quirrell, bringing along an army of Dementors would be a good idea. I can't find the source, but somewhere in a discussion, a commentator called Harry's failure to destroy the Dementors while he was in Azkaban a 'missed moment of awesome' and Yudkowsky responded with something to the effect of 'Just be patient'.


**Speculation 3**
Harry is the bad guy. Not the villain, but 'HE IS THE END OF THE WORLD'. There are three, maybe four prophecies regarding Harry. The first is the centaur telling Lily not to be nice to her sister or the world would end. Lily was nice to her sister and this set up events such that Harry became a super intelligent rationalist. The second was the 'The one with the power to vanquish the dark lord...' one. This is because Harry, as an intelligent rationalist actually could defeat Quirrellmort. If Harry had been canon! Harry facing MOR Voldemort, he would have died. Quickly. The third and fourth prophecies are basically the same 'He is coming...' and 'He is here...'. Both occurred at turning points in Harry's path to what he will become/do. The first point was after Harry's conversation with the sorting hat in which Harry chose Ravenclaw. A conversation in which the hat warned 
*This day is a great fork in your destiny. Don’t be so sure that there will
be other choices beyond this one. There is no road-sign set, to mark the place
of your last chance to turn back. If you refuse one chance will you not refuse
others? It may be that your fate is already sealed, even by doing this one
thing.*
The hat's full warning can be considered another pseudo prophecy, perhaps. Trewlaney's second similar prophecy occurred after Hermione's death when Harry vowed to do whatever it takes to bring her back. There were many warnings which were consistently ignored as Harry moved down the path to become the destroyer of worlds. 


**Bonus Speculation**
The Weasley twins did it. All of it. Or, as they prefer to be called, The Lords of Chaos. They are pranksters who are *very* committed to their pranking. For them, there is no such thing as going too far. They long ago decided that learning memory charms would come in handy. A memory charm can by itself be a good joke, and many of the more complex plans require certain people to forget certain things. They are now extremely proficient with Obliviation and planting false memories. They orchestrated the whole Rita Skeeter situation by memory charming the right people, and may have even maneuvered Harry into requesting their help in the first place- or at least into thinking he did. They arranged for Hermine to 'die' as an elaborate plan to make their head of house resign. The wards think the defense professor did it because, well, they are the defense professor...They are both animagi. Small ones who are able to spy on others. Very much like Rita Skeeter. They managed to fly/crawl into the circle when Dumbledore was establishing Quirrell as the defense professor and are now considered 'The Defense Professor' themselves. They routinely use their professor status to Obliviate other students and move events as they see fit... acting as a mysterious figure known as 'Hat and Cloak'.",,False,self,t5_2t5xf,False,,,True,t3_1i3c5c,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1i3c5c/speculation_spoilers_up_to_ch_94/,

&gt; **I must achieve my full potential. If I don't I... fail...**

&gt; **""What happens if you fail?""**

&gt; **Something terrible...**

&gt; ""What happens if you fail?""

&gt; I don't know!

&gt; ""Then it should not be frightening. What happens if you fail?""

&gt; **I DON'T KNOW! BUT I KNOW THAT IT'S BAD!**

&gt; There was silence for a moment in the caverns of Harry's mind.

&gt; ""You know - you aren't letting yourself think it, but in some quiet corner of your mind you know just exactly what you aren't thinking - you know that by far the simplest explanation for this unverbalisable fear of yours is just the fear of losing your fantasy of greatness, of disappointing the people who believe in you, of turning out to be pretty much ordinary, of flashing and fading like so many other child prodigies...""

&gt; No, Harry thought desperately, no, it's something more, it comes from somewhere else, **I know there's something out there to be afraid of, some disaster I have to stop...**

&gt; ""How could you possibly know about something like that?""

&gt; Harry screamed it with the full power of his mind: NO, AND THAT'S FINAL!

&gt; Then the voice of the Sorting Hat came slowly:

&gt; ""**So you will risk becoming a Dark Lord, because the alternative, to you, is certain failure, and that failure means the loss of everything. You believe that in your heart of hearts. You know all the reasons for doubting this belief, and they have failed to move you.**""

&gt; Yes. And even if going to Ravenclaw strengthens the coldness, that doesn't mean the coldness will win in the end.

&gt; ""**This day is a great fork in your destiny. Don't be so sure that there will be other choices beyond this one. There is no road-sign set, to mark the place of your last chance to turn back. If you refuse one chance will you not refuse others?** It may be that your fate is already sealed, even by doing this one thing.""

So, firstly there is the obvious point about ""tearing things apart"", which is implied will occur if Harry becomes a Dark Lord. Harry also points out that destruction is the easier course of action, and while he may not wish to think of himself as the sort of person who chooses the easy option, he has in fact done this in the past - using the Time Turner to get himself out of a sticky situation, consequences be damned. Has Harry matured and learned from his mistakes sufficiently to not take the easy route in future? If not, then he may well be on course to becoming the Dark Lord the prophecy foretells.

Secondly, what is the terrible event that will occur if Harry fails to fulfill his potential? Was this a premonition of Hermione's death? Has he already failed by not finding a way to save her? Or could it refer to a more global event, such as Voldemort taking over the world? If Harry doesn't develop the skills necessary to defeat Voldemort, the world might end. Or could it even refer to a threat to the world from Dementors/Death?

Also, why does Harry believe this so unconditionally and irrationally? The only other thing he has believed in so firmly without evidence was the existence of magic, and presumably that was due to lingering memories from his early childhood. Did Harry experience something/hear a prophecy as a baby that gave him knowledge of this destiny?

The final point I want to discuss is the Hat's warning that this might be Harry's last chance to turn away from the Dark side, or that if he does get another final chance he might turn that one down as well.  
""If you refuse one chance will you not refuse others?""  
Well, he has since refused the phoenix, which must be another fork in the road. His refusal presumably takes him further on the path to becoming a Dark Lord. Is Hermione's death the final straw that will see him become ""the end of the world""? Or will his love for her and his desire to prevent anyone else from dying win out?

Also I couldn't decide exactly where to spoiler this so I erred on the side of caution.

Ever since it was clear that Quirrell was playing many roles my theory about his periodic spacing out is due to him taking control over another body somewhere.  He might only have the tiniest amount of awareness over Quirrell's body when in this state which is why it seems like he can be startled out of it.  The interesting question that arises from this theory is to try to find a character that's appeared in the story so far but only when Quirrell wasn't around or while he was a zombie.  The situation of course becomes much more complicated if he just directs someone's actions temporarily instead of having to dictate everything, in which case we would be looking for someone who appears to act significantly differently when Quirrell is not around or in zombie mode, but that is probably too complicated for discussion.

Thoughts?

1372800104.0,11,self.HPMOR,1hiv4p,[Spoilers Ch 88-90] Your Suspects List,15,4,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hiv4p/spoilers_ch_8890_your_suspects_list/,"With the story currently focusing on Harry trying to reverse Hermione's death, most discussions have been on how/if he is going to accomplish it. I looked but didn't find any thread focusing on whodunit. So what are your thoughts on the possible culprits, their motives and the likelihood of them being guilty?
My suspects, from the most likely to the least, are:  
* The Defense Professor  
-Because... It is clear throughout the story that he is trying to bring Harry over to the Dark Side and had noticed Hermione was strongly anchoring him on the Light Side. He also tried to get rid of her non-violently by sending her away after the plan to send her to prison didn't work (I'm assuming the incident with Draco and the troll were caused by the same person). He was also the one responsible in canon.  
-On the other hand... Releasing a troll on a huge non-Euclidean castle doesn't seem like a very efficient way of going about killing a specific student, unless you have means of putting some sort of tracking charm on him. Besides, I'm fairly confident he could have done it with much less risk to his pet project.  
* Mr. Hat-and-Cloak   
-Because... As we know so little about him, it is hard to speculate on his motives. However the memory charm does seem like one of his favorites and Hermione is one of only two people we have seen him interact with. Besides, if he isn't a professor, he has already shown to be able to circumvent Hogwarts' wards (only a professor can Obliviate students) so it wouldn't be a stretch for him to go around others.  
-On the other hand... It's all a little too vague while we are still speculating on who he is.  
* Lucius Malfoy  
-Because... Revenge, pure and simple. He said he would drop everything if Draco came to harm, and setting a troll loose is the kind of thing an irrationally angry person might do. Besides, the troll could also have killed Harry (whom he might blame for exposing his son to dangerous ideas) and, even if it didn't kill anyone, would still be a political blow against Dumbledore.  
-On the other hand... Draco didn't die and Lucius has had plenty of time to see this is obviously someone else's plot. And though he would never admit it, even he must see that Hermione is a very unlikely murderess.  
* Dumbledore  
-Because... Maybe he thought Voldemort would try to exploit her as vulnerability of Harry's. Maybe he thought it would push Harry towards taking the enemy seriously. Maybe he faked it. Maybe he is insane. None of these are really strong evidence, but what I find suspicious is how the enemy so thoroughly outwitted him, letting the troll in, preventing the Hogwarts' wards her sudden injuries (he only arrived after she died), circumventing whatever special enchantments he put on her personally and preventing the other professors from calling (I'm just speculating, but it seems strange that Minerva, Flitwick and Snape didn't try to send him a Patronus as soon as they heard about the troll). Also, he is the only one we've seen who knew about the map.  
-On the other hand... No matter how fallible he is, I just can't see Dumbledore being this cruel. I still think he is one of the good guys, but maybe I'm just biased towards Mysterious Old Wizards.  
* Snape  
-Because... It's hard to come up with a good reason why, but he is close enough with Dumbledore to fool him and his loyalty seems to have been faltering. Not to mention what he said to Harry about knowing the feeling of losing the one you love. Also, maybe he was actually trying to steal the philosopher's stone and used the troll as a distraction, like Quirrell did in canon.  
-On the other hand... The impression I got from the Self-Actualization arc was that he was deliberately trying to help Hermione and that his faltering loyalty was not to Dumbledore in general, but to the idea that bullies should win.  
* Some other character that hasn't appeared in story yet  
-Because... There's plenty of canon characters that haven't shown up yet, maybe this is some new unknown party.  
-On the other hand... This doesn't sound like EY's writing style at all.  
* Professor Sprout   
-Because... You know, no one would suspect her of it....
-On the other hand... It could have been Hermione, following the pattern Quirrell mentioned of trying to look like the victim (which it is even less likely than Professor Sprout).

I barely even lurk on this subreddit, in part because I feel I can't contribute much to the discussions, and in part because every time I read one of your brilliant insights, I regret not reading EY's sequences and rereading the fic and discovering it myself. I know, thats silly and vain, but this is a fic, not a real problem we ""need"" to solve as a community. Not that I don't think all your collected efforts are awesome, I imagine EY must feel great about the fact that so many people are throwing themselves at his constructed problem and taking interest in his theories as a result.

I guess i want to learn by doing so to speak, so thus the only minor lurking. This post is supposed to really be a sort of log for my reread so feel free to downvote it or ignore it. I ask that you don't confirm any of my theories, but hey do what you want. I would appreciate it if you correct me if I think some pop-culture reference or jab at canon is a clue when it's just EY not being able to contain himself :)

Otherwise, don't expect much from this little thread. My theories may just be stupid. ONWARDS!


**Things that confuse me in HPMOR**


**CH1**
The first few lines : 
Beneath the moonlight glints a tiny fragment of silver, a fraction of a line...

(black robes, falling)

...blood spills out in litres, and someone screams a word.

This is the first confusing bit in HPMOR. It does not really fall within the ""more confused by fiction, not reality"" bit, but is more of a clue or something
Theory based on CH90 [SPOILER](#s ""this is Harry's spell, his endgame, that he eventually creates by sacrificial blood magic to attempt to save Hermoine."")


Petunia's changes : Ofcourse this bit is vital to this fic's existence - if this divergent point from canon did not happen, we would have Dudley and Vernon
However, the information missing here is the WHY. Why in the world would Lily Potter risk the world ending to improve her sisters appearance?
Even with Petunias threat of suicide..? Not sure if that makes sense.


Third, major confusing bit:
Harry is convinced magic is real. [SPOILER](#s ""Or ""some part"" of Harry is. This part is probably Harry's dark side. There seems to be no reason why this 
very rational Harry, bred on science by his very sceptical dad, should _believe_. Accept the possibility, sure, want to test it, sure. But he 
_believes_. In CH90 hindsight, this supports a dark!Harry time travel theory, time travel where he sends his ""soul"", or brain pattern information back in time. His soul assimilates with cute!rational!Harry to make our hero. However, nothing changes so time travel apparently sucks?"")
Maybe HPMOR is a tragedy, not Humor &amp; Drama :(

So, just going to post this now and update continously.

**CH2** - End of Spoiler Tags 
I think the work of making ALL these tags when the title is so clearly labled is cruel work. Is it OK to skip them?
Err, had to tag one thing incase it was NOT ok to skip them.

""Of course it was my fault. There's no one else here who could be responsible for anything.""


So this is a line from CH90 that refers to Harry's resolution to save Hermoine at any cost. Excited to reread the chapter to
see what EY wants me to read with this ominous line in mind


""not to mention that the mind was the brain and the brain was made of neurons, a brain was what a person was -

And then a woman turned into a cat, so much for all that.""

So this brings us to CH90 again, and the idea of Horcruxes as well. It's Harry's observation that he should not trust his preconceptions about
how the world works and discard anything as too silly, like souls or atleast a HPMOR universe thingy that may be labled so. [SPOILER](#s ""In CH89, there's also this 
thing where Harry sits by Hermione : ""There was a burst of something that was magic and also more, a shout louder than an earthquake and containing a thousand books, a thousand libraries, all spoken in a single cry that was Hermione""
Harry still decides to cryo her, but it's basically the observation of a ""soul"" leaving it's body. So this mostly to make a note to self that 
horcruxes are definetly on the table, really."")

The only other thing in this chapter is Minerva's thing at the end where she's saying she wont take Harry to Diagon Alley until the end of summer
to keep him from destroying the England or something. This is really really strange, I don't see any reason why she would say this, but I think
we can chalk it up to being just EY getting a bit carried away.


**CH3**


""I had the strangest feeling that I knew him..."" Harry rubbed his forehead. ""And that I shouldn't ought to shake his hand."" Like meeting someone who had been a friend, once, before something went drastically wrong... that wasn't really it at all, but Harry couldn't find words.""

So I have this crackpot theory based on Lily helping Petunia - the warnings Lily received must have been very vague since she went ahead and changed things, and the warnings, or prophecy is now much clearer (Trelawneys prophecy about the one who will destroy the stars and all that..) and that makes me think someone timetravelled and made stuff go even more wrong... It's not based on a lot of data, just CH88, 89, 90, and my reread so far, as well as my
vague memory from my previous readthru. It may be the stupidest theory ever, or one that's been aired on this subreddit previously, but I will spoiler tag it incase it's correct and someone might want
to figure out themselves in their reread. [SPOILER](#s ""So I think Harry's time-travelled twice. Once, to a alternate timeline where theres no  rational!Quirrel,
and once more to assume the role Madam Bones peggs Quirrel for. So I think Quirrel is not Voldemort, but Harry."") Right. So. Not even gonna look at the 
comments in this thread anymore, just gonna continue reading and see how it fits.

What? I am assuming he levitated the body and dropped it over the edge, so as to make sure that if the troll did recover, then it would do so outside the immediate vicinity. But you would think that the fact that the troll's body stopped regenerating would be sufficient for you to leave your enemy's corpse alone and focus on the somewhat more momentous fact that your friend is lying in a pool of her own blood, very likely dying in those moments. So my question is: what's up with that?

In particular, I have implemented naïve Bayes before and would like to find a book or other comprehensive resource to look into using the other Bayes-related forms of inference.

I plan to use this to solve a personal medical mystery due to the failure of the ""let's eyeball the log"" approach.

To elaborate...

I have a tentative diagnosis from a doctor and she said to try keeping a food diary to nail down what's causing problems. However, by this point in my life, I have managed to consciously &amp; unconsciously avoid the ""wrong"" things most of the time so that I don't end up feeling awful all the time. As a result, when I tried to do a similar sort of logging earlier, I ended up with a lot of simple text data with only a few incidents. Also, my doctor and I already know that the actual event/""keyword"" is probably going to include something like ""ate out at XYZ restaurant instead of ABC restaurant"". And, there's probably more stuff that can be trivially calculated (like, yes, I just ate at home and should be fine except that I ate out at XYZ Restaurant 4 hours ago).

Wait, isn't there some sort of simple medical test or something?

Nope. I read through a recent academic review article and right now, people aren't even sure what the gold standard for diagnosis is. It's either ""get a really good clinical history"" (aka, ask the patient to figure it out for you) or ""do a bunch of skin tests and hope for the best.""

Now, back to crunching data...

Naturally, this quickly turns into looking through a huge pile of data (both directly logged &amp; easily calculated) to see which events (e.g. ""Eating at XYZ"" AND ""chicken with assorted vegetables"" AND ""&lt;4 hours elapsed"") are strongly associated with problems.

(Un?)fortunately, I haven't managed to completely subconsciously figure out what to avoid so this isn't as bad as trying to hunt for terrorists but it's not as trivial as hunting for spam e-mail.

I don't plan to implement the actual Bayes-related algorithms because tools like RapidMiner exist. However, I know there's a big gap between knowing Naïve Bayes &amp; Sequences/Gentle Introduction to Bayes to ""let's use this fantastic tool to build a Bayesian network"".

I expect to write a bunch of little programs to spit out the calculated values and possibly help me keep the data straight. The raw logging pieces are already set up. I'm just not using them until I know that the raw data won't get flushed down the toilet.

He had already watched, upon his instruments, the boy leaving Hogwarts, and that could not be undone (his one attempt to fool his own instruments, and so control Time without altering its appearance to himself, had ended in sufficient disaster to convince him to never again try such trickery). He had hoped to retrieve the boy at the first possible moment after his arrival, and take him to another safe location, if not Hogwarts (for his instruments had not shown the boy's return). But now -

&gt; ""A paradox if I retrieve him immediately after he arrives in Diagon Alley?"" murmured the old wizard to himself. ""Perhaps they did not set in motion their plan to rob Azkaban, until after they had confirmed his arrival here... or else... perhaps...""

In addition to this scene, Harry has been influenced by notes he's sent to himself, like ""DON'T MESS WITH TIME.""  Given a reasonable understanding of the handwriting of the wizard in question, would it be possible to manipulate events by planting such a note in order to convince Dumbledore/Harry/anyone with a time turner to stop whatever they're doing, as it would result in a paradox?

It seems that, if you know you could be trying to manipulate someone who is using a time turner, it would be a fairly good strategy to use such notes.  They can never *ignore* such a note, in case it actually results in a paradox.  This could eventually be neutralized with predetermined passes (Harry's ""I am a potato""), but it would at least initially give a large advantage to whomever used it, especially if you were relatively confident that they were using the time turner.  (Presumably it wouldn't give away the strategy if they weren't, since they wouldn't be looking for such things as parchment notes, and would likely disregard them if they saw them.)

From Chapter 86:

&gt;""Not necessarily, Mr. Potter."" Professor Quirrell drained his teacup in one swallow and then set it down, the cup making a sharp rap as it descended. ""**There is also Severus Snape - though what he might think to gain from this, I could not guess. Thus he is not my prime suspect either.**""

Also from Chapter 86:

&gt;""Perhaps that is true,"" said the Potions Master from where he was lurking. ""But what of it, Mad-Eye? Whatever his identity, Monroe was surely the Dark Lord's enemy. I've heard Death Eaters curse his name even after they thought him dead. They feared him well.""

**Hypothesis**: The Potions Master and the Defense Professor worked together to frame Hermione Granger for the murder of Draco Malfoy. 

**Evidence**: 

First quote - Proves that Severus and Quirinus have secretly met before, and hints at the possibility of them collaborating again some time. One might even go as far as to say that this section is only there because EY is hinting to us about the two of them working together. 

Second quote - This quote was taken from the section ""*Hypothesis: Dumbledore*"". In this section, Quirrell *heavily* investigates the possibility of Dumbledore and Lucius Malfoy being the culprits, but as seen from the quote, instantly dismisses the possibility of Severus being it. This is by no means conclusive evidence, but in my opinion can be sufficient evidence to say that Quirrell is trying to steer suspicion away from Snape. 

Third quote: This quote was under the section ""*Hypothesis: The Defense Professor*"". It is the **only sentence** Severus Snape speaks throughout the entire section and also happens to be something that is defending Monroe, who the Defense Professor supposedly is. Once again, not conclusive but in my opinion sufficient evidence to say that Snape is trying to steer suspicion away from Quirrell.

On the other hand I'm not sure this fits with the Quirrel's apparent mood swings and the description of his extra sleep as a ""zombie like state"". And we don't really know anything about his sleeping patterns apart from that he sometimes enters these states.

Several points.

I'm going with the assumption that PQ=TR=H&amp;C.

1. Quirrell loves to hijack other people's plots. He uses Dumbledore's plot to diffuse pre-Christmas tension to get Harry to distrust Dumbledore through Zabini. He interferes with Snape's plot to set up his Draco&amp;Hermione project. I know that's not enough to set a trend, but I can't think of a scheme that he didn't play some role in, one way or another.

2. Quirrell needed to explain Skeeter's disappearance somehow. It wouldn't do for her to just go missing when she touched upon the subject of Harry Potter and the Defence Professor.

3. When Quirrell supposedly finds out about Skeeter's article and acts all astonished, he doesn't leave Harry's side until he kills Skeeter, which means he has already arranged for her to be there (by delivering her an anonymous tip about Mary's Room, I imagine). His means to cover up her death should have already been in place.

4. When, after discussing the article with Quirrell, Harry approaches the dangerous hypothesis of deception, Quirrell makes it look like a more reasonable explanation exists which requires the Weasley twins by 'deducing' Harry's subcontractors to misdirect his suspicions.

Well, there you are. I know this isn't ironclad, but it seems very likely to me. Thoughts?

Century doesn’t mention anything like that and Modern Magical History warns that there are lots of crackpot theories about you.*

Well met on this fairest of evenings, ladies and gentlemen.

Today, I present to you my crackpot theory about the identity of Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres' dark side.

If one for a moment is willing to assume he premise that Dark!Harry is not really a part of Harry, but instead another personality, the story-savvy reader will instantly remember that the Talking Hat says:

&gt;I can go ahead and tell you that there is definitely nothing like a ghost—mind, intelligence, memory, personality, or feelings—in your scar. Otherwise it would be participating in this conversation, being under my brim.

Now, what if we further assume that the Deligitor is wrong, that could mean that Dark!Harry is more powerful than an artifact created by the Founders Of Hogwarts, the *almost* most powerful wizards in history.

&gt;Draco was trying frantically to think. “I always heard that nobody
was as good as Merlin and then after that nobody was as good as the Founders of Hogwarts.”

That's right. Dark!Harry is possibly a reincarnation of Merlin or something to that extent. We do not know the upper bounds of Merlin's power. Word is he managed to alter the very Laws of Magic themselves (Interdict of Merlin), which *is* quite a feat.

Of course, this relies on the following being true:

* Merlin existed in the first place, which is far from hard fact. I noticed his name is used troughout the story like Muggles would use ""Jesus"".
* Merlin was indeed as powerful as people say (or at least more powerful than the Hat.)
* Merlin either was evil or somehow only his evil part ended up in Harry, maybe accidentally.
* Merlin had some reason to put his soul into a child born ~2000 years after him, or did so unintentionally. Maybe this reason was that he strived for immortality, which would be not surprising. In fact, Dumbledore would say it would be consistent with him being a Dark Lord.

Also, Dark!Harry does not have special powers (that we know of), except being a psychopath and thus good in Occlumency.

From this I infer that Bellartrix knows something *very* important. Dumbledore is unlikely to care about the reputation of Azkaban all that much (if anything its political fodder to shut it down). That leaves either political fallout (I can't imagine Dumbledore or his close allies being hit that hard, its the ministry and aurors that would really be hit the most, or she knows something that *must* be kept secret (from Dumbledore's perspective).

If that seems plausible, speculate away on what it could be!

Earlier today, though, I remembered Eliezer's [AI box experiment](http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/aibox) and had a bit of an epiphany. The conclusion that I believe we were supposed to draw from the experiment was that it is futile to try to prevent an AI with superhuman intelligence from turning evil and such by making it incapable of doing so - the only way is to make it a [friendly AI](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence), meaning one that doesn't *want* to turn evil. From here it takes just a short leap of logic to arrive at the MrCheeze Hypothesis: **The only way to defeat Quirrelmort is to get him to want to do the same as you want him to do.**

Of course, that is still a difficult task, but at least one that seems possible, unlike outsmarting or overpowering him.

The question now is *how* to get him to change his mind. Persuading him, ""Hey, you shouldn't be evil and stuff"" seems right out, both because of his character and because that would be really boring. The cleverest thing I have come up with is based on the fact that a lot of the things people do, they do because they think of themselves as the kind of person who does that kind of thing, and they think that because they remember doing a similar thing in the past (~~I think I got this piece of information from a Less Wrong post, but can't find which one it was~~ [BT_Uytya found it](http://lesswrong.com/lw/4e/cached_selves/)). Thus, if you managed to hit Voldemort with a successful memory charm (still very difficult, obviously), you could give him a few memories of doing not-evil things, and he would probably think of himself differently and do more not-evil things in the future.

Legends and even modern accounts are stories told about unwitnessed events, not events themselves, and therefor extracting truth from them is a difficult proposition.

The Big Story in MoR is the source of magic itself. Wizarding history is mute on the subject; hardly anything is known about the centuries before Merlin and Atlantis is only a name. EY has postulated, through Harry, that magic itself is an artifact, the creation of the time-lost Atlantians. But what do we know about MoR magic?

So far as I can see, there are two parts to it. Magic is ""fueled"" by a wizard's magical core; casting spells takes personal energy and can lead to magical exhaustion. But magic is ""shaped"" by something else; the things it is capable of are beyond the powers of the human mind.

&gt;Harry was breathing in short gasps. His voice came out choked. ""You can't DO that!""

&gt;""It's only a Transfiguration,"" said Professor McGonagall. ""An Animagus transformation, to be exact.""

&gt;""You turned into a cat! A SMALL cat! You violated Conservation of Energy! That's not just an arbitrary rule, it's implied by the form of the quantum Hamiltonian! Rejecting it destroys unitarity and then you get FTL signalling! And cats are COMPLICATED! A human mind can't just visualise a whole cat's anatomy and, and all the cat biochemistry, and what about the neurology? How can you go on thinking using a cat-sized brain?""

&gt;Professor McGonagall's lips were twitching harder now. ""Magic.""

&gt;""Magic isn't enough to do that! You'd have to be a god!""

Harry is quite correct: to do what wizards and witches routinely do, which is basically have their way with matter, energy, space, and time, requires functional omniscience and omnipotence. In short, it requires the Singularity Event that EY works towards; the creation of a computer/AI capable of leveling itself up to infinite computational power. It is a short step from infinite computational power to infinite knowledge of how the universe works to mapping the universe (or at least our local neighborhood) down to the subatomic level in real time and thence to full omnipotence, the power to manipulate all of time and space.

This God Machine would not, however, be an active god in the sense of a God of History; it would be a caretaker-god, a genie only capable of carrying out instructions. It will respond to a user-request like ""turn me into a cat,"" but it will not turn a user into a cat because it thinks a cat would be a fine thing for that user to be. A God Machine that did more would rob humanity of its free will. Where this God Machine is and what it looks like is anybody's guess; it may be purely a psychic or hyperspace or quantum construct, not existing in the physical world of our senses at all.

There is, however, another possibility; what if the God Machine is located in the future?

Lost Atlantis may in fact be a pure myth, an explanation for the ""disappearance"" of magic's creators. Harry assumes that the ancient Atlantians created the source of magic, then wiped out their civilization. It has been suggested that they wiped themselves out of time itself. But EY has taken pains in his story to show time as incredibly stable, to the point that interaction with the past results in closed cause-and-effect loops. You can't change history, but you can participate in it, even provide your past self with knowledge/directions. It boggles Harry's mind, but it is strongly implied that, while an event can cause itself (thus Harry's game), the cause of the event cannot simply disappear or be overwritten.

So what if the Magical Singularity that created the God Machine that powers all magic has yet to actually happen? There is no reason the God Machine cannot come into existence in the future and still affect the distant past (the six-hour limit on Time Turners smacks of Arbitrary Limit when prophecies can go back for centuries). The God Machine may reach back to the distant past to be the source of magic for the Wizarding World that later creates the Magical Singularity and the God Machine.

Which would imply that, when Harry conquers death, eventually it will have been conquered for everybody who ever existed in all of time...

It would certainly fulfill the prophecy ""He will end the world.""

I believe it can explain the way paradox prevention works in a more satisfying way than any other hypothesis I've considered.

The Consistent Universe Probability Distribution Hypothesis

There is a probability distribution of configurations of 4-dimensional universes. If time travel were not involved, then there would be a simple (prior) probability distribution of universe configurations. For each time that the conditions for time travel of matter are met in a universe, the probability weight of that universe contains a term for the probability that the matter succeeds in going back in time, which is roughly the probability of the matter not spontaneously ceasing to exist due to quantum noise or any other reason in a particular instant. If the past is inconsistent with the future person going back (they never showed up), then the probability mass of that universe will be essentially zero. The Auditors from Discworld sampled Graham's number of universes according to this distribution. How did they sample the distribution? Very well, thank you. Perfectly, in fact.

By the anthropic principle, you are likely to be in a universe which does not have paradoxes, in the same way that you are likely to be in a universe which does not contain people suddenly popping in or out of existence. In this model, there is no ""if you cause a paradox then something very bad will happen"". It's simply, ""you cannot cause a paradox"". Best of all, the regular rules of the universe apply during each time loop. Time loops in which people act out of character are as unlikely as people acting out of character outside a time loop, unless people acting out of character is an event with high probability conditioned on paradoxes not happening, which could be plausible depending on the situation.

---
Paradox Threat Algorithm

Suppose you want to factor a large integer n. Receive from your future self the factorization of n as two integers. Confirm by a reliable method that their product is exactly n. If it is, send yourself the same message. If not, send nothing. When using this algorithm on other problems, in order for it to work, there has to be a proof of correctness you can confirm yourself with very very high probability. If you get a statement like ""this Turing machine will never halt"", then you can't enforce the universe's honesty via paradox because you have no way of knowing whether the answer was correct. This algorithm therefore immediately extends to any problem in the intersection of NP and co-NP, because that is exactly the set of decision problems which have short, polynomial time checkable correctness proofs whether the answer is yes or no. You can also compute the solutions to problems in PSPACE, using an Arthur-Merlin interactive proof that is too complicated to discuss here. See the paper ""IP = PSPACE"" by Adi Shamir for details if you are interested and are somewhat familiar with theoretical computer science.

Strictly speaking, even if it worked, it would not prove P = PSPACE. That is a purely mathematical question regarding Turing machines. If it worked it would invalidate the hypothesis that the speed of Turing machines is within a polynomial of the speed of real world computers (unless P = PSPACE, of course, in which case it would just give you something you could have done without time travel).

In chapter 17, HJPEV attempts to use a similar method to factor 181429, a number Anthony Goldstein computed as the product of two prime numbers, which he did not show to Harry. Instead of getting the factors, Harry receives the message ""DO NOT MESS WITH TIME"". He then stops the experiment and does not attempt it or any other like it again. The question is why he failed to factor.

Hypothesis 1: the universe can overwrite itself, and does not have to be consistent. Something very bad happened when Harry further attempted to factor primes, and in that timeline he wrote himself a message telling himself not to do it, preventing that timeline from happening. This does not explain why he did not explain to himself why he should stop.

Hypothesis 2: there is a mechanism in either the universe or with time-turners themselves that detects and prevents such meddling. This certainly explains it, but incurs a complexity penalty for the arbitrariness of time-turners, how they detect and know how to prevent such things, etc, etc.

Hypothesis 3: the consistent universe probability distribution hypothesis is true, and the message was emergent behavior based on that. Ignoring universe consistency, the prior distribution of messages should be uniform, and the number of possible messages is large. The higher the number of messages is, the stronger my claim will be, so conservatively assume that the prior probability of (the message consists of two integers and the smaller is prime and the higher is exactly floor(18429 / firstFactor)) is essentially 1. There are floor(sqrt(18429)) = 135 initial candidates for the lower number, of which 32 are prime, so there are at least 32 plausible messages he could get before taking paradox prevention into account.

The prior probability of getting the right message is at most 1/32. If there is an event with probability significantly higher than 1/32 that would prevent the experiment from proceeding, then it becomes much more likely to happen than the right message being sent. By the anthropic principle, paradoxes are about as unlikely as large amounts of matter popping in and out of existence, so the distribution is conditioned on (an event with prior probability about 31/32) not happening. Even events with low prior probability have high posterior probability if they prevent the paradox from happening and are more likely than the success of the paradox threat algorithm. It intuitively seems to me that the probability of getting the ""DO NOT MESS WITH TIME"" message is actually much lower than 1/32, so this line of reasoning doesn't immediately seem hopeful. However, consider this: the result of the message was that ""[Harry] resolved not to do any more truly brilliant experiments on Time until he was at least fifteen years old."". It is quite likely that if the experiment had been a success, he would have attempted other paradox threats, because if they work then they are a powerful tool, and there's no reason not to use a useful tool unless there's a reason not to use it. The message he got prevented all future experiments Harry might have attempted, at least for a few years. Therefore, in order to be plausible, the probability of the error message only has to be larger than something much smaller than 1/32. I don't think I'd estimate the probability of the error message much lower than 1/10000, and unless Harry got a message like that at some point, he would have used paradox threats that were collectively at least that intense, so this analysis seems to work.

[""Spoiler TSPE""] (#s At at least one point in the story, Dumbledore receives the message ""No"" from himself to prevent himself causing a paradox. This can be explained about equally well by hypothesis 2 or 3, but slightly better by hypothesis 2. It could be that Dumbledore's false perception of time makes it easy for the universe to manipulate him into not attempting to cause paradoxes, or it could be that time turners made him write the message because that's how they work.)

There is a certain line of reasoning used by many fans here (and also a few characters in the story) that is incorrect if the CUPD hypothesis holds. I will illustrate an out-of-story example to avoid spoilers of the later chapters, and to have a clean, simple example.

Steve and Mary each have time turners. Steve wants to steal a bag of money with a dollar sign on it from Mary. Steve plans to observe the room with the money bag until an hour passes without Mary being in the room. Once that happens, he'll go back in time an hour and simply take the money and walk away. He reasons that Mary will be unable to go back in time and catch him in the act, because Steve already observed her not being there, so her going back would be a paradox, which is essentially impossible. Mary has the following policy: she regularly checks if the money bag has been stolen, and if it has, she will go back in time and check on the bag of money to catch whoever attempted to steal it.

The critical fact is that the CONJUNCTION of Mary checking on the money and Steve checking on her not checking on the money is the paradox. It can be resolved by Mary failing to go back, or it can be resolved by Steve observing Mary observing Steve stealing the money. I actually think both are unlikely enough that it is very likely that something else will prevent the situation, like Steve giving up, Mary changing her mind, one of them breaking or losing their time turner, etc. Even if these events are likely enough, it's certainly not obviously the case that Steve will win just because the paradox prevention event happens later in that case. Assuming no third candidate event happens, the two main prevention events will happen with probability proportional to their relative probability.

---
An Experiment

There is a simple test Harry could do to distinguish between hypothesis 2 and 3. Harry sits in a room for one hour and watches the door to see if his future self arrives. He then leaves the room and goes back in time by one hour. He flips a coin a number of times small enough to avoid risk of disastrous paradox prevention events, but large enough for this experiment to be convincing evidence. Let's say five times. If the coin comes up heads every time, then Harry enters the room if and only if he remembers seeing himself enter the room. Otherwise, Harry enters the room if and only if he does NOT remember seeing himself enter the room. In short: he causes a paradox with a ""safety valve"" event which happens with probability 1/32.

If the artificial mechanism hypothesis is true, Harry will at some point in the process receive an intimidating note telling him to abort the plan. If the consistent universe probability distribution hypothesis is true, then the coin will come up heads each time. Ideally, the prior probability Harry fails to go back and follow the policy should be significantly smaller than 1/32. However, if that happens, it would also be evidence of the CUPD rules preventing the paradox threat in a different way.

If Steves always win the above sort of game, then he will likely be unable to go back in time and he will not see his future self in the room during the hour that he is there.

But she is not able to create a cure for alzheimers, which she has no understanding of and doesn't exist yet in the real world. Harry is not able to engage in partial transfiguration until he is able to fully grasp the action he is about to perform in detail that fully rings true in every part of his mind.

We have received numerous hints that spells are related to human intuition - broomsticks operate on aristotlean physics, transfiguration (up until harry) operated on objects, not the little understood atoms underlying them -- less traditional objects like air couldn't even be transfigured (chapter 22). This would also coincide with the evidence that powerful wizards also tend to be extraordinarily intelligent and creative -- they are able to create models of the world in their minds that they find fully believable.

What does this imply for the harry's efforts to bring hermione back from the dead through spell creation? Harry is unusually creative, and due to his scientific knowledge is capable of having different intuitions from the magical community. However, despite his creativity, he is still bound by his beliefs about how the world works, which limits his potential solutions to saving Hermione. Assuming 1) the Methods of Rationality is set to be over after Harry's first year 2) Harry makes an attempt to bring Hermione back from the dead, what does the foregoing argument imply about his attempt to do so? That his comparative advantage in doing so is through using unusual scientific knowledge.

Assuming the previous conclusion, what scientific procedure 1) causes stars to be destroyed 2) the world to end 3) could result in hermione being brought back to life, and yet 4) is a procedure harry is aware of? This forum has previously discussed the possibility that time travel could result in the world to end (in the sense that a non-stable time loop could be formed, if nothing else). Black holes, which can be formed by the destruction of a star, can be used in the creation of a wormhole, which potentially allows a form of time travel. Harry is aware of them in Chapter 90, and references one variant - ""There were theories of time travel under General Relativity (which had seemed much less plausible before Harry had run across Time-Turners)"". Supposing that such a form of time travel did allow a non-stable time loop, harry could relatively easily avoid hermione's death. This path is uniquely open to Harry because he understands science sufficiently (presumably he can understand general relativity to the level that he understands quantum mechanics, which allows him to engage in partial transfiguration)

&gt; Lavender was still nice to her, and Tracey was, um, Tracey, but neither of them were quite relaxing to spend a free hour around; and in any case, neither of those two had stayed over for the Easter hols. (ch. 87)

So, who does that leave? I would expect these mysterious heroes to be either SPHEW members, Chaos Legionnaires, or other officers of Sunshine Army, since ""people likely to be willing to stick their necks out on behalf of Harry and/or Hermione"" are probably going to fall into at least one of those categories (we're ignoring Lesath, since we already know he didn't do anything). I can think of the following: 

* Seamus Finnegan (Chaos Legion) 
* Theodore Nott (Chaos Legion) 
* Blaise Zabini (Chaos Legion / former Sunshine)
* Anthony Goldstein (Sunshine)  
* Ernie Macmillan (Sunshine) 
* Daphne Greengrass (Sunshine / SPHEW) 
* Hannah Abbott (Sunshine / SPHEW) 
* Parvati Patil (Sunshine / SPHEW) 
* Padma Patil (SPHEW) 
* Dean Thomas (ex-Chaos Legion) 

That's ten people, and we have no idea which of them might be on vacation (although odds are good that at least *some* of them are, since most of the school is gone). Some are more likely than others; for example, the Slytherins are rather less likely to behave in classically Gryffindor ways, and at least some of those people probably still believe that Hermione Granger was a murderer. We don't know if they were following Susan and Ron's lead (a case that makes Sunshine participation more likely) or if they were defending Harry as General Chaos (a case that makes Chaos Legion participation more likely). Or, in the simplest case, they all *would* have helped, but three of them weren't there. But if it were that simple, why is it being made a mystery? So I tend to think that it might not be that simple. 

Then, who am I missing? Who participated that we, the readers, aren't allowed to know about yet? 

(Of course, this could just be because it would have been narratively awkward to name them all, or because Harry wasn't paying attention. But I would be interested to see if anyone has any brilliant ideas about it.) 

EDIT: 

It has been [pointed out](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hq9j6/deliberately_missing_names_spoilers_to_ch_93/cax1gdv?context=3) that Dean and Seamus are also specifically mentioned as being absent for the holiday, in chapter 88. I am personally inclined to consider Ernie Macmillan the least likely of the ten names I proposed (since he believes himself to be ""ethically prohibited"" from being Hermione's friend, according to Harry). Crossing him off, along with Dean and Seamus, generates a list of exactly seven: 

* Theodore Nott
* Blaise Zabini
* Daphne Greengrass
* Anthony Goldstein
* Padma Patil
* Parvati Patil
* Hannah Abbott

(Of note: that's three Slytherins, two Ravenclaws, a Gryffindor, and a Hufflepuff; and includes four Sunshine Soldiers, two Chaos Lieutenants, and the Dragon Army's second-in-command. When your Slytherins are acting more Gryffindor than your Gryffindors ... well, it looks like McGonagall has a point.) 

I will register this as my prediction, with ~65% confidence. The other reasonable answer is that they are simply nameless NPCs. As was astutely pointed out by /u/philip1201, random bystanders are a more effective way of conveying the meta-information ""Slytherin-Harry's pessimistic expectations are not actually accurate"" than the same actions from Named Characters would, since we would tend to assume Named Characters are *unusual* rather than representative of the general population.

Here's my question. The mind is obviously a very important component of the magical engine. You can't just build a machine to wave a wand and produce the sound ""Wingardium Leviosa"" and expect it to levitate things--knowledge and intention are of great importance. So what would happen if a wizard cast a spell, brewed a potion, or Apparated while on psychedelics? I'm sure it's been done before in the Wizarding world, and there are probably even Wizard-specific drugs sold in shady apothecaries on Nocturn Alley, but I'd like to hear your takes on how this could affect the casting/mana generation/magical flow process. 

In addition, with all the talk of spell creation going on, it would be interesting to read (hell, or write) a story about a wizard in the '60s who tripped on acid and created a trans-dimensional scrying spell or somesuch.

Let's leave for now the interesting question of how a wand, a human mind, and optionally some words trigger the spell and focus on how one would levitate a physical object.

Intuitively, you give things an upwards push. What does that mean, though?

The matter particles in the object must all experience an equal force in the opposite direction from gravity. Ok, in a computer game that is easy, but in real life?

Suppose you place a tiny field of negative charge -- a virtual electron cloud -- underneath each atom or molecule in the object. This field would repel the electrons in each atom and shove it upwards. So far, so good, but consider the fact that any positively charge ion would be attracted to this field, and any molecule with an electric moment (e.g. water) would reorient itself and possibly be attracted. The side effects would be many!

Suppose we do something with gravity instead? We reduce or reverse gravity for the matter particles in the object. Hmm, now we're really messing things up. Gravitational mass and inertial mass are identical, and have to be so because it's fundamental to how the universe works (General Relativity). So now we have to break this important symmetry (and who knows what will happen), or we're also reducing or reversing inertial mass. How does negative inertial mass work? Plug it into Newton's second law, and you'll see that it doesn't work at all -- if you push something, it'll start moving towards your hand. 

Both electrostatic repulsion and gravity manipulation open a Pandora's box of side effects, and we're only talking about levitation.

**Week #5 results**

*Five basic questions.*

This week there were 54 responses!

The answers to each question:

*How would you rate the fic overall, on the following 7-point scale?*

    1 Awful		 0	 0%
    2 Very bad	 0	 0%
    3 Bad		 0	 0%
    4 Mediocre	 0	 0%
    5 Good		 3	 6%
    6 Very good	22	41%
    7 Amazing	29	54%

*Were you familiar with Eliezer Yudkowsky before reading HPMOR?*

    Yes						11	20%
    No, and I'm still not	 5	 9%
    No, but I am now		36	67%
    Don't know				 2	 4%

*How did you find out about HPMOR?*

(I've categorised the responses, and added a new question to the survey so that later respondents can categorise themselves)

    Non-author-affiliated site	34	63%
    	Reddit					12	22%
    	TV Tropes				 7	13%
    	xkcd forums				 3	 6%
    	A blog					 3	 6%
    Author-affiliated site		 5	 9%
    	LessWrong				 4	 7%

    Friend						 9	17%
    	Facebook				 2	 4%
    Other fanfiction			 2	 4%
    Other						 2	 4%

*Do you prefer the earlier or later chapters?*

    Earlier			 9	17%
    Later			18	33%
    No preference	27	50%

*What's your favourite moment so far?*

    Votes	Chapters
     1		4,9,11,14,20,28,38,39,46,47,56,57,60,63,73,74,78
     2		10,17,74
     5		81
    11		45

* So, clearly everyone who filled in the survey this week likes the damn thing, with a lot of people (29) classifying it as *amazing*.

* Not many people haven't at least looked into Eliezer since reading the fic (5), but most people had to (36).

* Most people (34) found it through a variety of random websites - most popular of those were reddit (12) and TV Tropes (7). Of the others, 9 found it through a friend, 2 through other fanfiction, and 5 through LessWrong or Yudkowsky.net.

* As to whether the better chapters came earlier or later in the fic, 50% expressed no preference, and of the other 27 respondents two-thirds prefer the later chapters.

* Many chapters were nominated as favourites by just one or two respondents, and you can go to the spreadsheet to see the specific moments being referenced, but there are two moments in particular that received several votes. 4 people chose [spoiler](/s ""Harry frightening the dementor"") in Ch81, and 11 chose [spoiler](/s ""the Patronus 2.0 creation"") in Ch45. (It's worth mentioning that this was for many a hard choice and I'm sure there are plenty of moments that would have been promoted up if you could have chosen more than one. But sometimes asking tough questions produces interesting results!)

That's all for this simple analysis. Remember, if you are interested in previous questions many of them have significantly more responses now! The results can be seen by going directly to the spreadsheet and clicking Form &gt; Show summary of responses.

Random Statistic To Entice You In: 18 people (28% of the 64 responses) don't know what philosophical naturalism is!

    More specifically Quirrell is a very interesting character.

	6: 7

There's potential for a rather more in-depth analysis of this data, unearthing correlations, and I really wanted to do it myself but I don't know of any way to make it easy for myself. I wrote a little code that bashed out the table below, but it only gives you an idea of what I was going for.

Anyway, if you want to read my shitty little table, the key's at the bottom and each row tells you what percentage of the people who ticked that answer also ticked the answer at the bottom of the column (so the top right number, for example, tells us 61% of the 18 people who ticked 'science' also ticked 'the writing' - slightly less than the population-wide 67%). I guess the interesting numbers are those that differ significantly from the population-wide percentages in the key. Like we can see that 52% of all respondents particularly enjoy guessing what's coming, but only 44% of those who enjoy the science content.

You can see that I haven't even tried looking for correlations involving more than just pairs of answers.

But that's enough of that.

**Week #5: Five basic questions.**

This week I've added five basic questions that should be fairly self-explanatory.

**How would you rate the fic overall, on the following 7-point scale?**

1. *Awful*
2. Very bad
3. Bad
4. Mediocre
5. Good
6. Very good
7. *Amazing*

**Were you familiar with Eliezer Yudkowsky before reading HPMOR?**

And are you now? By 'familiar' I just mean you know a bit about the things he does besides HPMOR.

**How did you find out about HPMOR?**

I haven't tried to list the possible answers for this one, just describe your route to reading it the first time.

**Do you prefer the earlier or later chapters?**

I think it's not unreasonable to suggest that Eliezer has evolved in how he's writing the fic, so I expect some people prefer the early chapters and some the later ones. Or you might have no such preference.

Preferring the earlier or later chapters doesn't mean you don't like the other!

**What's your favourite moment so far?**

Identify the chapter and specific moment.

Use [this form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFRtbUVFVEtnRWpaYzhGaVF5bGtZVmc6MQ) to answer this question, and answer or modify your answers to previous questions (if you don't enter the same reddit name as before, it will be counted as a separate opinion so *please don't do this if you're answering questions you've answered before* - and even if you aren't if you want your responses to be analysed in relation to each other at some future date) or manually edit your row of the results table [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlaIaUs-ntoPdFRtbUVFVEtnRWpaYzhGaVF5bGtZVmc).

We can interrogate this world just as we do our own, treating the fanfic's assertions as data, Rowling's original series as secondary, slightly shakier data, and our observations of the Real World as tertiary. So let's start brainstorming hypotheses about why magic works in the way it does, and ways of testing these hypotheses. Here are perhaps the ten most immediate questions to answer:

1. How did the magic gene arise, and how does it confer magical and superhuman powers?

2. How do brain-states, words, and motions produce magical effects? Why do they produce the specific effects they do?

3. How and why does 'magical exhaustion' occur? Why is magic so effortful and limited in power, and what is this 'energy' it exhausts?

4. How does transmutation work? Does magic violate conservation laws?

5. How does teleportation work? Does magic allow faster-than-light communication?

6. How does time travel and retrocausation work? Why are there seers, and what makes someone a seer? Why can Time Turners only go back 6 hours, while seers can receive information from more than 6 hours into the future? What happens when paradoxes arise, and what does it mean to be ""erased from time""?

7. Why and how does advanced technology interfere with magic? What specific features of modern devices interfere in this way?

8. Why is magic so superficially intuitive, user-friendly, and simple? Why does it conform so well to our (e.g., Aristotelian) biases and expectations?

9. Why are incantations mostly in broken Latin? Why are a few from Sumerian (Mahasu), Aramaic (Avada Kedavra), French (Morsmordre), Italian (Tarantallegra), Germanic (Langlock, Salvio Hexia), and even modern English (Meteolojinx, Muffliato, Pack, Point Me, Repello Muggletum, Wingardium Leviosa)? How are new spells invented or discovered?

10. Why do almost all magical abilities require magical items? (Wands for spellcasting, various substances for potions.)

To me this seems more like an actual explosion than a release of a soul. The power seems to go in all directions, and separate, rather than taking a form. The story has already stated that wizards seem to have a magical ""battery"", that grows   as they get older. It would be logical to assume that any power left would be released on death.

   This makes magic appear as a limited resource. Possibly the total available magic is also limited, as wizards replenish their magic over time, likely from the area around them. If Atlantis created a supply of magic to be used, or enough for their population, then the amount would be limited. Maybe the magic around earth is the limit instead.

   Well if wizards do store magic, and the supply is limited then we would see trends. Like say magic appearing weaker now that the population has risen. I imagine wizards also rose in population like the rest of the world as time went on. So now you have more people with more batteries fighting over a limited amount of magic, or maybe the limited amount of power the Atlantic machine has. Its posible magic has rose in strength after great wars of disasters, when many wizards have died.

   In which case to strengthen magic you improve the supply, or destroy part of the demand (better not tell the purebloods). So i don't see this pointing to a soul or other presence. Maybe some of the released power forms ghosts (magic pollution/waste?). As far as i can tell from the limited information we have the ""soul"" people think of would be part of the machine or brain, not this release of energy.

Are there any non-obvious interpretations of this prophesy? It seems fairly straightforward, as far as prophesies go.

In my opinion, Dumbledore should reveal the prophesy to Harry. It will likely give even him pause. If he actually cares about billions of blades of grass, he should care about tearing apart the very stars in heaven.

Step right up and test your predictive mettle!

The Rules:

1. Make predictions in top-level comments.
2. Reply to top-level comments with your confidence that the prediction is accurate, from 0%-100%. Explaining your reasoning is optional but encouraged.
3. If someone has already expressed a confidence-level/justification that corresponds to your own, leave a reply to that comment.

Example:

    Prediction: Quirrell is a cylon.
       75% confident. It's just so obvious at this point.
          Yup, I agree.
          Me too. There were just so many obvious hints.
       15% confident. Much more likely he's a Time Lord.
    Prediction: Rocks fall everyone dies
        40% confident. Seems like the next logical step at this point.

This is just circumstantial evidence of course, and the blood is quickly replaced, but it makes me wonder how many drops of blood (usually defined in medicine as [.1 to .05 mL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_%28unit%29)) you would need to sacrifice before there could even be a measurable difference.

----

**Week #6 results**

*How many times have you read all the way through?*

This week there were 50 responses.

    1		 9	18%
    2		17	34%
    3/4		17	34%
    5-10	 5	10%
    11-20	 1	 2%
    &gt;20		 1	 2%

There was some noise associated with how people interpreted the question, judging by the additional text responses given (whether to count listening to the podcast, or being half-way through a readthrough) but it's safe to say that most people have read it more than once, but no more than 4 times.

Plenty of people mentioned reading individual chapters many more times, which doesn't surprise me.

Apparently one person's read it nearly 30 times. Crikey! Now go read something else O.o

Random Statistic From Whole Survey: A total of 159 responses have now been recorded so far (although 33 haven't been back since answering the first question).

----

**Week #7: What else do you read?**

So I'm interested in the general reading habits of HPMOR readers. I've decided the best way to figure that out would be to ask about your last year's reading.

a) How many books have you read in the last year?

 - Don't count HPMOR
 - Don't count short stories (we're talking at least like 50 pages here)
 - If you've read 5 books but they were like *this big*, good for you, put 5 and let us know!

b) What genres were they?

c) On a scale of 1-4, how important would you say reading is to you, in general? (Or, if you like, how much of 'a reader' are you?)

1. Not important
2. Slightly important
3. Very important
4. Extremely important

1348320613.0,10,self.HPMOR,10ao7v,Wounds in the World and the Tale of the Three Brothers reveal new method of creating powerful magical artifacts/rediscovering ancient magics (PS: spoilers for the Stanford Prison experiment arc and events preceding such).,14,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/10ao7v/wounds_in_the_world_and_the_tale_of_the_three/,"Alright, so basically while reading the Stanford Prison experiment, part 4 or 5 I think, Harry demonstrates that not only can one hide from a physical manifestation of Death itself using a Deathly Hollow, but that these manifestations of Death, these wounds in the world are conscious in a sense resembling and maybe even more completely than the Sorting Hat itself had demonstrated in earlier chapters. 

Not only that, they operate as undying autonomous agents in and of there own right that operate in acknowledgement of self-preservation and exercise the ability to keep secrets, as demonstrated by the fact that Harry could strong arm them into not revealing additional information about him to the Aurors during this same chapter.

Now we go back to the Tale of the Three Brothers how overcome Death itself and Death, feeling cheated for not recieving another life but being clever, says he will give a gift to each of the Brothers, knowing that such extravagant gifts will likely bring about their inevitable down fall. And thus, the Deathly Hollows were born and all but the but one of the Brothers soon came to die at the hands of Death.

The similarities between this and Harry's own interaction with the Dementors and the original Beedle the Brax tale are immense as the strong arming of Death personified as an independent, intelligent agent is demonstrated, overcome, and bartered with for personal gain in some form or another after denying Death another life.

So, I propose for the consideration of my fellow Conspirators the theory that, much like how Salazar had tried to overcome the Interdict of Merlin using Paseltongue and an undying snake, Harry will now have the capacity to access ancient magical knowledge and even specialized artifacts from Death itself given these recent developments.

Do unbreakable vows affect the soul or the body? See, I was wondering what would happen if you made an unbreakable vow to never create a horcrux, and then made a horcrux. Obviously, the vow doesn't come into play until after horcrux has been made. But once the horcrux was made, wouldn't that protect you from death? (Sure, you may lose your body, but ...)

So, I see three possibilities. One: unbreakable vows only affect your body. This means that using horcruxes could also be a way to get around unbreakable vows. Bound by a vow you no longer wish? Prepare a resurrection ritual and then off your body.

Two: It affects your whole soul (regardless of where parts of it may reside). In my hypothetical case above: creating a horcrux would ""kill"" your soul, and your horcrux wouldn't save you. This implies a way to kill Voldemort without having to find all of the hidden horcruxes. 

Three: It affects the parts of the soul that you are in possession with. For example, if you already have a horcrux, and then make an unbreakable vow and break it, the part of your soul still in your body dies (i.e. the same as what happens to a horcrux when destroyed), but the part of your soul that is in the horcrux survives. Presumably that part of the soul could still be resurrected. This brings up questions about partial-souls that were never really addressed by JKR or by EY.

*The existence of ghosts, portraits, the dementor's kiss, and the resurrection stone are evidence that souls exist.
*Dumbledore's belief that souls exist is not to be discarded lightly, given that he is extremely intelligent and well-read, knows many hidden secrets and has seen so much death.
*[Ch.89](Hermione suddenly convulsed, her arms twitching into the air as though reaching up for something, and her eyes flew open again. There was a burst of something that was magic and also more, a shout louder than an earthquake and containing a thousand books, a thousand libraries, all spoken in a single cry that was Hermione; too vast to be understood, except that Harry suddenly knew that Hermione had whited out the pain, and was glad not to be dying alone. For a moment it seemed like the outpouring of magic might hold, take root in the castle's stone; but then the outpouring ended and the magic faded, her body stopped moving and all motion halted as Hermione Jean Granger ceased to exist)

*The main argument against seems to be that physical brain damage happens. Are we even sure this is the case? Wizards do have enhanced resistance to head trauma from bludgers etc. Although that would imply that wizards have souls and soul-based cognition while muggles are wetware-only...

If souls are not real, it should be 'easy' to resurrect Hermione - her brain is fully intact (oxygenation potion was in the blood in her brain before her heart stopped, and she was chilled before the potion could run out.)
If souls are real, restarting the body would presumably produce a dementor-kissed-like stupor. You would need to find her soul which is either on Earth (as a ghost?), waiting to pass on (Like the train station in canon), or in whatever afterlife/soul storage plane there might be.

The wards of Hogwarts seem rather awkward in the past dozen or so chapters. In Time Pressure, Harry kills the Troll, later revealed to have been considered the Defense Professor by the wards. Dumbledore had the wards triggered when Hermione died, but was not warned when the Defense Professor was killed by Harry. I have to make the assumption that if the wards could trigger on the death of a student, that the wards would also trigger and tell him upon the death of a professor, since Dumbledore arrived at the scene knowing that a student had died. If that is true, why didn't Dumbledore react when the Defense Professor!Troll died? 

My two current thoughts on this question is that either Hogwarts would only trigger the wards when a professorship becomes unfilled, and at the time there was still Defense Professor Quirell(This possibility seems moronic, and if true should have told Dumbledore which student had died), or that the Troll didn't die when Harry turned it's brain into acid.

Somebody powerful enough to get a troll past the wards let a troll kill Hermione. Suppose it was Quirrellmort.

The only reason Filch would be the one to find the troll was that he was supposed to. Filch is the least magical person in Hogwarts and therefore the one who is the least likely to stop the troll when he sees it (the timing would fit by the way, that zombie-voldi had possessed him).

Because it happens when everyone is in the great hall Quirrellmort can be sure that: a) Harry finds out b) everyone else stays out of the way (since he knows the troll is on some roof and everyone will stay in the great hall).
If he wants Harry to find out, he probably wants Harry to find her (everyone thinks it’s in the dungeon don’t they). – At this point he must suspect that Harry will go alone (because everyone else is a good person and therefore do nothing). 
At the same time the troll can only be stopped by Abracadabra so he might even get Harry to show his real potential.

As it turns out Hermione dies and Harry abracadabras his soul a little so as to be more him then Dumbi.
-Turns out it was a very nice day.
Then the divination professor basically says “He is here who will tear apart your Horcrux in space and will end this world.” – That’s when he realises he has screwed up.

As soon as they exhale, the molecules from this lungful of air begin to rapidly diffuse. One of these molecules may then be inhaled by another wizard who then time-travels another few hours, taking the molecule back further.

There are at least three wizards in Hogwarts who are capable of time travel (Harry, Margaret Bulstrode, Dumbledore), two of who do so regularly (Harry, Margaret). Two of them will occasionally be in close proximity shortly before and after time travel events (Defence class, hallways, Chapter 61). Despite this, we have not observed any time travel attempts inexplicably fail, as would be the result of someone having an air molecule in their lungs that had already been through six hours of time travel and could not go back more.

Is it more likely that this is important information about the time travel restrictions (air molecules are ignored) or that it's just an overlooked detail?

EDIT: After some comments pointed out that I'm not quantum physicsing right, the important part is that information propagates through reality really, *really* fast and that this doesn't match the time travel rules we've heard, not that there are ""individual bits of matter"" going places. So the TL;DR for the first option should be closer to ""Magic refuses to set up patterns in the wave function which match certain parameters, and the patterns *must be* more complex than simple entanglements"".

Whoever had created house elves in the first place had been unspeakably evil, obviously; but that didn't mean Hermione was doing the right thing now by denying sentient beings the drudgery they had been shaped to enjoy.

-Harry considering house elves in chapter 42

Was the creation of house elves evil? Why? Here's why I think not:

Humans historically have had to eat food, and evolution has shaped us to want to. We innately enjoy food.

Just think about food. What if it wasn't necessary anymore. Imagine giving it up. Would you miss it? Can you imagine if eating was suddenly just mechanical, a chore? We enjoy food, we have a favourite food, we like trying new foods, we create different food combinations, food can have fond associations, memories, experiences, it can be a source of delight, stimulation, mystery, exploration, a test of skill, a hobby. Now imagine being a house elf, and having *a whole new experience* that means this much to you. House work!

It actually seems to me *incredibly sensible* to create subsets of humans which enjoy, in the same way we enjoy food, doing something that's actually beneficial to others (unlike eating!). It's engineered symbiosis. It's not evil, it's *brilliant*!

If one day we no longer needed to eat (pick your sci-fi reason), what function would the enjoyment of it serve any more? It would be entirely selfish, and pointless. A game. Which is fine, by the way, it would still be fun to make new foods and to try to prove to others how good at making food we are, etc. But wouldn't something with utility achieve all that, and *more*?",,False,self,t5_2t5xf,False,,chaos,True,t3_z6887,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/z6887/ch42_on_house_elves/,

&gt; ""You turned into a cat! A SMALL cat! You violated Conservation of Energy! That's not just an arbitrary rule, it's implied by the form of the quantum Hamiltonian! Rejecting it destroys unitarity and then you get FTL signalling! And cats are COMPLICATED! A human mind can't just visualise a whole cat's anatomy and, and all the cat biochemistry, and what about the neurology? How can you go on thinking using a cat-sized brain?""

The paragraph above has often been taken to prove that magic is truly supernatural and not bound by a tangible material universe and its physical laws. (And for this, I'm going by a legal definition of tangible. Software is tangible under the law, for example.) 

Unfortunately, this conclusion carries two unspoken and unwarranted assumptions with it:

* Harry and/or the reader has all of the pertinent information
* Harry and/or the reader understands all of the science involved

One must remember that when we are confronted by a situation where Clarke's 3rd law may be relevant, that we probably do not have all of the relevant data. 21st century 1st world humans are capable of feats that a stone aged human would liken to telepathy. (Making cell phone calls.) 21st century humans can accomplish feats of godlike legend. (Levitating huge inanimate objects that weigh as much as many boulders or several of the largest trees, or healing deadly diseases by administering a shot.)

Just as a stone aged human would have no way of observing and not even a conception of bacteria, electricity, or radio waves -- for all the reader knows, there are mechanisms that conserve McGonagall's mass-energy that Harry doesn't have the means of observing nor the background to immediately understand. Going back to maglev trains as a metaphor -- to a stone age human, such a massive thing floating above its track would seem to violate the natural state of the world and require the act of a god. In time, she or he could learn that he same electromagnetic forces that allow one to stand on one's feet on the ground are holding the train up. 

In fact, you can think of Clarke's 3rd Law as blithe way of saying: ""When confronted with a sufficiently advanced technology, you will not have all of the pertinent information to understand it, you will not even have the mental models required to understand it, and in fact, you probably will not even be able to figure out the right questions to ask to start figuring those out.""

But what if Harry tried the following experiment:

Harry asks a Ravenclaw for a number N such that N=pq where p and q are distinct primes. Harry then goes into his trunk, draws a paper-sized rectangle on the floor in front of him, and closes his eyes for 2 minutes. When he opens them, he does the following:  
1. If he does not see a piece of paper in the rectangle, he goes back in time 2 minutes and sends himself a blank piece of paper, then leaves the trunk.  
2. If he sees a piece of paper inside the rectangle containing two primes that *do* multiply to the given integer, he sends a paper with those numbers on it back to himself, then leaves the trunk.  
3. Otherwise, he immediately leaves his trunk.

Harry precommits to all of the above rules and is prepared to follow them.

Now, these 3 outcomes encompass anything that might happen. Possibilities 1 and 3 do not lead to a stable loop, so they cannot happen. Therefore, 2 must happen. The problem with Harry's original plot was that he did not account for what might happen if a wildcard comes up; for example, a note reading ""DO NOT MESS WITH TIME."" Here, he can precommit to saying ""all wildcards will result in me not sending anything back,"" which means that something arbitrary *can't* show up, or else the loop is unstable.

Does this seem to work? What can happen that will make it so that Harry can't factor large numbers instantaneously? What other experiments can you devise?

It seems to me inventing a spell is a lot like defining a function when programming. The inventor reserve a particular namespace (incantation) to a specific callable piece of magical code which is reusable for future wizards and witches. However, if we allow this shallow analogy to continue, the magic engine of Atlantis would most likely have some sort of resource limitation as memory limit for a running program. Many languages have this garbage collection feature, to free up memory from deferenced  functions, objects, etc. So I wonder, if the magic system in MOR would also handle similar situations. 

Say, a wizard invented a spell, but did not pass this piece of knowledge on to future generations, the spell became lost in history. It is only reasonable to expect the magic core  to recognize the fact that this spell is no longer accessible by any magic users and free up the resources it takes to maintain its existence. Otherwise, there would be a dead-weight entry stored in the magic engine, forever wasting resources. 

Of course, we need to assume two things for this garbage collection system to exist. First, the whole magic system is designed by humans, and its capacity constrained in some fashion so that some recycling of resources is needed.  Secondly, we'd assume spells are not hardcoded into the law of the universe, therefore allowing the purpose of a spell to be deleted or overwritten. 

If we accept the possibility of a garbage collection system, we'd take the literal meaning when characters or books say powerful spells are lost. They may be in fact, lost, or recycled in other words. This could be the truth, as powerful spells are most likely the resource intensive ones from the perspective of a magical engine.

&gt;And Father had finished by saying that plays like this were always unrealistic, because if the playwright had known what someone actually as smart as Light would actually do, the playwright would have tried to take over the world himself instead of just writing plays about it.

&gt;That was when Father had told Draco about the Rule of Three, which was that any plot which required more than three different things to happen would never work in real life. Father had further explained that since only a fool would attempt a plot that was as complicated as possible, the real limit was two.

To me, this would seem to imply that if we want to come up with fiction that reasonably models reality (or perhaps a fanfic that reasonably models its source), we should change no more than three things and follow them through to their (logical) conclusion.

Now whether EY indeed intended for HPMOR to be based on only a small number of changes from the original, I won't guess at. Nonetheless, I thought it would be interesting if we could pinpoint the root causes of HPMOR branching off from HP.

The obvious first point is rational!Lily Potter casting some sort of beautification spell on her sister Petunia. This decision cascaded into Petunia marrying Micheal Verres rather than Vernon Dursley, and HJPEV growing up reading books rather than sulking in the cupboard under the stairs at 4 Privet Drive. Not sure if we can trace this action of rational!Lily's back any further.

This doesn't, however, explain how rational!Quirrell=Monroe=?Voldemort=??Riddle turned out as he did. This branch-off from canon likely occurs some time around 1970, or even during Riddle's school time. I find it rather unlikely that canon!Harry would not have heard of David Monroe throughout all seven books. Still, inventing a whole new character who ends up filling the same role of Hogwarts Defense Professor as canon!Quirrell just doesn't seem neat enough for EY. Perhaps I'm missing something, but I'm finding it rather difficult to pinpoint where this branch occurred.

Can you guys think of any more points where HPMOR breaks from canon, that cannot be traced back to one of these causes?

tl;dr:
Fiction should only assume like 2 or 3 things. Lily made Petunia pretty, which made Harry smart. Also something happened with Quirrell/Monroe.

Any ideas?

edit: There are obviously more small differences than I'd realized. I then stumbled upon this from the [author's notes](https://www.evernote.com/pub/adelenedawner/Eliezer#b=90390ce2-1356-4522-959e-a300957704c5&amp;st=p&amp;n=f3753a14-3e72-4543-ae0e-de5bb33b5055) to Chapter 33-34:

&gt;A word on the rules this fic follows. It is not a strict single point of departure. Changes from the original Harry Potter universe may occur for any of the following reasons:

&gt;1) Changes growing out of the fic's single point of departure - a single event that happened differently, at some point in the past. For example, Petunia seems to have married a scientist.

&gt;2) Changes that smooth over the seams of the universe. When Rowling wrote the first book, it seems likely that she had not yet decided that there was a systematic, reliable curse on the Defense position. But of course, if the curse really had been operating for decades, everyone would have noticed and would be expecting something to go wrong with Professor Quirrell.

&gt;3) Changes that result from taking a hypothesis more seriously. For example, if Harry Potter had really saved the whole nation on October 31st, 1981, wouldn't politicians invite him to ceremonies marking the 10th anniversary?

&gt;4) Changes to the laws of magic so that, y'know, there are some. There are stories which can get away with having the laws of magic be unclear, because they are part of the background setting rather than the plot. This is not one of those stories.

&gt;5) Changes that result from this not being a children's book. Writing a children's book is much harder than writing a story for grownups. I can't do it. Therefore this is a story for grownups... and that means it is impossible that an evil Peter Pettigrew is hiding out as Scabbers, the pet rat of an enemy wizarding family. In a children's book, this can be taken in passing. In a story for grownups, it would mean Pettigrew was holding the Idiot Ball. It is a general law of MoR that no one is ever holding the Idiot Ball.

&gt;6) Changes that result from a general philosophy of upgrading obstacles to match the more powerful protagonist. One illustration of this is that in Goblet of Fire, there is a point where canon!Harry on a broomstick faces a dragon called the Hungarian Horntail... which in Ch. 16 of Methods is said to breathe fire quickly and accurately enough to melt a Snitch in midflight, implying that canon!Harry would have gotten roasted in an instant if he'd tried the same thing in this universe. But of course the Triwizard Tournament could not possibly take place the same way in this universe, because this is not a children's story, and in a grownup story that plan would require Lord Voldemort to be holding the complete set of all seven Idiot Balls.

&gt;7) Changes that are required to make the fic artistically complete when seen against the background of Harry Potter fanfiction, such as including at least one completely wrong ship.

Many of the small changes to magic and the universe can be encapsulated by 2-7. So it seems like the central changes to Harry and Voldemort can be traced back to one point of departure.

The villain has a respectable public persona, but his secret identity is associated with pure evil (assuming Quirrell is Voldemort[spoiler](/s "", which he is"")), and it is widely believed that said secret identity no longer exists. He is vaguely transhumanist, way smarter the rest of society, and is one of the most powerful magic-users around (although this is not widely known). His sinister plan involves manipulating people on both sides of a conflict and befriending the protagonist.

The protagonist is a trainee at a magic-related institution. There was a prophecy about him, and there were already high expectations about him when he entered the magic-using world, although many are also vaguely scared of him. He quickly fulfilled those expectations, accomplishing great things and becoming a quite powerful magic-user. He has a God complex, and is extremely arrogant.

The administration of the institution that he is a trainee at are, to a certain extent, stooges for the corrupt government, but also generally wiser and more ethical than the government. The head of the administration is very old, often says wise-sounding things that don't always make sense, but other times he does appear to know what he's doing. Along with the villain, he is one of the most powerful magic-users alive.

The female lead gets a lot of powerful people seriously pissed off at her. Her life ends up in danger, and the villain uses this as a tool with which to manipulate the protagonist (in the case of MoR, this part is speculation, but seems well-founded).

Methods of Rationality looks a lot like what would happen if you made Anakin a lot smarter and more rational, and then set Star Wars in the Potterverse. My leading hypothesis is that these seemingly-eerie parallels are the result of there being a lot of fiction out there, with many common tropes, and the ability of human brains to see patterns where there are none.

**Week #8 results**

*Where do you live?*

This week there were 46 responses. A special thanks to those thoughtful Americans who thought I needed a lesson in standard state abbreviations...

There were 12 entries that used the anonymous date/time/random-word idea for replacing the username, 10 of which filled the whole survey out, so I'm a bit concerned that it seems unlikely they were all first-time respondents which means they now have two sets of answers in the results... So just a reminder I guess, if you submit a response under a different username, please don't fill in anything you've answered before.

Anyway, the results:

    Votes   Countries
      25     USA
       4     UK
       2     Finland, Germany, Norway
       1     Australia, Belarus, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France,
               India, Ireland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine.

And since most Americans also listed their state:

    Votes   States
       4     Florida
       3     California, Michigan
       2     Alabama, Oregon
       1     Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota,
               North Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Washington.

There were about 5 comments explaining that they either used to live elsewhere, or now do, and I guess it is a pretty vague question. Do we care more about where people were born, raised, currently live, lived for most of the life, found out about HPMOR, or what?

Anyway, as we can see half the respondents are American, but half come from various countries around the globe. 18 from Europe (+1 from Russia not sure if that's Europe). 1 from India, 1 from Australia, 1 from Canada.

None from South America, Africa, the Middle-east, or East Asia, though.

**Week #7 results**

*What else do you read?*

This week there were 40 responses.

a) How many books have you read in the last year?

    0		 0	 0%
    1		 0	 0%
    2		 2	 5%
    3/4		 2	 5%
    5-10	 7	18%
    11-20	 8	20%
    &gt;20		21	53%

3 quarters of respondents read more than 10 books over the year, with over half reading more than 20, but perhaps we should be surprised that nearly a quarter (11) didn't even read 10 books?

b) What genres were they?

In order or popularity (from the choices I made available):

    Fantasy				35	88%
    Science fiction		34	85%
    Science				21	53%
    Philosophy			19	48%
    Adventure			16	40%
    Graphic novels		12	30%
    History				11	28%
    Crime				10	25%
    Thriller			 8	20%
    Historical			 7	18%
    Teenage				 6	15%
    Health &amp; Lifestyle	 5	13%
    Horror				 5	13%
    Romance				 5	13%
    Tragedy				 5	13%
    Children's			 4	10%
    Humour				 3	8%
    Family saga			 3	8%
    Religion			 2	5%
    Biographical		 2	5%
    Politics			 1	3%

There were also 7 'other' responses, which were:

    Maths
    nonfiction
    nonfiction, academic
    Social sciences
    Cooking
    Feminism

Science fiction and fantasy were clearly the favourite genres, with 31 out of 40 respondents having read both this year, and only 2 having read neither.

c) On a scale of 1-4, how important would you say reading is to you, in general? (Or, if you like, how much of 'a reader' are you?)

    1		 0	 0%
    2		 1	 3%
    3		14	35%
    4		25	63%

Nobody responded that reading wasn't important to them, with only one person opting for 'slightly important'. Seems...interesting...to me that people can read only 3/4 books over a year and still consider it very important! Maybe they had a busy year, or maybe they were referring to reading something other than 'books'. The respondent who put 'very important' rather than 'slightly' important' out of the two who only read 2 books did leave a comment saying ""I do a lot of short-form reading"".

Random Statistic From Whole Survey: The number of people having read through HPMOR only once has nearly doubled from last week's 9, to 17, bringing it just behind 'twice' and '3/4 times' (up to 21 and 20 respectively, both from 17).

&gt;Suppose I told you that I met a student at Hogwarts, not already part of our circle of acquaintances, who called you a ‘flawless instrument of death’ and said that I was your ‘one weak point’. What would you say about him? It didn’t take very long after that for an owl to bring Draco the reply.
&gt;
&gt;My beloved son:
&gt;
&gt;I would say that you had been so fortunate as to meet someone who enjoys the intimate confidence of our friend and valuable ally, Severus Snape.

I'm not sure what to take away from this at all.  


2\. From chapter 17:

&gt;The Remembrall was glowing bright red in his hand, blazing like a miniature sun that cast shadows on the ground in broad daylight.

and later in the chapter:

&gt;""More importantly, why did the Remembrall go off like that?"" Harry said. ""Does it mean I've been Obliviated?""
&gt;
&gt;""That puzzles me as well,"" Professor McGonagall said slowly. ""If it were that simple, I would think that the courts would use Remembralls, and they do not. I shall look into it, Mr. Potter."" She sighed. ""You can go now.""

Again, I have no ideas.  


3\. From chapter 20:

&gt;""Harry... you must realize that if you choose this man as your teacher and your friend, your first mentor, then one way or another you will lose him, and the manner in which you lose him may or may not allow you to ever get him back.""
&gt;
&gt;That hadn’t occurred to Harry. But there was that jinx on the Defense position... one which had apparently worked with perfect regularity for decades...
&gt;
&gt;""Probably,"" said Professor Quirrell quietly, ""but he will have the full use of me while I last.""
&gt;
&gt;Dumbledore sighed. ""I suppose it is economical, at least, since as the Defense Professor you’re already doomed in some unknown fashion.""
&gt;
&gt;Harry had to work hard to suppress his expression as he realized what Dumbledore had actually been implying.

Did Dumbledore imply that because Harry is choosing Quirrell as his mentor the professor is doomed? If so, why? Any other ideas?  

  

4\. From chapter 21:

&gt;""HE IS COMING,"" said a huge hollow voice that cut through all conversation like a sword of ice. ""THE ONE WHO WILL TEAR APART THE VERY -""

I'm on my first read-through, and I am having a terrible time having any sympathy for Harry's position on Azkaban (or much else, honestly, but this is about Azkaban). He wants to destroy Azkaban, and is extremely upset that Dumbledore says he cannot.

So he wants to... just set everyone free? The murderers and rapists? Just free? Then what? He doesn't propose any ideas on how to then hold wizards who can do wandless magic, or who can turn into beetles (or even smaller things). I get that he is upset and that he sees it as torture, and I'm inclined to agree. But then what? And why doesn't anyone call him on it? Because he's a moody 11 year old?

Was he really expecting the Headmaster to just say ""Oh yeah, let's go take on the entire wizard government to release some rapists. That sounds like a great idea!"" ?

Does it not cross anyone's mind to say that they might want to look at getting rid of Azkaban through political channels instead of starting a war?

Anywho, anyone have some clarity to throw my way? Or maybe I missed a paragraph where any of the above is explained as anything more than an 11 year old's rant that for some reason people listen to? Or that it is brought up in a future chapter? (knowing my luck, it's all in the very next chapter I'll read tonight ;) )

Unrelated, but the same chapter... does anyone buy that Dumbledore would be fooled by the time turner thing for a minute? Or that that simple and obvious test was the only one he would use? Or that Severus doesn't know you can basically buy time from within the Slytherin house?

We know that fire and acid confuse a troll's regenerative powers [1], but we can also deduce that it only works on a wound that fire or acid inflicted, rather than confusing the troll's entire regenerative system. This is because the troll started to regenerate after the rock, which occurred after Fred and George used fire on the troll. [2] [3] So clearly it was still able to regenerate in some capacity despite having been attacked with fire.

So with that in mind, we can deduce the following:

1: Fire and acid stop the troll regenerating only wounds inflicted by fire or acid.

2: The Sword of Gryffindor stopped the troll regenerating the wound it inflicted. [4]

So, either the Sword of Gryffindor has powers we don't know about, or the ""fire and acid"" thing was an incomplete piece of knowledge. Since Quirrell said it, that seems unlikely...though it's also possible that Quirrell knew certain ancient artifacts could stop a troll's regeneration, but didn't bother to mention it because it was a useless piece of information, like sunlight; one typically doesn't have ancient magical artifacts in their possession when encountering mountain trolls. 

Any ideas?

[1]: Fire and acid will produce scar tissue which can temporarily confuse a troll's regenerative powers - for an hour or two!

[2]: ""Fire and acid! "" Harry shouted. ""Use fire or acid! ""

""Fuego!"" / ""Incendio!"" Harry heard, but he wasn't looking...

[3]: The enemy's head was already beginning to regenerate, the ragged stump of the jaw and spine smoothing over, the mouth completing itself and replacing its teeth.

[4]: ...the sword sliced off the troll's right arm through the elbow...

First an foremost, and speedily correct me if I'm wrong, I have only found the broad term *""muggle technology""* used in this context, as opposed to *""electrical technology""*, which is not evidence against Hypothesis A, but certainly makes the sin of assuming Hypothesis A the only one available all the more problematic. The other thing that should caution us, is the difficulty rationalist Harry experiences with his first experiments about the nature of magic. *Magic seems to behave in a way that does not exactly align with the muggle physic's understanding of the world.* The final problem is that we have no idea if magic **generally** affects magic, or if certain properties of certain spells do so **specifically**! Muggle technology not working in Hogwarts could be the result of the *large variety of spells and wards* flying about, that the probability that technology disrupting spells being among them is sufficient to disrupt it on the whole.


So, what other factors, beside electromagnetism, could interfere with muggle technology (MT)?

Hypothesis B: Magic does not generally disrupt MT, time dilation caused by certain magics does.

Hypothesis C: Magic does not generally disrupt MT, microscopic space distortion caused by certain magics does.

Hypothesis D: Magic generally disrupts MT, because magic can (seemly) disregard the laws of physics.

###**Spoilers**
 
We begin this speculation with quotes from Chapter 84.

&gt;Bones - ""But your House - there are not many Ancient Houses remaining -""  
&gt;Quirrell - ""It shall matter little to this country whether eight Ancient Houses remain, or seven.""

We learn that there are 8 houses, including the House which has either died in the Wizarding War or remains in ""Quirrell"". We already know a few of these for sure as they are referenced as Noble multiple times. They are:

* Longbottom
* Greengrass
* Malfoy
* Potter
* The Lost House

To me, these are the only ones that are certain. In regards to [the most recent OP](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/14xdvf/identifying_the_noble_hero_the_eight_noble_houses/)'s ""Astorga"" passage, I'd say that Jaime is only being threatened with points reduction because Greengrass is an equal in Hogwarts House, but holds gender *as well as* nobility preference over him. This would therefore be read as Astorga **not** being a Noble House

The ""Lord Jugson"" assertion is more murky due to two things. First, as mentioned before me, the Wizengamot is addressed as ""Lords and Ladys"", however, second, the Jugsons are referenced in another chapter as over 500 years old, and third he's the only person thus far addressed as ""Lord"" other than the elder Malfoy. I'd say with some certainty that the House Jugson is on our list.

The Black family is another questionable surname. They are without a doubt Most Ancient, however, they are more accurately the ""Most Ancient and *Disgraced* House"" with the majority being publicly tried criminals and the house being bankrupted (iirc). Be that as it may, it may also not preclude them from holding their place on our list of Noble Houses. Humor me and lets put them up there.

Our list stands at:

* Longbottom
* Greengrass
* Malfoy
* Potter
* Jugson
* Black
* The Lost House
* Number 8?

There are also quite a few others being posited. The Nott family, the Lestranges, Bones, and I'm sure there's more. Lets move on to chapter 86.

&gt;And Moody told them who the Department of Magical Law Enforcement thought 'Quirinus Quirrell' really was. A seemingly ordinary Hogwarts student (though talented enough that he'd been only narrowly beaten out for the Head Boy position) who'd gone vacationing in Albania after his graduation, disappeared, returned after 25 years, and then been caught up in the Wizarding War -

&lt;Insert everything we know from chapter 84 here\&gt;

&gt;""It was murdering the House of Monroe that made Voldie's name,"" Moody said. ""Until then, he was just another Dark Wizard with delusions of grandeur and Bellatrix Black. But after that -"" Moody snorted. ""Every fool in the country flocked to serve him. You would've hoped the Wizengamot would turn serious, once they realized Voldie was willing to kill their own sacred selves. And that's just what the bastards did - hope that some other bastard would turn serious. None of the cowards wanted to step in front. *It was Monroe, Crouch, Bones, and Longbottom*. That was nearly everyone in the Ministry who'd dare say a word that might give Voldie offense.""

&gt;""That was how your House came to be ennobled, Mr. Potter,"" injected the solemn voice of Professor McGonagall. ""There is an ancient law that if anyone ends a Most Ancient House, whoever avenges that blood will be made Noble. To be sure, the House of Potter was already older than some lines called Ancient. But yours was titled a Noble House of Britain after the end of the war, in recognition that you had avenged the Most Ancient House of Monroe.""

With the previous two passages, we can now update our Houses to:

* Longbottom
* Greengrass
* Malfoy
* Potter
* Jugson
* Black
* Monroe
* Number 8?

But wait, this could not possibly be the case. Harry himself speculated on the subject in this chapter: 

&gt;And if the Defense Professor was David Monroe, or could convincingly appear to be David Monroe, then Lord Voldemort technically hadn't exterminated the House of Monroe. In which case somebody might be able to pass a Wizengamot resolution revoking the Noble status of House Potter, which had been granted for avenging the Most Ancient House of Monroe.

Here, I will admit that I intentionally wrote my previous list incorrectly so I could bring attention to Harry's comment here and Quirrell's comment back at the top. According to Quirrell, if the Monroe line is dead, then there are only 7. If it is not, there are 8. According to McGonagall and Harry, if the Monroe line is dead, then the House Potter has avenged them, so there are now 8 with Potter replacing Monroe. If the Monroe line is NOT dead, then there are *still* 8 with Monroe instead of Potter as there would be no extinct line to avenge. From this, it seems obvious that Quirrell could not be including both Monroe and Potter in his 8. I could be very wrong though

Our actual list of Noble Houses is therefore:

* Longbottom
* Greengrass
* Malfoy
* Monroe OR Potter
* Jugson
* Black
* Number 7?
* Number 8?

Which means that there are still two spots left open. 

Now, lets return to Moody's response above, where I emphasized. He mentions ""It was Monroe, Crouch, Bones, and Longbottom..."" We know that two of those four are definitely on the list of Noble Houses. Based off of [this list of Pure Bloods](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Pureblood#Known_pure-bloods) and the Crouch's political affiliations, it stands to reason that the Crouchs could be among the Noble Houses, however, in canon, surely the senior Crouch would have used the Lord title. As to the Bones, they are not on the list of purebloods, however the parts we currently know about are definitely most honorable and worthy of the title. In canon, I would expect that the Daily Prophet would mention either family as being Noble, so it stands to reason that in HPMOR, the Noble houses do not reflect those of in canon,  so we should not use that as a reference point. 

Since we have no foot to stand on from a MOR!canon historical perspective, lets instead look at this from a literary angle. It is obvious that the story is semi-self-aware and is obscuring but not avoiding legitimate literary cliches

&gt;It is kind of obvious, though, observed his Slytherin part. I mean, do you actually believe that under natural circumstances, anyone would end up as the last heir to a Most Ancient House AND Lord Voldemort killed his family AND he has to avenge his martial arts sensei? If anything I'd say he went too far over the top in setting up his new identity as the ideal literary hero. That sort of thing doesn't happen in real life.

&gt;This from an orphan who was raised unaware of his heritage, commented Harry's Inner Critic. With a prophecy about him. You know, I don't think we've ever read a story about two equally destined heroes competing to see who's cliched enough to take down the villain 

Given this point, I want to look at the list of Noble Houses in the manner of good versus bad. This is just my opinion and probably wrong.

* Good
  * \*Longbottom
  * \*Greengrass
  * \* Monroe OR Potter
  * Crouch
  * Bones
* Bad
  * \*Malfoy
  * \*Jugson
  * \*Black
  * Lestrange
  * Nott
* Uncertain
  * One or Two Other or Yet Unknown Houses

The above is simply my analysis. Stars obviously designate those already on the list. Crouch is the only House I have reservations about but only because I don't recall them even being in HPMOR thus far other than in passing, though they did defend against Voledmort from the beginning.  Even though the current possible last in line for the Houses Monroe and Potter are questionable at best, they do fit in the good table as the actions of the Houses were honorable.

It seems to me, then, that the Bones would have to take up the Good spot, while an unknown house would take the Bad spot. I say this because the Lestranges are essentially Blacks and the Notts are essentially Jugsons. There's no need for a double. On the other hand, the Crouchs aren't important enough to be good, while the Bones have been a pretty big part. This also then leaves the door open for a different House to step in. 

From a literary standpoint, though, what purpose could a House that is unknown to the readers, but known to the characters, serve, or for that matter, what purpose would the Bones family being Noble serve? Remember, this is Britain, and Wizarding Britain at that: EVERYONE knows who the Nobles are... except us and perhaps Harry. I am positive that the next one or two Noble Houses will not remain unknown in the next story arc. I don't think, however, that those Houses will make an appearance as students. At least one will be 'bad' and have aligned with Voldemort during the war. One will probably also have a very high, very direct stake in Harry's misadventures. For example, Director Bones and the Azkaban breach. On top of all that, Jugson and Black may not even be full Noble Houses, thereby doubling our open spots. Feel free to discuss. 

Next:

##Who the hell is Quirinius Quirrell?""

There are quite a few options here, most of which are laid out by Harry.

1. The real David Monroe never came back from Albania.  
2. The real David Monroe died when he didn't show up for the Wizengamot vote.
4. The real David Monroe died some time after the war
3. The real David Monroe is still alive.

Without a doubt Quirrell is putting on a show to make it seem like he **is** David. But is he actually David? Could he be another legitimate Noble from the extra house? Could he have faked being David Monroe some time after the real David had died?  Could he be pretending to be one of those two without having done so in the past? The following line from Quirrell, notable the day *after* the meeting with Moody, points to him being aware of things at the school at the time David Monroe was there and Quirinius Quirrell was probably not supposed to be.

&gt;""And I believe that Bathsheda Babbling, now of Ancient Runes, was then a Ravenclaw prefect. 

So lets just say that Quirinius Quirrell is without a doubt a manufactured identity. Furthermore, he is in some manner Lord Voldemort. There are a few possibilities though. He could be infected a la canon. He could be a horcrux with a fraction of LV's soul. He could have LVs full soul in him. His body could be Tom Riddle. It could be David Monroe.

Imagine the Interdict of Merlin algorithm goes like this: check for magic gene -&gt; if the gene exists, check if Wizard/Witch is of school age -&gt; if so, check if Wizard/Witch has a wand-&gt;if he/she does, Interdict! Further, imagine that if one is Interdicted once, they will be Interdicted till death.

This might explain the origin of the tradition of sending kids to school at 11- that's when the Interdict of Merlin requires you to get a wand. People like Bacon may represent a crack in the system, where they had the magic gene, but possibly are not bound by the Interdict of Merlin- *Bacon never had a wand*. If this hypothesis is true (a big if), anything Bacon wrote in his diary could in fact bypass the Interdict of Merlin, though Quirrell remarks that he never got far in his research.

To take this further, perhaps anything written in Bacon's diary is not under the Interdict. This last bit, of course, is not very likely, and is a really simplistic model of how the Interdict of Merlin treats media that belong to Witches/Wizards.

The flaw in this, of course, is wandless magic.

Maybe kids under school-age aren't even Interdicted- the kind of wandless magic that kids can perform is fairly harmless and almost never controlled. As for the other extreme, most people who get to the really advanced controlled wandless magic stage have probably owned a wand at some point, therefore having been Interdicted. Also, kids who get expelled are possibly still under the Interdict.

This is my fun little theory about Bacon's Diary and the Interdict of Merlin in general. Probably complete BS.",,False,self,t5_2t5xf,False,,,True,t3_11gc1s,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/11gc1s/the_interdict_of_merlin_and_bacons_diary/,

**Week #3 results**

*'Less Wrong' philosophies*

This question received only 7 responses :(

    Philosophical naturalism: 
    Strongly for (5) 
    What's that? (2)

2 people didn't know what philosophical naturalism was, the other 5 were strongly for it. Phew!

    Science: 
    Strongly for (7)

All 7 were strongly for science being a highly significant human pursuit. So far so good!

    Rationality: 
    Strongly for (7)

All 7 were strongly for rationality also being a highly significant human pursuit.

    Intelligence: 
    Leaning towards (3) 
    Strongly for (4)

Intelligence being the *most* significant human attribute did not inspire quite so much certainty, with 3 people defecting to 'leaning towards'. I'd be interested to hear the reservations of those 3!

    Artificial Intelligence: 
    Strongly against (1) 
    Leaning towards (3) 
    Strongly for (3)

Similarly, thoughts about AI were split over leaning towards and strongly for, except in this case one person is strongly against it. Our first dissenting opinion - interesting!

    Friendly Artificial Intelligence: 
    Leaning against (1) 
    Leaning towards (2) 
    Strongly for (4)

It seems at least that everyone had *heard* of FAI (not what I expected, but this is a small sample size). In this case we have most people for or strongly for, with only myself expressing reservations about its importance (hey, humans weren't designed carefully to have the right programming, so why would a slightly smarter intelligence almost definitely make us all into paperclips?). Does the dissenter from the previous question, who was strongly for this one, think that Friendliness is so important that the risk of getting it wrong are too much?

    The Technological Singularity:
    Leaning against (1)
    Leaning towards (3)
    Strongly for (3)

I'm interested in those who were strongly for this one: where do you get your certainty from?

    Transhumanism:
    Leaning towards (2)
    Strongly for (5)

2 people have reservations about transhumanism.

    Immortality:
    Leaning towards (1)
    Strongly for (6)

An interesting one this one - I imagine everyone has thought about immortality at one time or another. No 'deathism' expressed here!

    Cryonics:
    Leaning against (1)
    Leaning towards (4)
    Strongly for (2)

The first one with fewer strongly for than leaning towards. Interesting that supporters of immortality have reservations about this one!

    Poylamory:
    Leaning against (1) 
    Leaning towards (3) 
    Strongly for (2)

One person did not submit a response to this one, the others were similarly torn over it as in the previous question (although the responses were not correlated).

3 of the 7 respondents expressed reservations about at least one of the statements, and of the other four only 1 was strongly for everything (except the one they hadn't heard of).

I wonder what it all means!

**Week #4: What do you read the fic for?**

HPMOR is a story, and stories are told and enjoyed for many reasons. Maybe Eliezer has an agenda with this one, but what I want to know is which elements of the story contribute to your personal enjoyment and keep you reading, and which don't.

Please tick all that apply. 

* Science stuff
* Rationality stuff
* Considering philosophical questions (ones the characters are considering or not), story as a thought experiment
* The setting/lore
* The characters
* Trying to guess what's going to happen
* Finding out what's going to happen
* The referencing of pop culture
* The writing style (the handling of humour, drama, etc)

If there's something else you enjoy about the fic, or you don't enjoy it at all, feel free to write that under 'other'!

Use [this form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFRtbUVFVEtnRWpaYzhGaVF5bGtZVmc6MQ) to answer this question, and answer or modify your answers to previous questions (if you don't enter the same reddit name as before, it will be counted as a separate opinion so *please don't do this if you're answering questions you've answered before* - and even if you aren't if you want your responses to be analysed in relation to each other at some future date) or manually edit your row of the results table [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlaIaUs-ntoPdFRtbUVFVEtnRWpaYzhGaVF5bGtZVmc).

I have a few of my own, but I figured I might as well crowdsource further questions rather than rely on thinking of my own... I'll probably make a survey whether or not I get any inspiration from this thread, but a lot of surveys I've seen could have been vastly improved in my opinion with a bit of initial research!

I'm pretty fascinated with 'theory of surveys', as in 'how to get meaningful information from a population using pre-prepared questions'. I think it's a complicated topic, with many pitfalls, so this is also a sort of personal project for me :P

**My ideas**

The basics:

* Demographics stuff?? I'm a bit concerned about questions like these, because at the end of the day whose business is it what gender I identify as or whatever (*assuming* I even conform to your set of labels - in fact I'm completely dubious we should give labels at all)? In the end, why are they even interesting questions? I guess the tentative list to consider would be, that I can think of: age, gender identity, country, present employment/education status, educational level/fields, religious views, dunno I can think of a bunch, they're getting weirder though. Sexuality? Marital status? How do you sum up a person? Maybe we should just stick to age, nationality, gender, and maybe education. Or not ask these questions!
* What chapter was the fic at when you first read it/how long have you been reading the fic?
* Were you familiar with Eliezer Yudkowsky before reading HPMOR?
* How did you find out about HPMOR?
* Does anyone else you know read HPMOR?
* How do you rate HPMOR? (7-point scale - awful/very bad/bad/not *good*, but not bad either/good/very good/amazing)

And some more fun questions:

* What's your favourite moment so far? (either a text response or a chapter number - or both!)
* Where do you fall on the 'desperation for updates' scale?
 1. Extreme unconcern (Honestly couldn't care less when the next chapter comes out)
 * Strong unconcern (Completely comfortable with waiting, but still get excited when an update is coming up)
 * Slight unconcern (I've got plenty to be getting on with between updates, but I'd like it to be updated more often)
 * Balanced (I can wait, but I'd definitely prefer more frequent updates)
 * Slight concern (I do get antsy waiting for updates)
 * Strong concern (It's a serious problem with this fic)
 * Extreme concern (I can't bear to read this fic with such long delays)
* Which MOR!House would you want to be in?
 * Ravenclaw (intelligence above all else?)
 * Slytherin (figuring out *how can I achieve X*?)
 * Hufflepuff (honesty, loyalty, hard-work?)
 * Gryffindor (fighting evil?)
* Which of these keep you personally invested in the fic:
 * Science (learning new science/more about science)
 * Methods of Rationality (learning ways to be rational)
 * Philosophy (exploring questions of good/evil, right/wrong, etc.)
 * Psychology (exploring characters' motivations, decisions, reactions)
 * Hunting for clues about the plot
 * Spotting pop culture references
 * Anything major I've missed that characterises readers' investment in the fic?
* What would make you enjoy the fic more? (text box)

1345761501.0,6,self.HPMOR,ypz4z,I just had a thinky-thingy about Hat-and-Cloak,13,7,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/ypz4z/i_just_had_a_thinkythingy_about_hatandcloak/,"So, this person is going around handing out obliviations to kids like it was a type of candy, right?  This must mean they're either so powerful/clever that they can circumvent the wards, or they found a way of keying themselves into them.  

Now, I find it slightly less likely that they're going around the wards each time.  If it's an act of overpowering them, that would tire out even the most uber of uberwizards.  If it's simply finding a way around them, then they would probably have some sort of limiting factor, like exploiting times when the wards are changing, or finding blind spots in its sweeping patterns.

H&amp;C was standing around [spoiler](/s ""obliviating Hermione"") for hours on end.  So it can't be tiring, and it's unlikely they'd found some way that was so clever that they could exploit it for that long.  Even silly wizard security wouldn't have blind spots that big.

It's more likely that H&amp;C found a way of keying into the wards, then.  Which raises the probability they're a teacher or member of the Hogwarts staff.

But it doesn't make it *impossible* that they're someone else.  Remember that

On [chapter 84](http://perf.hpmor.com/chapter/84), ctrl+f for ""Hogwarts Wards""

&gt; A slight smile. ""The Headmaster drew a circle, and told Hogwarts that he who stood within was the Defense Professor.

Depending on the size of the circle and the way that the wards work, this could mean that someone could key themselves in by standing in the circle with Quirrel.  

It'd be easy enough to test too, all you'd have to do was check the wards to see if there were more than one defense professors running around.  Or for something else that would only happen if there were two, like the defense professor being in the trophy room and quirrel's classroom at the same time.

Though you'd have to test for time-turners at the same time, I suppose...  

Anyway, to pull that off, you'd need something like the cloak of true invisibility.  Or the cooperation of Quirrel.  Or both.  

The only other person that I know of for sure to have had the cloak at one time is ""Santa Claus.""  So if it turns out that the wards have been tricked in this manner, then there's evidence that Santa Claus and H&amp;C are the same person.

So yeah... No solid hypothesis on an identity yet, but I had a thinky-thingy about some ways to tell, so I thought I'd share it.

Of course, this is also potential evidence that H&amp;C is the shade of Voldemort, separated entirely from Quirrel.

This passage in Chapter 45 confused me a bit:

&gt;They had come very close to the Dementor's cage guarded by four Patronuses, when there came sharp intakes of breath from the three Aurors and Professor Quirrell. Everyone's faces turned to look at the Dementor, seeming to listen; there was horror on Auror Goryanof's face.

&gt;Then Professor Quirrell raised his head, his face hard, and spat toward the Dementor.

&gt;""It did not like having its prey taken from it, I suppose,"" Dumbledore said quietly. ""Well. If it becomes necessary, Quirinus, there will always be a refuge for you at Hogwarts.""

&gt;""What did it say?"" said Harry.

&gt;Every head swung to stare at him.

&gt;""You didn't hear it...?"" Dumbledore said.

&gt;Harry shook his head.
&gt;
""It said to me,"" said Professor Quirrell, ""that it knew me, and that it would hunt me down someday, wherever I tried to hide."" His face was rigid, showing no fright.

&gt;""Ah,"" Harry said. ""I wouldn't worry about that, Professor Quirrell.""

The bit that confuses me is Dumbledore saying ""It did not like having its prey taken from it, I suppose,""

To the re-reader, with full knowledge of Quirrel's horcrux(es) and the true nature of dementors, it is somewhat clear that the dementor is angry with either Quirrelmort's past escapes from death via horcrux, or the fact that he is in the process of trying to escape it via horcrux. But what spurred Dumbledore to make that comment? Does he have special knowledge that Quirrel has escaped Azkaban before? Does he know of Quirrel's horcruxes and the true nature of dementors?

In these chapters: Uh, since I haven't been reading along with this readthrough I've just skimmed them to get a summary and I've come up with this: Harry passes the Time-Turner test, Dumbledore 'reveals' to Harry what has happened at Azkaban and confines him to Hogwarts, and Fawkes takes Harry's side. In the (many) aftermaths: Fawkes can't be persuaded to join Hermione, Draco tries to figure out what the blazes is going on, Neville vows to hunt down and kill Bellatrix, Lesath pledges himself to Harry, Amelia Bones decides Voldemort tricked an innocent to rescue Bellatrix, Quirrell is recovering, the Weasley twins promise not to help Harry leave Hogwarts, Moody and Snape go through the motions of trying to sabotage obvious routes to Voldemort's resurrection, Harry agonises over his intentions and eventually boils it down to 'destroy Azkaban', and Trelawney is disturbed by a growing prophecy. And then an Omake chapter.

We have seen that Harry has discovered a 2nd mental state which makes the spell vastly more effective and operate differently.

We have been told by Mad-eye Moody that Adavra Kedavra is a spell that is mind state dependent (must have killing intent).

We have also been told that Harry's edge over Voldemort is via magic 'he knows not'. As I count it, Harry has two significant magical innovations: Atomic transfiguration (used often and to great effect), and the true patronus (generalized as knowing that at least one spell can be changed via the right mental state). 

Hypothesis: 

There may exist a mental state which changed (the already mental state dependent) Adavra Kedavra into an effect which can destroy/neutralize a Horcrux. 

Additionally, if such a spell had any innate guidance ability, then by aiming it in the general direction of a very distant object (like, oh, a space probe in the outer edged of the solar system), it would be able to successfully destroy an apparently inaccessible horcrux. An additional targeting trick if it only affected a desired target to investigate is using the Suns gravity to slingshot the effect back at the Earth to let its targeting find any other Horcruxes without having to search them down one at a time.

Note, Quarrel did tell Harry that he did not have the power to cast Adavra Kedavra, however, he may be able train a useful adult such as Moody to cast it on his behalf. Or for that matter, just because a Phoenix's have only come to people once in that past does not mean that must always be the case.

&gt; If you throw a Transfigured object and de-Transfigure it, it continues moving at exactly the same velocity, regardless of momentum and kinetic energy. There are at least two good reasons for this, one of which is that, even in MoR, Special Relativity is simply the way reality is; you can add laws that violate conservation of momentum and even conservation of energy (though the latter requires the insanity of single-world QM, but then so does the Time-Turner), but in a Minkowskian universe the idea of a privileged frame of reference is too incoherent even for magic. The other reason is that if you didn't know about conservation of momentum or energy, of course you'd expect the object to continue with the same velocity.

The conservation of velocity requires violation of both momentum and energy conservation, but I see no reason at least one of these could not be preserved. Let's assume we throw an object with rest mass m_0 at relativistic speeds (or any speed really) and that its rest mass changes discontinuously to 2m_0 at some point from being de-transfigured. This obviously breaks mass/energy conservation, but we're okay with this (because *magic*).

Now, assuming special relativity holds, the energy of the object before detransfiguration is:

    [; E_i = \sqrt{ (p_ic)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2 } ;]

and after, it becomes:

    [; E_f = \sqrt{ (p_fc)^2 + 4(m_0c^2)^2 } ;]

If we hold that p_i=p_f, then we can rearrange the two equations to give the energy lost or created from the detransfiguration:

    [; E_f = \sqrt{ 3(m_ic^2)^2 + E_i^2 } ;]

Alternatively we could conserve energy at the expense of momentum (ignoring, of course, the fact that we've created 1m_0 of mass, which is technically 1m_0c^2 of energy already).

    [; p_f = \sqrt{ p_i^2 - 3(m_ic)^2 } ;]

1375818851.0,6,self.HPMOR,1jtzy9,Time Turners in a branching universe,9,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1jtzy9/time_turners_in_a_branching_universe/,"So I was just reading the [Causal Universes](http://lesswrong.com/lw/fok/causal_universes/#more) article on Less Wrong. This seems to be more or less how time travel works in HPMOR; the universe does a kind of brute force search on on the future, figures out which universes are ""legal"", and then picks one at random.

However, what if it only appears that way? That is to say, what if the universe is not actually using the self-consistent time loops that it appears to be using?

Consider this paragraph:

&gt; If a time machine does allow for changing history, it's easy to imagine how to compute it; you could easily write a computer program which would simulate that universe and its time travel, given sufficient computing power. You would store the state of the universe in RAM and simulate it under the programmed 'laws of physics'. Every nanosecond, say, you'd save a copy of the universe's state to disk. When the Time-Changer was activated at 9pm, you'd retrieve the saved state of the universe from one hour ago at 8pm, load it into RAM, and then insert the Time-Changer and its user in the appropriate place. This would, of course, dump the rest of the universe from 9pm into oblivion - no processing would continue onward from that point, which is the same as ending that world and killing everyone in it.

Now, instead of that happening, the universe simulation stays in RAM, and the ""new"" universe created by time travel is just run in parallel as a separate thread with its own share of RAM (that's why you can never have enough RAM). We now have universe A and universe B, and they both survive just fine without either being destroyed.

It's probably clear where I'm going with this.

If you can have multiple universes splitting off from each other, then it's very possible to get two universes which are very nearly identical to each other. As an example, I could stand in a room for five minutes, then go into the next room and travel backwards in time five minutes and exit through another door. In the origin universe, which we'll call Universe A, there was no one in the next room while I was sitting around waiting.

However, in the second universe, Universe B, there was a copy of myself from Universe A quietly making his exit. I've already precommitted to going into the next room and traveling back in time, so I do that, ending up in Universe C. And so on, until the universe simulator is running an infinite number of universes that are all identical. From my perspective, it doesn't matter whether I'm in Universe B or higher, since they're all the same to me. And if I set up cameras, the universe would probably look like a stable time loop.

So a high-level metatime view of the multiverse of time-travel created universes would probably see a lot of dead ends, but there would also be these long chains of identical universes which created each other. At the start of a universe daisy chain, you'd see enormous inconsistencies, but eventually they would either result in terminating universes, or in an infinite chain of identical (or possibly oscillating) universes. And since there are so many more of the universes where things appear to be the same, you would expect to find yourself in them more often than not.

So take the prank Harry plays on himself with the pies when he first is about to acquire the Time-Turner. In the multiple universe method, there really was some originating Harry who started the trick at the beginning of the causal chain of universes. Each Harry afterwards made the trick better, until eventually we see the universe billions of causal links down the chain, where the prank appears as *fait accompli* - because the prank has reached a completely self-replicated equilibrium.

If future Harry can figure out the key to time-travel, and unlock what is holding time-turners back from going backwards farther than 6 hours, then he could go back in time, armed with whatever other knowledge he needs, to the room that Harry is protecting, minutes after the body is put there, with the intent of stealing away and reviving Hermione.

But since we know that Quirrel is intelligent we know that he must have had some motive not to instantly conquer Britain and that was probably that he didn't really want to conquer Britain but just wanted to push them into action.

Furthermore, McGonagall and Dumbledore seem to believe that this acts as a hard limit to how far back information ingeneral can be carried back in time period. 

However, we have yet to see a real example of this hard limit coming into play to begin with.

As such, and given the one use only nature of the time-turners within a single day, I propose a variety of tests to determine how time-turners can be used.

Test 1: Identify exact definition of a day as established with a time-turner (TT). Test how definition of a day relates to ability to turn back time. Test if movement across regional time zones can allow flexible use of time-turner based off of changing geographical location.

Test 2: Independent of previous results, identify if definition of day is based off of universal time somehow using TT to travel from any time from 12:00-5:59 a.m. to anytime from 6:00-11:59 p.m. and test if TT can be reused for an additional 1-6 hours back. Test if still applies if TT was not used during previous day in case of interference.

Test 3: Independent of previous result, identify if use of multiple TTs allow 6+ hour travel into past. Acquire second TT, TT2, in addition to original TT, TT1. Send TT1 back in time 1-6 hours using TT2, then attempt to send TT1 6-1 hours back.

Test 4: If the previous test is positive, acquire two additional TTs, TT3 &amp; TT4 to the two from the previous experiment and see if a span of 24-hours is all that is necessary to permitted the repeated use of any given TT for word or backward in time from latest use.

Test 5: If previous test is negative, test if cumulative 25-30 hours of cumulative time is necessary in order to recover 1-6 total hours of use is necessary for TTs to become useable again or not. Acquire additional TT, TT5, use TT1 to go back 6 hours, use TTs 2-5 to send back TT1 additional 24 hours back. Place TT1 in a hidden location. Retrieve from spot 30-hours later and test if usable or not.

Test 6: If previous test is positive, bring bag of holding during trip back 30 hours. Place TT1 inside bag 30 hours prior. Retrieve TT1 that has experienced 30 additional hours already. Test if able to move further back in time. Recycle TTs 2-5 until limit on bag is reached at negative 6 hour time intervals.

Test 7: If previous test is positive, see if possible to replace TTs 2-5 with TT1.

Test 8: If previous test is positive, see if possible to modify memory of past self and or others.",,False,self,t5_2t5xf,False,,dragon,True,t3_10ocr4,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/10ocr4/timeturners_overcoming_basic_limitations_and/,

&gt;Professor Quirrell’s lips twisted further. “Ah, but the truly amusing
thing was this. You see, Mr. Potter, the chant of every ritual names
that which is to be sacriﬁced, and that which is to be gained. The chant
which you gave to Miss Davis spoke, ﬁrst, of a darkness beyond darkness,
buried beneath the ﬂow of time, whose voice echoes in the emptiness,
which knows the gate, and is the gate. And the second thing spoken of,
Mr. Potter, was the manifestation of your own presence. And always,
in each element of the ritual, ﬁrst is named that which is sacriﬁced, and
then is said the use commanded of it.”

&gt;“I... see,” said Harry, as he trod through the halls of Hogwarts after
Professor Quirrell, following him toward the Defense Professor’s oﬃce.
“So my chant, the way I wrote it, implies that the Outer God, YogSothoth—”

&gt;“Was permanently sacriﬁced to fuel a ritual which but brieﬂy manifested your presence,” said Professor Quirrell. “I suppose we will discover tomorrow whether anyone took that seriously, when we read the
newspapers and see whether all the magical nations of the world are
banding together in a desperate eﬀort to seal oﬀ your incursion into our

The original HP never really made sense to me if I thought about it too hard, but I decided to just follow Basil Exposition's advice from The Spy Who Shagged Me. But now we are trying to be rational here, so I wonder if anyone can think of some explanations for this.

One of the things that always bugged me was the people complaining about the lack of ethnic minorities in the movies. Now I know Rowling decided to use the concept of blood-purity and the plight of the house-elves to talk about discrimination, and racism as we know it doesn't appear to exist in the magical world. But there is actually a surprising amount of diversity in the Harry Potter world already.

So I'm just wondering what events in the history of the wizarding world would have caused Indian, Chinese AND African (Dean Thomas) families to move to Britain? Or even Irish (Seamus) for that matter, surely wizards wouldn't have been affected by a potato famine? Or does Ireland not deserve its own magic school (which means there should be far more Irish students)?

The genetic explanation means that someone must have had the magical gene in the past. Does this mean that all ethnic minority wizards are muggle-born? Or are the characters actually mixed race / is there a high rate of de novo mutation? If the magical gene exists in all races rather than being confined to (perhaps) speakers of Proto-Indo-European, would America still be populated by native American wizards instead of white ones? Presumably African wizards would have avoided getting sold into the slave trade.

My parents and grandparents wouldn't have met if the British Empire had not come to Asia. But I can't think of why magical Britain in the 18th century would have tried to conquer the rest of the world. Unless it was done by dark wizards, but then why didn't they take over their own country first?

A random thought popped into my mind when I heard someone mention the sorting hat, and it kinda makes sense, but feel free to shoot it into dust with things i may have missed, I can't find any.

So, to quote the hat itself:

""Oh, dear. This has never happened before...""

When I read it for the first time, I didn't give this much thought. But after some consideration, how probable is that the reason they figured he became self aware was something as simple as questioning the possibility. If this part of the original story is unchanged, we can assume Riddle who later turns into Voldemort was under that hat too. So adding the current theory that Voldemort is one of the personalities Quirrel has been playing, wouldn't it be probable that he asked himself the same question? And if not him, the myriads of students sorted before, this kind of thing would highly likely pop up into a mind of lets say a muggle born kid seeing a talking hat for the first time. (Or a random thought of anyone else I guess.) 

So taking this into consideration, second quote from the hat:

""I can tell you that there is definitely nothing like a ghost - mind, intelligence, memory, personality, or feelings - in your scar. Otherwise it would be participating in this conversation, being under my brim.""

What if he was wrong and the dark persona was actually participating in the conversation, and the reason why the Hat became self aware was because he partly fused with this dark persona, or whatever is making the persona work.

Now for how to make this theory work (and make some wild guesses and assumptions).

Firstly, let's say the imprint on Harry was not coincidental. While the Horcrux gave the Canon Harry some connection to Voldemort, I don't remember it actually changing him in this way. So let's say the dark persona is a construct, of the Horcrux (or some kind of essence of cynicism and darkness, since the Horcrux Harry isn't really confirmed in HPMOR yet), and a spell that works like an emulator, basically loading Harry's mind into it and running it with the Horcrux filter.
If this emulator somehow got mixed up with the magic of sorting hat, it could possibly explain the self awareness and it being unable to detect anyone since the Horcrux itself could be possibly hidden from detection, which would make sense if it was implanted with prior planning and a paranoid rational mind.

Another way to explain it being undetected, may be that it was still running as a filter, and the hat simply didn't tell Harry he could feel it. (It feels like ""Souls"" is maybe avoided on the list of things he can't see. )

Given that HPMOR is a rationalist vehicle, I would expect the resolution of the story to settle this conflict. Would you disagree?

From that perspective, I wonder if the prophecy that ""he"" (Harry) will end ""the world"" can be read as predicting that he will end the *wizarding* world, i.e. somehow collapse magic.

(I'm not sure how this would also ""end the stars"", but it would end Quirrell's stars.)

Would Harry see ending magic as desirable? E.g. because he thinks the wizarding world is unjust/undemocratic? To avenge the deaths of Hermione and his parents? To prevent any further Dark Lords? To ""optimize"" the world?

Even if Harry doesn't intend to end magic, it might come about by whatever new ""Fixus Everythingus"" spell he ends up inventing.

I was puzzled a bit by the ""taboo tradeoffs"" arc. The action seemed to be heating up in a way that meant the status quo couldn't continue. Particularly the ""Harry sees Quirrell as a mentor, rather than Voldemort"" status quo. At the same, it was very unclear to me how the story actually resolves.

In [Eliezer's November 1st progress report](http://hpmor.com/notes/progress-12-11-01/), Eliezer confirmed that the story must resolve soon: ""We have two major story arcs (and a couple of intervening chapters) left to go before the end of the story.""

Yet I can't for the life of me see how Harry wins in two arcs (presumably covering the end of the Hogwarts school year, possibly into the coming summer but probably not covering Harry's second year at Hogwarts). The basic problem here is that Rational!Voldemort is much smarter than Canon!Voldemort, which creates further problems like:

1. Voldemort's horcruxes being (strongly implied to be) much better hidden than in canon.
2. Voldemort being unlikely to make any of the stupid mistakes that handed Harry easy wins in canon (""Casst Killing Cursse?"" Harry hissed in incredulity. ""At me? Again? Ssecond time? Nobody will believe Dark Lord could posssibly be that sstupid -"")

Scroll down for the new question!

----

**Week #1 results**

*How concerned are you about the frequency of updates?*

This question received 48 responses in the first 28 hours of the week, then no more after that.

Concerns were expressed in the comments, with a popular sentiment apparently being that it was an uninteresting question (sorry about that!) or irrelevant (really?). I don't know if those people voted in the question, I would rather everyone voted no matter what, so to that end I have added an option for 'don't want to answer'. I don't really like that, since it may introduce bias into the responses, so perhaps a question with sufficient 'veto' responses should be chucked. But better to know than not, I guess. I asked the question because I wondered if the most commonly expressed sentiment - concern about updates - was the most commonly held one.

But anyway, the results:

    1		 0	 0%
    2		14	29%
    3		 6	13%
    4		 8	17%
    5		10	21%
    6		 8	17%
    7		 2	 4%

Out of 48 responses, 20 rated themselves concerned (5-7), 20 unconcerned (1-3), and 8 balanced (4).

Nobody responded with extreme unconcern.

There was a spike at strong unconcern (2), and the other 34 respondents formed what looks like a crude bell curve around mild concern (5).

From this it seems that though there are many people who are strongly unconcerned, there is among the majority of the readership a mild tendency towards concern overall.

10 respondents (20.8%) expressed strong or extreme concern (6 or 7).

Nevertheless, it is still very elementary, mostly composed of theories and factoids learned in high school and my core biology course in college.

I am unable to understand the role of genetics and magic in HPMOR. Harry’s theory of magic and genetics states there is a magical allele, M and a muggle allele, m. Humans who are able to perform magic (i.e. witches and wizards), have two copies of the magical allele, MM. This determines if a person has magic or not, whether they were born or muggles or wizards. Squibs have one magical allele, and one muggle allele, Mm. Muggles do not have any magical alleles, and are mm.

Harry and Draco observed that Squib couples had a ratio of 25% magical kids, 50% squib kids and 25% muggle kids, approximately. This is an expected observation of the above theory, discovered first by Gregor Mendel’s experiments with pea plants.

HOWEVER, this does not make sense. If the above were true, then one would not expect to see muggleborns at all. Two parents with an mm pairing would never yield a child who was MM. The best that could be expected would be two squibs, ignorant of the magical world, just so happening to copulate and giving birth to a magical child.

The second expected observation would be no Squibs being born of pureblood families. The original books, at the very least, have stated that squibs have been born of pureblood families, though of course this may just not be true of HPMOR-verse

But lastly, the theory above would rid the world of half-blood wizards. If a wizard and a muggle were to mate, every single child would be Mm, and thus Squibs. There would be no such thing as half-blood wizards at all, wizards would be pure-blood, born of squibs, or some combination of the two. 

Is my science and reasoning correct?

Contains spoilers.,6,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/tmm3i/possible_implications_of_harrys_lineage_contains/,"Canon!Harry, we know, is not the actual Heir of Slytherin. His Parselmouth talent is a result of the imprint of Voldemort on Harry after the killing curse rebounded. However, HJPEV is in a different situation. It is possible that Voldemort's influence on HJPEV granted him the Parselmouth ability, but my speculation is this:

Salazar Slytherin, at some point in his life, had an affair with a muggle. Being a proponent of blood purity, he either hid the affair or did not know he had fathered a child. As a result, the line of Slytherin continued separately from his actual House, and separately from the rest of the wizarding world. This line terminates in Harry, coming through Lily.

Evidence to support this hypothesis: Harry and Draco's discovery that magic is passed down through an on/off gene means that wizards born into non-magical families, like Lily, must have some wizard ancestry at some point in their family tree (unless mutation or some other spontaneous genetic change allows for it).

Additionally, we can infer that Parselmouth is an inherited trait as well, due to its rarity and instant recognizability. If it were a trained or magically bestowed trait, fake Heirs of Slytherin would surely have popped up and tried to use it as a means of proving their legitimacy. Draco's immediate assumption that Harry is the Heir implies that this is not the case- he was not even remotely suspicious that Harry had somehow acquired Parselmouth by some other means.

If this speculation is true, it raises some interesting implications. First, it is entirely possible that Roger Bacon was part of this line of Slytherin, which would account for his complete removal from the wizarding world while still having magical ability; he could even be one of Harry's ancestors.

Secondly, we know that Quirrelmort is just about the best schemer in history. He would almost certainly know about Harry's Heir-ness, definitively so as soon as he discovers Harry is a Parselmouth. He would have to be aware of the implications of Harry being a direct descendant of Salazar- primarily, that it would help garner support for Harry-as-WizardKing from many of the anti-Dumbledore faction, and secondarily that it could be used as an ace-in-the-whole against blood purists to find out Salazar had a bastard with a muggle. One could even go out on a limb and speculate that Bacon's diary itself contains a clue as to his ancestry, and Quirrelmort chose Harry from birth for that reason.

I may have missed other evidence that would support or disprove this, but that's for all of you brilliant people to find out =)",,False,self,t5_2t5xf,False,,dragon,True,t3_tmm3i,http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/tmm3i/possible_implications_of_harrys_lineage_contains/,

If a character is said to have done a thing (Dumbledore said 'Happy Happy Boom Boom Swamp Swamp Swamp') cite the chapter in which they do that thing (Chapter 12). If a character is not explicitly said to do a thing, but meta-knowledge that this is a story indicates that character did the thing(Somebody influenced Hermione), cite the chapter with a meta tag (Meta Chapter 77). Meta influences that can apply to more than one character should be noted as such. (Hat-and-Cloak, Quirrel, Dumbledore, Harry, Lucius, Voldemort, McGonagall).

Is it possible it was instead selectively bred with sun resistance? Voldemort seems the type to attempt something like that. He's had decades to prepare such a thing. I'm not sure what the life cycle of a troll is but given their regeneration they may reach maturity very quickly. If Quirell is Voldemort this would explain why Harry's magic didn'tinteract with the troll.

~~Harry mentions in chapter 94 that it's odd that trolls didn't evolve sun resistance naturally which made me think of this theory.~~ Of course the simpler explanation might be that Quirrel used either a store bought potion or even sunblock. Or that Quirrel's not behind it at all.

The way I understood it, only the owner of a time-turner can use it. In chapter 61, Dumbledore strongly suspected Harry had been misusing his time-turner and the test he used to determine that was just the most obvious test you could think of. But Harry couldn't have known that and should have expected a test that establishes beyond doubt that he's a time-turned Harry or not. Since the stakes in this case were really high, this would mean Harry obtaining someone else's time-turner (by force or trickery, with Quirrell's help) . The fact that neither he nor Quirrell did that, and instead only prepared themselves for the obvious test, suggests that if it was anything other than the obvious test they couldn't have done anything about it.

Besides, if this can be done at all, Quirrell would've got himself a time-turner, just in case.

So I understand that broomsticks work under Aristotelian physics in that they go where you point them, even though under ""real"" physics they should be going where they were already going, unless, of course, another force acts on them.

I was thinking about how when you drive a car, the friction of the wheels against the ground allows for you to change direction, or, you exert a force on the car that stops it from continuing in the direction it was going before.

But broomsticks don't operate like this. They go where you point them, and turn when they shouldn't.
Except, what if a broomstick does actually have ""wheels"" like a car that allow it to change direction in the air?
