1349983156.0,35,self.pharmacy,11bopw,I'm a PharmD for a major pharmacy chain who likely failed a drug test yesterday...any advice?,47,12,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/11bopw/im_a_pharmd_for_a_major_pharmacy_chain_who_likely/,"EDIT #2: Okay guys, since so many of you have been asking for an update, I'm going to fill you in with the facts as I know them so far. First of all, Quest Diagnostics has NOT contacted me yet with a positive result. I took the drug test at 11:00 on October 10th. It has been well over a week since I took the test, so from everything I can gather from message boards on the internet, I should be golden. HOWEVER, my store manager usually receives an email from Quest for negative results, she has received no such email for my test. Another confusing fact is that my store manager tested positive for hydrocodone (she had a Rx). She got a phone call from a Medical Review Officer from Quest on the Monday after the UDS, and our pharmacy has already been called to verify the prescription. 

This makes me believe one of two things. One, my sample came back positive on the EMIT test, but it came back negative on the confirmatory GC/MS and for whatever reason my store manager didn't get an email (remember, this seems very unlikely because I was taking bong rips the night before the test and I am a daily smoker). Two, Quest tried to call me but had an incorrect phone number. If this was the case, I believe they would have contacted my Walgreens to get my phone number so they could have the MRO call me. 

My store manager called a former DM to ask about my situation. The ex-DM said it can take the district office up to 3 weeks to come down to fire someone. It's also apparently not unheard of for the district office to sweep incidents under the rug (for example, the pharmacist I replaced when I started working there never got fired for sleeping on the job and throwing prescription totes out into the patient waiting area). My store manager thinks that if they come down to fire me, it will likely be on our next inventory day (Friday, October 26th) since the district people often come down on inventory days anyways. 

Since this thread is getting kind of buried in /r/pharmacy, I'll create a new one once I have a true update. You all have given me great advice and I appreciate the support very much. I've upvoted everyone in the thread, even those who believe I have acted recklessly and unprofessionally, as even though I disagree with you, I still respect your opinion and it has caused me to look at my situation with a new perspective. If nothing else, it has allowed me to see the perspective that the district people will have in the event that I have a confrontation with them about the positive UDS. 

If there are any other pharmacist cannabis-consumers out there, do tread carefully. Know your workplace's random drug testing policy and have a contingency plan in case you ever get tested. Please, please, please never go to work under the influence of any substance, we do have patients' lives in our hands. What you do at your home is your business, and your business alone. Everyone take care, and do good for goodness' sake. I'll update you all in a new thread ASAP, and I'll continue responding to comments and specific questions in the meantime. 

EDIT: It looks as if I'll be terminated. My store manager says I should walk out voluntarily before the District people come down to fire me on Monday. I'm waiting for the pharmacy manager to call me back to see if there is any way he can intercede for me. I'm still unsure if I should effectively quit at the end of my shift tomorrow or wait for them to tell me I failed and act completely surprised and demand a retest. I'm also unsure if this will go all the way to the Board of Pharmacy. Any advice, pharmacy phriends?

This is a throwaway for anonymity...

Here's the scoop. I'm a pharmacist at a major pharmacy chain, and yesterday, Quest Diagnostics came into my workplace to conduct a random drug screen. I was taking bong rips the night before so I'm 99% it is going to come back positive. I'm getting ready to call an employment lawyer to seek advice, but does anyone out there (especially pharmacists) have any first hand experience or advise with my situation? I'm thinking that the worst-case scenario is I lose my job and my license is suspended, and the best-case scenario is I go on probation with my employer and have to pay for drug rehabilitation counseling.",,False,,t5_2qjl3,1350672173.0,,,True,t3_11bopw,http://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/11bopw/im_a_pharmd_for_a_major_pharmacy_chain_who_likely/,

Patients who argue with you over why they can't get their prescriptions.  As if there is some grand conspiracy against them by the pharmacist to deny them their medications.  To put them into terms your tiny brain would be able to  understand, it would be like going to Burger King and them refusing to sell you burgers... or going to the Ford dealership and them refusing to sell you cars.  As you can see, this is not a good business model.  I am a pharmacist.  I sell drugs for a living.  If my pharmacy doesnt sell any drugs, we go out of business.  Do you see how this works?  You want the drugs, I sell you the drugs... and that is how the free market works.  Pretty fan-fucking-tastic.

SOOOOO... if for some reason you cannot get your prescription filled, there is usually a pretty damn good reason why.  There is some barrier between us preventing this transaction from occurring.  Something legal perhaps (I cannot authorize three months worth of refills without the doctor approving it).  Or perhaps there is something wrong with the insurance like a prior authorization (because Lord knows you are not going to pay the actual price of all your medications... so somebody has to and that somebody is your insurance company).  Just to reiterate, you want to buy drugs, I want to sell drugs, it's how this whole thing works.  So please do not accuse me of lying to you or ""being out to get you"" or some other nonsensical bullshit.  Pull your head out of your ass and take off your tinfoil hat.

This day comes every year: January 2nd. It's the first day that doctor's offices are open in the new year. Ergo, it's the first day that most people will come visit our little slices of Heaven.

And they come bearing gifts. They come bearing gifts of rejects. Rejects of all shapes and sizes. Some people are highly informed of their situations, coming with their insurance cards in hand, before you even ask them. Other people are completely taken aback, fully surprised that their insurance plans may have changed in the slightest. 

This is the day that all Medicare recipient breathe a sigh of relief, because they are all out of their doughnut holes, now. This is also the day that the rest of the world screams, because their deductibles all reset.

So, r/pharmacy. How was your day?

Myself? I worked the busiest part of the day, and we had a tech call out for most of the day, because her kid was sick. The morning help was a bunch of newbies, and we had to call in a senior tech early so that she could help. We called in more help in the middle of the day, but he was extremely grumpy and short with most every customer (this is his second-to-last day).

So, I helped with the brunt of the load, and it was all ugly. The highlights of my day include an entire insurance provider going down for several hours, and having to hand back dozens of medical cards, telling people that we needed their pharmacy cards (and being looked at like I was crazy). 

This is an ugly time to work in pharmacy.

As difficult as it might seem let's try to keep political and ethical viewpoints out of it. If you want to debate whether or not health care is a right there are posts in other subreddits for that.

That being said, I am very interested to hear what impacts you (practicing pharmacists, pharmacy students, patients) think the Affordable Care Act will have on the profession. I have heard plenty of physicians express their disapproval but I feel like pharmacists (the ones I know) have stayed pretty tight lipped about it.

Interesting points of discussion might include changes to the pharmacist's role in patient care, compensation, drug prices, demand for jobs, Pharm.D education, or anything else you find relevant.

I am a pharmacy student and will admit that I don't know all of the components of the legislation. My impression from what I have heard/read thus far has been a negative one. Here's a few things that come to mind.

A.) **Greater generic availability** - sounds great on the surface. Cheaper drugs available to more people, hopefully increasing health across the board. On the flip side, we all know the front-end costs that drug companies incur on bringing a new drug to market and the research dollars that went into developing that drug and dozens of other drugs that won't ever see the market. I feel like cheaper prices and/or shorter patents will lower the reward for innovation that drug companies receive and in the long run it could decrease the quality and quantity of new drugs that they pump out.

B.) **Changes in reimbursement** - still not clear on all dynamics of this. If I had to take a stab in the dark I would say 3rd party reimbursement pay in both community and clinical settings will decrease. If this happens I think those changes will be reflected in RPh salary. Possibly through mandatory mail order? I don't know, just brainstorming.

C.) **Pay by performance measures** - will pharmacist pay be based on how many times their patients skip a dose or refill medications? Not likely, but I do think it is possible for aspects of the physician compensation model to trickle into pharmacy, especially in clinical settings.

D.) **Greater role in patient care** - this is the only possible outcome that has come to my mind that seems positive. If pharmacy is given a greater scope of practice it could increase jobs by creating new roles for the Pharm.D to fill.

That's all I have for now. So now I want to hear - what do you think?

We have a total of 4 people who work in the pharmacy, 2 pharmacists and 2 techs, I'm one of the techs. On any given shift, we only have 1 pharmacist and 1 tech working. Unsurprisingly, we recently ran out of flu vaccine and we can't get more. We're done for the season. And also unsurprisingly, we have seen a truly massive rise in inquiries about flu shots. We had about 54 people (we counted) today ask. Well, it turns out the district (whatever that means) managed to get more vaccine, and they're trying to decide which stores it should go to. It was the store manager (not the pharmacy manager) saying this, so I tried to give my input. I said that I was unsure if getting more would be beneficial, because we could barely handle the pre-scare work load of flu shots and if we got more, we'd be doing nothing but giving flu shots and wouldn't be able to do anything else. At least, that's what I TRIED to say. He cut me off around ""unsure"", telling me that I shouldn't make any comments until I'd worked there several years (I've worked there 5 or 6 months). Ok...so my opinion has no value, despite the fact that I'm the one who has to actually deal with the patients and he hasn't worked in an actual pharmacy for a decade. Fine, whatever. That's insulting and obnoxious, but fine. But then came closing time. We have a very new pharmacist working at our store and she's not as efficient as she could be, which is expected and understandable. We're extremely busy and only have 2 people working at a time, so it shouldn't be shocking that sometimes we have some things to finish after close. Today, the store manager was flat out yelling at us, telling us to hurry up an that he was going to lock us in for the night. I was about to deck the guy. I'm only scheduled until 8 and we close at 10, so at this point I'm working 2 hours past my shift. I do this on a regular basis and I sometimes come in on days I'm not scheduled. I don't give a shit about thes small amount of money working those extra hours gets me. I'd rather just go home and relax. But if I stuck to my schedule 100%, the pharmacy would almost not be able to operate. So now I've got this guy who is supposed to be managing the store and doing what's best for it yelling at me because he has to stay an extra 20-45 minutes when I'm ALREADY 2 hours past my shift and am willing to stay longer because there's work that needs to get done. I'm basically doing him a favor while he yells at me. I get yelled at and abused by customers all day and am still willing to do what it takes to keep the place running and the MANAGER is the last person I should be taking shit from for going above and beyond.

My question was what would it take to get pharmacists provider status. Provider status would mean pharmacists could be reimbursed and get many other benefits (like loan repayment for serving underprivileged areas). 

Until pharmacists gain provider status our profession will stay in a product oriented state instead of a service provided state. Currently the Veterans Administration, a government organizations that serves American soldiers, has recognized that pharmacists are underutilized and now use pharmacists for ambulatory care (making sure patients know what their medications are for, how to use them, and adjusting and prescribing medications). Patients that are followed by pharmacists do much better and are less likely to end up in the Emergency Department. 

What would it take for provider status? 3-5 million dollars put towards lobbying. I think this is the most important obstacle facing pharmacists. It seems that no organization is making this their priority. To put this in terms there are over 50,000 hospital pharmacists, which means if every pharmacist donated $100 we could change the landscape of Pharmacy.

- What are some of your day-to-day duties around your work space?

- What's the most common task you'd say you have?

- How many other clinical/hospital pharmacists are there in your work place?

- How much prep is involved in your work? I've heard of Clinical PharmDs spending big chunks of time looking up clinical trials and data for new drugs.

- This one is just out of curiosity for the PharmDs: Are you referred to as ""Doctor"" where you work?

The doctor wrote for 240ml of a liquid with the directions to take 30 ml daily with no end date and no refills.

We only have the 473ml bottle size and don't break them up, so I added a stop duration of 8 days to the directions so the patient would know to stop.

The other technician who saw me filling it told me that I should take the 8 days off and not specify anything because we don't know how long the doctor wanted them to use it for. I argue that by putting a specific quantity and directions, that he is specifying (much like 20 pills, bid, clearly that is 10 days without having to say so).

Anyway, the pharmacist wasn't really picking a side and let me keep my 8 days on there, but the technician refused to see that we were inadvertently doubling the duration by not informing the patient.

There was this on the news and I just wanted pharmacists opinion in this. It says some doctors say they are useless and dangerous. 

Personally I would disagree as to go so far to say they are useless. While I agree a change in diet and exercise is the best way to help reduce cholesterol statins can also be used temporarily to help. After all if the patient will keep eating unhealthy it is obvious that he will have to keep taking statins to keep his cholesterol in check and that will result in more side effects, also important to note that side-effects do not affect everyone the same.

I posted this here mostly because there wasn't any mention of the pharmacists opinion and everything was said by doctors.

My question to you guys is, how was/is your pharmacy school experience in terms of the academic and social atmosphere? I'm actually very excited because I'll be seeing the same faces for the next four years just like high school. I went to a huge university so I rarely saw the same people every day.

Another question I had - did anyone join a pharmacy fraternity/sorority? I've only heard good things and I'm starting to consider it.

Is that what pharmacists really do?  People tell me I'm smart (although I don't feel that way often) so I could probably do something else, but I imagine that is the case for most pharmacists, so what was it that made you know pharmacy was the right choice?

I understand how strenuous the retail setting can be, but I'm also aware that specializing requires extra work through residencies and fellowships.

If you haven't read it before (I'm a new grad, so I hadn't read it until this past year), it's a very interesting story:
http://www.astrocyte-design.com/pharmaceutical/betty-dong.html
http://bioethics.stanford.edu/education/documents/Rennie_JAMA.pdf

Basically (copy/pasted my explanation from the other thread, so it's a very non-medical explanation)... 
Betty Dong was a strongly against switching patients from brand-name thyroid replacement products to generics, as she felt it would be unsafe. The manufacturer at the time (Boots Pharmaceuticals) of Synthroid (the brand name) wanted to gain a larger part of the thyroid replacement market share, so they gave her money to conduct studies to prove that there was truly a difference between the brand and generic. What she found, however, was that there was absolutely no difference between the two. As any good scientist would, she wanted to publish these groundbreaking findings and submitted it to JAMA - despite the fact that she had publicly been against switching patients from brand to generic. Boots pharmaceuticals was pissed, ended up threatening to sue her and all those involved. She was forced to pull the article at the last minute, and the pharmaceutical company started published other articles discrediting Dr. Dong in other journals... eventually the Wall Street Journal figured out what the company was doing, the FDA stepped in, and her results were finally [published](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9103344?dopt=Abstract).... albeit 5 years later.

I work for a Pharmacy Benefits Management company and I wanted to clarify some things.",11,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/o4s6y/well_its_openenrollment_again_i_work_for_a/,"Hello all! It's a very hectic time for us who work in the pharmacy benefits industry. I work for a pharmacy benefits management company (I'll not say which)....you know, those guys you call whenever you pharmacists call in for a reject of some sort or you doctors/nurses call in for prior authorizations? Yeah, I work there. Now, I'm sure that you guys probably hate us. :( But I wanted to clear up a few things.

Pharmacy callers:

- We know you've been transferred a lot. It sucks, trust me, we know. But in all honesty, there's nothing we can do about it. The insurance companies hide behind us and will put our phone number on their cards instead of theirs. It's basically a filter system where we have to determine where callers go. It's terrible and we want it to change as much as you do, but we don't have the power. And getting mad at us or telling us you've been transferred a lot only wastes both of our times. :/

- Yes, we HAVE to verify your information on every call. We hate it just as much as you do, but we HAVE to do it. This information includes but is not limited to: ID number, patient name and dob, your name, phone number and npi number for the pharmacy, pharmacy name, etc. 

- You know how most of you guys are calling in for processing information on patients' new plans? Well, most of the time the info we give is different than what's on the patient's card. Yes, it's dumb, but having the patient order a new card is useless -- it will likely have the same information. 

- Speaking of processing information, this is a real bitch during this time of the year, isn't it? The most common problem seems to be once we give you the proc. info, the fields don't update to reflect your new info. For example: you process with a BIN number of 12345 and a PCN of AB, if you later update that same claim with BIN 98765 and PCN of CD, the new claim will still have the old info. Usually cashing out the claim or backing it out then reprocessing will work. This seems to be a problem with all chains of pharmacies. This is also a common problem with DUR codes. Basically, if updating information doesn't work, try starting the claim over and reprocessing.

- We know that you hate it when we suggest calling your software vendor for assistance, we do too. But the fact of the matter is, we're working with a read-only system. Remember, we're the processor, not the actual insurance company. We can't change any information. If you're using information we give you to process a claim, etc, and it doesn't work when it clearly should be, we have no choice but to refer you there. 

- As you may have guessed, we have a lot of new people hired temporarily who are still learning the whole process. Personally, they really should've been hired earlier because as I'm sure you know, this type of work requires lots of knowledge on the topic and attention to detail, but we have to work with what we've got. If you have someone that you suspect is new and doesn't quite understand what you're saying, please be patient with them. If it gets bad enough, you can always ask for a supervisor but this should only be done if you feel you absolutely need one. They are just as busy as we are.

- In a related matter, the new year brings a lot of new rejections that even tenure agents don't understand. Of course with time we learn them, but some of these are complicated, especially with certain plans. 

- As a company, while we are graded for quality (and they are very strict about it), we are also graded for handle time on the phones. I won't give a specific number, but our average time is expected to be around 3 minutes. While we try to make sure that we give accurate info, we also have to do so in a timely manner. So with all due respect, please don't ask questions like, ""How are you?"", etc. Also, please try to have all your info ready when we answer. We know you guys are multi-tasking, but trust me, being prepared saves us all lots of trouble. :)

- In a related matter, there is just certain verbiage that we HAVE to give at the beginning and the end of the call. Again, I won't really go into detail here, but specifically, at the end of the call if you've gotten what you were looking for and you hear us giving our ""little speech"", feel free to go ahead and hang up. It won't hurt our feelings at all I promise.

- Lastly, PLEASE, I REPEAT, PLEASE DO ***NOT*** hand the phone over to the patient because at our department, we are not allowed to disclose any information to them. All it does is get them mad that we can't talk to them. All they can do is contact their customer services number on their card if they have any questions.

- I think that's all for now. I feel like I'm forgetting some things, but if I think of any I'll try to update. By no means am I saying that all the responsibility during the call is yours, just understand that a lot of times, we're in the same boat as you. We're decent people just trying to do our job and so long as you're good with us, we'll be good back! :) There's a lot of things I'd be interested in learning about what you guys have to do in your system and whatnot, so please feel free to respond and ask any questions!

Doctors/Nurses

- The main reason you guys call in is for prior authorizations. At the department I work, we can't issue those. Depending on the patient's plan, there are multiple prior authorization departments we have to transfer to in order to get the PA (remember, it's a filter system!) and sometimes we have to refer you over to the plan itself (remember, we're not the plan! Just the processor!) We understand you were probably transferred 2-3 times just to get to us, but as I said, we can't issue PAs and we can only get you to the right department. :/ It would be nice if the cards had the number directly to the PA department, but I guess the logic is to direct to us so we can confirm the exact reject and what needs to be done. 

- A lot of your calls are also drug coverage related and we do our best to help you here. The main problem is that we aren't medically trained, so we don't all know the purpose of certain medications, or brand/generic alternatives. A lot I know out of memory. For example, I know that Levoxyl is the brand name for Levothyroxine. Keep that in mind if you need to know if certain meds are covered!

- I guess that's about it for you guys, really. We understand that you guys are really busy and another transfer is frustrating, but trust me, we hate it as much as you guys do. Our systems only allow us to do what we're authorized to do and if we have to transfer you, we have no choice.



As I said above, I would really love to hear your side of the story! I've never worked in a pharmacy but I know it's hectic.

Colleges of pharmacy recently expanded to meet the predicted increase in pharmacists needed to provide patient care services. Now, we are in a predicament where the number of pharmacists graduating may exceed what the market demands. Our profession is still fighting to gain provider status, but dispensing fees are often insufficient to pay for product, let alone professional services. This situation may lead to what Brown described as the “perfect storm”—an oversupply of pharmacists coinciding with decreased demand. This situation would affect all pharmacists, regardless of practice setting.

When I say there is no tomorrow, there is true urgency in the statement. Change has to happen now, and it needs to be professionwide. As practitioners, we need to work harder to convince patients and payers of our value. Educate them about what you do to ensure that patients achieve their therapeutic goals through medication counseling and management. Discuss your clinical activities, interventions, and collaborations with other providers. Document your patient care activities so that you have proof of what you do. Integrate patient care activities into your daily practice, and follow through with targeted and comprehensive MTM interventions.

Pharmacy organizations need to help create different reimbursement models that pay pharmacists fairly for patient care activities. Reimbursement needs to go beyond our current model, in which pharmacists are paid primarily for select Medicare Part D patients, to include patient care services integrated with dispensing services.

Schools of pharmacy need to prepare students for the changing health care system, in which practitioners will be evaluated based on patient outcomes rather than dispensation. Students must know how to assess patients, implement clinical interventions, and document their activities effectively and efficiently.

Pharmacy has come a long way since the pharmaceutical care movement of the 1990s, but we need to step up our efforts. Our future depends on it.""

What did you do and why did you do it?

I'll go first.  Just happened the other night.  A ~80y/o male called my patient unsure if he took his clopidogrel dose and wanted to know what to do.  According to him, he went to take it earlier, got distracted, and came back to the pill he found on the kitchen table.  He did a pill count and according to him everything checked out, this was supposedly the dose he was suppose to take that day but he wasnt completely sure or not.  The man was worried about double dosing.  He said he read in the pamphlet that it said not to take a double dose if you missed it.  

Here is where I felt I did something counterintuitive.  I told him to take the dose.  Potentially his count could have been off and he could have potentially taken two doses of it in one day.  The reason I felt that this would have been okay even if he had double dose because I recall two instances from my clinical rotations where patients who missed a dose of their plavix, ended up in the ED with a CV event.  Twice this had happened during my clinical rotations.  I used my judgement and decided that a one time double dose (though a potential for increased risk of bleeding) of plavix would have been better than him missing a dose, and having a CV event.  I also took into account the situation and felt that the patient simply forgot to take the medication and left it on the table to find it later.

This has been a relatively painless process so far (aside from the tedious nature of it), but one PBM in particular is making this difficult. WindsorRx has rather strict guidelines for approving coverage compared to other PBM's.  

So far most of these requests have gone through other PBM's with ease despite them preferring some benzodiazepines over others and the non-preferred options have gotten approved.  WindsorRx on the other hand prefers diazepam (and one other I can't recall off the top of my head) over lorazepam and will not approve without relevant information documented in chart notes as to why the formulary options can't/won't be tried.  While I can provide this information most of the time, it seems absolutely absurd to have this requirement when all of these drugs are in the same class and are multi-source generics of roughly the same cost to the insurance. 

So my question is, what could be the rationale for WindsorRx to prefer diazepam over lorazepam, so much so as to deny the initial request despite the patient being stabilized on the lorazepam for over 2 years when, like I stated above, they are in the same class and roughly the same cost?  I understand the concepts of drug formularies/step-therapy etc, and how usually they are in place for cost-saving and/or safety measures, but this one has me puzzled.  I've asked a few of the providers at work but they also are at a loss so I'm wondering if any redditor pharmacy folks may have some insight.  As of right now I'm filing this under crazy-arbitrary insurance non-sense, but would love to be enlightened otherwise.

1359255787.0,9,self.pharmacy,17cm0g,Incoming pharmacy students: What I think you should do to prepare the summer before pharmacy school,24,15,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/17cm0g/incoming_pharmacy_students_what_i_think_you/,"This goes out to those worried or futuristic students who are just now getting accepted, and preferably, students who don't have much experience actually working in a pharmacy. So, the question is: ""What exactly should I do to better prepare myself for the madness that is pharmacy school?"" I know this question gets thrown around a lot during the summer, so hopefully students utilize the search function when that time comes. 

 So, here are my 5 simple rules to preparing for pharmacy school: 

**1) Begin developing good habits.** This means STOP CRAMMING! (I know it's a little too late for this in summer, but you get the idea). If you are currently in school, try it out. Begin planning ahead. Keep a calendar and planner (if you already don't have one). More importantly, pick up a fun, long-term hobby. This can be exercising, playing a sport, dancing, singing, cooking, becoming a chest grandmaster, whatever! The point is you want to lead a balanced life in order to de-stress during the difficult times in pharmacy school. 


**2) Develop networking skills.** Since the job market is narrowing, it is important to develop relationships that will last you throughout your career. I am often told that obtaining a job after pharmacy school may not necessarily be due to merit, yet instead, relies more on the people that you know. Begin making the effort to meet new people. Practice remembering the names, and finding conversation. Ask for a facebook add, email, or phone number to stay in touch. These skills should help for when you actually do become involved in organizations and conferences in pharmacy school. 


**3) Find a mentor** Out of all of your friends and family, you have to be able to find a pharmacist. If not, go to a pharmacy and tell them that you are beginning pharmacy school. I know this may be difficult without an intern or tech license, but ask him or her if you can shadow or work. If not, obtain their contact information, and use them as a source for questions. Ask how the job market is, how to improve yourself, and how a pharmacy simply works. And who knows.. maybe after you get your intern license, they'll end up hiring you. 


**4) Learn your word roots.** Many times, students try to think ahead by wanting to get started on actual pharmacy school material. Forget about that! There is simply too much to learn, let alone by yourself. Something I found interesting in pharmacy school was the amount of health jargon in every class. I would even go on to say that medical talk is like learning a new language. My suggestion would be to memorize medical word roots. You can easily Google for a list. If you've taken a course like medical terminology, then great! Review your old notes. Once you've covered that, move onto generic drug suffixes and their corresponding drug classes. Once you've done that, move on to memorizing generic and brand names. Do this in order; I think the results will be astounding. 

**5) Plan a career goal.** By now, you should be able to answer the question ""Why do you want to be a pharmacist?"" flawlessly. Make sure your reasons are completely honest and true. With that, research the job market; KNOW your strengths and KNOW your desires. In short, try to pinpoint what you really want to accomplish in life as a pharmacist, and create a simple long-term plan with steps of how to get you there. You obviously won't know for sure what you want to do until you get your hands dirty, but taking these first steps can do wonders. 


Now, I could add much more, but these are the primary things I'd focus on without getting overwhelmed. After all, this probably is your most free summer before school, so ENJOY IT! What do you guys think? If you have additional suggestions, feel free to comment. 


**EDIT:** Just to clarify, I'm not trying to ruin anyone's summer. I only post this because some students, no matter how sane they are, do ask this before school starts. With the exception of shadowing/working in #3, you can easily enjoy your summer. 1) Picking up a hobby won't buy into your relaxation time; it's supposed to be fun. And chances are, you already have one. 2) ""Network"" at parties, bars, or hangouts. Simply, meet people and talk. Make friends. 3) You don't need to shadow or work, but I would still encourage you to find an easily accessible and personal resource for questions. 4) You can do this in 5-10 minutes a day, or you can take care of it in one week. You'd still end up having at least 2 months to yourself. 5) Ok, I will be biased in this one because I believe a well balanced, happy life needs a sense of direction. This is not a homework assignment. Re-evaluate why you want to be a pharmacist because if you end up hating your job or not being satisfied with the pay, that will be a life long burden. You can find something related to pharmacy that will make you happy in the long-run; and if not, there is still time to refuse acceptance and re-plan your goals. Aside from all this, there is no doubt that you will have enough time to get wasted every weekend, to travel out of the country, to bond with friends one last time, or to pursue a new skill you never had time to master before. I had a 3 month summer before pharmacy school to do all of the above, and I could have done 1-5 easily during that time.

How come the USA has such a big problem in drug-shopping addicts?,12,2,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/176lfd/dutch_pharmacist_here_how_come_the_usa_has_such_a/,"It seems to me as if a big portion of a pharmacists work in the USA is to cope with addicts looking for opioids, benzo's or other illicit drugs. 

In the Netherlands this is hardly a problem. If a pharmacist notices overuse of benzo's/opioid's without a proper indication he will contact the GP (or any other organization which supplies the prescription), ask him to invite the patient over for a consult and not hand out the medication (or hand out for 1 week or sometimes even 2-3 days, telling the patient to seek medical advice from a GP/psychiatrist). It's even the case that if a patient hands over a forged prescription, they will contact the ""prescribing"" doctor and other pharmacies in the area to have them be aware of the patient. This also happens if a client steals a prescription block from a psychiatric healthcare organisation.

So I am curious. Is my view of the American patientfield skewed or is this really a major problem. It seems to me as if 1/20 patients is a pillshoppper, visiting different GP's, scoring as much Oxycontin on 1 prescription as possible and then go to different pharmacies with copies of that recipe? Am I simply ignorant of these kinds of problems because of how the Dutch healthcare system is trying to catch these drug abusers and trying to get them to kick off?

I've read around here that the market is over saturated but isn't every market nowadays? Usnews cited pharmacy as one of the top 25 jobs to go into (based on potential job growth http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/the-25-best-jobs). 

  On top of simply getting the pharmD I want to go into R&amp;D which at first I figured I could get away with not having any other degree than a B.S. in chemistry (which I am headed towards anyway) and the PharmD and a fellowship/residency in a particular area would do the rest. I have yet to work in a pharmacy but I've shadowed some doctors and I am pretty sure I don't want to go into that not to mention I don't feel my gpa/extracurriculars match what they are looking for. Pharmacy seemed to allow me the use of my brain, less pressure on my undergraduate career (not that much less but enough to stop me from stressing out too much) and the 'freedom' to possibly get into pharmaceutical research or work with a pharmaceutical company. 

Sidenote: I am considering a dual degree in pharmacy school (an MBA or PhD).

tl;dr 
 I want to know what I need to do to start working in a pharmaceutical company's research or upper management positions? 
 If the market is over-saturated for pharmacist- if so what do you suggest as an alternative in the healthcare because I think everything is becoming over-saturated? 
 And finally, does anyone work for a pharmaceutical company who has a Pharm.d- I would love a little insight.

I'm a pharmacist, graduated from KU several years ago with my PharmD. I did a PGY-1 residency in the VA and then moved into a private hospital. I'm currently employed as a clinical pharmacy specialist at a private hospital in the Midwest. In the last couple years I've seen some troubling changes:

1. Upper management does not respect pharmacists anymore. The vast majority of times that I receive positive feedback are when I do something that saves money. They literally make all pharmacists sign-in each morning when we arrive, and I was written up for 3 tardies in which I was literally 1 or 2 minutes late. I couldn't believe it. 

2. When clinical positions become available, upper management is obsessed with hiring PGY-2 candidates. They won't even interview anyone else. This doesn't scare me now, but in 10 years? What then? Will they be trying to push me out so they can bring in someone who's a PGY-2 PharmD and also a Physician's Assistant? I'm serious, that seems to be the new trend. 

3. Raises don't even keep up with inflation anymore. 

4. Health benefits have been diminished practically every year. 

5. I'm in a state that is not passing the Medicaid expansion, and everyone in management is flipping out. They have literally told me ""We're in big trouble if the state doesn't pass this Medicaid expansion.""

My current options are:

A. Stick with current position and try to weather the storm.

B. Move and get back with Veteran's Affairs. I actually really enjoyed working in the VA. How competitive are these jobs now?

C. Try and get some other federal position such as FDA or BOP.

Provider status =/= Prescribing Rights.  Provider status has to do with the amending the Social Security Act in order for pharmacists to be able to bill Medicare Part B for various services we provide.  Here are examples of current providers under the Social Security Act: physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, certified nurse-midwives, clinical social workers, clinical psychologists, and registered dieticians or nutrition professionals.  Also, in obtaining a federally recognized provider status, all private insurance providers would then recognize pharmacists as providers and we would be able to bill them as well.

With that clarification made, what are examples of services you would bill for if you could?  Or what are services you would actually perform but currently dont because there is no means for reimbursement?

Here are some off the top of my head:

-health care screenings or point of care testing (A1c, blood glucose, blood pressure, etc)

-diabetes classes

-MTM for non-Part D patients

-immunizations

-coaching sessions (smoking cessation, heart healthy, nutrition, etc)

-splitting tablets for patients/flavoring drugs for patients

-calling MD to make an intervention

-scheduling an MTM appointment (to at least get paid for preparing for an MTM and the patient not show up)

-counseling on a medication

-DMEPOS


So its everyone elses turn, what would you guys bill for if you could?

There's very limited information on the internet about pharmacy law, so I have a few general comments/questions that I'm hoping will get a conversation started: 

1. I'm not eager to go out and get a Pharm.D. on top of my law degree, but I would really like to have an edge in the pharmacy industry when I go on to practice law.  Do you have any suggestions as to how to gain some experience/knowledge? Don't tell me to just go read a book (unless you have a really good one in mind).

2. Please tell me about any experiences you have had with pharmacy lawyers/law in general.  

3. Now I know that ""pharmacy law"" is quite broad; there's everything from pharmaceutical patent lawyers to tort litigators. I'm particularly interested in taking a counsel/consultant/legal compliance role for a firm or insurance company. What do you think? Is there a particular sub-field in pharmacy (e.g. pandemic drugs [excuse my ignorance]) that you think is going to be hot in a few years and will have high demand for lawyers?

I'm trying to create a niche for myself by going into pharmacy law. If you weren't already aware, the legal profession is extremely saturated right now. I strongly believe that a lot of recent law grads are not getting jobs because they have no expertise.  I figure that if I can take some initiative early on and have a plan, I won't end up getting screwed with a law degree. So help me out reddit, huh? Thanks!

I'm currently on a general medicine rotation and its not at all what I expected. I'm thinking about sitting down with my preceptor about it but I just wanted to make sure that my expectations are not atypical.

Basically I come into the pharmacy and I work up a whole floor of patients. By working up I mean, I assess their labs (renal function, CBC, electrolytes if warranted, microbiology), check their chart to see if they are improving on therapy and if therapy is still appropriate, go through and make sure relevant labs have been ordered, finally I find out how well they are eating for IV to PO conversion. After I'm done with that (2-3.5 hours depending on census) I just work on projects (usually case presentations) until the clinical pharmacist comes back and we take 20 minutes to go over my patients. Then I either go back to projects or if I'm lucky I get to counsel a patient on warfarin. Recently, I was given a new project where I just determine whether an ADR occurred based on drug therapies ordered. 

I was kind of expecting to go on rounds and make suggestions on therapy in an interdisciplinary team. I don't know have some interaction with doctors other than ""I need that chart.""

I guess what I'm getting at is I don't get how what I'm doing now differs from what I would do on a hospital rotation, since at least at my site, the staff pharmacists do everything that I do (and more since  they check compounded IVs and pyxis and do controlled substance, etc).

Feedback Desired!,17,10,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/19nv9o/new_pharmaceutical_aid_pharticulate_feedback/,"TL;DR - We have designed a Windows based application called PharTiculate to help people in the Pharmaceutical Industry learn how to pronounce drug names and get basic drug information to educate and improve credibility.

Hey Guys and Gals of /r/Pharmacy!

My name is Brad and am a long time Redditor. On behalf of my newly formed business partner Deidre, I wanted to take a moment to reach out to the community and inform you guys of a new application we have started to sell called PharTiculate. We have both been employed in the Pharmaceutical industry for a while. Myself in the IT side and Deidre in the Customer Service / Pharmacy Technician side. Deidre had an idea for the program after noticing how often techs and customer service reps would mispronounce drug names or had no idea what they were for.  She was surprised to discover that there was no good, quick resource of this information out there and these are the people tasked with talking with the patients most often. She came to me and asked if I could design something that would be easy to use and could help people overcome this challenge. About a year and a half later, PharTiculate was born. In a nutshell, PharTiculate lets the user search a list of either Generic or Brand Name Drugs and view basic information about it in a flashcard format. Besides being a shameless plug to spread word of mouth about PharTicualte, we decided that what better way to get good honest feedback than to reach out to the Reddit community which made this kind of feedback famous on the internet. Our intention is to make PharTiculate as good and polished as it can be.

More information and a downloadable demo can be found at http://www.pharticulate.com. We would appreciate any positive as well as negative feedback that you guys might like to provide with no obligation to purchase any licenses at all. If you believe we are on to something and might like to purchase a license believing it may be of benefit to you, we are offering a 20% discount to the Reddit community for individual and business licenses. Send us a PM and we will send you a discount code to use during checkout.

1358643067.0,5,self.pharmacy,16wkkv,Pharmacists and techs! Are these patterns prevalent with Suboxone users in your area?,15,10,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/16wkkv/pharmacists_and_techs_are_these_patterns/,"I am simply trying to determine if these are general issues other people have had to deal with in the pharmacy, and hopefully gain an understanding as to why.

I am a tech with almost 2 years of experience. I worked in a retail setting for a while and then moved away to a different school for a year. I came back and got my old job back, but several things had changed: Lortab and Xanax were not the common thing - suddenly everyone is on Suboxone. Prior to my move, I had only filled a few prescriptions for it over a year. I come back, and suddenly, it appears that 30-40% of the cusotmer base is getting it.

I live in an area that deals with prescription drug abuse frequently. However, unlike filling Lortab and Xanax often as I used to, I noticed Suboxone users tend to be...different. I see common behaivors to the point I can guess that they are picking up Suboxone, and have always been right. This disturbs me.

In instance one, there is a patient at the counter. Normally, people stand in line behind them. Suboxone customers tend to stand BESIDE them at the register, and stare at me. Now, when a customer asks what they have that is ready, I don't want to tell them they have Valtrex and Viagra when I don't know if the person standing next to them is a stranger or not. This happens around 80% of the time when someone is in line for Suboxone. No customer privacy whatsoever.

Calling. I would say the majority of calls I answer are about someone telling us to get their Suboxone ready. However, most of the time, they are outside in the parking lot when they call. Also, they tend to have others pick up the medication for them. Not only that, 50% of the time they are on the phone and make a damn drug deal right in front of me. However, as this is retail, the sale matters more, as I am told. I would estimate (where I live, anyways) that 2 out of the 30+ patients that receive this medicine are actually trying to break away from the substances they were originally addicted to. The rest make sales in front of me, which pisses me off. This leads into the next issue.

I see these people several times a day. Now, this area isn't know to have sufficient access to 'real"" drugs. Still, I should not see the same patient - 1. Daily, and 2. Multiple times in one day. I should not see you on every shift I work, much less 2-3 times a shift.

They come in pairs - Since many tend to have no issue talking in front of the pharmacy, it appears that the party that does not have a prescription is often the driver and buyer. Often times, they are given permission to pick up the medication, often leading me to believe that they have simply given money to pick up the suboxone from the other person.

They know the price of their medication and tend to have exact change. It is understandable since they are here, buying it then coming back an hour later for more. However, handing me exact change, rolled up in electrical tape and such gets suspicious. This isn't something I am bitching about, it is just another thing on the list of common things I see. Even the customers that are clockwork, knowing what day they are out of X drug dont come in with exact change. Something about suboxone always ends up without having to break a bill. Always exact change, everytime.

I'm not looking down on anyone here. I am merely wanting to know if other places outside of this region (SWVA) deal with the exact same thing, and if anyone happens to know why. If you or your friends do this, inform me! I'd like to understand this. I want to know why people stand next to customers at the counter and stare at me, why they have exact change, why I see them several times a day (I dont want to assume dealing, but hey, I see it often in this field) and why they call so frequently, and are in the parking lot when they call. I don't know exactly how this stuff affects people, but I can easily state that I don't see this with people on other substances that I deal with on a day to day basis. I don't want to continue asking why, I want to understand it.

I was wondering how / if labor laws pertain to retail pharmacists in the sense that they can only work a 40 hour + overtime(unless salary contracted) work week, or even have a limit as to how many hours a shift can last per day.

My girlfriend is a salaried FT pharmer and works at a large retail pharmacy (DR, CVS, RiteAid, one of those) and she works 10 hour shifts (Scheduled) but stays for 12-14 a day sometimes, with **no time for lunch / bathroom breaks.** Now as a normal person who works a 9-5(6 or 7) job, I can't wrap my head around the fact that she works this much and doesn't even get a 5 minute break to do personal business or even eat a fucking snack, it's really frustrating hearing that she doesn't have the time to maintain her own health during work hours.


Please /r/Pharmacy. Help me out with this and give me some insight as to your experiences and dealings with retail pharmacy or any pharmacy with a similar experience/story.

I started off in community college because I wasn't sure what the hell I wanted to do with my life, and have recently decided pharmacy would be a good fit for me. I was just accepted to the biological sciences B.S. program at the University of Rhode Island, and since I already have a ton of credits from messing around in community college, I plan to get my bachelor's before I apply to pharmacy school.

I've been looking around on the web and while there's an abundance of ""How to become x doctor"" websites, there's precious little info on a good path for pharmacy. URI offers a pharm.D. program that's pretty well respected around the area, and they just renovated the entire department so they have a bunch of toys to play with. The downside is that they don't offer a dual phd/pharmd program, which is what I was interested in because I think I'd enjoy doing research.

Is it feasible to get a PharmD and perhaps some fellowship training and then work on a PhD while I'm in the workforce? Or should I be looking at schools where I can get them both done in the same go.

From what I've seen it's kind of hard to do research as a PharmD, and I'm better off getting a PhD. What sort of PhD would be good for research at a university or drug company. Would general Pharmacology be okay?

I'm keeping my options open because I'm not fond of planning out my entire life in one go, and right now I'm focused on just getting my bachelor's, but I'm interested in what input you guys might have!

Morphine is used for treating moderate to severe acute or chronic pain (i.e. it is an analgesic). One of its more serious side-effects is respiratory depression. Its severity can be judged by the degree of sedation (i.e. depression of a patient's awareness to the environment and reduction in their responsiveness to external stimulation). Almost all of a dose of morphine, whether administered intravenously or orally, is metabolized by conjugation (covalent combination) with sugar derivatives (glucuronides formed from glucose) to form two glucuronide metabolites. One of the metabolites also possesses analgesic activity and side-effects, acting via a similar mechanism to morphine.

(a)
The Australian Medicines Handbook (AMH) advises to “Avoid use in severe hepatic impairment; may cause excessive sedation or coma.” What might be the reason for the excessive sedation from morphine in patients with severe impairment of liver function?

(b)
The AMH also advises that morphine may cause excessive sedation and delirium in patients with renal impairment. Explain why there might be a greater risk of these side-effects in such patients.

There is currently no answer to this question and I am unsure due to my inexperience and lack of knowledge in pharmacy whether or not i am on the right track with my answer.

I started as a technician and got my training and license by working for CVS near the campus of a major US pharmacy school where I was an undergrad student with hopes of getting into pharmacy school and becoming a pharmacist. After 6 months my license was upgraded from tech-in-training to regular tech and I studied hard for the national tech certification. Because of financial troubles (I made what highschoolers who put fries in a box at McDonalds make) along with my parents' declining health I had to go home for a while.

I continued to work for CVS but after some typical CVS shenanigans I began working at a small local grocery store chain.

My boss seemed like a really nice guy. He hired me on the spot and gave me a $3/hr payraise over CVS and it was only two minutes from my house. I worked as many hours as possible in a couple locations around town including 1 weekend shift/week at a location an hour away because they needed the help. I was putting in over 50 hours a week for 6 months straight. During that time I had some health issues but nothing too serious that would require me to miss work or perform poorly. I had broken tooth that would have been too much for me to pay out of pocket to fix, an ear infection, etc.

I spent all day helping people in the community bill their controlled substances to the government from doctors who were under investigation by the DEA, but it was a long process and they were still handing out scripts like candy to some really sketchy people. During all of this I just kept telling myself that after my 6 months I'd get insurance too and could go see a doctor and look after my own health. I'm sure a lot of health care workers here can sympathize. 

After 6 months I was contacted by someone in the company who wanted to talk to me about my options for limited health insurance coverage that I would have to pay for myself at a very high monthly cost that was out of my ability to pay, and wouldn't help me very much at all anyway. When I asked about it, I was told that as a part time employee that's just how things were.

I was pretty angry, because the pharmacy store manager that hired me told me he had hired me as full time, and again, I was putting in over 50 hours a week. I called him up and asked him if I was full time or part time. He assured me I was full time.

I knew where the employee files were kept so the next time he was gone and we had a floater pharmacist I took a peak at mine, as they weren't locked away or anything. The day after I was hired there was a notation in my file that said, in my boss's handwriting, 'employee switched to part time' dated with his signature next to it. He knew I was working under the idea that I was full time and putting off my own care until I would get insurance, which he knew that I wouldn't be able to get. 

Also in the file was my 3 month review which stated that I was a great employee with a professional demeanor that was a great addition to their team, yada yada.

During my time there, a lot of things bothered me about the way things were done. It was a poor area and right across the street from an apartment complex that was full of our frequent fliers. I saw the same faces daily in there causing problems about early refills for CII's. Many prescriptions were filled severely early. Every month without fail our pharmacy went through the maximum amount of the different strengths of norco/hydrocodone that we were allowed to purchase from our supplier by only midmonth, and had to do inter-store transfers from other locations in order to supply the customers. It was the same for soma, xanax, and valium.

Customers would come in with prescriptions for these sorts of drugs and have the gall to tell me that CVS down the street wouldn't fill it for them because it was too early, but they heard we would fill anything. These people had their needs met.

I learned about the national database that these sorts of purchases were reported to and learned that we can look up patient prescriptions. I told my concerns to the pharmacist at the store an hour away that I worked 1 shift a week at. I began, with her help, to look up the patient names of our customers at her location and confirmed that these people were filling all over town. After seeing the proof I told my pharmacy manager about it. I told him which patients, which drugs. We are talking about obscene amounts. Sometimes I saw these patients making drug deals in the parking lot after leaving our store.

Word came down from the pharmacy head of all stores that I was to stop doing this. I never betrayed patient confidentiality, as I didn't report anybody or make mention outside of the pharmacists in our company who saw these patients. I feel my concerns were legitimate and I was practicing due diligence and doing my job, and that these patients and the doctors prescribing them who were under investigation by the DEA (some of their patients died by OD) were making a mockery out of the pharmacy profession. I just honestly didn't want to spend all day helping drug addicts get their fix at the tax payers expense, or help local dealers fill their inventory. I did as I was told though and just did my job to the letter and kept my head down.

Rather than cause a stink, I told myself it was just a sign that I should leave that particular pharmacy and go back to school. I called around back on the campus I had come from the year before and found a store location within the company I was employed by and got hired on by a store manager who promised me full time with benefits, which I was ecstatic about as it meant I could go back to school.

I gave 1 month notice and worked up to my last day as a professional and left on good terms. I never confronted my boss about lying to my face about the full time/insurance issue.

When I got back to school I started working at the new location. The store manager that had promised me full time and benefits wouldn't let me fill scripts, answer phones, touch a computer, etc, as it was a small pharmacy and he wanted to do all the patient interaction himself. He instead scheduled me for 10 hours a week driving a hatchback gremlin delivering meds to patients out in the boonies. I talked to him about the promise he made, the whole reason I had relocated in the first place, and he said he couldn't do anything for me. Unable to sign a lease or afford a place to stay with only a 10 hour a week job, I was forced to quit and without notice, as I couldn't even find a place to stay while I did another two weeks.

My file now says quit without notice.

I abandoned pharmacy altogether and now work as an EMT. I deal with heart attacks, gunshots, grannies who broke their hip, etc.

I still don't get health insurance. I haven't been to a doctor, a dentist, or an eye doctor in many, many years. I can't afford to finish school still. I'm extremely bitter about health care in America, and really peeved about how things ended in my pharmacy job. My license has expired naturally and I haven't renewed it.

I love medicine, and I've accepted that I'll never be a doctor or a pharmacist even though I'm a hard worker and bright enough.

Are there any career paths in medicine that I can pursue that will allow for a decent lifestyle, with health care for myself, that operates ethically? I've been all over and I can't find it.

Sorry to rant. I just miss working in pharmacy and feel really nostalgic today.

Since graduating pharmacy school a couple years back, I never had a pharmacy job. No retail, no hospital, nothing. I was still working in a restaurant as a server trying to make ends meet, as no immediate job opportunities were on the table. I quit that job when I graduated, as I wanted to focus on passing my tests, and that job just got shitty after the 3 years I was there. Then I figured, ""well, if I don't have a good job lined up, what's the rush?"" I knew I was already at a disadvantage. So I took my time passing the exams, and did a lot of traveling. I know I should have been looking for work as an intern all the while, but coulda-woulda-shoulda, and now I'm here. 

Since I finally got my license, I have been applying to jobs everywhere but no bites yet. I knew it wouldn't be easy to find a job just because I'm licensed, but I wasn't expecting this. I literally have no experience other than from rotations, and my resume is pretty weak.

**Update** Lexicomp says that the contents of the capsule can be emptied into apple sauce or apple juice and not chocolate pudding (difference lies in pH which may result in compromising the enteric coating). I'm trying to decide if I should try administering the med via gastric tube with apple sauce/apple juice or buffered solution or maybe even just hold the med and monitor for symptoms for fear of risking an overdose.

Update to the update: Ok so I was an idiot and forgot to check the patient's renal function. His CrCl turned out to be &lt;30 so duloxetine would not be recommended for this patient. Still, I'm curious if the patient had normal renal function, what should be done?

Advice?,17,12,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/wxnnf/as_a_floating_intern_pharmacist_i_see_a_lot_of/,"I work for a major chain in California. I float from store to store. Here are a few things that make me quite uncomfortable, but I'm not sure what, if anything, I can/should do about it.

1) California law mandates that if there is only one pharmacist on duty then there may only be one technician. There may be as many clerks as the rph feels comfortable with, two pharmacist interns, one technician extern. When there are two pharmacists there may be three techs. Clerks may ring up scripts, type scripts, and accept refills. Now in this chain I constantly see two techs per pharmacist. One of those techs should be working as a ""clerk,"" doing nothing but clerk duties in order for it to be legal. But both the techs do tech work (ie filling scripts, restocking drugs, etc).  An inspection by the board could land me fine if I'm the rph on duty at the time. 

2) California requires mandatory counseling on ALL new scripts, copies, and changes in dose or directions. Techs must instruct all patients to go to the counseling window if their script falls in these categories. I routinely see/hear ""do you want a consultation with this?"" I rarely see a tech direct the patient to the counseling window unless the patient asks for it. Not only is this illegal and could result in a fine, but it is dangerous! As an intern I've learned that patients don't know shit about their drugs or their side effects. It's important they talk with a pharmacist. 

I'll leave it at two. These are the things that bug me the most though there are a few other things that strike the wrong chord. 

Once I am working as a pharmacist I will demand any tech I work with to follow the laws. If they don't I'll report them. If I'm a manager I'll write them up. If corporate doesn't do anything to remedy the situation I'll report the pharmacy to the board.  This makes me seem like a bitch, but it's my license on the line. 

*tl;dr* I know counseling takes a lot of time, we are slammed with scripts, have corporate deadlines and goals to meet, and are usually understaffed, but I don't think that is sufficient reason to blatantly ignore the law. People are going to hate me.

I'm currently in my final year of school (P4/APPE rotations,whatever you want to call it).  I haven't really worked in a pharmacy (as a paid job), which I realize puts me at a great disadvantage compared to others with years of tech/intern experience, but it's a bit late to change that now.  The majority of my friends in pharm school are all contemplating fellowships and residencies, and planning their trips and such for Mid-Year.

At this point, I don't really see myself pursuing any kind of clinical and/or industry position after graduation, just not my cup of tea from what I know about them.  My real question is, is it worth the time/money/stress for me to go to Mid-year if I don't plan on going into those fields?  My roommate, who is in my year in school, asked me the other day about my plans for the trip, and when I said that I didn't think I was going, he basically said (in a polite way), ""how do you expect to get a job after graduation if you don't go to Mid-Year?"", and it kind of worried me.

I wouldn't mind a community pharmacy job, but I know that without a foot in the door from being an intern/tech, those can be tough to get.  I'm also strongly interested in the areas of specialty compounding and nuclear pharmacy, based on previous rotations that I've had, and I know that they require additional certifications after graduation.

I am not really getting the kind of pain relief from the Difenac that I was getting from the Robax Platinum and I think it may be because the methocarbamol was helping with the muscle spasms.

I never acted on it because I kept telling myself it was too late to switch. Throughout the 3+ years I've spent in lab, I never really enjoyed it. I stayed on the track mainly because I found the intellectual part/literature pretty interesting and I liked the people I was working with in lab. But now, with graduation approaching, I'm getting really anxious and depressed just thinking about applying to grad school/doing research fulltime. Basically, I'm really starting to regret my decision to pursue grad school instead of pharmacy. 


My favorite subjects in college have been ochem and immunology and I definitely prefer interacting with different people to being stuck with mice/dna/cells all day so.. I am now seriuosly considering going to community college after I graduate to finish some prepharm courses.

 
I've thought about it a lot, and honestly, I'm extremely scared to make this sudden career path change just as I'm about to graduate. I would like to know if anyone else has been in a similar situation and if so, how you handled it. I also have a couple questions regarding applying to pharmacy school which I've listed below.


Prepharm Questions:

1)Will taking prepharm classes at a community college instead of a four year university hurt my chances to get into a good pharmacy school? (I am currently at a pretty good university with a 3.72 GPA and I still have to take a microbio class with lab, anatomy class, econ, and public speaking) 

2)What kind of extracurriculars do pharmacy schools usually look for? (I've done a lot of volunteer work and research. Should I shadow a pharmacist or is it possible to volunteer at a pharmacy? If so, how should I go about finding a pharmacist who would be willing to let me shadow? How important are leadership activities to pharmacy schools?


Any other tips for applying to pharm school would be greatly appreciated!

I have been prescribed amitriptyline by my doctor.  I am supposed to take 10mg about 30 minutes before I go to bed.  I thought I would be getting 10mg pills, as I had received 10mg pills in the past.  However, when the pills arrived in the mail, the box said 100mg.  Also, the instructions and packaging are all in German (I think).

I have a Walgreens pretty close to my house, so I took these pills there to have them identified.  The pharmacist there refused to help. She said that since I hadn't received the pills from Walgreens, she would not be able to help me.

I then called my doctor's office, and they said that I needed an appointment, and they had one available in 2 weeks.  I thought about it, but I really can't go 2 weeks without sleeping.

I am pretty sure that each pill is 50mg, and each tear-off section has two 50mg pills, hence the 100mg markings.  However, I am not going to take this medication until I know what I am dealing with.

[These are the pills in question.](http://imgur.com/a/NPotC)  I have included pictures of the front and back of the pill, the packaging, and the blister pack they came in.

Anyway, the pharmacist tells the patient to just wait until tomorrow and go ahead with the remainder of the Z-pack. His reasoning was that 1. the patient had some antibiotic activity going on already from the Augmentin and 2. enough azithromycin would have gotten into the patient's system to skip to the next dose.

OK, given it was like 7pm on a Friday night when some doctors had already closed early for the holiday weekend, but I felt like he took the lazy way out by not looking into the situation further and/or researching the pharmacokinetics of azithromycin (which he may not have been able to find anyway due to the corporate firewall on our computers).

I don't hate it like most people seem; I'm a people person and people seem to like me so it's naturally a pretty good fit (and the money obviously helps too).

My only real experience/skills are related to retail pharmacy.

I didn't do any residencies once I got my PharmD, but I am about halfway through getting my MBA...I had to put that on hold with the birth of my first child this past October.  But I don't think owning my own independent pharmacy would really be for me either...just more of the same with added business-related headaches.

I ask because I've recently become somewhat frustrated with some of the courses I'm taking; not because of their difficulty or unreasonable test questions, but because I feel like they're not being taught particularly well.  

For some of the more ""practice-based"" classes, including those that focus on ethics, SOAP notes, interviewing, counseling, health disparities, and other similar topics, I feel that much of the material and lecturing is not particularly well presented. It seems that much of the time, lecturers are unclear, ambiguous, or somewhat shallow in their explanations of these subject areas. It often seems that the professor him/herself doesn't really have a deep appreciation of the material, and can only explain things to a certain extent. However, when I look around the school, I see examples of published research and projects from some of the professors that have caused me the most frustrations. I have to wonder if maybe my expectations for teaching are unrealistic, or if maybe I'm just seeing them outside of their strong subject areas. In any case, I'm mostly wondering if this sort of thing is ""the norm"" for this type of material, or if I'm missing out on gaining a well rounded, deep understanding of important issues.  I've tossed around the idea of becoming a faculty member in the future, and I don't know whether this is an opportunity for me to make an impact, or just something that will drive me crazy.

That said, I feel as though the faculty members that handle the science and therapeutics courses are very knowledgeable, well qualified, and effective at teaching.  Maybe the areas that frustrate me simply aren't all that important or effective (from a didactic standpoint) in training good pharmacists.

I'm uncertain whether other countries have tiered healthcare in senses similar to the way we do, and I know that this provides us ""options,"" but the negative aspects really seem to runaway with all of the benefits it provides us.  My questions are below this demonstration of what I'm talking about. 



I find the insurance co. driven healthcare system in the US discomfiting, personally.  In the scope of pharmacy, I observe our pharmacists (I work as a tech) bending over backwards all of the time to work around coverage issues.



The instance that comes to mind was about a dad under Caterpillar insurance, who was nearly sideswiped when he discovered that his insurance policy actually *penalizes* some of its insured members when they fill at certain pharmacies.  Now, obviously this isn't always a big issue; in fact, numerous families have gotten quite skilled at trying to understand the exact niche that their insurance co. has placed them.  That being said, I don’t believe this is reason enough for us to abandon our father figure example either.  Let's look on.



The Caterpillar example has a few variables to it, but it in short led to him trying to fill a script for a Class II narcotic for the eldest child who was on her last (transdermal) patch from the previous script (filled elsewhere, I'm assuming); we would have to charge him an obscene amount for that generic (his policy completely excluded the brand name), and unfortunately none of the preferred local options, which would have charged nothing through his policy, had enough to fill the prescription.  I am aware that the promotion systems are continuously engaged in our healthcare system, but the act of penalizing a man for trying to work with a system that may have benefited him more based on proximity or whatever variables he normally manipulated is clearly hurtful to the patient, and seems blatantly driven by company politics.


My pharmacist, after calling all of the local Walmarts, (the preferred option) did in fact managed to find an intermediate that was only going to have a $15 copay for dad.  



It might not seem like much to make a few phone calls, but the whole affair took well over 30 minutes (it was late thankfully).  Considering that the business is saturated with phone calls for new scripts, transfers, and questions, vaccinations, and some biochemical analyses, as well as the traditional role of monitoring indications and contraindications for our customers, placating a customer to this degree isn't feasible. It especially reeks of yesterday's fish when everybody is painfully aware that the big pink elephant, representing insurance companies' mentality of “our politics first and our customers' health second,” is unashamedly waving a multicolored banner bearing the words ""Sucks for you"" around for all to see.



TLDR: Anecdotal evidence shows US insurance companies' disinterest in their customers' health being the cornerstone for their policies.   Pharmacists literally work to manipulate any variables they can to maintain their customers’ health at reasonable costs, but when it’s circumnavigating insurance companies, it really starts to open questions on the system’s foundations.



So my questions for the rest of the pharmacy world are:



How does your government handle healthcare, in consideration of the pharmaceutical aspects, and what about it do you think is really beneficial, and what do you think is completely detrimental?

*Remove the fat and connective tissue directly the sheep is killed. Reject cystic, hypertrophied or otherwise abnormal glands. Mince. Dry at 90° to 100° F. 32.2° to 37.7° C.. Powder the dried product. Remove all fat by washing with petroleum spirit and again dry.*

Would isopropanol work as a fat solvent? How do you actually go about dissolving the fat so that you're left with the powder?

However, as many of others in the same situation as I have noticed, there is painfully little information for prepharm students.

So, as the title says, I am looking to pursue an education to become a pharmacist.  I live in MA and would plan on practicing here as well.  I am a CPhT at the moment.

My first (and primary) question is: what degrees would benefit me from pre-graduate schools in order to gain admission into a school of pharmacy?  I am having issues finding answers to this off of search engines.  Maybe I am just wording funny.

Second, do the prerequisites for pharmacy school require a 2-year or 4-year degree prior to admission?

I graduated with a BA in linguistics, but I don't think have a strong interest to pursue an MA for it. I might not be good with languages in general and I probably can't teach either.

I currently work part time for a very small company that deals with website design/graphic design, but I have just have the basic skills with HTML and Photoshop. I have a wavering interest for art/graphic design, but my work is mediocre at best.

My dad wanted me to pursue pharmacy because of the salary, however I am terrible with a science and math classes. But I think more and more about my future and jobs, it seems pharmacy might be a more secure path to take.. So, I was wondering whether I should go back to school for second bachelor's degree in pre-pharmacy (and maybe graphic design or not) and then pursue pharmacy school. Inevitably, I will have to deal with loans and getting a lot help/tutoring too.. I just don't know what I should really do with my life.. I've been depressed on and off about this because I feel absolutely useless in society. If you have any suggestions, I am open to them.

Thank you to anyone who reads this.

I'm a little ambiguous by the way I'm being taught to calculate the amount of mls that I'm going to need for electrolytes in my class, and also about how to calculate the amount of amino acid, dextrose and fat emulsion. The teacher who is teaching me is a really bad teacher and I can't seem to find another information in my book, so here's the question that I'm working on right now:

**Available electrolytes**

Sodium Chloride: 4mEq/ml
Potassium Acetate: 2mEq/ml
Magnesium Sulfate: 4.06mEq/ml
Potassium Phosphate: 4mEq/ml (K) &amp; 3mM/ml (PO4)
Potassium Chloride: 2mEq/ml
Sodium Acetate: 2mEq/ml
Calcium Gluconate: 4.65mEq/10ml
Dextrose 70%
Amino Acid 10%
Fat Emulsion 20%

**Order**

Sodium 180mEq
Potassium 40mEq
Magnesium 12mEq

Chloride 40mEq
Phophate 4.5mM
Acetate(to balance)
Amino Acid 2%
Dextrose 12%
Fat Emulsion 1.5%
Total Volume: 2450 ml

one question that I would like answered as well is whether the percentage of the dextrose, fat emulsion, and amino acids in the order represent the percentage of the total volume of the TPN, or if it represents a percentage that is diluted from the the original concentration and if it's a diluted version how do you figure out how much you need for the TPN.

I am a junior now and my first two years of college were god awful. The first two years of school I had lack of motivation to pursue my studies seriously. I wasn't going out every night or even indulging in bad behavior but rather my mind was never at the task at hand.  In my non science/math classes I got mainly all B's but for everything else I did even worse. Got Cs in general biology, general chemistry 1 ( b in lab which is 1 credit), calc 1, and when i got a d in orgo 1 (got a b in the lab), i retook and got a C. Also when it was time for me to take orgo 2 i withdrew from the course (keeping the lab I got a C) and even got a D in microeconomics. After these two years I took a hard look at my life and the road it was headed towards and decided to make a change but  I'm afraid it's still too late.

 I received a 2.5 GPA after those 2 years and that following summer enrolled in Physics 1 at my local community college (due to the classes being significantly cheaper as opposed to my 4 year) and got a B. The following semester I got a 3.2 gpa (last fall) and that includes a B in Anatomy and Physiology 1 ultimately raising my gpa to a 2.72 . As of now I'm taking other classes required for my Public Health major which are going ok, but not to be making excuses, this time around Anatomy 2 is going god awful for me. The professor this semester tests and overall layout for the class are quite difficult compared to the last professor.. At this point in the class it seems I will be getting a C in that course and getting a 3.0-3.2 this semester (raising my gpa to a 2.77-2.8).


My current plan is to enroll into orgo 2 this summer at my local community college (again due to cost) but doing well next year in both gen chem 2, physics 2, and microbio. This year was my first year changing my study habits in college and though they have shown results I am still tinkering them to perfection on how to study properly/manage time which will definitely happen by next year. But what I'm worrying about is despite showing an upwards trend in my overall grades, getting Bs in my more recent science courses is not going to be good enough with my horrible academic record. I plan on  prepping very hard for the pcat and working at a pharmacy as a technician, but I don't know if this will suffice. When I think about it, by the time I'll graduate with my improved recent grades, I'll still barley meet the bare requirements for the 2.5 min prerequisite gpa that most schools require since I did so bad initially. 

This is a bit of ramble but my mind is such a mess now thinking about these things. If anyone had any advice/tips I'd be very grateful. ",,False,,t5_2qjl3,True,,,True,t3_rtw9v,http://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/rtw9v/is_there_hope/,

A question for pharmacists from a pharmacy student,8,4,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/pj5iw/how_much_of_this_stuff_will_i_actually_use_a/,"I'm currently in the second semester of my P1 year and I thought I'd pose a question I've been considering lately. I am in the second half of a pharmaceutical calculations course in the program and my professor has become frustrated with my class recently because of our grades on the first exam on Monday (2/6). 

In the first half of the course, we covered the basics like conversions and the metric system, and eventually moved up to clinical calculations such as TPN, IBW, etc. The professor who covered these topics provided the class with the formulas on the final exam and most people did well as far as I understand. She didn't see a point in forcing us to memorize all of the various formulas, molecular weights, sodium chloride equivalents (E values for calculations isotonicity) and the like.

However, the professor this semester has decided that it's imperative for us to know all of these things. He claims that we will have to know these for the boards exams and once we eventually enter the workforce. This requirement has caused many students grief because of the sheer amount of things we are supposed to remember.

I'm perfectly fine with learning whatever is asked of me, especially considering how interested I am in the field in general, and the fact that I want to move on to clinical pharmacy after receiving my PharmD. At the same time, the majority of my classmates will likely end up in retail/community pharmacy and stay there for the extent of their careers.

What I want to know is how often any of you retail/community pharmacists actually use these things. How often do you calculate mEq or perform other calculations involving molecular weight, and how necessary is it to remember these? How often do you perform calculations for isotonicity and other calculations required for compounding? 

While I'm not the typical young person who likes to mindlessly claim we can just look up formulas, values, molecular weights, etc. in books or our phone when we need to, I have to think it's an option utilized by many pharmacists. 

In the end, I'm concerned that many of my classmates won't get through the program strictly because of petty things like memorization, but I guess that's part of the weeding-out that occurs with programs like this.

I will begin my first year in pharmacy school this fall. I am in the process of deciding what I should do for my last ""free"" summer before pharmacy school. I apologize for the long post in advance: 

[B]Option 1: [/B]
I was just presented with an opportunity to intern with a company called 'Southwestern Advantage.' They sell educational supplies including textbook study aids and software. Essentially, my job would be to sell these products to families with children who are attending grade school to high school. The average college student intern makes above 8,000$ within these three months. I would be living with a host family, my manager, and 3 other student interns. 
     I've looked at the products, and they are definitely helpful to students. In addition, this company has been operating and taking in interns for over 100 years. They are successful, and this is not a scam. The catch is that it takes a lot of work to sell the supplies; I must visit 30 families 6 days a week. 
[U]Advantages: [/U]
- character building (leadership, communication, able to take rejection, exposure to working in new locations, improving work ethic and commitment) 
- college credit
- experience
- money
- possibly once in a lifetime opportunity 
In addition, I see this as a chance to build experience and character; 
[U]Disadvantages: [/U]
- working about 80 hours a week
- stress, time commitment
- accepting rejection
- pay based on my effort 


[B]Option 2: [/B]
At the same time, I realize that this may be my last ""free"" summer before I enter pharmacy school. My only reason to not follow through with the program is because I want to finally relax and feel the satisfaction of getting into pharmacy school. I know that it will not have a lot of free time once I am attending. 

My alternative plans for summer would be to work part-time, visit family in Puerto Rico, volunteer in Guatamala for 2 weeks, and to really do new things that I've never really had time to do as an undergrad.

So again, my two options are: 
1) Enjoy my last 'free' summer by traveling, working part-time, and relaxing
OR 
2) work my butt off through the entire summer with this internship that can most likely pay me above 8 grand? 

Do any of you have advice on what I should do? Is this really my last relaxing summer before pharmacy school? Would this program heighten my experience and personal character? If you have any other questions about the program or what I’d be doing over the summer in detail, I'd be glad to answer them

Any advice is much appreciated; Thank you all :)

I'm currently a student on the pre-pharmacy track, and am applying this cycle to pharmacy school. I started asking professors, pharmacists, and past mentors for recommendation letters about 1-2 months ago. One of the people I asked was my manager at my part-time job that was my first big exposure to retail pharmacy, but the response was quite disappointing. Instead of treating it as a personal recommendation, the manager first stated that corporate may have an issue with it and basically pushed it off for 3-4 weeks. Granted, I could have been more aggressive, but that point I took the behavior as a negative sign and looked for other references.

Some background on the job: It was only in my third year at university that I seriously decided to pursue pharmacy and looked for more opportunities for a place to learn. I volunteered and applied to a bunch of pharmacies in the area, and picked this position even though it had more time commitment required than my other options (~25 hours per week, opposed to just 5-8). I believed that I would pick things up faster if I worked more, and really put my heart into doing my best. I made my fair share of errors though, mostly because I had trouble the first few weeks since there was no guidance and the store was quite busy (making it hard to ask for and receive guidance :/). I've definitely had my slip-ups, but it's frequently commented on (by that same manager) that I'm hardworking, helpful, friendly, calm, bright, and willing to learn.

I thoroughly enjoy this job, and the people I work with. I love that I'm learning something new each day, and I am getting more and more comfortable with the environment that I'm working in. I also think that the company would be great to work for in the future, but I am still a bit bothered by the manager's behavior. I know that it's up to a supervisor's discretion (or anyone's discretion, really) whether or not they want to write the recommendation, but the way they went about it seems a bit off in my books. Why did I not receive a straight, honest answer if it was obvious and stated explicitly (many times) that this was a time-sensitive case? Even after it was ok'd by the higher ups, more conditions were put on the quality of my work and there have been so many mixed signals regarding a simple letter of recommendation even up to this day. (Personally, I am not adding them as a reference simply because I don't want my application to have any weaknesses that I can consciously avoid). I have only been working for half a year, but I'm not sure if I should stay in an environment where my superiors can't vouch for my performance and are so hesitant in doing so. I feel that I'm not that incompetent— like I said before, I've made my fair share of mistakes but I've also done my best to maintain quality in my work.

Should I be looking for a new job with less hours and possibly a manager who is more confident in my skills? I'm not sure how things will work out in the future, and if I will be working in a pharmacy as a pharmacy student. I don't want to burn any bridges, and I don't want to seem like I'm only working for a good word. I am in the job mainly for more experience/exposure to retail, but at the end of the day, I do wonder why should I put so much time and effort into the job when I can't even get a recommendation out of it. Is this a huge red flag? Should I just ride it out for the rest of this academic year and look into a new location later on down the road? Or is it time to look for new opportunities?
