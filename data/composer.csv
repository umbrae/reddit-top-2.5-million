Hi everyone.

Our first trimonthly competition has started today, and the rules are as follows:

* **Open class** — No theme. Any number of traditional western classical instruments; no electroacoustic instruments. 

* **No longer than eight (8) minutes of length.**

* **Only one piece can be submitted to the contest** (no variations or movements). This piece has to have **[September13]** in its title. 

* **A score must be provided.** Voters will be encouraged to scrutinize the quality of the score for real world usage.

* **Your work can not have won any of the previous contests hosted in r/composer.**

* **The score and/or the mock-up must be perfectly available for anyone to view and listen to without sign-up, fees etc.**

* **This contest starts July 1. and ends September 30. 2013.** Votes will then be collected for a week, and the winner announced shortly thereafter.

* **After posting the link to your submission must be messaged directly to /u/OktoberStorm.** 

*A new contest starting October 1. through December 31. will commence immediately after the current one.*

The rules might be altered in the next few days.


------------

**How to vote**

Votes are open from October 1. through 7. There will be a post later about how to vote (regulars already know, but hold your horses until time). 

------------

**Prizes**

I'm in the works of recruiting sponsors that may offer a reward to the three top voted contestants. There will be a post about this later. All suggestions are very welcome.

------------

**Feedback**

Do not hesitate to leave your ideas and suggestions in this post, or message the mods directly.

------------

**NB**

The reason a contest have a start (and not just an ending) is that we normally would offer a theme, instrumentation and so on that would be disclosed only at the beginning of each competition period.

* The work must fall into one or more of the following categories:

Art music; contemporary; serious music; opera; (western) “classical music”. 
Performance art (e.g. using your penis/boob as a marimba mallet) is outside the scope of this competition.

* The work must be for one or more of the following instruments:

The western orchestra and solo instruments; SATB voices with contras; Well known “ethnic” instruments; Electro-acoustic instruments.

* Only one work can be submitted, but the work can be of several movements.

* ~~There's no time limit in January.~~ Some challenges may have time limits, but usually not.

* Some challenges have particularities, like modality, specific instruments and so on. 



This is how you post:

**(This month) challenge [Work title, quartet/orchestral/solo/etc.,]** 
You must include the text ""(This month) challenge"" so that by a search we can be a 100% certain we see all submissions. The rest is kind of up to you, but be informative. 

Very important: **You MUST include a score!**

**Voting is done by sending a message to [OktoberStorm](http://www.reddit.com/user/OktoberStorm) at any time until the end of the given month**

Three winners will be given a month of Reddit Gold. I've never tried it, but my fellow mod and winner of last competition W357Y says it's pretty sweet. Results will be posted in r/classicalmusic!

**The competition on the last day of the month, 00:00 CET. Three winners will receive reddit gold.**

Your participation will be essential to how further competitions will be held. We're hoping for a landslide! 



*October: No theme*

*Movember: A clear melody played by one single instrument from the brass.*

*December: Christmas theme. More rules will be disclosed 1st of December.*

*January: A piece for any number of classical guitars.*

*No competition in February*

As r/composer continues to grow I would like to write up an update, what we’re doing (and what we’re not doing) and perhaps most interesting; what is happening with the contests.

**The purpose, and** so the modding, of this sub has been the same from day one: a reddit dedicated to showcasing your contemporary music without clutter, memes or content where related reddits are much better suited. It seems people are pleased with this level of niche, so the rules have been unchanged since our inception, save for some rephrasing.

**We’ve passed a thousand** original works posted, about one post for every three subscribers. Unfortunately there’s been so much great music that have been removed. This is because we are not competing with r/ThisIsOurMusic, and even more importantly: if we relaxed the rules we would be outweighed by rock and pop, and art music music would be hard to find. This is the reason some posts (e.g. singer-songwriter/guitar and voice) are removed though they comply with the rules.

**If a self-post is** made with a relevant question about music then I usually let it stay until it is properly answered or until a day has passed before I take it down.

**Now, for the contests:**
We’ve had a few successful composition competitions, but the frequency has been too high. Or you could say that people haven’t had enough time to prepare a piece of work. We’re adjusting to four competitions each year ending on the last day of March; June; September and December. Rules for each competition will be posted on the first day of the succeeding month of the aforementioned. 

**Prizes! I’ve been** told that reddit Gold is pretty sweet, but it may not be a big enough prize for an outstanding piece of work that has been worked on for hours and days. I’m reaching out to a few reddits for sponsorship, and while I can’t promise anything I’ve gotten some good feedback on the idea. More information will follow.

**As always we appreciate your feedback.** And we appreciate any ideas or improvements, particularly for CSS/layout and features. Consider leaving a comment and tell us what you think.

Thanks for reading.

The ""Movember"" Challenge will follow the same rules as last month described here: http://www.reddit.com/r/composer/comments/102tyb/the_challenge_our_monthly_composer_competition_is/

The theme for this month is ""Men's health"". Your work must have a clear, distinct melody, and the main theme must be played by a brass instrument. (Get it? Brass balls. Movember is about testicular cancer, so honor your comrades in your piece.) 
I will apologize to my female counterpart for not making October about women's health, but it was the very first competition this year so it had to be open. 

Next month's theme will, of course, be ""Christmas"". But before you pull out your sleigh bells: There will be certain rules (so and so many instruments, lead instrument, this and that modality etc), and these will be posted here in a month.

I know, four links is a lot to click on for one post on reddit. If you like what you hear though, this tune is part of an album that I released a few weeks ago. It's pay-what-you-wish on the bandcamp site. Here's a link for the album.

I've just finished writing a cycle of twenty four preludes for piano in every key. This work has been quite a labor for the past 7 months of my life, and I'm absolutely overjoyed to finally be able to share it with you all. I hope you all enjoy it and I look forward to hearing your thoughts, questions, feedback, suggestions, etc. etc.

As I assume the majority of you will not want to take the time to listen to the entire 55 minute work, I've ordered the preludes into a list of my own personal recommendations, separated into fast and slow preludes for your convenience. My aim was to write the cycle in such a way that made it acceptable to be listened to as both a set of self standing pieces and also as a complete cohesive work, so if you enjoy listening to them separately, I strongly recommend you go back and take the time to listen to them as a set, from start to finish.

You can view the score [here](http://www.scribd.com/doc/62185021/Storm-Piano). Sorry about the spots where the dynamics aren't aligned correctly, I think that's Scribd's fault.

I'll have a recording soon. I'm going to record myself playing it when I get home from vacation.

My original plan was to upload the entire ""Excursions for Band"" suite once it was finished, but I scrapped that project, so here is the only completed movement.

I titled it Harmoniemusik to pay homage to the woodwind ensemble arrangements that were often done to popular Classical symphonic works to be played in a chamber setting in the 18th century.

Instrumentation is:
-2 Flutes
-2 Oboes
-2 Clarinets
-1 Horn in F
-1 Bassoon
-1 Bass Clarinet
-1 Contrabass 

Enjoy! If you're interested in performing this piece, I can send parts, just shoot me a DM

Our three winning pieces are Jazz Prelude No. 1 by **Roanourke** (13 votes | 20%), Prologue by **W357Y** (11 votes | 17%), and ""Number Theory"" by **bdubbiez** (11 votes | 17%).

Congratulations to our winners! You will receive your reddit gold soon (ish).
 
 
I'd like to say thanks to all of our contestants. Your pieces have shown that all of you are talented composers and have bright futures as musicians. In total, we received 6 pieces for piano, one piece for cello, one piece for electric cello (w/ looping), and one piece for clarinet (w/ looping). That's pretty cool. I mean, two pieces with looping!? I think that's pretty awesome.
 
 
Anyways, congratulations to our three winners and thanks to everyone who entered. Hope to see you all (and hopefully more!) next contest!

This piece was my first attempt at exploring indeterminte and aleatoric procedures in my music. The piece is in 5 movements with each one containing 9 to 11 phrases that the player is to combine in any way they wish live. The length of the phrases decreases as time progresses starting with 5 measures of 4/4 in the first movement and ending with one measure of 9/8 by the last. Each movement is a set of pitches that if played in a row on the piano make up a complex chord progression.

If you visit my soundcloud, have a look at some of my other pieces too! They represent only the pieces that I have had recorded, the earliest being the Etude and the latest being ""Number Theory"". If anyone would like a score for this piece or any others just pm me and I will be more than happy to give you one.(this is also because I dont know where I can put scores up on the internet)

Finally, if you would like to perform ""Number Theory"" or anything else of mine please, please, please let me know!!! Id love to have anybody perform anything!

Here's an cue I finished a little while ago that I'd been tinkering with for some time. It's not part of an actual soundtrack, but I've composed it as though it were a middle-of-the-order incidental cue that comes in well after the main themes have been established. I'll be the first to say that there are a few parts where I was very specifically going after a feel similar to ""The Asteroid Field"" from the Empire Strikes Back.

[Audio](http://soundcloud.com/alexander-temple/the-escape)

[Score](http://www.alexandertemple.com/uploads/at_the_escape_full_score.pdf)

Since this was composed for a virtual orchestra, I'm not concerned by the excessive orchestral resources used on a short piece, and I also haven't notated the harp pedal changes or the timpani tuning changes.

This is for one of my composition assignments for the coming semester. The piece had to be a 2 minute piano miniature which uses an unusual scale and uses metric modulation.

Lust was my favourite piece.,9,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/composer/comments/1c37ii/i_worked_on_a_media_composition_project_based/,"As part of a 20 minute composition portfolio for uni, I re-scored seven scenes based around the most common understandings of the seven deadly sins; lust, wrath, envy, sloth, pride, greed and gluttony. Each scene and the composed music reflect my interpretations of the sin.

Lust turned out to be my favourite piece of the lot. The scene is from Shame (2011). I didn't want to approach it like it was a 70's porno with wah-guitar and a load of brass. Instead I used mainly piano, viola, violin and cello. It starts off with staccato violin resembling the rhythm of the train before a flirtatious piano melody comes in. Strings come in and out before gradually building up - everything is built up to lead to a sort of hypnotic state, being caught in the moment I guess, that resembles a deep passion that two strangers are feeling. 

I think I was most happy with the kind of innocence it has. I felt that even though you eventually find out that the two characters acting on their lust would be wrong, the music still makes you feel for the guy; well that was the intention anyway. 

Anyhoo, I just wanted to share it, get some feedback and see how other people interpret the music/scene combination.

a) the score of which can be found [here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3847969/Jook%20Eul%20Leh.pdf)

b) and a .wav file can be found [here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3847969/Jook%20eul%20leh%20score.wav)

I think it's pretty rock and roll.

But what I mostly want to talk about, especially to you younger composers who want to get real musicians performing their music, *having a clean, easy to read score is so very very important!* Even little errors in your scores and parts can take up precious rehearsal time, which you may or may not know can sometimes be in extraordinarily short supply, and every second counts toward getting a good performance. It's important to write down exactly what you want to hear in the most straightforward and neat way to make performers like reading your music... you'll be much more pleased with your performances that way, and having clean, easy to read scores is the most crucial step.

...on that note, I'd like to tell you all about another redditor whose username is serendipetey... he edited this score for me! I can tell you that he really put a lot of work into it, and it didn't look half as good before he got through with it. My harmony as you can probably tell is, pardon my French, *friggin' wacky*, so having him work over your scores will make performers very happy (and you ALWAYS want to make them happy!) If you think you could use his services, drop him a line, he even gave me a great deal. I know this is a bit of a shameless plug, but seriously, clean scores are great and a good editor is worth the cost.

We often like to take the time to experiment, sight-read new pieces, try ensembles, and other off-beat things. If there are composers that are interested in hearing the 
[Stone Soup Symphony](http://www.StoneSoupSymphony.org) play their compositions, we'd be open to it.

Our instrumentation is as follows: 
    Violin 1, 2 
    Viola 
    Cello 
    Bass 
    Flute 1,2, Piccolo 
    Oboe 1,2 
    Clarinet 1,2 
    Bassoon 
    FHorn 1,2,3 
    Trumpet 1,2,3 
    Trombone 1,2,3
    Timpani / Percussion

If someone has written a piece that's a good fit, we'd consider trying it out. Keep in mind that we are a non-audition community group.  While we do have some excellent professional musicians among us, we also have a lot of students and hobbyists.  Don't expect the philharmonic.

I'd be open to playing original pieces if they are a good fit for us.  I'd be happy to send you a recording of your work in exchange for permission to play it publicly.  Our next concert is in September.

I'm sort of at a composer's block with this piece. I'm having trouble segueing into my 2nd episode from the middle entry. I was looking at the Bach inventions and trying to gain inspiration from them. When he was going into his second episode, he seemed to just modify the theme or the countertheme. I've tried augmentation, diminution, inversion, retrogression, but nothing seems to work. Does anyone have any specific tips on how I should continue? Where from my piece I can take from?

To those of you who may not know what all that jargon was, an episode is a set of sequences and a middle entry is the canonic imitation in a different key.

I used to compose things of this sort quite often, but only recently have I started getting back into it. I posted this in /Musictheory and was directed here.

The first one is Piano/12-string guitar alternating between C# Chinese (Major Pentatonic) and C# Major. It is written in 5/4 with a lot of 'float'.

https://soundcloud.com/cernnunos5/whispers-in-a-dream-2-0

Second one is Shamisen/12 String Guitar/Drums/Koto/Viola. Short and punchy. I'm aware the volume levels are a bit odd. C# Japanese and C# Byzantine.

https://soundcloud.com/cernnunos5/the-undines-march

EDIT: There is also a third composition which another user brought up. I did not include it in the original post but it seems to be interesting to most people. Guitar/12-String Guitar/Viola/Bodhran

https://soundcloud.com/cernnunos5/willows-storm-1

Breakdown of the Scales Used (Other than Major):

Chinese: Whole Step, Whole Step, 1 1/2 Steps, Whole step. Or C#, D#, F, G#, A#. Or Tonic, Major 2nd, -4th, 5th, Major 6th. Just a Major Pentatonic.

Japanese: Half Step, 2 Steps, Whole Step, Half Step. Or C#, D, F#, G#, A. Or Tonic, Minor 2nd, 4th, 5th, Minor 6th.

Byzantine: Half Step, 1 1/2 Steps, Half Step, Whole Step, Half step, 1 1/2 steps. Or C#, D, F, F#, G#, A, C. Tonic, Minor Second, -4th, 4th, 5th, Minor 6th, Major 7th. There is a little jingle example of this scale in my soundcloud.

This recording is a really rough version and I still have stuff to add but i want to perfect what i already have first. 

https://soundcloud.com/plagarate/zoom0015

t's not just piano, i am working on a violin part too. To clarify, 1:00 to 1:30 and 4:20 to 5:40 is all repetition because i have special violin bits to put in there. i know i make a mistake at like 4:10 but this is a rough recording so ... ignore it :p. 
If the start is too slow and you feel bored, skip to 1:30 because it changes a LOT. and tell me if the start is too boring because i sort of feel it is :p

- I'd really like some feedback on the piece in general - what genre would you put it in? Should I replace chords with broken ones, or put in more dischords and maybe make it into a romantic piece? Where is there too much repetition?

- I'm having difficulty composing the violin part. I've been playing violin since i was 9 but i've been playing piano since i was 4 and piano comes more naturally to me, so while i have a few ideas for the violin part, i have trouble creating a violin part that isn't monotonous. I would appreciate suggestions (like for example an ascending scale turning into a broken chord to fill the slowness of the waltz at the start). Or if you could direct me to some advised violin composers/pieces to listen to and draw on. (just to headstart my creativity).


I do have a very unfinished score which has bits of my violin part in it too. If you want to see that i will add a link. 
EDIT: Link to score: 

http://www.noteflight.com/scores/view/027583a1f01ce73787254332a31af5311596d089

The score is sort of out of date, but only in terms of the C section which i decided to totally scrap as i devised something different which is shown in the recording. I have yet to edit that into the score.

The idea is stated, and bearing in mind I'm always thinking of orchestral voices even though it's for piano, a lone voice talks. Then one must imagine after the cadence that the orchestra picks up and develops the mood and tone for the second statement of the voice, now with the orchestra.

I've done some fugues before, and, to give myself a challenge, decided to make one that modulates between E minor and C minor (one of my favourite progressions, used extensively in the magnificent Daggerfall soundtrack).

Thing is: my subject sucks balls. I don't even have a clear idea of what the second half is, and even then, it just repeats itself; terrible for a fugue subject. Anyway, I think what I've done so far is pretty good, but I've been stuck there for a few days, and everything I've tried sounds dull and out-of-place. So, here you go.

EDIT: Sorry for the bad quality, timbre wasn't exactly what I was worrying about. I'm sure Bach didn't either when writing his WTC and AoF (flawless rationalization (rationalization of rationalization(ad absurdum ad infinitum))).

While we're at it, here's another unfinished song I'll probably never finish or do an arrangement for big band instead.

I just grabbed this out of Finale's studio view, so sorry for the ambiguity, but these are the staves for a solo piano. Because the right-hand rhythm is so syncopated, I'm not sure whether it should be notated as it is now (quarter - eighth - quarter - eighth - etc) or if I should be replacing the quarter notes with tied eighths to show the downbeats. On one hand, it shows the downbeats clearly, but on the other it gets very messy. Any ideas?

A dark and dramatic take on an established form.

As I don't have very many theory-oriented musician friends, I would like to ask this community for its objective opinion, as well as a question regarding my harmonic techniques; Am I wrong in marketing myself to potential clients (Film/TV/Game producers, etc) as a neo-romanticist? I'm not quite familiar with the conventions of the period, other than it is generally regarded as being more harmonically colorful than previous eras. For myself, this means fun and frequent modulations, however slight, as well as a substitution here or there. I have not thoroughly studied past classical-era tonic/dominant relationships, and as a result, I fear for my harmonic vocabulary being stale. Lastly, any recommendations for texts on the analysis of various forms and conventions throughout history (a la The Shaping of Musical Elements Vol II) would be greatly appreciated.

I'm new to this, and I thought 'why don't I share something I recently composed'? So here it is, the audio of my first violin sonatina in G Dur! I excuse myself for the poor quality, as it's Sibelius 7 playing it.
I composed it for a friend of my girlfriend's younger sister, who happens to be playing the violin. A friend of hers also plays the piano, but they haven't had the time to practice it together.

I think it would be written in a classical style, the piece follows a sonata form and covers many galant progressions.

Composed this for the new Man of Steel movie. I tried to channel a bit of Zimmer by composing what I felt I saw through the trailer. The beginning of the theme you have a militaristic feel introducing Superman's boldness and heroism. The flute theme right after represents Clark as a young boy and his innocence. The main theme then presents itself in solemn fashion to represent his internal struggles to find his true destiny. As the theme picks up momentum, we see Clark Kent transcend into his inevitable form, Superman.

I am using EastWest Composers collection as well as Hollywood Strings to achieve these sounds.  Great VST's if anyone is interested!

Anyway, enjoy the full track here: https://soundcloud.com/renan-javier/man-of-steel-theme

Here is a trailer edit to go with the trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6uFOHIMg9c

All the best!

I've been working on this quintet about a year, abandoning it a few times for other things but always ending up coming back to it. I've posted two of the movements here before, but I figure I might as well upload them as well. It's written in a Late Classical - Early Romantic Style, and I thought I would share it now that it's finally finished. Below are links to audio (from Garritan in Finale 2012) and PDFs of the scores. Enjoy!

In the words of our instructor, ""It has to look like you put effort into it"".

For my final piece I wrote a choral piece that moves through the various periods of western music, from middle ages single voice chant to organum duplum to Renaissance polyphony, to a chorale, to a composition in ""reduced"", shall we say, sonata allegro form for classical, then a section in the best I could do with the romantic period (this was, in my opinion, the weakest section). Then I have a bit of impressionist style gliding chords and such and take a dissonant stop in the early 20th century with Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique before wrapping it up with a contemporary style section.

I'd love to hear what you guys think. I think it's a nice piece, but I'd love to hear an outside opinion. Sorry for the awful quality, by the way, this was meant to be sung a capella, but I didn't finish in time for our school's choir to learn it, so I made do with Finale's midi playback.

I'd like to get some feedback on choice of accidentals. I realize they don't appear as they might in the sounded chords spelling, however I figured trying to maintain the same enharmonic spelling of a note would be a benefit to the performer. Is that the right way to go about it? Which version goes about it in a better way? Or do both go about it poorly?

For some reason, the MIDI file doesn't play the last measure completely. Also, depending on your soundfont, I expect the MIDI file to sound terrible.

My name is William, and I'm a Year 10 student (equivalent, I believe, to Grade 9 in the US, and Year 9 in Australia) who has recently composed a small piano piece for my music class. Just before I elaborate on myself and this piece's origins, I should make it clear that I'm only up to Grade 6 in theory :/

Fond of Classical and Romantic music, and especially the piano (not that I'm of professional stature, mind. I merely appreciate its sound), this piece sounds out of place to my tastes. It's a work of experimentation, composed by ear and meddling, rather than genuine masterful vision. It's also my first 'complete' work on Sibelius (I've composed several small pieces in the past, but nothing as comprehensive as this).

The composition's rhythm inspired mostly by a piece from the video-game Bioshock; ""Cohen's Masterpiece"", or 'Andante con fuoco', as it's referred to on Garry Schyman's site (Link to this piece: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnn_UKKNv5c). The development of the piece from Movement 1, to 2 and then 3 however, comes from both Beethoven's Moonlight sonata (in part), and Chopin's Posthumous Op. 66 (The Fantasie Impromptu, whose 2:3 rhythm had some minor implementation during a few bars in the first movement).
I apologize for my lack of concision here (It's a well noted fault of mine!), but I just love to talk.


I'm requesting, in this post, for someone of more professional a stature to give some weighted judgement and feedback on the piece. Even feedback or opinions from those of you without the confidence to refer to yourself as such would be greatly appreciated.

**TL;DR:** I'm a 2nd year High School student. I wrote my first complete piece of music for the piano a week ago. Please listen and give feedback.

(Both files are very small)


**Also note:** I'm aware of the notation's currently messy nature. Dynamics aren't too apparent, timing is improvised through unnecessary or inaccurate metronome marks, the second movement needs some heavy rubato, and notes/lines all-too-often overlap. And yes, Sibelius seems to require (perhaps as a result of my inadequacy) two pedal lines, something I'm hardly retaining if I submit this for NCEA credit! Finally, I apologize for the page-width long bars :(",,False,self,t5_2sjib,True,,,True,t3_n0wzd,http://www.reddit.com/r/composer/comments/n0wzd/requesting_critique_on_my_first_full_piano/,

I have had an idea going in my head for a while now, and it's been driving me slowly insane. I've been obsessing over the concept of time and the circulatory nature of the year, dividing itself into seasons and months.

I have decided to write twelve motifs, each focusing on the essence of each month. The work will be a circle, neither having a beginning nor end. 

The concept is that you will be able to begin on whatever song in the project that you want and it will go slowly in a circle all the time. Twelve songs, each around 5-7 minutes of almost total improvisation. There will be no stops between songs, thus they will slowly go through the year and gradually change form and tone, giving you the four seasons. I know that the concept of seasons and circular structure isn't new, but it's an interesting topic to me. It will focus on the natural aspect of the seasons, and not the human aspect. 

The songs will then be grouped into Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter.

I will be posting pictures of the sheet music with the motifs and directions.

[Recording (MIDI)](http://soundcloud.com/accurg/symphony-1-mvt-idk-rough-draft)

MIDI issues:

-The MIDI poops out with the horn in the beginning, playing those 16ths.

-At C, the shaker in the third percussion part doesn't playback. Same with L.

-The tam-tam in the first percussion part never plays back (happens twice, once at K and then at the end).

-The MIDI doesn't really know how to play sul pont. in the strings at P.

But those things aside, sibelius was able to render some halfway decent audio. I wrote this movement over the summer, and I'll be taking it in for lessons at some point in the near future, once the semester begins. Hopefully you guys might be able to give me a bit of advice beforehand! I know we have lots of romantics here, so I guess I should issue a warning that this is more on the modern side. I hope you enjoy anyway, regardless of style!

I'm mostly a gigging musician/singer songwriter/aspiring Flamenco guitarist, but I took two years of Theory &amp; Composition at a community college and left school to study composition on my own.

This is the first ""feature film"" I've ever worked on, and it's one the most difficult (if not thee most difficult) thing I've ever done musically. The movie ""California Winter"" has been completed for almost a year now and may never be released, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

1. This is the very first, opening piece, which was not used in the final cut of the movie. They used something else I wrote (something completely different in genre), but I still like this one (Orchestral): https://soundcloud.com/healtone/cw-opening-1

2. This piece is from a scene in-which one of the characters is being evicted. This piece was also not used in the final cut of the film (Orchestral): https://soundcloud.com/healtone/eviction

3. This is the second to the last scene of the movie (This one is a more conventional instrumentation of mandolin, harp, and guitar. I played the mandolin and guitar, the harp is from the Xpand2 virtual instrument): https://soundcloud.com/healtone/cw-empowering-flowers

4. This is the ending of the movie (Mostly Orchestral): https://soundcloud.com/healtone/cw-last-scene

Bonus: Here's a short film I did the music to right after working on the above movie: http://vimeo.com/40595463

Thanks for listening if you listened. And, I hope you enjoyed it.

(Note: I used Pro-Tools and Xpand2 to record all of the above. I used the volume slider on my keyboard controller incessantly for all the string sections, except for #2, my neighbor played the lead violin in the second half of that piece. Also, I'm a novice cellist and I noticed that if I added just a single cello track to the ""fake"" orchestra it added enough variance of pitch and bowing to make it sound more like a real orchestra.)",,False,self,t5_2sjib,1362067372.0,,,True,t3_19dw9v,http://www.reddit.com/r/composer/comments/19dw9v/heres_some_music_i_composed_for_a_yet_unreleased/,

One with just the orchestra, another with the alto melody plucked on a guitar to fill it in (sounds crappy).

I'm interested in particular in knowing if I scored the timpani drumroll properly, and I definitely would love thoughts on how the final mix sounds. If it's balanced nicely, etc.

I'm a music student studying Classical composition. I've also been playing piano my whole life. Like any composer I'm trying to find my own style.

So far my style is represented best by the third phrase with the unusual rhythm. It's contemporary Romanticism. I love the Romantic Era the most.

The entire piece is 5/4 in d minor.

I completed this piece while attending an Oberlin Conservatory composition workshop last summer (I'll actually be starting my first year of college there in a month). Since then it has seen many revisions and brought me a fair amount of success in competitions and performances. The recording isn't perfect but I feel the ideas are expressed well enough to achieve the desired effect. The 7"" and 4"" pauses at the end of the piece aren't honored in the recording but are made present in performances.

Program notes:

“The piece begins with three statements of a four note set. After all three instruments have stated a set, an episode occurs, which strays more and more from consonance with each repetition. A polyrhythmic dance follows the opening section and precedes a fugato-esque section that changes rhythmic emphasis sinusoidally. The final section juxtaposes the first set and its inversion against the violin’s monophonic melody, ending with a mensuration of a set by the flute and clarinet.”",,False,self,t5_2sjib,False,,,True,t3_xcz0u,http://www.reddit.com/r/composer/comments/xcz0u/sisyphean_shade_for_flute_violin_and_clarinet/,

In the last 6 months I've started getting into music and recently started working on some counterpoint/harmony/introduction to composition. I am working towards becoming a mental health professional and would like to include composition as a tool for telling people's personal stories.

This is a piece I am working on for my Mom's wedding in October. I wanted to capture happy dance feeling of a waltz but also include a sad section that speaks to inevitable struggles and the need to work together to overcome them. I am happy with how this sounds as of right now but I was hoping to extend it to being at least 3 minutes. My problem is I don't know how to do that in a way that it will still be interesting harmonically, and as an added bonus it needs to be easy for an intermediate guitar player to play so modulating keys is something I would like to avoid.

Do you guys have any comments on how I can lengthen this and still have it be interesting?

Score: http://www.scribd.com/doc/62262219/Twisted-Time

Part of a series of video-game style compositions. The idea of this piece is that the listener is suppose to be constantly getting lost, not being able to keep up with the pulse or the harmonic movement, while still being able to enjoy the melodies and counterpoint. Also, it does not really have an end - it gets to the end and repeats infinitely, as is with much video game music. The last bar is only there for the purpose of performance - hopefully this will get performed at a concert in a bit over a month.

It felt appropriate to keep the harmonies as pleasant as possible, but I am unsure about the result: You'll recognize it, it's one of the most basic pop progressions. Do you think that this still works for what the piece tries to be, or does it just strike you as bland or trite? Any perspective is appreciated, I would also especially welcome feedback on notational issues and the left hand in general (sound too thin, unplayable, unidiomatic, whatever).
