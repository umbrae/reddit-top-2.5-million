About a month ago I asked for your advice. I wasn't earning any money despite working for 8-10 hours a day (and my financial situation was already pretty bad) and I was stuck with clients who didn't respect me. I was about to quit this and get a job as a cashier at a PC hardware store admitting failure and scratching my dream of becoming a designer.

... but I took your advice. I fired most of my clients and discussed my rates with the rest of them - some are paying me more than double what they paid before. I also started frequenting /r/forhire and made about $1k this month there making several people very happy with my services.

I'm feeling really confident in my skills now. I also feel I progressed ALOT during the last 30 days (certainly more than during the last 6 months!). I put more thought in what I do, more and more of my work is based on grids.

The result of it all? Well, I landed a GOD DAMN JOB AS A DESIGNER. The pay is awesome, the people are awesome, and I'm just sitting there in front of a retina mbp and high-end eizo monitor ~~masturbating~~ designing really cool stuff. Never in my life have I felt so awesome, happy and stress-free.

It's super weird to admit, but you guys changed my life. Thanks. I love you, random internet strangers.",,False,,t5_2qmtk,False,,,True,t3_13eaw4,http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/13eaw4/update_2_i_am_starting_to_doubt_if_i_can_make_it/,

I'm really excited to celebrate the publishing of my first eBook on Amazon's Kindle Store. Feel free to skip all the text if you just want the download link.

I wrote and published the eBook, ""The 101 Dos and Dont's of a Successful Graphic Designer"" about 7 months ago on Design Panoply. I sent it around to get feedback from a lot of top design bloggers, and apart from some pricing and grammatical suggestions, it was all positive :)

I sold it as a PDF for a while, but just finally got around to reformatting it for Kindle supported devices.

Of course I'm selling it, but I wrote it in hopes that it would help other designers save some time and avoid the mistakes that I made, so I'm giving it away for free for a month. (The link will be inactive after Feb. 15, 2013)
You can learn a little more about why I wrote it here: http://www.designpanoply.com/blog/the-101-dos-and-donts-of-a-successful-graphic-designer

Of course, if you find it helpful, I wouldn't be against anyone buying it to show their support as well :)

If you enjoy it, I would GREATLY and unendingly appreciate it if you left positive feedback on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Donts-Successful-Graphic-Designer-ebook/dp/B00AX0QD7G/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357501581&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=john+shaver

You can download it for free in ZIP format here (includes both PDF and MOBI formats): http://s3.amazonaws.com/DesignPanoply/ebook-101-dos-and-donts-of-a-successful-graphic-designer.zip

Feel free to AMA about the contents or the publishing process as well :)

**EDIT:** Thanks so much for all the feedback and encouragement. I'm glad the book is so unanimously liked!

And special thanks to everyone who either bought it or left positive feedback on Amazon, you have no idea how much I appreciate it. If you are still reading it, please consider leaving positive feedback once you finish. It helps a ton.

I saw this on Digg.com today and Craigslist has already taken it down, read it and take it to heart. 

The Post
------------------------
Every day, there are more and more Craigs List posts seeking artists for everything from auto graphics to comic books to corporate logo designs. More people are finding themselves in need of some form of illustrative service.

But what they're NOT doing, unfortunately, is realizing how rare someone with these particular talents can be.

To those who are seeking artists, let me ask you; How many people do you know, personally, with the talent and skill to perform the services you need? A dozen? Five? One? none?

More than likely, you don't know any. Otherwise, you wouldn't be posting on craigslist to find them.

And this is not really a surprise.

In this country, there are almost twice as many neurosurgeons as there are professional illustrators. There are eleven times as many certified mechanics. There are SEVENTY times as many people in the IT field.

So, given that they are less rare, and therefore less in demand, would it make sense to ask your mechanic to work on your car for free? Would you look him in the eye, with a straight face, and tell him that his compensation would be the ability to have his work shown to others as you drive down the street?

Would you offer a neurosurgeon the opportunity to add your name to his resume as payment for removing that pesky tumor? (Maybe you could offer him a few bucks for materials. What a deal!)

Would you be able to seriously even CONSIDER offering your web hosting service the chance to have people see their work, by viewing your website, as their payment for hosting you?

If you answered yes to ANY of the above, you're obviously insane. If you answered no, then kudos to you for living in the real world.

But then tell me why would you think it is okay to live out the same, delusional, ridiculous fantasy when seeking someone whose abilities are even less in supply than these folks?

Graphic artists, illustrators, painters, etc., are skilled tradesmen. As such, to consider them as, or deal with them as, anything less than professionals fully deserving of your respect is both insulting and a bad reflection on you as a sane, reasonable person. In short, it makes you look like a twit.

A few things you need to know;

1. It is not a great opportunity for an artist to have his work seen on your car/zine/website/bedroom wall, etc. It IS a great opportunity for YOU to have their work there.

2. It is not clever to seek a student or beginner in an attempt to get work for free. It's ignorant and insulting. They may be students, but that does not mean they don't deserve to be paid for their hard work. You were a student once, too. Would you have taken that job at McDonalds with no pay, because you were learning essential job skills for the real world? Yes, your proposition it JUST as stupid.

3. The chance to have their name on something that is going to be seen by other people, whether it's one or one million, is NOT a valid enticement. Neither is the right to add that work to their portfolio. They get to do those things ANYWAY, after being paid as they should. It's not compensation. It's their right, and it's a given.

4. Stop thinking that you're giving them some great chance to work. Once they skip over your silly ad, as they should, the next ad is usually for someone who lives in the real world, and as such, will pay them. There are far more jobs needing these skills than there are people who possess these skills.

5. Students DO need experience. But they do NOT need to get it by giving their work away. In fact, this does not even offer them the experience they need. Anyone who will not/can not pay them is obviously the type of person or business they should be ashamed to have on their resume anyway. Do you think professional contractors list the experience they got while nailing down a loose step at their grandmother's house when they were seventeen?

If you your company or gig was worth listing as desired experience, it would be able to pay for the services it received. The only experience they will get doing free work for you is a lesson learned in what kinds of scrubs they should not lower themselves to deal with.

6. (This one is FOR the artists out there, please pay attention.) Some will ask you to submit work for consideration. They may even be posing as some sort of contest. These are almost always scams. They will take the work submitted by many artists seeking to win the contest, or be chosen for the gig, and find what they like most. They will then usually have someone who works for them, or someone who works incredibly cheap because they have no originality or talent of their own, reproduce that same work, or even just make slight modifications to it, and claim it as their own. You will NOT be paid, you will NOT win the contest. The only people who win, here, are the underhanded folks who run these ads. This is speculative, or spec, work. It's risky at best, and a complete scam at worst. I urge you to avoid it, completely. For more information on this subject, please visit www.no-spec.com.

So to artists/designers/illustrators looking for work, do everyone a favor, ESPECIALLY yourselves, and avoid people who do not intend to pay you. Whether they are spec�gigs, or just some guy who wants a free mural on his living room walls. They need you. You do NOT need them.

And for those who are looking for someone to do work for free  please wake up and join the real world. The only thing you're accomplishing is to insult those with the skills you need.

More inside...",209,29,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/wtdaz/10000_fkin_subscribers_well_done_everybody_on/,"Upvote this (I get no karma) to keep it to the top if you don't mind. :) 

Dear /r/graphic_design

Congrats! 10K subscribers! Thanks to every last one of you for making this place awesome and growing it in size while ever improving the quality of submissions. There's always more that can be done however we'll get there slowly but surely.

There's a couple of things we need to look at going forward. 

Firstly: The rules in the sidebar and their enforcement, good or bad, for or against, we want your feedback on how you think the community has been run. 

~~Secondly: We're taking applications for another moderator (maybe more than one). If you'd like to be considered PRIVATE MESSAGE me or the moderators. If you post here, YOU WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.~~

~~1. We'd like to see the design you do or the design you like. 
2. Let us know if you have any moderation experience (anywhere online or reddit).
3. Let us know if you've any ideas that you think you could execute in the community.
4. Let us know what your international Time Zone is. edit: European and Asian applications have an advantage due to Time Zone requirements.~~

*edit: Thank you for your moderator applications, we have enough to look at now. Our decision is under consideration, we will make an announcement to all once a decision has been reached. Thanks so much everyone for their enthusiasm and interest. Apologies to those who missed the boat. If we keep growing as we have been recently, I'm sure there'll be room for more. :)*

That's it for now, of course if there's anything else you'd like to bring up, here and now is where to do it. I'm quite busy (hence the need for another moderator) but I'll get to all of your questions or opinions eventually.

Thanks again everyone and congratulations! :)

Let's discuss.,160,25,141,http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/1hvdex/should_unpaid_internships_end_lets_discuss/,"Last month an intern that worked on ""The Black Swan"" movie won his lawsuit for backpay. Saying the work he did for free was meaningful and worth monetary reward. This has sparked a nationwide discussion about the ethics of the unpaid internship.

As someone who is a year out of art school this topic couldn't be more relevant to me. I've experienced the unpaid internship system, and know the set backs and rewards. I've watched the potential of a job dangled in front of dozens of my freshly graduated friends, while they do free meaningful work, only to be out unemployed 3 months later.

I've had one unpaid internship in my career, and while I learned a lot I was quickly feeling like I was being used. A line was crossed when I started doing work that would in the future make business money. When I worked on client projects and kept track of my timesheet it just felt wrong. Some people might argue that the experience you get is too valuable to even put a price on. Which I agree in some ways. The connections I made as an intern I will most likely have for a lifetime. I feel like the unpaid internship may not be dead but it certainly needs boundaries.

In my mind there should be levels like this:

**Unpaid:** Little experience or ability that would help the establishment make money. This would be like a mentorship where the person is just coming to learn. Not much is expected of them, other than hard work.

**Minimum Wage:** Experienced but has never worked at a business doing design. Will touch client projects. Mostly learning from experience, with a lower level of guidance.

**Fair Wage:** Maybe not the maximum wage of a starting employee, but this is someone who is fresh out of collage and might be vying for a position at the company. Most likely has had an internship prior to this one.

I'm wanting to write a full article on this at some point and I'd love to hear what you guys think. Especially if you are someone who has to hire designers and interns at your firm.

Anyone interested?,142,17,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/18gg8f/an_upcoming_weekly_design_education_series_on/,"Hey all fellow designers. As the title states, I'm interested in creating a series of design videos on youtube.

As I see it now, there are a TON of speed art videos (some good, mostly meh) and a lot of art showcasings. What I noticed was the lack of good, fun, and easy to understand design education videos. This is where I'd like to make my entry.

I'm currently a sophomore enrolled in Visual Communication Design but have been designing in total for about 5 years now (damn I feel old saying that). Because of this I have a nice mix of self taught and disciplined design principles flowing through my work. Like most of you, I started out self taught, I developed my own style, and I did things MY way. Getting to college however proved to be a lot different than I imagined. Once I got into some higher level courses, I dealt with a ton of criticism, so much so that it felt like design bootcamp. For many of us this was a complete shock. When I was a freshman, my entire class consisted of about 200 people. Now, as a Sophomore, that's down to about 100.

My reasoning for creating these videos is to ease the transition between going from a completely self taught designer to becoming a formally educated designer. In my videos, I would do a range of tutorials ranging from drawing techniques, color theory, design principles (this would probably take about 5-10 vids to explain of it), tutorials with adobe programs like photoshop and illustrator, and I would definitely like to showcase other designer's work!

So my question to the graphic designers of reddit. Would you have any interest in this? As of now, I'm pretty devoted to coursework but there's no reason why I couldn't crank out 1 to 2 videos a week. Let me know what you all think! I appreciate it.

**EDIT:** From all the feedback, I'm definitely going to launch this series. If this got downvoted into oblivion, well that would have been the end of it. But as long as there are people that would benefit from this, I'm willing to help. Thanks for the response everyone!

**EDIT #2:** Link to youtube channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/ptrklwdn (no videos posted yet but feel free to sub).

**EDIT #3:** I can't believe the amount of overwhelming support for this! Went from 48 to 134 subscribers in a night. Thank you so much to everyone who has gotten behind this. I'm going to get to work immediately!

Hi all,

Due to some voting trends we've noticed regarding the submission of designers' own work getting through the cracks, we've decided to institute a one month trial change of the rules.

**For one month users will be able to submit their own completed, professional work for inspiration or educational purposes from today the 16th of October until 16th of November.** This means we are *still against* the posting of critique requests , spec work (contest entries) or conceptual work (portfolio padding that will never see commercial / real world use). 

What **we *are* allowing is the submission of completed, successful, professional work you've done, in the form of a self post** where you either explain the process of the project for academic benefit, or the conceptual goal and thinking behind the ideas for inspirational reasons. Perhaps some of you would like to make AMAs about the project. 

All posts of this nature should be tagged [OC]  or [AMA] with the title or the client and the media if applicable.

**Example**

**[OC] Reddit Logo Design, Branding**

**[AMA] Reddit Brochure Design, 18.4 x 14in Booklet**

We do not desire any damage to the traffic at /r/design_critiques, so critique requests will still be removed. You are much, much better off posting over there for critiques. This is also a measure to keep any negativity that may occur as a byproduct of critiques to a minimum and we'd like to see it stay away in the threads about professional work too.

This is a month trial which, depending how it goes, will determine if we keep this option available in the sub.

So, professional visual communicators of reddit, get submitting!

________________________________________________

**We will be starting a weekly questions thread aimed at novice designers that will begin on Monday 22nd October.** The thread will be called [Ask the experts] and we'd hope that all you design experts will show up to help out! This thread will hopefully prove to be the ideal place to answer all you novice designers' questions about the world and profession (vocation?) of design. There will be suggested topics each week to help the thread along but we encourage all questions to be directed there. It will be submitted by a moderator so it receives some highlighting. It'd be nice if it kept going all week, every week but you guys see how you like it and we'll take it from there. All are welcome!

That's it for now, we just broke 16k users, gonna be a bit of a celebration at 20k. Thanks for staying one of the loveliest design communities on reddit and dont be afraid to contact us at any time either here or by message if you have ideas, suggestions or queries.

However, race ownders decided to go with this as a logo instead:

So, what should I include in my email back to them?

**Edit:** So, I couldn't stop thinking about this logo. I decided to start from scratch. I ended up with this:

So, we'll see if they go for that instead.

Also, thanks for all the responses. A lot of you guys made me laugh, but most of you made me cry/scream. :P

However, when I go to cancel my subscription, I'm informed that I have to now pay 50% of my remaining year's payment to them, just to cancel. To me, this is unbelievable. I had done extensive research on this product before signing on, and nowhere was it mentioned that I would be trapped into this deal. I intend on completely abandoning adobe as a company and service. I don't have the money to comfortably pay this right now, so as a result I must continue slowly paying them the monthly. I feel tricked, baited, and switched.

Give me your thoughts. Am I crazy? Did you know about this? ",,False,,t5_2qmtk,False,,,True,t3_1kgbp7,http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/1kgbp7/outraged_with_adobe/,

I'm sure I'm far from the only one out here who is frustrated seeing promising job listings for talented designers, only to see requirements for the listing to name ""expert in PHP, HTML5 and half a dozen others"" as a requirement.

How do you all feel about the rapid speed in which two disciplines and schools of thought which (I for one believe) up to the last few years were mutually exclusive? How much longer will it be before talented designers who want to focus on illustration, company branding or advertising design absolutely must know how to program and code websites, apps and other media in order to survive?

And I'd love to hear from those of you who have no problems with the merging of design and programming, and your experiences working in the field, as well.

If you don't have a passion for design in your heart you should NOT become a designer. ""I like to doodle"" and ""I have used photoshop"" are NOT good reasons to become a designer. I graduated with a bunch of people like this, people who chose design because they thought it was going to be an easy major and they fancied themselves ""artistic, creative free spirits"". The majority of those people are now servers, retail employees, and realtors.

Design is NOT easy, and it is by and large NOT an artistic pursuit. (Unless you consider a page from a picture-less novel ""art"") 

You will be getting paid to deliver brand messages and hawk product. You will be producing banner ads that no one will ever see/click. You are not painting Guernica or even drawing Garfield. 

You will be busting your ass to sell your ideas to dimwit clients who typically don't know shit about design and don't place ANY value on you or your skillset. 

You will be working with and taking direction people who get to positions of power by brown-nosing, being tall, and having a nice haircut.

You will be focusing primarily on typography and content organization, and typically only dabbling in what you might call art — color, image, illustration, icons, etc. (about 90%/10%)

Unless you truly enjoy all the anal, tedious minutiae that comes along with ""designing"" - (and by that i mean typography, kerning, leading, grids and guides, stock image/footage searching, color correcting, clipping paths, endless revisions — NOT crosshatching a portrait of your cat wearing a beret), you are guaranteed going to hate your existence and be one of many simply adding noise to a landscape already overflowing with bad-to-mediocre design.

Yes I realize I am an asshole and that this post is rife with potentially-unfair generalizations... if you disagree, please share why!

**Update:** I was always a lefty, artsy kid who enjoyed all creative pursuits — drawing, crafts, acting, music, etc. They were all hobbies and I never took any of them seriously and was never the best artist in class. I sucked at sports and had a passing interest in most other studies — enough to get decent grades but I never really considered a career in math, science, or ""business"". I always knew I wanted to be an ""artist"" of some kind, but didn't even have a concept of ""graphic design"" until I was in high school. I image most designers or people who consider getting into design fit this bill.

But I also clearly remember being impressed with certain logos as a kid and considering how the creators managed to create such recognizable images with such few shapes. being blown away by album artwork and t-shirt designs and silkscreen rock posters and wishing so badly that one day I could make something as awesome as the stuff I found cool.

I went to college for photography at 18 (but took the general art curriculum, including intro to GD) and dropped out after a semester. Then to a trade school for audio engineering — did that ""professionally"" for a few years. Went back to school for Graphic Design at 23. I became a paid design intern at 25 and am now an ACD at 31.

Lots of creative people are drawn to the idea of design because it's one of the few ways to actually make a living doing something ""creative"" — where less than 3% of painters, sculptors, actors, musicians, etc will ever make enough money to support themselves, there's a lot of money being thrown around in design and advertising — enough to feed many a family. That said, I know a lot of folks (some who are ex-designers) who make a respectable salary via other less traditional creative pursuits — baking, crafts, jewelry, custom murals. The world needs these creative people too!

The title of this rant is perhaps a bit much. As a few of you have said, people (creative or otherwise) should dabble in lots of different things before committing themselves to one specific career path (especially with the cost of quality education/software/hardware/etc). Exploring on your own (via the internet, self-initiated projects, libraries) over time is the only way to see if something really interests you enough to make a career of it.

The included bleed area has been rendered useless, since the designer left the registration marks and color bars in the bleed itself.  If you're going to do that, put them outside of the bleed.

To be honest, as a guy who works at a publisher, we don't need all of that extra stuff.  We're just going to fit it into a layout, PDF and send it to the printer with our own marks anyway.  When the ad comes from a client who can't get the file fixed by their creative agency in time, I'm usually stuck with having to clone everything out.  If it can be fixed by the client, it means extra work on their end and getting closer to the deadline.

So, the next time you have to send a full page ad with bleed: Don't forget to double check!  :)

1375038490.0,87,self.graphic_design,1j88xh,[Unpopular Opinion] Everybody thinks they're a brand designer.,122,35,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/1j88xh/unpopular_opinion_everybody_thinks_theyre_a_brand/,"I can't be alone in this, but I'm prepared to see a big backlash anyway. Regardless, I feel like this needs to be said.

&amp;nbsp;

**Everybody thinks they're a brand designer.**

Okay, not *everybody*, but I see it often in portfolios posted around the design subreddits like this one and /r/design_critiques where designers add brand design to their services. Sometimes it's warranted, like when that individual is *a brand designer*. But often it's a web designer or graphic designer pinning brand design on their vest because they don't mind making a logo or some stationery or whatever, in addition to doing up websites or illustrations or whatever your real niche is.

&amp;nbsp;

**Please stop that.**

I get it, I really do. You want to diversify your services to drum up more business, charge more hours, and be one of those full monty design guys to attract clients who need it all... But stop saying you ""do brand design."" You can make logos, or pick out colors, even put those logos and colors on a business card template for your client, okay, but *that is not brand design*.

A brand is so much more than the logo, and requires research and thought beyond visual design. I see a lot of these ""brand"" designers selling their logo services, but never talking about the positioning research behind it. Calling a logo ""brand design"" is a mistake at best, **disingenuous** at worst. Hell, I'd even caution folks not to be a logo designer unless branding is what they're really going for. A logo is just a pretty flair at the top right of that website without a brand to support it, or be built around it, or for it to represent. 

It also leaves clients either misinformed or with unclear expectations. *Especially* if they know what a brand really is. None of us want more misinformed and mislead clients in our future. Be honest for yourself, if not for the rest of us. Honesty about what we're actually skilled at is what we sorely need in this industry, especially at a beginner level.

If you find yourself at this point thinking to yourself ""*oh yeah buddy? Well what's brand design then?*"" then that resentment you feel should be a cue to double check that you're actually pretty sure you know what brand design is and could define it to a client thoroughly. If you can't articulate the lengthy research and labor that goes into brand design long before anyone says the word ""logo,"" you might need to reconsider what your services should be called.

&amp;nbsp;

**Note:**

The response to this, if you're realizing you might be making this mistake in your profile, is NOT to start adding ""market research"" and ""positioning analysis"" to your services if *you do not know what these things are or how to do them appropriately.* Don't steal business from professional brand designers if you don't know how to design brands. If you love the idea, learn it first!

Besides, you know what they say. The riches are in the niches. I'd be willing to bet you'll make a lot more money stripping out the portfolio fluff and just being the best at whatever you're best at. If that's logos, do logos. But don't call it brand design.

Like some of you, I attended a traditional 4-year college to get a BA in graphic design.  I would imagine many of you are self-taught or had a friend who introduced you into the business, which is cool too (honestly, one isn't better than the other, don't hear me say that). 

I think those ways are nice, they accomplish something, but after some amount of time these paths are finished.  You can't keep taking classes or move in with that friend to get advice forever, you might even surpass them!  

What I wish I had, what I wish I could be is more of the guild/mentor type relationships.  What if instead of schooling for graphic arts, we joined a guild of people.  We worked hard for our 'teachers' and built lasting relationships around more than just classes.  We could have these relationships for years, and eventually replace our teachers.  

Then I thought: what if I could replicate this idea virtually?  I do much of my work remotely, as a freelancer, so I seem to have the ability to skype and talk to anyone I would need to.  I think it would be amazing that have those kind of networks in place.

I could spend hours poring over work by Jessica Hische and all those other design rockstars, not to mention consume endless design articles off of Twitter and here, until my head is absolutely spinning. But, despite all the inspiration on the internet, I can't seem to spur into action. I get discouraged and lazy instead of inspired. I keep thinking I can't compare to these other people. It's going to take too long to get there. Regardless, I want to try.

I WOULD LOVE to create some cool side projects of my own, outside of my not-very-creative full time job. I WANT to be better known in the community, but while I have the brains, I'm lacking the drive to make stuff once my 9-5 is over. Sometimes I have freelance client work after hours, but again it's pretty corporate &amp; I dread doing it (but they're a good client, so I have to). (I'll be honest — even when I didn't have a full schedule, I still lacked drive to make cool things, even if I obsessed over other peoples' work for hours).

By the time the weekend comes around, I don't even want to look at a computer, let alone illustrate what could be the coolest 10-hour handlettering ever... I'd much rather go to a park, or play with my cats.

But I feel like I'm severely missing out. Like, I would much rather be at the TYPOSF Conference right now instead of being in Middle America. I want to do the awesome thing, the popular thing, be a part of the movers and shakers. But I am a corporate nobody in an unfriendly, crappy city with not much of a design community.

Help!,98,17,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/19ty1a/i_have_11_days_left_to_raise_600_to_save_a_93/,"Hey, /r/graphic_design. I was told that I should post this here, and having read a bunch of threads, I think I am among like minded folks. I am a letterpress enthusiast, using technology from the days before 'graphic design' existed as a separate entity, and a graphic designer's tools were type cases, compositor's saws, furniture, reglets and leading.

There's a few different schools of letterpress -- those who use computers to produce photopolymer plates from which to print, those that work almost entirely with movable type, and then there's the group that I belong in -- the hot metal crowd. We're the people that work in molten lead. This almost invariable involves big machines that work magic to assemble brass moulds into which molten lead is injected, producing entire lines of cast type ready for the press. It adds an element of ""holy crap, this could seriously injure me"" to graphic design.

Comparing my letterpress setup to a computer setup, my keyboard weighs 3600 pounds, my printer 2700 pounds. My font menu has 4 choices in it, and each choice weighs around 40 pounds. My backspace key is permanently broken, and sometimes my keyboard sprays molten metal at my legs.

Of particular interest to me is my Linotype, the machine which composes and casts the lines of type. It's an amazing feat of late 1800's engineering. The machine is the conductor of an orchestra of hundreds little moulds, which are automatically assembled and disassembled on demand to cast a line of type.

Time to get to the point… I have been made are of a 93 year old Linotype in Seattle that is homeless, and soon to be scrapped. I am located in BC, and I want to save it from that fate. I tried to find a willing adoptee in the area, but nobody could be located. Not willing to give up, I started an Indiegogo campaign to raise the funds needed to go and rescue the machine. My intention is to give it a home until a proper home can be found. I already own a Linotype, and a second isn't too high on my want list right now.

Counting some off-line contributions, I'm half way to my fund raising goal, but there's still some distance to go to the finish line. If you've got a few dollars to spare and believe in preserving the history of print design, please consider contributing.

**TL;DR:** I need money to save a 93 year old linotype from being scrapped. Help!

1. I'm born and raised in Eastern Europe where the living standard is pretty fucking shitty and where the graphic design industry has been non existent ""professionally"" until recently. 
2. I'm a duel citizen of a ""western"" country where I was lucky enough to spend lots of years of my life and I know the misconceptions that can arise from stating a salary without any context to people living in shittier countries.
3. I'm currently back in my home country working as an in-house graphic/web designer and would like to put things in perspective for all members of this subreddit, regardless where they're from because even among Montana and Boston I assume things are quite different.


Anyway, let's start, me first!!

I'm 3 years in the industry. I specialize in print design. I make 600 euros a month. The average salary in my country is 300 euros!. 

With said 600 euros I give 200 euros for rent(average price), 100 euros for bills and utilities(average price), 100 euros for gas/petrol and I get to enjoy the rest (200euros). Mind you, I make double the average salary in my country! Most graphic designers here make 250 - 300 euros!! I consider myself to be lucky living the life I am currently.

My request to all members here is this: 

Don't just state your salary but put it in context so people could get a feel for what's that worth. When someone says ""I make 96,000$"" but lives in New York, that might give a false impression to some people.

Please, state your salary in this post (monthly) but tell others what that salary PROVIDES you with in that 1 month?!

I hope I don't get misunderstood.

Start with knowing your tools...,95,21,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/175op0/want_to_learn_graphic_design_start_with_knowing/,"Since joining /r/graphic_design many moons ago, I've noticed A TON of people popping in and asking where to get started if they're trying to take graphic design seriously as a profession or field of study. I think the question gets asked at least once a weak in one form or another; ""where should I start, what tools do I need, how do I start, etc."" Most of these questions can be answered by simply reading the side panel and making use of google and such.

**HOWEVER**, I'm posting this to give a heads up to all people who legitimately want to learn the tools of the trade. Since subscribing to Lynda.com a few months ago, I've noticed a shift in my quality of work. I'm no longer limited by my knowledge of the software. It's amazing how simple things become once you have a keen understanding of your tools. I'm no longer bogged down by the need to implement the cool new trick I learned in my latest professional or pet project. I design what I want, how I want it.

I know this sounds like an advertisement for Lynda.com. It is not. It's simply a fellow designer sharing a tip that I wished I had taken more seriously when it was first presented to me a while ago.

Also, I'm not saying that I completely 100% know PS, AI, &amp; ID through and through. Very few do. I am saying that learning the beginner and intermediate level fundamentals of the software has lifted a need in me to ""show off"" the new trick I discovered, and focus on designing work that is fundamentally sound and well constructed.

Anyways, I hope this leads some curious future designers to check out Lynda.com (or any site that gives you a thorough break down of the CS family, although I've found that Lynda.com is pretty much the best one out there). I promise that the time and energy you spend watching those videos and taking notes will pay off ten-fold when you start sending out invoices and cashing those checks.",,False,,t5_2qmtk,False,,,True,t3_175op0,http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/175op0/want_to_learn_graphic_design_start_with_knowing/,

Obviously people are happy to ask questions here at the moment, but if there's just that little one line quick question it could be a good way to promote discussion!

I don't know if we could maybe alternate topics, e.g.

Week 1 - __Typography__

Week 2 - __Printing__

Week 3 - __InDesign__

Week 4 - __Illustrator__

So maybe we concentrate on a specific area of graphic design, be it applications, resumes, portfolios?

It seems that we get a lot of the same questions repeated here, so maybe these could be used as a permanent reference if they do end up being on certain topics.

__TL;DR;__ Why don't we start a weekly discussion thread, maybe focussing on specific topics OR allowing users to ask any one line type questions that they don't deem big enough for an individual post.

---

Update: it's great to see so many people think this is a good idea! I agree, after reading comments, that it would be better to allow users to ask any questions they like to get more of a discussion going. 
---
Because of this, I propose a new idea to run along side [Moronic Mondays], [Topic Tuesdays]. Here we would set a particular topic every Tuesday, as per above in this post. That way we might be able to find someone who would definitely be able to answer any questions. For example, for the printing week, there was a post on here or maybe /r/design a couple of months ago by a guy who ran a print shop - he could be great to get in a thread like that, as i'm sure he's more knowledgable than most on the subject!

2) Communication
3) Empathy

1) If you don't have confidence, potential clients won't put any in you. ""Fake it till you make it"" is the saying. If you can't do something, learn by doing. Invest in clothes that make you feel good. Don't dress like a prick just because you think that's what you should do. If you feel comfortable and confident it shows and you will be surprised how little your portfolio matters if your prospect is impressed by you as a person.

2) Your job as a graphic designer is to communicate a message effectively (and efficiently). This should be your mantra. ""I am a messenger."" Don't piss and moan about how your drawing skills are sub-par. Yes drawing comes with time, but be prepared to accept the fact that you may not be a talented artist. Focus on improving your ability to speak with and deal with a wide range of individuals and firms. Meet with your clients as often as possible. Have your face next to your work when you show them. Don't hide behind emails.

3) A good graphic designer can put the message before themselves. Chances are, with most work, you are not the intended audience. So how do you get in the right mindset? Use your empathy, asshole. Watch the shows they watch, listen to their music. Communicate with your client and ask them questions! Have you seen that Mel Gibson Movie ""What Women Want""? It's an extreme example but basically Mel's character is an advertising director given the power to go into the mind of women. Do that. Go into the mind of your target, whoever they are.

1363111665.0,61,self.graphic_design,1a5rn9,Quit on a client for the first time. Was I being professional about it?,69,8,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/1a5rn9/quit_on_a_client_for_the_first_time_was_i_being/,"The client I just quit on is a small non-profit organization who is planning an annual fundraiser event. It is a school for autistic children. I did work for this event last year and had a rough time with it, mostly because the owner was really nit picky and she had non-stop changes because she would always change her mind. I am a freelance designer with a separate full-time desk job so this is a pretty big project for me. It consists of a Save the Date card, invitation, RSVP card, auction list, a 12-14 page auction brochure and about 10 16x20 posters.

So this year the client is expanding and wants to include older kids. Her idea was to create a more mature looking event while showing that they can build a bridge for these children. After about a week working through concepts that I felt fit what she wanted, she turned them all down because she now want more primary colors showing the current kids she has (basically moving back to last year's design which featured only children and using primary colors). So I designed the Save the Date card for her the way she wanted it - and she loved it. A week later when we were ready to design the invitation and RSVP cards, she changed her mind again. Now she wanted to do full blown photos of her students instead of the previous design which consisted of sketches. Small change, but big enough to where it wasn't going to be consistent. I advised against doing it but she kept pushing so I eventually agreed and did another redesign. Now this is where everything went kaput with me.

After the redesign, she accepted another design i did - but later she had her husband, who she says is a ""design engineer"" (I have no clue what a design engineer is) modify my design and asks me to create it like how he did it. I was obviously offended by this but never said anything to her and just agreed to change it. I started working on other design pieces for her and she tells me she loves what I am designing. But then she has her husband modify another part of my design a week later. At this point most of the design elements are her husband's work and not mine. At this point I am angry (both at her for having her husband change my work and myself because it made me think I was doing a horrible job). I proceeded to send her the following email:

""I have updated the file and uploaded it to Dropbox. Please let me know how it looks. On another note, I would like to see if it is really a good idea for me to continue working on this project. I am starting to feel that our design interests are vastly different and I am really just modifying someone else's design work that you feel more comfortable with. I don't feel comfortable taking your investment funds since I don't feel like I am being creative enough for this event. I can issue you a final billing for hours worked that we have agreed upon up to when the invitation designs are sent to the printer.""

I sent this to her two days ago and she still hasn't responded. She usually responds within a couple of hours so I am assuming she is pretty ticked off. We started on this project in the beginning of February and the event is in mid-May. What makes me feel worse is that a client who I work with monthly recommended me to her but I just can't work with her.

Should I have taken another route?

*EDIT*

Looks like she responded. Here is her email: ""Sorry for the delay in responding. Thanks for making those changes.  Yes--let's finish out the invite, RSVP, and auction insert and get those sent to the printers.  I am still waiting for confirmation on a few items, so I hope to have that list sent to you by tomorrow.""

I guess she needed time to cool off, but I'm glad it ended well. Thanks for all of the comments and suggestions. I will definitely use them if the situation arises again.

1343319588.0,60,self.graphic_design,x71ve,X-Post from /design: How to keep your work organized on a server (or any file system) Ad Agency Style.,74,14,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/x71ve/xpost_from_design_how_to_keep_your_work_organized/,"I just had the displeasure of rummaging through several years of a server that was less then organized. In fact, it was a nightmare. Soooo, with that said, I would like to explain a little bit to the younger crowd or just people in general who aren't very organized with their file system on how to keep things simple, easy and organized.

[Here is a screenshot of the server at work and how my folders are stacked](http://i.imgur.com/bUKrH.jpg)

You can see that we start off with just a general ""Art"" folder, from their its broken down into years, this is helpful for freelancers or someone who is doing alot of work. Once you go deeper you will see it is then further broken down into the alphabet, furthermore, if you go into folder ""A"" for example, you will see all the clients, who's business name starts with an ""A"" This is crucial. You absolutely want to keep your stuff sorted by client name as that is how your memory works. It doesn't remember PO# 32489 from August of 2009, this is the reasoning behind spelling everything out. Once you get to the client folder, it breaks down even farther.

I break down my clients creative folders into 4 different sections.

1. WIP (Work in Progress) This is where I keep all of my layered .psd or .tiff or whatever file I am working on. If I am building a magazine, this is where the native InDesign file would reside. If it's an illustration, the .eps resides here and so on. I also rename my files with each revision, so its _v1.psd, _v2.psd and so on. If it's a complete design overhaul, sometimes I will create a new folder inside WIP that says something like ""Revised July 27th - New layouts"" or something of that nature to let me know the entire design changed in style. Also, say I am doing a whole creative campaign for say Chevy, then inside the WIP I would have folders for each car name &gt; Volt, Malibu, Cruze etc.

2. Orig (Original art) This is where all of the files the client have given me are stored. This is also where I keep all of my references or parts to files. THESE ARE NEVER, EVER ALTERED. I keep this folder this way so that at anytime, if something gets lost or deleted I have all the essential elements to rebuild whatever it was I was working on. Examples of things that would go in here: Logos, stock photos, fonts, color palettes (colorlovers) vector stocks etc.

3. Proof - This is self explanatory. If I am showing my proofs in a InDesign template, then I save my low res files into here. I also save all of my final proofs in this folder, again, named with version extensions _v2_Proof.PDF or _v3_Proof.PDF so that I know what the last version was that was approved.

4. Final - Again, self explanatory. This is where all the final files are saved, as well as utilizing the version callouts in the file extension for easy reference when looking for the last version. This folder can also have deeper folders inside for huge campaigns like &gt;Web &gt;Print &gt; Social &gt;Vehicle Wraps etc.... that way you keep everything separated for easy reference. That way when the printer needs a new file rushed to them at 2am and your groggy eyes (and brain) are trying to comprehend where that final postcard file landed it's easily accessible.

I have to run, hopefully this all makes sense, I will probably be back to edit this some more tomorrow I just wanted to get this out as a couple people showed interest in this in another comment I had made.

Godspeed designers, let's all keep organized so we don't have to spend all day cleaning up someone elses chaotic file structures.

I can't seem to keep up with making quality stuff within such shorts amount of time. Using a website like www.graphicriver.net would really make things a lot easier especially with web design. Buttons, layouts, nav bars, etc. as well as other things would really speed things up. For example, I need like a power bar graphic, or a ratings 1-10 meter, but if I could find that on a website, I could just drop it in with ease rather than have to make one from scratch. Even templates for flyers could speed stuff, customizing them a little after. 

The thing is, not every project requires complete originality from scratch. Some of these projects are just pitches for products, or just need to be stylized in any possible way. Sometimes people just want you to make something look nice.

So the question is, how often do you guys use pre-made stuff as opposed to making stuff completely from scratch?

He was a massively talented, extremely humble, and very private man who I think deserves to be remembered.

John, (along with my father and their five other siblings) was born and raised in Greenwich Village during the depression. Many men (including my father) turned to the nearby waterfront for work as longshoremen - John, however, took elocution lessons and attended the Manhattan School of Industrial Arts, and was then hired by NBC.

Aside from his design work, he was passionate about the fine arts. His paintings and assemblages were fixtures in my house growing up, and still hang on my mother's walls. In fact, he designed a [**really great logo**](http://oi41.tinypic.com/11tu7n4.jpg) for my mom's real estate business in the early eighties, pro bono of course.

I've just received a negative performance review at work. While my first review went fairly well, my last review was awful. In my field, you have 2 strikes and you're out. This is strike 1.

Background: I work at a startup and I'm the only designer. Prior to this, I was interning at a few places. I got a late start in design, via the untraditional route of learning by myself. I signed up for this job knowing this (and knowing the challenges of being the only designer, its harder to motivate yourself)...because I know the impact it could have on my resume IF I do a great job. My job is split in half, half doing branding graphics work, half doing product work. On a typical day, I'm kept fairly busy between the two sides. I switched to design from another career because I truly thought my passion lies in something creative...and now I'm unsure of myself. 

The general feedback was: You have the skills, but you're not taking initiative to bring our brand to the next level. You're giving me designs that are off brand (I was exploring options, but I think they want me to treat them as a CLIENT instead of an Art Director), and you haven't even started on a style guide yet. I'm also responsible for helping to redesign their product - a HUGE task and one that I'm kind of nervous about. I haven't initiated doing that either. You clearly have the skills to do the job, but you aren't taking any initiative to improve things.

I saw it coming. The first few months of this job, I was on fire. Knocking things out left and right. But the last few months, I've been unmotivated and can't figure out why. I started slacking off and stopped exploring ideas and options, settling for designs that work. I used to do fun projects on the side to learn, and now I stopped doing it altogether. I know - an unmotivated designer is essentially a dead designer given how competitive this industry is. Its BAD. Is it because I'm the only designer (do other designers here have the same problem?) Or is it really just me, and I'm not passionate or motivated about design enough? How do you stay passionate?

I'm fearful of losing my job. It will have a really negative impact on my resume, given how small the industry is. I'm afraid of picking up my mojo, only to have it decline again a few months later.

I found out a while back that I was incorrectly naming colors, and it became frequent enough for me to go to my optometrist to ask and get tested. I found out that, although 'mild', I definitely *did* have color blindness. Basically reds, greens, and browns ('earth tones') are the ones I have trouble telling apart at different shades and mixtures.

As a designer, this has completely affected my confidence level, and as to whether or not I should still continue to pursue a career as one. I'm currently job hunting, and in an already super competitive field, I now feel at a huge disadvantage. I also feel guilty for not being honest and upfront about my 'disability', fearing that I won't ever find work again. I hesitate with everything, and I don't know if I'm naming any of the right colors at this point (Is that orange or red-orange? Dark blue or teal? Etc, etc). I hadn't realized at how much I actually relied on this ability, until I lost it.

I was told, however, that this type of color blindness is the most common, especially with men. So that's why I'm reaching out here. Is anyone here in the same position? How are you dealing with it? Are you still designing? Are there any tricks you use to aid your work, or a way you would recommend to re-learn colors?

Any advice would be *really* appreciated, because this has completely thrown me off, and I'm really confused on how to proceed.

Normally when I am done with a logo (or other design), I give the client a highres PNG, EPS... and whatever other, compressed, files formats they need that I can oblige. 

What I normally _don't_ give up are the PSD or AI files.

This recently came up when I did a digital painting/logo for a website's header.

Here is what was said...

&gt;The other thing I was emailing about was to ask for the source of the header. I know you are ambivalent about giving it, but I actually really do want it. If you are worried about me sharing the source with other designers do not be worried. As is with all [REDACTED] source files (code, website, and graphics) it is proprietary material and doesn't get shared with anyone that is not authorized.
&gt;
&gt;The primary reason is that my brother is a design student and had some feedback that I would like to experiment with. Its not something I really want to pay extra time for since it may end up going nowhere, but its something I do want to explore.

What I said back.

&gt;I don't want this to become a sore spot between us, but I can't with a clear conscious betray the principles of sharing a design's source files. Clients never pay for the source, they only pay for the final product. In the beginning  if they work out a deal where they MUST have the source, there is normally a premium; as the artist is, from then on, obsolete.
&gt;
&gt;This very principle is betrayed where you say ""If you are worried about me sharing the source with other designers do not be worried""... and then... ""my brother is a design student and had some feedback that I would like to experiment with"". I hope you can see how that would undermine the very nature of the work that I do. It isn't about other designer learning some fancy secret I have tucked away, it's about clients being able to make uninformed changes themselves.

Am I wrong? Is giving up the source files a _common_ practice? If so, its' new to me. My contracts have a clause about transferring the IP at the time of payment, but I was pretty sure that doesn't mean the uncompressed layers.

Did I do the right thing here? :S",,False,,t5_2qmtk,1350728651.0,,,True,t3_11sjjo,http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/11sjjo/do_you_give_up_your_source_files_at_the_end_of_a/,

As requested, I've put together a fun, little design challenge (one that I would have done for myself) for you guys. I don't really know what I'm doing, as I haven't ever taken a formal design class. So, if there's anything that you think is lacking from this challenge, please feel free to PM me with requests/details! Have fun with it!

____________________


**Weekly Design Challenge #1:**

Create, and brand, a fast food or soda company.

**Restraints:**

* Artistic Era: [Idiocracy, 2006](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387808/) Your logo should be able to fit into the movie Idiocracy. Edit: [Youtube link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMkrJOOTjj4) to video.

* Must use one ~~foul~~ *silly* word in slogan of company. Keep it SFW so it's safe to add to your portfolio! This can be both fun *and* productive, as one mod has pointed out!

* All submissions are due by 10:00AM PST, on Friday, the 11th of May 2012.

**What to submit:**

* Logo (three versions: B+W; spot colors; and process colour)

* 1 (8.5""x11"") advertisement featuring the Logo and the slogan. Your advertisement will be printed in the ""Super Jumbo Explosion &amp; World Report"" (Thank you, Riotous).

* Short paragraph explaining various design choices (explained later) and a willingness to attempt to (politely) defend those choices after critique. Edit: *I've received a few messages suggesting that this is an unnecessary portion to submit. Some sort of explanation is encouraged, but no longer required.*

* At least two critiques on others' submissions, please!

**Notes:**

* Think of your target demographic. Who are they? What do they need? Justify your decision with text.

* Do not submit your designs here. I will start a new thread on Thursday evening to receive submissions. Anything submitted here will not be counted.

Edit:

* If there's something you don't like about this challenge, that's fine. PM me with a *solution*, not just the problem. I'm not a professional and have put this together *for fun*.

I picked Idiocracy as it's one of my favorite modern movies. It's extremely stylized and fun, and advertisements/logos are a huge theme throughout the entire movie.

My answer is and always will be yes. Well, yes with a rant (which I will shove down your throats in a few more sentences).

I worked 15 - 20 hours a week as a designer in the Continuing Education department of my university creating a few catalogs, a lot of direct mail and quite a bit of advertising (print and internet). It's been just over eleven years since graduation and looking back, those 2 years of the internship/job taught me more applicable skill than any design/art class. 

My first hard and fast lesson, and one that could only be taught in the working environment, was the very clear distinction between subjective and objective design. In school, although each project had an objective, I was graded more on the ability to take the task at hand and come up with a “baffle them with bullshit” interpretation. It was always the more emotional or self/world-analytical idea that trumped the clear, concise, purpose driven one. If your school(s) are anything like the ones around my area, this still seems to be the case and is a disservice to the percentage of students who want a steady income with benefits. In the working world, most designers will end up answering to clients, or answering to someone who answers to clients. And clients, although the lifeblood of our industry are huge dicks that fail to see the effort in your work. When dealing with clients, more often than not, it doesn't matter what emotion the typeface invokes or what kind of back story you have for choosing your imagery, they will want it bigger, and flashier, and jazzier, and reversed. At that point, there is a choice to be made. Do you hold on to your artistic integrity and tell the client to fuck off, resulting in the loss of your job, your apartment, your boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/wife/dog/cat/ferret. And you're out there living in the streets, man. But hey, you held onto your values and their minds are literally going to explode once their tiny brains comprehend your original concept. No one can ever take that away from you... until you get your teeth kicked in fighting other bums while some sleaze ball videotapes the entire thing without calling 911 after you have a seizure and slip into a coma . Or, do you suck it up, make the asinine changes the client requested while maintaining a level of good taste, utilizing your knowledge/talent/experience. Keeping your job, living space, significant other and steering clear of all vagrants and makeshift squirrel tail paintbrushes you use to create your “art”.

Most people are going to choose the latter. I hope. But this is something worth learning as early as possible. Don’t get me wrong, school is great for learning the history and fundamentals of design, but you’ll never encounter a teacher that wants you create 3.25” x 8” ad that has two pages of copy in word, six images, four callouts and is due to the publication in an hour.

The people in question seem to then consider themselves an amateur or a beginner designer in whatever form they were creating. The fact is they aren't beginners and they aren't amateurs, they just happen to be someone who got their hands on a copy of Photoshop and made something [usually] horrible.

This doesn't just seem to be limited to reddit, and I feel that our profession is being devalued somewhat. At this current time, designers and design, don't seem to be considered important in daily life by a lot of people, and I think it's contributed to by the fact that there are a lot of people doing, what could be serious, work who actually aren't qualified to state themselves as designers. To me it seems this applies more considerably to people involved in web design, as it seems to be the most accesible, with the most amount of people saying they create websites on the side of studying for their unrelated degree.

Am I just crazy, or are the next man and his dog a designer/design critic nowadays?

- Started internship with a small YouTube channel company in November, but been going once a week. :/

- Was the top 3 designers in all my classes (Not being egotistical, but people were designing crap)

- Located in Southern California. 

- Got a call to interview late December as an in-house designer, but was cancelled literally last minute as I was driving to the 
company's location. They said they have my name on their list to call in January, but so far no call back. Should I write a followup? 

- What should I do in the meantime?

Things ended amicably, and I moved on.

The question we popped up is - which designer/s are... completely uninterested in your bullshit. They have no regard for your feelings, they don't want to be quirky or conceptual (necessarily) but are just trying to get the effing job done. The Dutch, they want you to smile and laugh... the italians want to stroke your ego... Modernists want to get out of your way to a degree, but they still like bright colors and clean type. Sagmeister is an iconoclast, Pentagram is about selling you something unobtrusively....

Some examples we came up with that DO seem to lack an overt agenda design-wise... they're 'just the facts':

* [Mirko Ilic](http://www.mirkoilicdesign.com) is sort of uninterested in your bullshit
* NatGeo is, to a degree, just here to educate you (not a lot of overt design per se)

I'm a 14 year old (Let the hate rise) and I've been doing photoshop/Cinema4D for about 1 1/2 - 2 years.

I know this sounds odd coming from a 14 year old, but photoshop is the one thing I *love* to do. It's honestly the only thing I ~~see~~ (saw?) myself doing as a profession.

I then discovered this subreddit.. I've been reading nearly every post for the past 2 or so hours, and %95 of people seem like they hate their jobs/tell people to not get into graphics.

This genuinely upsets me because, honestly, my grades have dropped (Nothing dramatically) because I've started to spend quite a bit more time on photoshop everyday. Hearing people say stuff like 'You will need 2 jobs' 'People don't appreciate what you do' etc, kind of sucks. 

I mainly do typography (To  be more specific, I'm usually just making myself some desktop backgrounds, or some for friends.)

I hope you guys don't mind, and I hope this is the right subreddit for this, but I have a few questions.

* 1)  I read that if you want to get 'serious' you should use Illustrator instead of Photoshop as it is Vector based (Probably mixing it up, sorry.) Should I be learning illustrator aswell?

* 2)  Is the career path really that awful? I've literally read people tonight saying how it's one of the worst careers they've ever entered in.
 
* 3)  How much is the *pay?* (Keep in mind, I'm 14, I don't actually care about the money in it right now, just curious.) I've heard people say 'You will need two jobs' But then I hear people say 'Stop doing logos for $1000' Surely $1000+ for a logo would be decent enough pay?

* 4)  Are there any books on typography / Illustrator / Cinema4d / Photoshop out there any of you would recommend? I've been saving my money lately for a new TV, but I think I'd honestly prefer to buy some books on graphic design.

* 5)  When did you get into graphics design? Was it in middle school? high school? College? I'm genuinely curious!






I would prefer not to share my work (Honestly semi-'afraid' of what people who do this as a living will say..) but... here goes nothing..

In total it's about 20 users.  All users had at least one copy of CS6 and most had CS5 and CS4, so we've spent a decent amount of money.

After the upgrade, when changes are made in InCopy, InDesign throws a critical error after attempting to integrate those changes.  I spent 5 hours on a tech support call with a very arrogant, useless, and unhelpful customer support.  In the end, the call ended up being dropped while he attempted to put me on hold.

Nothing about our workflow has changed in a couple years.  The only variable that has changed is the software.  This change caused us to miss our first print deadline in.....well it's the first one I've heard of in the 5 years I've been with the company.

We are a national industry publication with three national print publications, with 5 regional edition magazines for one of our publications.

We have tweeted you, posted on the Adobe forums, requested that the issue be escalated, etc.  At this point, our team is having to work extended hours because we are having to build each magazine, page by page, instead of being able to build them as a full magazine.

Adobe, if you are listening, we are actively seeking to replace your software because of your inability to support a long time customer.

**Edit**  4+ hours after first contact from Adobe on here, and still nobody has contacted me.  I was told via @AdobeCare on twitter that it had been escalated.  Not sure exactly what that means, but so far, it hasn't meant much.

**Edit 2** Three people have contacted me from Adobe.  I've provided them all with the files and info they need.  We can't get access to the computers that are having the issue until August 15 (missed an opening between print deadlines).  We'll see if anyone follows through with helping resolve this.

**Aug 14**  Two different people at Adobe are trying to resolve this.  One has been extremely helpful and has been able to duplicate the issue.  The other hasn't responded to emails since the first day of communications.  He's supposed to call me tomorrow at 10am EST, so we'll see.

**Aug 15 @noon EST** Adobe missed our scheduled call today at 10am EST.  They won't reply to emails I've sent either.  [Since they seem to prefer only communicating via twitter](https://twitter.com/torreddaytona/statuses/368037639091273728).

**Aug 15 @12:30pm EST**  Received an email back.  In the last 6 days, he hasn't emailed me once.  Now he replies that he hasn't been able to replicate the issue.  He blames it on ""system permissions"" that Adobe is having issues accessing the files.  This, of course, ignores the fact that another Adobe employee has been able to replicate the issue with VM's and the issue happens on dozens of computers.  So either dozens of computers(including a range of PC's and Macs) are all having read file permission issues, or he's barking up the wrong tree.

Hello my name is Jennifer, I am graduating with my Visual Communications ATA degree. My plans are to work as a graphic designer while pursing my BA in Visual Communications. In the meantime, I would like to know if you could spend some time to answer questions about graduating and working your way into the field. I would most appreciate it! If you have any other suggestions please state them. 

1.) As a student graduating into a field of freelance and agencies, what advice can you give about selecting the ""better"" temporary job when it comes to clients and agencies.


2.) What types of Portfolios (printed, online, custom ect) did you use while exiting school and what type(s) do you currently use in todays evolving trends.


3.) What is the salary range for a junior freelance designer to senior designer based on your experience over the years? Would you suggest an hourly rate over a flat rate?


4.) What type of continuing educate or graphic design trends (blogs, sites or software) do you review to stay up to date on design trends? Any suggestions?


5.) Do you suggestions on design software, as of now I am experienced in Adobe Creative Suite 6.


6.) Is there anything you do on a daily basis to keep your creative mind flowing?


7.) What skills are important to be competent in this field? What degrees and/or 
training are necessary? 


8.)How stable is the job market in this field? 


9.)What is a typical day like? What kinds of problems and decisions do you face in an average week? 


10.)What social medias do you use to promote your work or your clients?



Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions, I appreciate your time and efforts in my education and future career!

As someone who has never done a logo design professionally that doesn't really help, can you guys be a bit more specific? Something like start at a base of X dollars if you've been doing this for X years, then add X amount of dollars if you live in these types of areas etc? Or even just the lowest/Highest you would charge for a logo would be helpful. I know there isn't one price you charge but everyone ever only posts the variables to the price. it would just be nice to have a rough idea of how much MORE/LESS to charge? 

EDIT:

this is [my portfolio](http://michaeltruong.ca) most things on there which is still just for fun/practice (graduating from highschool this year)

If you haven't had any real professional work/Paid work but you think you have enough skill as someone with lets say 3-4 years of experience, would you charge like you did?

Where do you get your blank templates to paste images of your work into for 3D and context visualisation?

I recently came across [Live Surface](https://www.livesurface.com/images.php), and it seems to be exactly what I need - each image opens in Photoshop and has Vanishing Points equipped, so you just drop your image on it and it formats the perspective automatically.

Unfortunately, as much as I like their service, I'm a recent graduate and just can't afford to spend $29 per image for the variety of templates I need. Does anyone know of a cheaper or free alternative similar to Live Surface? Or perhaps a resource site along these lines?

Your answers to any of the following would be interesting:

1. How do you indicate the nature of your work (ie your value) to an uninformed client?
2. How do your pricing expectations change between project sizes -- do you stick to an hourly rate regardless? Does certain work cost more? Less?
3. (Personal/Subjective) What is the ""threshold"" where you begin to seriously consider an offer? How much negotiating is involved?
4. (Personal/Subjective) What would you consider ""great"" pay for your current context (type of work/geographic market)? 
5. How do you expect to be paid? Up front? At the completion of the project? A mix of both?

We'll have a specific topic but don't worry about that if you have a question that doesn't relate to it. Feel free to ask whatever you want about any topic, in any field of design.

This weeks topics is Adobe CC and AIGA.

1366821099.0,34,self.graphic_design,1d0nqp,Fighting scammers. . . Thoughts?,43,9,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/1d0nqp/fighting_scammers_thoughts/,"I recently took on a client from another state (first time I've done that) and was hired to design a logo for her. Right from the beginning, something seemed off with her. She only spoke to me via emails, her spelling, grammar, and typing was horrid. I didn't judge, thinking maybe she wasn't natively English. I asked her a bunch of questions about her business to assure that she was a real person, phone number, address, demographic, website, how long have you been in business, etc. she kept responding accordingly, so I went forth with the project. 

I didn't request any funds up front, the project was only going to be $100-200 and I usually don't require 50% down on jobs that low. 

After I sent her the logo concept designs (with watermarks on them), she disappeared. She stopped emailing me. And when she finally did respond she basically said my services would no longer be needed. WTF?

So I guess my question is, how do you guys protect your work from scammers and thieves? Like I said, I put watermarks on all the designs, and didn't send her any hi-res proofs. But I feel like I could have still done more to protect my work. 

Has anyone else dealt with this sort of thing?

TL; DR - got scammed on a job. How do I protect my work from scammers??

I am looking into buying the adobe design suite (il, ps, id) and wondering if its worth it? The thing is, this is my last opportunity to buy it 80% off with the student discount. I've always got by with torrents just fine though. I know the biggest benefit to having a legit copy is being able to get the latest patches in case of any bugs, though how often does that happen? Also I would be able to upgrade the collection in the future versions of the applications at the fraction of the cost. Another future benefit would be not getting fined if they should ever track me. and then there is always the moral issue.. So do you think its worth the investment? What were they reasons why you bought or chose not to buy the software?

So tomorrow, I have a group of three high school students coming to shadow me at work tomorrow, and I need help filling the day with things to talk with them about the entire day.

A little about myself, I'm a 26 y/o graphic designer working at a screen printing shop full time in Rochester, NY. I mainly do prepress work, but do a lot of graphic design on the side and for the shop. I was asked a few weeks ago by a local guidance councilor to have a few kids come shadow me for the day. They specifically wanted to shadow a ""graphic designer."" I thought it would be a fun thing to do, and thought about how I wish someone would have done that for me in high school, and I agreed.

Fast forward to today: Just remembered I have these kids coming in tomorrow, and struggling to prepare a good day for them. I know they have a packet they have to fill out, which I was given a copy of to prepare in advance. Basic career questions mostly.

I figure I can talk to them about my past and how I got where I am, followed by a tour of the shop, talk to them about a typical day, share a few stories, grab some lunch, show them some of the tools I use everyday, etc. After that, I'm not sure what to talk to them about concerning graphic design...

What are some things I can talk about with these kids about? What is some stuff you wish someone had told you about in high school? I'm struggling for ideas at this point! I don't want to screw these kids up and make them think the career path is lame! Any help would be awesome! Thanks, Reddit!

im 28 years old guy from germany and i am frustrated with my actual carrier and some other parts of my life in general. what i do for a living right now, has absolute nothing to do with graphic design but i actually was interested in all kind of design since i can remember. i somehow never trusted myself that i could be any good in a creative field. it only occurred to me after  some resent life changes i did(thanks to r/nofap and r/mediation and a few others) that it is possible to change for the better und start following my dreams in life. 

so with that being said, of course i know that i cant just drop out my current life and that i have to take step after step ( a lot of reading, learning software skills etc. in my free time) to eventually get a carier started as a graphic designer.

i'm reading this subreddit for some time now and i think, like in some of the other reddits i mentioned, there is great knowledge and there are great people to be found here. **so i would love to hear stories froms some of the pros out there who started their carriers at a later age or/and were coming from different carriers.**

Trends like bright text on black backgrounds, marijuana-leaf stickies on breasts, skulls, flames, etc. make it hard to take the culture seriously, especially when considering rescheduling the drug for medical use.

I kinda lost interest in it after constantly getting into trouble, but a few years later I came into possession of CS2 and was pretty hooked on being able to express myself with computer-based art. So after a few years of doing oddjobs for friends/friends of friends and school, I went to uni to study a bachelor's in graphic design.

____________________


**Weekly Design Challenge #2:**

Design the logo and packaging for an imaginary FDA-regulated company responsible for the distribution of marijuana.

**Restraints:**

* Try not to use an obvious name and logo for your product. ""420 Bluntz"" featuring a vectorized marijuana leaf is too obvious.

**What to submit:**

* Logo (three versions: B+W; spot colors; and process colour)

* Design for the packaging (you decide how it's going to be distributed and why; it could be sold in cigarette-style, could be sold loose, etc.).

* Optional: short paragraph explaining various design choices and a willingness to attempt to (politely) defend those choices after critique.

**Notes.** 

* Consider the morality of not making your product appeal to children and teens, as this project is in honor of Judge Gray's testimony for the legalization and regulation of marijuana.

* Don't submit your work here. I'll create a submission thread next monday, the 21st of May, 2012.

* PLEASE PM ME with notes if you think I've made an error or am not asking for the proper criteria. Please include a suggestion for a solution.",,False,,t5_2qmtk,False,,,True,t3_tlpct,http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/tlpct/weekly_design_challenge_2/,

I'm an in-house designer, part time, been at this company for almost 2 years. I'm the only graphic designer in this small office.

This was my first ""official"" position out of college and I pretty much screwed myself over on my hourly rate from the beginning - I took the offer because I was ignorant. It's an embarrassingly low number.... If you guys have some good advice for me, maybe I'll tell you how much I'm currently making..

It took me a while to realize that I was under-charging and I adjusted my freelance rate (outside the office job) accordingly. Now, I'm to the point where I won't even charge my FAMILY as low of a rate as I'm getting at this office job. 

So, I'm to the point where I've waited way too long to broach the subject of adjusting my hourly rate at the office to match what I expect from all other freelance jobs. To get my office rate to match the freelance rate, I'm looking at asking for at least TWICE what I'm making right now (but it's still a totally reasonable rate for my experience level.. yes, the current rate is that bad). Also, I have held a freelance position where I was charging close to 3x what I get at the office job.

Basically, I want to set up a meeting with my boss to discuss my compensation. So here are my basic questions:

How should I approach my boss? I've never done this before and I have high anxiety about it. What are the ""business speak"" things that people say in this situation?  

What types of numbers and documentation should I arm myself with for this meeting? Any online resources or best practices to recommend?

I feel that this issue will be difficult to approach without admitting that my current pay has ALWAYS been unacceptable... should I be up front about this fact? Or just focus on the present?

Anyways, I'm mostly just trying to get over my fear of setting up the meeting and my anxiety about doing this the ""right way.""

My question is wether I should buy one of the bundles (if so which?) or just buy all the applications seperately? The ones I definitely need are Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere and After Effects. I'm also considering Audition and InDesign but I think I can replace those with other apps (Audacity and Illustrator repectively).

I know I can just go look at the prices on Adobe's site, but I'd like to get some tips and pointers from you guys as well. Are there benefits I don't know about with buying a bundle?

I've been sending resumes out but with no luck. I got a response from one I contacted this week. I went to their site as well as the site of one of their other designers. Now I'm terrified. 

I've gotten so comfortable working for this mom &amp; pop shop I'm not feeling very confident. I worry I'm not good enough for what I'm seeing on their site. Not their design work really, since I know I could do what I'm seeing. I guess I'm just scared of getting out there.

Update: thank you for all the good constructive criticism. I will be implementing those I am able to implement, such as reconstructing the website. Also, thank you for those compliments on my work. I know I'm not great, but I'm just starting so I hope to grow from here and consider it a good starting point. I doubt I will be able to present my work as some of you have suggested as I can't afford to print these pieces with fancy techniques and have them professionally photographed and don't have the means to do it myself. I'm a older than college age woman supporting 2 kids on my own making just above minimum wage, so I have to make do with what I have access to cheaply.

When I say 'graphic designers' I don't mean students or people who play with photoshop in their spare time.. I mean people who actually have fulltime jobs or maybe freelance fulltime in design. This is because in my opinion it's completely different to being a student or doing it as a hobby.

I graduated from design and luckily (and because I worked hard at it) got a job within two months. I'm now working 40 hours a week as a graphic designer and have been for about 3 months, so I'm still extremely new to the field and would really appreciate some advice on a few things...

1. How do you cope with sitting at a desk for 40 hours a week straining on a screen? I like using computers, but I still really love being healthy and active, so it's a shock to the system. I try to go for walks around the office, to make tea, get water, have a chat, go to the printer etc (while working hard of course). I also try and do exercises while sitting at my desk, like sitting in lotus position on my chair and doing foot rolls. It still doesn't feel it's enough. Not to be a debbie downer, but today I happened to read [this](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/04/confirmed-he-who-sits-the-most-dies-the-soonest/256101/) article. How do you guys feel about this aspect of the job? Any advice for me in 5 years, 10 years, etc?

2. Something I'm sure most entry level graphic designers can agree on is that the pay is pretty low. In addition to this, my job in particular is a casual position so I don't get holiday pay or sick leave. I know it sounds bad but where I live it's super hard to get a job in design and to even get it was lucky, so I'm not complaining. And they aren't actually doing anything illegal, it's all done by the book because I've looked it up. I am still managing to save so it's not a life or death situation but I have higher expectations of how much I want to save. So I'm considering getting a second job as a waitress - this means more exercise on my feet, no sitting in front of a computer, more talking to people and an additional wage. Has anyone else worked a second job with graphic design being their fulltime wage? Waitering, bartending, painting, poker pro-ing on the side, I'd love to hear about it! People tell me I should freelance design in my spare time to get better - but I couldn't do it, I need balance.

And this really isn't supposed to come across as a whiny post. I feel hugely lucky I even got a job in the field and am really liking it. I'm also doing really well and am picking everything up quickly which is great. No job is perfect but I still like to critique and address the issues I do have. I would really appreciate any stories, ideas, theories or advice.",,False,,t5_2qmtk,False,,,True,t3_sma2f,http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/sma2f/asking_all_graphic_designers_for_advice_regarding/,

Content quality has been in constant flux but you guys have shown you're capable of delivering the goods for the past two years. Following one or two messages and after monitoring the voting activity, some changes will be implemented in r/graphic_design soon. 

**New Sidebar, New Rules**

With the new sidebar our goal will be clarifying information for novice designers and fleshing out the rules of the subreddit. 

One thing that will be removed is critiques. There is already a subreddit for design critiques. It's a fine community and they deserve your usage. Critique requests garner very little karma (1-5, the odd 20 - looking at you iSunMonkey) and it has become clear that it is not what the professional design community wants filling up this subreddit. 

That is not to say you can't submit critiques of high-profile work by designers other than yourself, but the genuine requests, self promotional requests and the free consultancy will be directed to [r/Design Critiques](http://www.reddit.com/r/design_critiques) where there is a great community eager to help.

We'll continue to keep the comments section as free as possible, we just want to concentrate the submissions.

I am currently compiling an FAQ for amateur designers and that will be made available shortly. Once this is in place there will be restrictions on posts asking the questions it will be answering.

The new rules will apply from today on.

**Updated Vision for the Subreddit**

We don't want to be an unfriendly or authoritarian subreddit. We do aspire to raise the quality to that of a professional online design magazine. We want this to be a place for the following:  

* Discussions of ground-breaking work and high-profile work.  

* Examples of great design, examples of poor design (note: not crappy, there's a subreddit for that, just design that falls short, use your knowledge).  

* Tips, techniques, theory, design movements, trends, professionalism, careers and technology (digital or craft).  

So in future, items that fall outside the defined topics in the sidebar will be removed at our discretion. If you wish to plead a case for your submission, we will always be receptive but if it fails to meet the criteria outlined, there's not much we can do. We want this place to be better for everyone, amateur and professional.

**New Look:**

We're finalising a subreddit CSS theme over at [r/graphic_design2](http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design2), which WoozleWuzzle has poured a lot of work into and deserves all the credit for it. There is still some tweaking to be done but please feel free to give constructive criticism on the current design. We plan to move forward with this design as we have spent a lot of work on it. But if you see something overly glaring please feel free to point it out. We will take the suggestions and use them if they can improve the current design.

If any of you have any questions or suggestions, please do let us know. We're trying to make this the best subreddit it can be and how it will be is entirely down to your feedback. Thank you for reading, happy designing. :)",,False,,t5_2qmtk,True,,,True,t3_qpfh3,http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/qpfh3/changes_are_coming_new_rules_new_look_better/,moderator

I need to talk to someone about it, and who else knows better than a large community of designers?

I was always the creative one in my family, drawing, doodling, messing around in an old version of Paint Shop Pro, or teaching myself basic code as I made Xanga blog layouts. I was curious, and excited about design. 

I went to post-secondary right after High School. It was a small college, but had a decent design program. I flourished there. I felt like graphic design was exactly what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I made great friends, and had a great experience. I really took to the environment - the like-minded people everywhere. It was so easy to feed off everyone creative vibes. The projects were fun and exciting, my instructors were fantastic, and I found my creativity definitely peaked while I was there.

I have since completed college, and began work at a small design studio. I've been here just over a year, and I found I feel burnt out creatively. I used to be an avid doodler, and even that habit is long gone. I don't feel as creative as I was in college, or even before. 

I don't know whether it was design school that broke me, or my current work environment. I wanted to work here, I knew it after my second year of college. It had great portfolio, and the people here are great. But I dread coming to work every morning.

Some of the projects are interesting, some of the clients are cool. It has it's pros and it's cons either way. I can imagine no matter where you work there will always be projects and clients that you just don't want to deal with, but alas, you have no choice. I don't want to blame my place of work for my lack of creativity. 

So aside from being a rant, I do have a question for the design community.

pretty much whenever I have my computer running I'm on irc. There's a wide variety of channels but I've never really been able to find one where design is discussed. I've asked the mods for permission and they're fine with me trying to start a channel for this subreddit.

For those who know what IRC is, I've created the channel ##reddit-gd on freenode. I'll be online most of the time, as usual with irc though there might be longer periods where I (or anyone else who is present) might not reply. I have irc running whenever I boot up my pc and will look what's up once every hour usually.

**For those who don't know what IRC is here's a quick run-through:**

[IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) Is an entirely textbased chatprotocol and usually consists of a server where users can host their own channels. The irc network I created the channel ##reddit-gd on is [freenode](http://freenode.net/).

Freenode offers a [webbased chat to connect to ##reddit-gd](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23%23reddit-gd) but I would recommend using a proper [IRC Client](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients). As IRC is textbased and hellishly ugly by default you can improve the interface of simple clients like [mIRC](http://www.mirc.com/) (Windows Only) with add-ons  like [nbs-irc](http://nbs-irc.net/) or use other clients like [chatzilla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatZilla) (Firefox Addon - Crossplatform), [x-chat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XChat) (Crossplatform).

Mac users can connect to IRC with [Adium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adium) or [Pidgin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin_\(software\)).

I've never seen a Linux user who doesn't know IRC but Pidgin, xchat or irssi should be the best clients for that platform.

As soon as you have downloaded the client and worked your way through the settings you can connect to the server irc.freenode.org Port: 6667 (or 7000 for ssl) and join the channel ##reddit-gd. 

A last small warning: Don't expect to join for 5 minutes and have the greatest in depth discussion of your life. Most IRC users idle all day and really just reply/talk when the current topic is interesting and they feel like they can contribute. Just joining the irc channel and asking a question Google could solve in 2 minutes is shunned upon and will usually make no one want to reply. IRC is more like your usual fb/gmail IM where you talk to people once a day but stay online for 24/7.

//Edit: Feel free to ask if there's any problem with configuring your client or joining the channel.

Also make sure to join **##reddit-gd** it's two #.",,False,,t5_2qmtk,True,,,True,t3_sth6u,http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/sth6u/anyone_interested_in_joining_a_rgraphic_design/,

I feel like this might ruin adobe in the long run based on the fact their system has always been to remain popular as the ""industry standard"".

Students would ""buy"" their programs and because they were the most used by students they would go on to use their software professionally which led to its hold on the graphics industry in general.

With this new system they are essentially removing the ""planting the seed"" aspect of their formula and just banking on the idea that people won't bail out in an angry panic.

1361959418.0,24,self.graphic_design,19bjbj,Any interest here for a subreddit-wide survey of your portfolios + job offers?,29,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/19bjbj/any_interest_here_for_a_subredditwide_survey_of/,"It seems like there are a lot of times people around here ([example](http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/19az9t/while_hiring_what_do_companies_look_for_in_an/)) who want to know what quality of work gets what kind of compensation. Maybe it has been done or maybe it is completely against most of your ethical principles. But if not, here's what I propose:

**SUBMISSIONS**

-----
Submissions would look like this:

* .jpg's, .pdf, .html, etc of portfolio
* position/contract/job *offered* based on portfolio:
* salary/compensation:
* city or region:

All data parts would be optional for participants that were uncomfortable giving out that information. Even some entries without portfolios could possibly be valuable to determine current market conditions in different areas.

Submissions would be made to a single volunteer compiler. I'm down, but if you guys want to see if a mod wants to I could see that. I guess multiple people could do it, but that would seem to complicate.

The results would be compiled and probably uploaded to an imgur album unless someone wants to make something cool out of them. Since portfolios contain multiple pieces, the compiler for efficiency's sake could make a simple collage (a 2x2 grid or something) that showed the “best of”.

**ETHICS**

-----
Everything would be anonymized. Feel free to do so yourself before submitting but even if you don't, the name, age, race, all of that equal opportunity stuff, and anything that could be explicitly identifying will be left out. For example if you say, “I offered this guy $1000 for a magazine ad: johncena-g-designer.com!” then the compiler person would just go to a site and select the best work there (excluding any personal logos or what have you) and enter that along with “magazine ad: $1000”

I would think employers AND employees could submit. (Here's a persons's portfolio to whom I offered this job versus here's my portfolio for which I was offered this job.) Maybe the employ**ers** should stick to portfolios that are available publicly so as not to breach the trust of privately submitted work.


**GOALS**

-----
Ultimately this would give everyone some perspective. Of course many jobs are not solely earned on portfolios. networking, interviews, and experience almost always factor in, but “portfolio quality” is subjective anyway. Students who think they'll never make it might see some stuff on their level that made some decent cash. Or managers/supervisors could realize they've been under or overpaying. It would even be cool to just see the portfolios of the crowd here, data aside.

The more people that participate the better. I don't get any karma if you upvote this to get more people to see.

**TL;DR**

The older co-workers are 'stuck in their ways' of things and of which some are right and some are wrong.

I was working on an advert today in InDesign and numerous versions were to be created. Each version uses the same image and logo/type placement. My logical way of building this document was to place everything on the master page and then change the copy of the headline and body. This saved me a fair amount of time and ensured all placements of objects were in the correct spots and had consistency. 

My creative director (3 titles above me) wanted to make a tweak to the document and hadn't realized I had the image on the master page. They became frustrated and asked another co-worker (two titles above me) what was going on and they had to trouble shoot that it was a master page element.

I was told not to use master pages because not everyone knows how to use them. This concerns me that I have my bosses boss not knowing how to use the software complaining and making me look like I'm in the wrong. Am I? Or am I in the right to use such a feature that saves time which makes me more efficient (where I work efficiency is supposedly highly valued). 

I want to seek outside input on how to go about handling this situation because I truly feel that using the master pages feature is rudimentary knowledge for InDesign and should be utilized whenever possible that would save time.

These are slightly different styles but the overall theme is the same.  My goal is to try my hand at doing this for Lord of the Rings (Prancing Pony Application etc) and putting them around my house.  

Thank you for your help! 

**TL,DR:**How do I make these pictures.

1346869426.0,24,self.graphic_design,zekxj,Career Dilemma: I don't want to do Graphic Design anymore. What now?,30,6,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/zekxj/career_dilemma_i_dont_want_to_do_graphic_design/,"So here’s my dilemma and a little background. I received my Associates Degree in Graphic Design (emphasis in print) in ‘09 and was on the track to pursuing Graphic Design as a career and eventually work my way up the ranks to Creative Director or something similar. I knew how to use the software and was usually at the top of my class in terms of design skill. I wanted to pursue my education further so I’m currently working on my Bachelors in Advertising and Studio Art (Double Major) to fill in the holes that my Associates left out. I had it set in stone that this was going to be my life, and I couldn’t be more enthusiastic about it.

I’ve done the freelance thing, and also worked as an in-house Designer/Prepress for a local print shop, and now currently work as a Marketing Intern at the University. All this “real world” experience has taught me that I don’t think I’m cut out to be a designer, or rather it’s something I no longer wish to pursue because its taken a negative impact on my life.

This idea is mostly due to the fact that dealing with clients and my boss in regards to designing has left me feeling incredibly frustrated everyday. I know dealing with said people is part of the job and there’s no way to get around it, and that as designers we just suck it up and learn to deal with frustrating people while at the same time working on our communication skills to convince the client that as an experienced professional we know what's best and thats why we were hired. 

What's happened now is that all the creativity and inspiration has just been sucked out of me. Designing has become a chore, and I find myself blatantly ripping off others designs just to churn out work and get the project over with. There’s no more enthusiasm, no more sense of accomplishment, just an empty feeling that leaves me staring at a blank InDesign document.

So I graduate in December and I’ve come to the conclusion that what I enjoyed was the innovation, thinking outside the box, and fitting all the puzzle pieces together in a design. The more artistic part has just been something I don’t care to pursue anymore. 

Now the big question is what do I do with all this education and training? How can I transition from Graphic Designer to something else? How do I market these skills to take my career in a different direction? I ask you wonderful people of reddit if you have any experience or advice that could send me in a new direction. Any ideas for jobs or areas of interest that I can focus on? I know no job is perfect, and there's always going to be bad days and bad people to work with, but I think I can do a little better than the rut I’m in now. So please save the negativity and criticism I see so much on here, I’m really facing a daunting life change.


**tl;dr** - Spent six years wanting to be a Graphic Designer, but no longer feel the same. Now I don't know what I want to be when I grow up, and I graduate in four months and want to hit the ground running. What do I do with all my experience? 

***update*** -  I appreciate all the outpouring of support, I really do, but I would like to discuss more alternatives to a career in design. I know my employers suck and that it's not all like that, and that I just need to find inspiration to keep me going. I just don't feel like this is the right path for me, but I don't want to waste all the time and money I sank into school and jobs

***Update 02/07/2013***
*Apparently people are still finding this, so I'm posting my latest response to user clydefrogforever which I think wraps up this post:*

Wow, I'm surprised people are still finding and replying to this.

Thanks for all the support and kind words, but as you can probably see from the rest of the post I've made up my mind. Recent developments since this post have been that I did graduate and had to resign my position as the Marketing Intern since I'm no longer a student. I've spent 2 months job searching and living off savings. I applied for many positions, mostly marketing but a few design positions as well. The design positions were more light work, such as doing book layout and cover illustration, real easy stuff.

I received nothing besides ""we regret to inform you"" messages, had a grand total of three portfolio views, granted my portfolio was thrown together and doesn't have nearly enough examples which is completely my fault. There's no market in my area, and my state (New Mexico) is ranked among the highest for unemployment, and ranks lowest in new job creation. I've applied to jobs in other states but with no luck because I figure most are trying to hire local and quickly. I also have the added disadvantage of looking like some 21-22 yr old kid who just graduated, because I indeed did just graduate. What doesn't carry through is that I'm 27, which may not seem like a big deal but it can work in my advantage that I'm older and possibly have more experience than a typical recent grad, and indeed I do have more experience than most of my graduating class in the same fields.

**End of story now;** I ran out of savings to live off of and just need to pay bills, so yesterday I interviewed to be a Barista at Starbucks. I figure its pretty much a given job right now because my partner is a well respected employee at the hotel the Starbucks is licensed and housed in. The company is really big on promoting from within and so far just from the interviews I impressed everyone with my knowledge and drive for furthering my career. While this hotel does not have a marketing department due to budget constraints, I hope to work my way into the small amount of marketing they have and eventually move to another hotel that does have a better marketing department.

Is this what I had in mind when I set out to push myself in school? No, not at all. It took some time to realize that this may be the best way to start a career. Start out in the mail room if you catch that old saying. This economy and job market is awful. I had high and unrealistic expectations. My lack of desire to keep designing bled out into a desire to not want to do anything anymore and made my life and dreams crumble. I picked my ass up though and reprioritized what was important. In a few days I'll hopefully have a job, I have a partner who cares for me, friends who care for me, I realized I'm in the same situation as many of my peers and people with much more skill than me. I think if I just work hard, show people what I can do, open my mind to different possibilities as far as a career, then I'll be fine. I'm optimistic about the future, even if its not my dream job.

Sometimes you just need to move on, and maybe that thing you thought you wanted so bad was just getting in the way of something better. ",,False,,t5_2qmtk,1360266295.0,,,True,t3_zekxj,http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/zekxj/career_dilemma_i_dont_want_to_do_graphic_design/,

I'm 23, heading to CalArts as an undergrad transfer, and beating my brain against aesthetic walls to determine whether I ought to continue down the path of painting/printmaking, or my new(er) love, graphic design.  I don't have much experience designing yet, and I recognize it presents an entirely different set of boundaries, challenges, and patronage; but am interested in your opinions.  Is it possible to straddle these divergent fields in one's practice?  Wayne Thiebaud did it; can you think of other artists/designers who can with good conscience say they do both?

Do any of you deal in the traditional media of painting and printmaking or photography, while still holding your own in the design field?

At full time I was making $25 an hour + benefits. I'm guessing I'll get at the most, 20 hours a week and no benefits while freelancing for them. What should I ask for as an hourly rate?

Some details: The job was in the marketing department of a small health system. I have 5+ years of experience in publishing and marketing design. They need me to get them by for a few months until they decide on whether to hire someone else or to start doing all their design out of house. I was the sole provider for my wife and child. We had just moved from 2 hours away about 4 months ago so I could take this job. We took a $12,000 loss from selling our house. We were just about to close on a new house. Now we have to keep living in my in-laws' basement which is 40 miles away from my job. They really fucked me and my family over. So, I need to keep in mind $4.00/gallon gas when negotiating my fee, or demand that I can work from home. I don't want to burn any bridges because this is the only thing I've got going for me. Anyone have advice? I'm pretty desperate for some tips/encouragement. Thanks reddit.

Edit: WOW. Thanks for the great responses. I did not expect so many people to respond, I'm deeply grateful for all of the advice. I think I will ask for double, or close to double my previous hourly rate. And I'll go with giving them the choice of a higher rate for me to come in to the office, or a slightly lower one to stay home. I just got back from hitting the pavement and have a lead on a job at the local newspaper. Not ideal, I know, but it potentially offers benefits and that's most important for my family. If I can land it AND keep the freelance money coming, maybe things wont be so bad.

With the cost of school now, is it worth it to return? If so, do you have any recommendations of schools or how to significantly offset the cost? I've done a bit of research on grants, but didn't immediately see anything that would pertain to me or my situation.

It sounds stupid, I know, but this is a question that is kind of gnawing at me. I work as a web designer at a very large company that I won't mention and my boss and I and the senior designer get along swimmingly. One day at lunch we discussed hiring people and jobs and whatnot, and my boss (the art director, obviously) started reminiscing about hiring me and other people. And he says to me ""you know why I hired you? You wore a suit to your interview. I never saw that before in all my years interviewing designers.""

I was actually kind of taken aback by that. I mean, I know we as artists aren't the kind to always dress sharp, but I always felt wearing a suit on a job interview was kind of a given. And this man has worked at many, many agencies and done things for many many prominent clients. So for him to say I was the first person he ever saw wear a suit to a design job interview kind of amazes me.

So I ask you, people of Graphic Design subreddit: am I the only one? Did any of you wear suits to your graphic design job interviews? Or did you dress in skinny jeans and a flannel and dress the part of the artist?

This serves two purposes that I think will help this community.

1. It gives new designers a chance to work on what a real creative brief would be. ie: Design a logo around these specs, design a 4x6 double sided postcard etc. so that they could potentially use it in a portfolio if it was good enough to show potential clients. Or, if they just want to see what it would be like to work at a real ad agency. 

2. To get feedback from seasoned designers and to explore their own creativity as well as see what others can pull out of a brief. 

I really really hope this sub takes off and gets active. The first challenge I threw up was a logo design. It will run for two weeks until the sub gets some attention. I hope to have weekly challenges after that. Please please spread the word if you think this is cool or want to participate. The more designers, new and old, the better we can make it.

* A little about me. 12+ years in the industry, have ran my own company as well as worked for several Fortune 500 companies. I still continue to learn daily and find it exciting to flex my creative muscles. I wanted someplace fun to work on quirky non reality typed creative briefs to explore new styles. Figured why not get more people involved.

I am looking for some insight on the future of graphic design and how it can affect my career.

Currently, I am doing in-house design and print production at a print shop. I've been doing this type of work for 6 years now, and now I feel I am at the point where I need to think about choosing how to proceed with my career. I see many paths, and unsure how to proceed. Ideally I want a steady paycheck for a few more years to build some equity before I eventually transition to freelance.

I am a solid print and identity designer. I want to leave the in-house work and go to an agency, however finding a well paying job is difficult due to the print industry's slow decline and my lack of agency experience. I have been actively looking for 2 months with no luck, and it could be a while before I find something. This is what I would be best at right now.

I have the option to go freelance, but I am a bit nervous to make the jump to it without obtaining a nice monetary cushion, and I feel I don't quite have enough experience to be effective. I have read that making the leap is safer with 6 month's living expense saved up, but that will take some time (6 months living expense in San Francisco, yikes). This is what I eventually want to do with my career, I just feel I should get more experience before I do so.

I also see the growing trend of UI/UX designers, and while I have no experience with that field I feel I could develop into a solid designer in that as well. I enjoy smartphone/tablet app design and would prefer to do this sort of UI work, but I know that web UI is big as well. The major roadblock is coding experience, for which I have very little except a rudimentary understanding of HTML and CSS.

So this is my question: Should I do what I do best right now and stick with print, knowing that the industry is going downhill? Do I save up my money and make the leap to freelance? Do I keep my job and train to make a career change into UI/UX, knowing it may take several months/year to get skilled enough for a position?

Literally everything I make I think looks amateur and ugly, which causes me to doubt my ability. I doubt when I get a positive critique because I think my classmates are just trying to be nice (because they actually do this to some people, which is counter productive imo.)

I'll generally submit some light precedents to return a description of their brand/website/logo but occasionally you're hit with a circumstance and (or a clientsfromhell) situation where you don't wish to pursue the work e.g. the client wants to go in a direction that you, as a designer, would be feel uncomfortable with to pursue.

I know of lot of my friends who work in this industry use the whole, 'just don't email them back' scenario as they often lack the 'business end' of communicating with clients but I think that's really unprofessional as any potential client deserves from sort of closure, regardless if you think it's going to be one of *those* projects.

The way I generally respond is by avoiding the exact reasons why unless they pertinently ask for them e.g. ""e.g. Dear (x), unfortunately I don't think I will be able to deliver the direction you are looking for. Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you and I wish you the best with your project."" I might occasionally recommend another designer for them to pursue.

I know some designers will be willing to take on any work, but I think if the circumstances permit, we really need to take a step back and be able to dismiss projects instead of keeping them on an [monetary] pedestal. Quality or quantity as they say. Just wondering if any fellow designers had any insight on how to let go of a project professionally.

[Links inside],27,6,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/bgquo/what_do_i_charge_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/,"For those of you starting out in graphic design, i'm sure you groan at the very sight of this topic. If there's anyone on here who has built up their own business in graphic design, but is not a business person, I'm sure you are familiar with that ""what do i charge?"" feeling. I've just had to re-examine my pricing after my last year in business and I've found these articles useful.

After stepping up from freelance, I found the biggest change for me was how I approached pricing. There's a couple of things you kinda  *have to* do: [this formula](http://www.davidairey.com/design-pricing-formula/) or one of [the other formulae](http://www.positivespaceblog.com/archives/what-you-should-charge-why-you-should-stick-your-price/). - Since moving up from freelance I've found that no matter how you charge, you need to do these, just to roughly know if you're covering costs.  

The other thing is deciding if you are a [""by the hour""](http://www.myintervals.com/blog/2008/03/04/7-reasons-you-should-charge-by-the-hour/) designer or a [""by the project""](http://www.wakeuplater.com/freelance-lessons/when-to-use-project-pricing.aspx) kinda designer. [Both have their merits](http://freelanceswitch.com/money/trading-the-hourly-rate-for-task-based-pay-should-you-do-it/), but after much re-examining of my prices in the past week - due to taking on big clients and a shit-ton more responsibility - I realised that the main thing is *only* that you [**charge enough first!**](http://vandelaydesign.com/blog/marketing/12-realities-of-pricing-web-design-services/) and [present your pricing well](http://blog.nerdburn.com/entries/tips-for-freelancers/sample-web-design-contract-budget-timeline-proposal). After looking through all the links and reflecting on my time in a studio, as a freelancer and in my business, I found that the 12 realities of pricing web design is the one that most rang true.  
  
I now see nearly all my freelance clients as having actually been tire-kickers, and the only essential difference between then and now, is I refuse to humour them anymore and do good work for my good clients. I find I still do more work than my clients pay me for sometimes, but now I think of it as a finder's fee as big design business is largely through word of mouth.  
  
Also, remember with word of mouth - cowboys will only refer you to cowboys, good clients will refer you to good clients.
