1353350780.0,3999,self.talesfromtechsupport,13gnjm,Providing tech support to telemarketers for fun and justice.,5201,1202,640,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/13gnjm/providing_tech_support_to_telemarketers_for_fun/,"Like most sane individuals, I am on my countries national do not call list. Unfortunately, a few less than scrupulous companies didn't get the memo. This is the story of how I provided ""tech support"" to one in particular.

For the past few months I have been receiving calls from telemarketers asking if I want %voiceSpammer%'s services. The first few times I politely told them to respect the do not call list and do not call again. When they kept on ignoring that I figured it was time to use my VOIP support abilities for some fun.

So one evening, I was hanging out with my family, raising my kids and such, when I hear my phone politely inform me that there is a long distance call coming in. Looking at the caller ID, I see the number of someone who legally should not be calling me. Being slightly bored I answered and prepared to have some fun.
This telemarketing company gave away alot of information about it's system within the first few seconds of a call. By having 5 seconds of silence followed by the unmistakable default [asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org/) Conference join sound, I already know what software they are running, how they manage their agent queue and quite a few ways to forcefully ask them to not call again.

Once I heard the conference connect beep I have to work quickly to set my trap, hoping that they would take the bait.

 
 
me: ""Tech support, can I have your agent # please""

Spammer: ""........ Um hello, I'm calling from %company% and""

me: ""I'm going to stop you there. Your system has detected that there is a issue with your workstation and has automatically sent you through to tech support. Can I have your agent ID please""

Confused spammer: ""Is this Mr Psychotc I'm speaking with""

Me: ""No, your system is still displaying the last expected connection on the screen, however you have been connected to tech support due to the issue which your system detected. Can I have your agent ID so I can help you with this?"" *I'm obviously making a guess about what type of setup they might have, hoping that I'm close enough to completely lure the prey into the trap*

Sheep: ""Oh, ok, my id is %probably a default setup value incremented by the number of agents%

Me: ""Ok, thank you now I just need some info while I pull up your system. Can you take a quick look at your phone? Does it say ""polycom"" on the front?""

Sheep: ""Yes""

Me: "" Ok, I'm showing a potential issue with your phone. I need you to run a diagnostic on the phone. Can you let me know when you are ready?""

Sheep on the ramp to the abattoir: ""Ok, what do I have to do?""

Me: ""Ok, on your phone I need you to press 4, 6, 8 and * at the same time, let me know when you are done

Sheep: ""Ok, it's asking for a password""

Me: *hoping their voip admin left things at default* ""Ok, now enter 456 as the password then press the button marked enter.""

Mutton: *unjoin conference sound*
 
 

And it has been a few months since I last heard from them.

Some technical details for those who do not work with VOIP and polycom products. The sequence above is the reload firmware and reset to factory defaults hotkey and the default password to allow the reload. Most polycom phones take about 5-10 minutes to reload the firmware, reboot and reload settings. More if they didn't setup DHCP properly.

**TL,DR:** I know more about your phone system than your company does

1337247273.0,3900,self.talesfromtechsupport,trffn,"It doesn't matter what it costs, please get my data back!",6075,2175,489,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/trffn/it_doesnt_matter_what_it_costs_please_get_my_data/,"I thought I'd share one of my proudest moments as a bench tech.  I suspect most of us who are interested in this type of work frequently encounter customers with lost data.  Usually the issue is resolved with a simple undelete application, of which there are many.  Sometimes we have to roll up our sleeves and image the disk and attempt to recover readable files.  No matter the method, it's the best feeling in the world to be able to call the customer and tell then you did recover their wedding pictures or important school work.  The look on their faces when they come in to pick up the freshly burned DVD with their critical data makes you forget all the mouthbreathers with their insect ridden e-machines (almost). 
 
But then there's that feeling you get in the pit of your stomach when you plug in the customer's PC and hear the ""click BANG"" or ""BOING whirllllll"" of a failed HDD while the BIOS reports no bootable drive.  You have to look them in the eye and tell them you are already 99% sure the drive is dead and there is nothing you can do about it.  You hand them the little card with the number to DriveSavers or similar professional data recovery and warn them it's going to cost a lot of money.  You are kind enough not to scold them about their lack of a backup, that would only cause pain now.  They already know. 
 
Flash back to 2007.  One morning I get to the shop to find a customer standing outside the front door with one of those ubiquitous claim-shell Dell PCs under an arm.  The look in his eyes alone tells me all I really need to know about the situation.  I tell him to come in and put the PC on the counter.  We exchange niceties as I plug in the monitor and keyboard and turn it on. 
 
We encounter the message he told me to expect, the PC can't find a bootable drive.  I open it up to make sure everything is plugged in and notice the drive is not spinning.  Not good, but there could be an innocent answer.  I pull the drive and try it out with a known good power supply.  Unfortunately with the same result. 
 
I tell him ""(Customer), it seems you have a failed hard drive.  Since it won't spin up I can't really help you.""  His exact words: ""It doesn't matter what it costs, please get my data back!""  It turns out this guy is an office manager at a local veterinary practice.  It must be a fairly big organization as they employ about 10 vets and about 40 other folks including cleaning staff, etc.  This PC under his arm contains the entirety of their accounting everything.  Payroll, tax stuff, accounts receivable, everything.  He explains that they will go out of business if they can't get the data on that drive. 
 
I let him know that data recovery from a failed drive takes specialized skills and resources, neither of which we have in this mom 'n pop computer repair outfit.  I give him the DriveSavers card and tell him to be prepared for a bill in the $1000's if they are successful at all.  Considering the importance of his data I thought it was a no-brainer to go this route.  $2000 is nothing to a medical office likely billing out over a million dollars each year.
 
Well, I would not be writing this if the dude had any sense. 
 
He's like: ""$2000 for data recovery?  And it might take weeks?  I don't know... Can't you do it?""  I tell him the truth:  If I try to recover his data and fail there is a huge chance I'll make it worse and less likely for a professional data recovery specialist to get it.  He really needs to go to the specialist.  Yet despite this, he continues to talk me into it telling me they can't possibly go weeks without this PC.  They need their data by tomorrow for tax reasons. 
 
So I told him to give me his number and I'd do some research and get back to him.  I call in my fellow nerds and we research (our Google-Fu was strong that day).  We end up with a list of about 8 or so things to try to order them by risk.  We even manage to find two of the same model drives from the junkyard downstairs to look at.  By early afternoon I think we've learned what we can and I call the customer. 
 
I tell him I'll try it, but it's foolish.  He describes an office in pure chaos and says they are willing to take the risk.  I tell him I'm going to charge $75 / hour for my time successful or not, to which he agrees.  I also tell him to bring in any other Dells they purchased as the same time as the broken one as I want more drives from the same batch if possible.  My boss prints out a unique addendum to our usual waver all customers sign, something to protect us from the consequences of potentially (likely) destroying this data and the other PC drives as well. 
 
Guy shows up 15 minutes later with sweat on his brow and three more clam-shell Dells.  We're lucky, the serial numbers on these drives are close enough be the same batch as the broken one.  These are a better match than the drives we already found.  So we now have the one failed drive and three good ones.   I go shopping to pick up items needed for the potential data recovery methods.  I purchase some dry ice, a couple of torque bits and eyeglass screwdriver to fit, ziplock bags, and microfiber gloves from a photography shop.  I try to make arrangements with a buddy who works in a chip fabrication plant to use their clean room if needed.  That was impossible but he was able to get me a couple of those dust free bunny suits and face masks.  Unfortunately they were pink.  But this was war so I did not complain. 
 
The first thing I try is swapping the PCB between a good drive and the failed one.  The good drive works fine with the failed drive's PCB, but the opposite is not true.  Next we tried putting the drive in a USB enclosure and plastic bags and cooling the drive with the dry ice.  After 1/2 hour we tried again, again without success.  I then tried powering the drive and kinda spinning it back and forth hoping to jump start the motor (or something?).  Needless to say that was not working.  We needed to open the drive up and see what secrets might be inside.  We took apart one of the three good drives to see if it was even possible to do a platter swap.  I've taken apart many drives and knew the most difficult part would be not damaging the heads.  Sometimes you have to remove the arms holding the heads to even get the platter out.  But luck was on our side!  The arm in these particular drives could be pushed down and would not get in the way when we pulled the platters!  Even better they smoothly went back onto the platters without hanging when you carefully pushed it back.
 
I dawned the bunny suit, much to the delight of the other nerds, and took the drive and tools into the bathroom.  I set an audiobook playing and started scrubbing wall to ceiling with wet rags to collect all the dust I could.  I taped over the air vent and along the door frame.  Then I collected hot water into a trash can and added the dry ice.  That much dry ice in that small room made quite a bit of fog which supposedly helps bring any dust out of the air.  I don't know if this actually works, but I was concerned about adding that much CO2 into a small sealed room.  I made it a point to hold my breath if I was reaching down to the floor.  After the fog was gone I noticed no ill effects and proceeded to phase 3. 
 
The actual platter swap went without incident and hardly warrants description in this story.  Just a few screws and aluminum spacer rings.  I just tried to line up the two platters so they were aligned the same way relative to each other in the new case.  Obviously I could not get nearly the same level of precision at the physical scale of the data on the drive, but I did the best I could. 
 
We held our breath while we booted up the bench PC with a Linux data recovery live CD.  It found the drive!  I started to read an image from the drive, which seemed to work fine.  I did a typical data recovery on the image and I FOUND FILES!!!  I actually recovered that data!  The customer was thrilled and didn't blink an eye at the bill (something like $700) or the fact we destroyed the other drives in the other PCs.  I even got a $100 tip for risking O2 deprivation and the ridicule of my peers. That evening we had pizza and Mountain Dew paid for out of the register.  I kicked butt at Counter Strike.

I get this call at about 2am. It's a woman, fairly young (early 20s maybe), and she can't get on the internet. She is getting connected to her router wired and wirelessly, but no internet. 

I walk her through some standard steps, but the router is still acting kind of funky, plus I think she had Comcast (we had a lot of trouble with them). 

Finally, in the troubleshooting steps, we get to the point where doing a manual reset on her router is the next best step before just replacing it. 

So I told her to pick it up, turn it around, find that small, recessed button on the back left, and use a pen to press and hold that for 10 seconds. 

After a brief silence, she asks, ""Where is this hole again?""

""On the back of your &lt;brand&gt; router, where you plug the cables in, it's on the far left.""

""Hmm, I don't see it back here...""

I'd done this many, many times before, and I knew the mistakes customers usually made, so I said, ""Move your left thumb, you have it over the hole.""

""Oh!...I'll be right back."" 

The phone click-clacks as it hits the desk, and the pattering of feet walking off in the distance can be heard. 

About 30 seconds later, the footsteps are back and getting closer. Then she picks the phone up again. 

She says, ""Ok whew, I'm ready now. I just had to put a robe on, I didn't know you had cameras on these things. Sorry for the free show.""",,False,,t5_2sfg5,False,,,True,t3_wc6gr,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/wc6gr/i_just_had_to_put_a_robe_on/,

Circa 2003.  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Week 1 Saturday, calling regarding ridiculous ping to the outside world (400ms+). After 45 minutes of music.  
**Tech 1**: &lt;Speech&gt;  
**Me**: &lt;Account Info&gt;  
**Tech 1**: How can I help you?  
**Me**: I have been having a very high ping to the internet after about 4pm till about 9pm everyday since I got your service installed. I have tried restarting the modem, the router and my computer.  
**Tech 1**: Please restart your computer.  
**Me**: OK. But, I have already done that. [I actually had restarted my computer, but I did it again anyways.]  
**Tech 1**: I understand but we need to make sure that this doesn't fix it.  
**Me**: Well, I get these high pings from all five of my computers, not just the one I am working on right now.  
**Tech 1**: Um, how do you have five computers using the internet?  
**Me**: With my router.  
**Tech 1**: Uh... A what?  
**Me**: A router.  
**Tech 1**: Sir, we don't support non-standard equipment.  
**Me**: Excuse me?  
  
10 more minutes goes by as I disconnect my router, directly connect my computer to the router and power cycle the modem twice such that my PC's mac address would get registered with their system(relevant). The high ping remains and I eventually get the tech to say the magic words:  
  
**Tech 1**: It looks like we are going to have to send out somebody.  
**Me**: Thank You.  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Next Monday the tech arrives and we go down to the drop. I had not been present for the installation. The drop was in a locked basement inside of a locked cabinet, both of which will be relevant later. The /r/CableFail was truly astonishing. The single RG6 line that came in from the street was split 48 times. None of the lines were labeled. There were 9 splitters involved. We spent the first 15 minutes yelling at each-other, 4th floor window to exterior basement door, to figure out which line was mine through the process of disconnecting one connection at a time. Mine ended up being the forth split down. RJ6-&gt;6Way-&gt;4Way-&gt;3Way-&gt;3Way-&gt; Me, which I had split again with a 2Way. One for cable, one for internet.  
  
**Me**: Well, what can we do about it?  
**OnSite Tech 1**: I dont know.  
**Me**: It works in the morning and late at night.  
**OnSite Tech 1**: It is probably because when people get home in the evening they turn on their tv/internet and you are getting interference.  
**Me**: So, what can we do about it?  
  
The OnSite Tech closes and locks the cabinet.  
  
**OnSite Tech 1**: Nothing. It is a wiring issue on the premises. We are not responsible. Talk to your landlord.  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
My landlord was more or less a slum lord (Oakland). The building was falling apart and was in serious need of repair. The landlord, to put it mildly, didn't care. I was frustrated. By the time I got done playing phone tag with my worthless piece of shit of a landlord I had decided that I needed to talk to Comcast again.  
  
Week 3, Thursday. Still have a ping of 400ms. After 30 Minutes of elevator music. 2:00pm.  
**Tech 2**: &lt;Intro&gt; What can I help you with?  
**Me**: I have had a very high ping to the outside world between the hours of 4pm till 9pm rendering my Internet unusable. I am interested in obtaining a partial refund for the time.  
**Tech 2**: I am sorry to hear that sir. Would you please reboot your computer?  
**Me**: This is not an issue with my computer. Comcast does not have a large enough drop for the apartment building I am in.  
**Tech 2**: I am sorry to hear that sir. We need to go through these basic troubleshooting steps to see if we can alleviate the issue.  
  
For the next twenty minutes I play repair man. Eventually the tech once again says the magic words.  
  
**Me**: Can I schedule the tech to come between 4pm and 9pm?  
**Tech 2**: Very well sir. You will have to wait until next Thursday if that is the time slot you want.  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Week 4, Thursday. OnSite Tech 2 arrives around 4:30pm. Perfect. After explaining the issue and what the last tech had said he checked the signal in my apartment.  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Lets go look at the box downstairs.  
After unlocking the basement and the cabinet he lets out a low whistle.  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Which one is yours?  
**Me**: This one.   
I point at the line that goes to my apartment.  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Alright, so here is the issue. You have way too many splitters between your line and the drop coming in. I am going to replace the ends on your line to ensure we can get the best possible connection and then I am going to check the pole. We can run a new drop but that could take up to six months.  
  
At this point the tech looks at me.  
  
**OnSite Tech 2**: I am not allowed to reorder these splitters because they are the owners property and other customers utilize these lines.  
  
And now I realize he is staring deep into my soul.  
  
**OnSite Tech 2**: The customers with these [things](http://www.cabletechtalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/trap_filter-300x182.jpg). Do not have internet and only subscribe to basic TV.  
  
Here he gestures to several of the lines. He lets his hand come to rest on a filtered line. I blink. It is connected directly to the first splitter.  
  
**OnSite Tech 2**: They require much less signal. It is going to take me 5 minutes with my 7/16 wrench and crimps to replace this tip. Then I will be on the pole for twenty minutes. Then I will come back to your apartment to check your signal again. I am sorry but I am **NOT** fixing this for you. I simply **can't**.  
  
I blink again. Twice actually. The tech turns his back on me and starts removing my line from the splitter to replace the tip. I back out the basement door and bolt upstairs. I pull out my wrench set and grab my 7/16. I run back downstairs just as the tech leaves the basement. He doesn't close the door. I wait until he walks out the front gate. Inside the basement I find the cabinet is closed but unlocked. Quick, quick, quick I am taking my line and switching it with the filtered line on the first splitter. After everything is tight I close the cabinet and run back upstairs. The tech, true to his word, showed up at my door twenty five minutes after this all started. I had already reset my modem and had a 15ms ping to Google. Success. After testing, my line ran with acceptable numbers.  
  
**OnSite Tech 2**: I am glad that replacing the tip on your line improved the signal to such an extent. I am going to go lock up the cabinet now.  
  
  
And he was gone into the night. I really, honestly, truly wish that this was the last I would have to see him. But it wasn't. No. It can never be simple with Comcast. My connection had improved considerably. A vast majority of the time I was receiving my advertised speed. I could download/upload/torrent to my hearts content. The only problem I had was when I would attempt to connect to a server in Southern California. You see, anytime between roughly 4pm and 9pm I would have a ping of 200+ms to any server south of San Jose. This wouldn't normally be a problem for average web browsing, but I also happen to be a gamer. And for online gamers, latency can be the difference between life and death. How did I know that the problem was in San Jose? Traceroutes. Tons of them. Automatically generated every minute, every hour, every day. The issue appeared to be that the peering between Comcast and Level 3 in San Jose consisted of two 56k modems and smoke signals. Graphs of average latency times over the course of the day showed two bumps. A small one in the morning as people woke up for coffee and internet and a longer one in the evening when people got off of work and decided it was time for a good wanking. I decided to do comparisons with some friends from around the bay area. Apparently Comcast routed everything from the entire Bay Area through that L3 peering arrangement in San Jose. This was confirmed by OnSite Tech 2, the third time I met him.  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Week 7 Friday. 5pm. Cannot ~~play~~ ~~win~~ enjoy any matches due to higher than average pings. 30 Minutes of music.  
**Tech 3**: &lt;Intro&gt; How can I help you?  
**Me**: I have an issue where when I connect to some servers south of San Jose I get high pings and it is difficult to enjoy my games at those pings. It is only during high traffic times and I have the traceroutes that describe the issue.  
**Tech 3**: Will you please restart your computer.  
**Me**: Look, I know what the issue is. It is not with my computer I can demonstrate that it is a problem with Comcast's network.  
**Tech 3**: I am sorry sir, but we must go through these steps to ensure that it is not your equipment. Often times restarting your computer will fix many problems.  
**Me**: I know. I have restarted my computer many times. Trust me. I have traceroutes that identify the issue.  
**Tech 3**: You have what?  
**Me**: Traceroutes.  
**Tech 3**: Uhh... I am going to elevate you to Tier 2.  
15 Minutes of music.  
**Tech 4**: &lt;intro&gt; How can I help you?  
**Me**: &lt;Explains the situation&gt;  
**Tech 4**: Can you please restart your computer.  
**Me**: No. Look. I have traceroutes that identify the issue. &lt;Explains about San Jose&gt;  
**Tech 4**: Sir, after reviewing the network status board it does not appear that there are any issues on our network. This is most likely an issue on your end.  
**Me**: Look, can I send you the traceroutes?  
**Tech 4**: The what?  
**Me**: &lt;Growling&gt; Traceroutes. They show the path that your connection travels between your computer and the server you are attempting to reach.  
**Tech 4**: ... I am going to transfer you to another tech. Please hold.  
30 Seconds of music.  
**Tech 5**: &lt;Intro&gt; How can I help you?  
**Me**: I have traceroutes that identify a connection between the Comcast network and Level 3 in San Jose as the source of an exceptionally high ping that makes it difficult to play games online.  
**Tech 5**: Interesting... I am going to send a tech out to your location to see if it is in relation to your earlier support tickets.  
**Me**: ... I can plainly see that I get a sub 10ms ping to everywhere else in your network before the San Jose hop.  
**Tech 5**: How about Monday at 10am?  
**Me**: ... Really?  
**Tech 5**: Yes.  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Week 8, Monday, 10am. OnSite Tech 2 shows up and smiles at me. I try to tell him everything that is going on.  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Let's go down and look at your line again.  
I am worried he is going to say something about the fact that I moved my line. He opens up the cabinet and smirks.  
**OnSite Tech 2**: I *forgot* which one was your line. Which one is it?  
I identify my moved line. He comments on the fact that it seems to be in an advantageous position and shouldn't be the issue. At this point he says he is going to go up on the pole and do some monitoring. For the next two hours his van sits outside the apartment complex. He comes back and informs me that he will be unable to fix the issue at this time because he cannot identify anything other than the fact that the lines in this area are old and need to be replaced. He said that might happen within the next two to ten years. As he leaves,  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Keep calling.  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
For the next two weeks I call every other day and get the run around. They are refusing to offer to send a tech out because the last report identified no issues. I am not willing to pay the eighty dollars to have a tech come out if I request it. Every time they insist that the network is operating normally and does not have any issues. Finally in the middle of week 11 I get escalated and after what feels like the hundredth time they tell me everything is fine.  
**Me**: THE FUCK IT IS. I CAN PROVE IT ISN'T.  
**Tech #20 something**: I am going to transfer you.  
**Me**: To WHO? Nobody you transfer me to listens to what I have to say or understands what I am telling ...   &lt;Immediately music cuts me off&gt;  
15 minutes of music later Tech 5 answers the phone.  
**Tech 5**: &lt;Intro&gt; How can I help you?  
**Me**: &lt;I attempt to explain everything again&gt;  
**Tech 5**: We are going to send out the field tech again.  
**Me**: Again? This isn't going to fix it.  
**Tech 5**: I know.  
**Me**: What?  
**Tech 5**: After he is done, call this number ###-####.

Week 12, Monday, 4pm. OnSite Tech #2 shows up. We talk. He goes up on the pole. He sits in his van. He wanders around the neighborhood and checks various other drops. Eventually he comes back to my door.  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Were oversold.  
**Me**: How much?  
**OnSite Tech 2**: All of it.  
**Me**: What?  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Bay Area. All of it. Six months until the money people will even talk about buying more bandwidth.  
**Me**: Six months?  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Yup.  
**Me**: Why, when it impacts everyone?  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Most people never notice. Most people don't care.  
**Me**: What can I do about it?  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Keep calling.  
**Me**: Why?  
**OnSite Tech 2**: They only spend money to fix things if there are enough calls logged about an issue.  
  
  
The number Tech 5 gave to me turned out to be the number to his line. For the next two months I would call him every week and OnSite Tech 2 would come out and sit in his van for two to three hours. Then one day the call went a little differently.  
  
**Tech 5**: &lt;Intro&gt;. How may I help you.  
**Me**: I am still having the same problem with the high latency out of San Jose.  
**Tech 5**: I am **not** going to help you with this.  
**Me**: Excuse me?  
**Tech 5**: The network is *working* as it is *intended*.  
**Me**: Uh...  
**Tech 5**: We do not officially support 3rd party devices like your router. &lt;He has never brought this up before&gt;
**Me**: Um... Why not? &lt;Getting suspicious&gt;  
**Tech 5**: 3rd Party Devices like yours are able to change their mac addresses and we need to know that your mac address will not change to verify that you are the correct customer. &lt;This is obviously bullshit... but why?&gt;  
**Me**: I don't understand, but ok... What should I do about this issue with .. &lt;he cuts me off&gt;  
**Tech 5**: I am **not** going to do anything to address this. The network is working as *intended*. &lt;Someone must be listening into the conversation.&gt;  
**Me**: Ok.  
**Tech 5**: Please call the help line at 1-800-###-#### if your issues persist. &lt;And the line goes dead. Not like he hung up, just dead.&gt;  
  
10 to 15 seconds later there is a dial-tone. I check my traceroute logs. Just about 30 minutes before my call I see that my connection is no longer being routed through San Jose. I have 10-30ms pings to every server I can try.  
  
  
tl;dr ISP's are corporations driven by greed but there are always technicians at these institutions who know what they are doing. They know the situation is fucked up. They know the ridiculousness of the problem. Sometimes a problem is a problem because of the poor ethics of the people in the suits. Sometimes good techs have to work at scummy corporations to feed their families&lt;I intentionally left this out for anonymity purposes&gt;.

My average-handle-time numbers were never very good, and I was constantly being told to bring my call times down from the 20-or-so minute mark to under 16 (as per the service agreement with said corporation). 


While most of my co-workers had no problem dumping their callers as soon as possible (earning a big pat on the back from the floor managers) I was not able to just push my clients back into the endless cycle of 40+ minute wait times. My first-call resolution rate of 90% or better, however, was always at the top of the chart. Nobody gave a rat's ass about that, though.


For anyone that has been in my shoes, you'll agree that trying to actually *fix* a problem in under 16 minutes is pretty difficult. Add the fact that most customers vent on you for about 10 minutes before you can start to help them and there isn't much that you can do if you are in the business of actually supporting the system. So, I made the decision to ignore my AHT (as much as the managers would let me) and just try to fix everything as quickly as I could. There were times when they would just hover and stare at me if they saw that my timer was over.


One particular day, I end up on a call with a nice elderly woman. She was 75 and had received her computer as a Christmas gift from her son, who had put the service account in her name. What her son neglected to do, however, was get her a warranty that included service to go along with her replacement parts. 


In scrolling through the log of her ordeal with our ""technicians"", I find  that I am her 16^th call to support in 2 days. She had originally called to ask about error messages that she was receiving and had been taken through driver/app re-installations, system restore, the dreaded 6-call format/re-install (Windows ME, no less), and finally a motherboard replacement. How she was not filled with rage and fury is still beyond me.


Instead of the profanity-laced tirade that I had come to expect, Muriel was very pleasant. 


""I just received your parcel and I am ready to go!""


It took a moment for it to sink in, but it wasn't long before the realization hit. I had to walk this lady through a motherboard install.


While it occurred to me that most of my co-workers would have gone as far as to just dump the call by hitting the RELEASE button on their phone, I felt obligated to put an end to this saga. 


""Muriel, we are going to need a Phillips screw-driver for this. Do you have one handy?"" 


""I have one right here!""


She was ready to rock. While she was waiting in the queue, she had managed to unhook all of the external cables and get the case onto her dining room table. I opened my 3^rd extra-large triple-triple of the shift. It was on. 


She followed every instruction with precision and passion, as if she had been preparing all her life for this moment. I could hear her grunting and occasionally cursing under her breath as her crooked old fingers fumbled for dropped screws in the bottom of the case. 


I could mark the end of most steps with the signature ""plunk"" of a card or cable being pried free of its slot. Others she would confirm with a simple ""OK, got it! What's next?"" When the PCI cards went back in I would add ""Make sure it's seated nice and securely!"" to her refrain ""It's in there!"" 


45 minutes later, the tower was back under the desk for the first of what I figured would be many attempts at getting the system to fire up. The managers were circling nervously, trying their best to signal me to finish the call. I smiled and waved.


""OK Muriel, let's try the power button. Be sure to let me know what you see on the screen."" I listened closely and prepared to count the POST beeps. 


One beep.


""What do you see Muriel?"" 


""There was some white writing on a black screen but now it says WINDOWS ME.""


""That's a great sign! Is the light on the floppy drive lit?"" In the thousands of times I had re-seated a floppy cable, my success rate at getting it the right side up the first time had to have been less than 10%. 


""It was for a second, but it's off now."" 


*Windows_startup_music.wav*


One boot. Impossible! 


I had her look through the device manager for conflicts/""bangs"" for which there were none. I had her launch her office applications and open a few of her documents without any issues. Play an audio CD? Check! I even went as far as to have her test her internet connection (AOL dial-up) which required I call her back. No problems there either.


I was in awe. We had just completed an entire motherboard replacement with 100% accuracy in 45 minutes. Sometimes it would take users 15 minutes to find the My Computer icon. ""Muriel, this has been the single greatest call I have ever been a part of. You can now tell your friends that you have assembled a computer from scratch.""


She cackled. ""I had a lot of fun, but I hope you don't take it the wrong way when I say that I hope to never have to speak to any of you ever again."" 


**tl;dr: I walked an old lady through a motherboard replacement in 45 minutes.**

edit: You guys are awesome. I am truly humbled.

We did 1st and 2nd line helpdesk work in our respective native languages. Our teamleader, BBBBB (for big bad badass bastard boss), did not speak our language, so he was useless for day-to-day operations, but man, was he ever godsent for handling the internal troubles.

The man was in his 40s, fat, short, red-haired and bearded. He was so cynical that he could make vestal virgins cry. He was blunt, honest, straightforward and called bullshit when he saw and heard it. Naturally, the management hated him. He had, however, saved their collective arses more than once, and with his complete disregard for their opinions on him, his knowledge and experience, they could not get rid of him. He also had the smoothest silk tounge I have ever seen from a tech guy. Small, ugly and fat and balding, he still chatted up the most beautiful girls on account of his tounge and being the most confident bastard ever.

I still aspire to be like him (not completely, but in many things) and I learned a lot from him.

Here are some war stories from the 18 months I spent at that god-forsaken place.

**Team meeting.**

BBBBB brings up a powerpoint presentation with lots of animations, sound, colours and short snippets of text.

BBBBB: ""Whoops, sorry. That was the presentation for management.""

BBBBB brings up another presentation with lots of text and acronyms.

Me: ""You have a different presentation on the account for management?""

BBBBB: ""Yes, you have to. Management is retarded. Consider them drooling sheep to be herded in the right direction. And if they get this presentation, they go 'Oooh, pretty colours!' and I can get what I want. If I show them your presentation, they'll get bored and annoyed that they don't understand and decide against what I reccomend out of spite.""

**Doorwatcher**

Collegue: ""Hey, do you know that your boss is staring at a door?""

Me: ""What?""

Collegue: ""Yeah, he has spent at least 10 minutes just staring at a door.""

Me: ""Really? He must be waiting for someone.""

Collegue: ""He's standing a metre away from it, staring at it.""

Me: ""I am sure there's some explenation...""

Collegue: ""Who knows. Ask him when he comes back. Anyway, I have work to do. See you.""

Another 15 minutes pass, and then BBBBB shows up.

BBBBB: ""Hi [vonadler]. What's up?""

Me: ""Trying to get a hold of customers that wont answer their phones, as usual. What about you?""

BBBBB: ""I just spent 45 minutes staring at door.""

Me: ""What? Why?""

BBBBB: ""I wanted to talk to the manager inside. I knocked, he told me off, saying 'I'M BUSY!!!"", so I waited outside until he came out, pointed at him and said, 'Now you're not busy, now we deal with this.' Poor guy probably just wanted to use the loo.""

Me: ""..."".

**Stealing our own equipment.**

We worked 2nd line helpdesk, and as a part of our instructions, we were to have dual screens, one to remote take over the customer's system on, one to have our own systems on (this was standard on all help desks, even 1st line in our native country, but not where we were working now). We got brand new flatscreens to replace our CRT screens (in 2005!) with and started fighting about the graphics cards. BBBBB thought we could just open the computers and put in a new one (stationary ones, so it was easy). Asset management threatened that we would lose support. We said, hey, we are 2nd line windows support, we can support our own computers. Asset management then said we would void any hardware warranty if we opened the computers. So that was that. Instead, we purchased silly expensive crappy USB graphics cards (at least 20 times the cost of a basic graphics card capable of having two screens) and stashed them in our lockable drawers, waiting for our second flatscreen. And waited, and waited.

After several months, BBBBB went more or less ballistic. New equipment was arriving every week, but we did not get anything of it. Instead, it was used to replace old CRT screens at the sales department.

So, he went after a manager about it.

BBBBB: ""So when is my team getting their second screens.""

Manager: ""Well, we have other needs to prioritise right now.""

BBBBB: ""So, you are saying we are not getting them?""

Manager: ""It has worked fine for two months already, has it not? I don't think you really need them.""

BBBBB: ""We have the budget for it.""

Manager: ""Well, going under budget is a good thing.""

BBBBB comes back, furious, and hatches a plan. Using his silk tounge, he chats up the girl in the reception and gets her to agree to call him before she calls asset management next time there's a delivery.

BBBBB: ""Come on you vikings. Time for pillage and plunder. Follow me!""

Me: ""What? What are we doing?""

BBBBB: ""You shame your forefathers - I would have said pillage and they would have had their axes out. We're stealing our second screens, of course.""

Me: ""Very well.""

So, we went there, took screens off the pile of delivered equipment and ran back with them. As we are unpacking them, the manager comes running.

Manager: ""What are you doing!?""

BBBBB: ""Installing our second screen.""

Manager: ""You have not been assigned this equipment!""

BBBBB: ""Oh, I did not know that. Well, we have the budget for it, so you can just order some more screens, right? No harm done.""

Fighting BBBBB over this, when the screens were already in place, he had registered them in the asset management system, they were in operation and we had the budget was too much for management, so we got to keep the screens.

**Tolling, it tolls for thee.**

The country we were working in used the euro, and we all got lots and lots and lots of useless 1 and 2 eurocent copper coins (commonly called brownies) and change everytime we bought something. I managed to use most of mine when I was riding the bus. You could only use 5 eurocent and bigger in the softdrink machine, so the smaller ones were useless, and lots of people assembled large amounts of them. So, for fun and giggles, we started paying roadtolls to each other as we passed each others' desks. Basically just dumping whatever brownies you had at hand when you passed, to the curses of the one sitting there.

Then a poor guy went back home for an extended weekend, came back and found his desk COVERED in brownies. Most of the building had seen them accumulating on his desk, and took the opportunity to dump their change there as well. There were easily 1000-2000 coins on his desk. He sighed and cursed a bit when he got back.

Then he got a really slow case - some of the users on his account wre local admins, and now and then they would get a case with a computer completely filled with spyware and malware. He told the user to go home after lunch, connected to his computer and started the cleanup. Being bored just watching the status bar millimetring its way through the cleanup, he started sorting, piling and pyramiding the coins on his desk. After a while BBBBB passes by, sees on the screen that he is working, nods and keeps walking. After a short while, he returns and points to a small pyramid of coins.

BBBBB: ""That is one euro, isn't it?""

Collegue: ""Yeah, why?""

BBBBB throws a 5-euro bill on the desks and proceeds to rake in five piles of coins with a devilish smile.

Collegue: ""Nice. But what are you doing with the coins?""

BBBBB: ""The girls at the cafeteria fucked with me yesterday. I'm going for a coffee.""

**Learning well.**

Me and BBBBB are part of a documentation group. Management recently changed the document standard for no real reason at all, so we need to lift everything we've done to the new format. Manually, as they don't provide any kind of automatisation with the new format.

BBBBB: ""Management. I swear to god, if I could see their inbred genepool...""

Me: ""They don't have a genepool. They have a cesspool.""

BBBBB: ""...""

Me: ""What?""

BBBBB: ""I have taught you well, young padawan.""

**Exactly what we want.**

A team meeting discussing the latest ideas of re-organisation from management, trying to mitigate the disaster it would bring.

BBBBB: ""...alright, then we have a good plan.""

Collegue: ""Yeah, then we get EXACTLY what we want!""

Me: ""Salma Hayek covered in honey?""

Collegue: ""No, I..."" he goes silent for a second, thinks, and then breaks up in a big smile. ""Yeah!""

BBBBB: ""I really like how you think, [vonadler]. Let me google that. Ooooh.""

**Wow, that is WoW**

We also had a software distribution team that was over-staffed due to organisational changes. It also continued to work together with the team in the home country for several months, since they had a long notice time. So, there was work for 3 people, and there were 8 persons doing it. One of the guys at our place got bored, got a new job and gave his 4 week's notice. Since there were so little work, and the other 3 guys were not fully trained yet (as they got too little work to do to properly train), he and them agreed that he would not do any work for the 4 weeks' notice time. So he installed world of warcraft on his machine and sat there playing for 4 weeks.

BBBBB, who knows the situation, walks by and spots the collegue playing WoW.

BBBBB: ""What are you doing?""

Collegue: ""Playing WoW.""

BBBBB: ""What level are you?""

Collegue: ""32.""

BBBBB: ""Haha, I am better than you.""

He then proceeds to walk off.

(Man it took a long time to write this up.) Sorry for the wall of text.

After working hard setting up the Cub Scout summer camp I work at seasonally, I come back home and unpack my stuff. About ten minutes later, the house phone rings. It's never a good sign when the house phone rings -- I only hand out my landline to services and such who need it, like my ISP (who handles my landline) and bank and so on. So, I pick up my phone with an ounce of dread.

""Hello, this is aveilleux, can I help you?"" (Old retail/support habits are hard to kick)

(Thick Indian accent) ""Yes, hello, is this Mister &amp;lt;my first name&gt;?""

""Yes, this is he. To whom am I speaking?""

""This is... Jason... from Microsoft Support. We were doing a routine scan of networks in your area and noticed that your computer may be vulnerable to viruses and other malware.""

At this point, my sense of foreboding instantly turns into a shining beacon of glee. I'd read about these kinds of scams before, and had prepared an unpatched Windows 2000 (yes, *that* Windows 2000) virtual machine for such an occasion.

""Oh, that sounds serious. Is there something I can do to help?""

""Yes, thank you Mister aveilleux. Are you in front of your computer now?""

""No, but I can be in a moment. Hang on a second, please.""

I set the phone down on my desk and stand up, stepping loudly on the uncarpeted section of my floor. After a few minutes and some Facebooking on my cell phone later, I take a seat again.

""Okay, Jason, I'm at my PC. What now?""

""Is your computer on?""

""I'm sorry?""

(Louder, with more enunciation) ""Is... your... computer... on?""

""Oh, is it on? I don't think so. Lemme just find the power switch real quick...""

I set the phone down again and start rustling things around on my desk, knocking my cup of pens over and yelling ""Oh, shit!"" and so on. I muck about for another minute or so, before launching Virtualbox and starting up my 2k VM.

""Okay, it says 'M... My-krow-sssssoft. Winnnndowssssss. Two thousand. Pr... Pro-pr. Proffesssshhhionalll.' Oh, shit, it's gone away. Oh, wait, here's my computer now."" (Referring to my desktop.) ""Okay, it's all booted up. What now?""

There's a pause where I think ""Jason"" didn't realize he was still muted, probably talking smack about me to a coworker.

""Jason? You there?""

""Yes, sorry aveilleux. Now, in the corner of your keyboard, in the bottom-left, is there a key with a little flag on it?""

""...Keyboard?""

""Yes, your keyboard.""

""What's a keyboard?""

I can hear the facepalm. ""The device attached to your computer that you use to type, aveilleux. That is your keyboard.""

I start banging things around on my desk again. ""Sorry, I think I've lost it under all the shit on my desk, give me a second..."" I crinkle a wrapper in the trash bin and rustle around a bit. ""Alright, I've uncovered the thing I type with... the keyboard?""

""Yes, aveilleux, the keyboard.""

""Okay. And I'm looking in the bottom-right for a key that looks like a cloverleaf?""

""...No, Mister aveilleux, look in the bottom-left for a key with a little flag on it.""

""A flag?""

""...Let's try this, In the bottom-left of your screen, do you see a button with the word ""Start"" on it?""

""Yes, sir.""

""Click on that, then click 'Run'.""

""Okay, I clicked on it, I'm looking for 'Run'? I see"" (picture the remainder of this sentence stumbling through pronunciation, I don't feel like typing it all out again) ""Set Program Access and Defaults, Windows Update, Programs, Docu--""

""It should be at the bottom, aveilleux.""

""The bottom?""

""Yes, 'Run' will be at the bottom of your Start menu.""

""...Ohhhh! I see it now! Sorry I wasted your time. Okay. I clicked on that. What now?""

""A little box should pop up in the corner. In that box I need you to type in,"" (he spelled this out) ""'eventvwr'. Okay?""

""Okay, I typed in 'event viewer'. Is that good?""

""No, aveilleux. I need you to type it in exactly as I spell it."" He repeats the proper spelling.

""I hit Enter and it said 'Cannot find the file 'event' or any of its components...""

""I need you to go back to the Run box.""

""I'm sorry?""

Go to Start, Run again.""

""But I already did that.""

He sighs. ""Please, Mister aveilleux, I need you to follow my instructions exactly or else your computer could be at risk for viruses from the Internet or other malware.""

""Oh, right, yeah, I'm sorry. Okay, so I have the Run box up again."" (At this point my ignorant facade starts to slip.)

""You've typed in 'eventvwr' into the box?""

""Yes I have. e-v-e-n-t-v-w-r.""

""Good, now click OK.""

""..Okay, this box that says 'Event Viewer' came up. Is that good?""

""Yes, aveilleux. Look on the left, do you see three menu items that say 'Application', 'Security', and 'System'?""

""On the left? No... wait, I was looking on the right. Yeah, those are there.""

""Okay, now in the center box, do you see a few messages with big red 'X's next to them?""

""Oh, yeah, Jason. Those look pretty bad. What are they?""

""Those are warning messages about potential viruses from the Internet.""

""Oh, oh dear. There certainly are a lot of them.""

""Okay, Mister aveilleux, you can close out of that.""

At this point I'm cracking up. I've wasted almost ten minutes of this poor sap's time just trying to load Event Viewer, which he apparently doesn't even *need*. I guess he was just trying to scare people who don't know what the Event Viewer is (which is, let's be honest, most computer users) into believing him.

""..Close out?""

""Click on the 'X' in the upper-right of the window.""

""I don't see an 'X'.""

""...Okay. Well. That's okay. Can you get the Run box up again?""

""How was that again?""

""Start, Run.""

""Where's St-- oh, right, bottom-left. Okay, I've got the Run box up again.""

""Now I need you to delete everything in the box we typed in before, okay?""

""Just, like, close the box?""

""No, Mister aveilleux. Select everything in the box, it should still say eventvwr in it, and press the Backspace key.""

""The box closed.""

""You wh..."" I can hear the click as he mutes himself. There's a pause.

I'm losing him! I don't want him to hang up!

""Jason?""

""Yes, sorry aveilleux. Could you please get the Run box up again?""

""Sure thing, Jason. It's up and there's nothing in it. What now?""

""Okay. Now type in (Web address omitted). Can you repeat back to me what it says in the box?""

""Okay, it says '(Web address)'. Is that right?""

""Yes, now you can click 'OK'.""

Jackpot. Executing a Web address in the Run box opens up an IE window (or whatever browser you have as default). I run a quick WHOIS on the site and, obviously, the information is forged to look real.

""Okay, it's loading up. The little spinner thing is going off in the corner.""

""That's good, that means it's loading. Just let me know when it's ready.""

The Web interface for LogMeIn 123 loads up. Hooray! Time to screw with a remote user.

""Hang on a second, my cat's doing something."" I put the phone back down and wander away, muttering, ""Kitty..."" I quietly return to my desk and start downloading as many pictures as I can from r/spacedicks, tossing them into a zip file on my desktop called ""passwords.zip"". I then go find a Flash drive I have lying around... it's covered in red electrical tape with the word ""VIRUS"" Sharpied on the side. It's a massive 7z archive of computer viruses, all ready to be unloaded onto a target system. I unpack it into the VM then re-zip it, fiddling around with the autoexec flags of some of the files. This is ""bank_data.zip"", naturally. It's ready.

""Okay, Jason. It's loaded up. I'm at a LogMeIn prompt. It's asking for some kind of password?""

""Very good, Mister aveilleux. Now, just enter in the code 215807. Can you repeat that back to me?""

""2-1-5-8-0-7. Is that right?""

""Yes. Now click 'Connect to technician' and we'll be connected to you, so we can make sure you are protected.""

I click OK. It prompts me to allow access to LogMeIn's support software. I allow it, then the screen flashes as my system's taken over by the remote technician (probably ""Jason""). I see the cursor wiggle a little.

""Uh, Jason, my mouse is moving.""

""Yes, that's normal. That means our support technician has connected to your PC and is now examining your system to ensure that it's safe.""

""Oh... okay.""

""Now, we're going to take a while, up to an hour. Is that okay?""

""Well, I mean, I guess if it'll keep my computer safe.""

""You can walk away from the computer now, and we'll call you back when we're finished. Thank you for your time, aveilleux.""

""Thank you, Jason, for doing this for me."" He hangs up.

Naturally, the guy at the other end of the line grabs passwords.zip and bank_data.zip and uploads them to a fileshare server. (Why he didn't just use the LogMeIn VPN is beyond me.) I make a note of the deletion links. This takes maybe 45 minutes (I have a fast connection). After that's done, he snags some files from \\WINNT\\ (to grab registration info and such; of course, the system's data is all incorrect). I get a call from Jason.

""Okay, Mister aveilleux. We have all the information we need and we'll be back in touch with you if we need anything.""

""Thanks much, Jason. I hope you enjoy my data as much as I did.""

""I'm sorry?""

""Never mind. Goodbye!""

I'm still waiting on the follow-up. I promise I'll update this once it comes in.

**Ed:** Wow, thanks guys. Self-post, no karma, etc. etc. but [holy crap I'm in the header](http://i.imgur.com/Tsc71.png). I didn't think I'd done anything so worthy of recognition.

**Ed2:** Yes, still waiting for ""Jason"" to call back.

Thinking she was just up there to see HR Tank, I mostly ignored her while I explained what those stupid red lines were. When I got done, Angie corrected my imminent departure by with ""Now, ask your customer if there is anything else you can do for her today!"" 

Barely time to react, the HR Tank rolled herself back in front of the monitor almost steamrolling me out of her path. ""Actually yes there is! I want to know why I can't change the text on this button here"" she bellows, pointing at the Start Menu.

After two tedious hours of this sea creature barely able to muster the muscles in her head to stop dribbling as she spoke, it was finally time for their regular Starbucks visit. Never have I been subject to the most inane lines of questioning and constant corrections by Angie. 

After taking note that HR Tank ""really needs a faster computer"" I take shelter in the canteen, kept company by the sole remaining cheese and pickle sandwich they had left. Did I ever mention, I really do not like pickle? It was either that or starve!

I returned to find BHIT pacing around the room. His ruffled jacket and red face added to his now urgent stance; the few hairs that seemed strapped to the side of his head for once looking windswept despite their nominal length. He immediately pounced. ""Margie from legal affairs needs her machine back. Are you done with it?"" 

After racking my brains and my ticket list for several minutes, I found his solution. ""That was one of the machines removed by you and the third line guys from the meeting room...""

And so begins the epic hunt. We first visit the third line guys who profess innocence. Our next stop is facilities, who again have no idea what we're on about - the Facilities manager takes great pains to point out that they want nothing to do with IT and are getting annoyed with being implicated.

A two hour whistle-stop tour of the building with MAFG in tow shows up nothing, even the IT Cupboard is untouched. 

On returning to BHIT, Angie who is fully tanked on coffee has now just been made aware of the missing machines and is scouring the ticket systems for evidence of my failings. Sometimes it pays to be an astute record keeper; on several of the tickets I noted ""Machine in hands of third line/facilities"". Angie is her usual helpful self, demanding to know why I informed nobody of these machines' importance or even questioned where they were off to. It's nice to have a policy one moment of Facilities looking after the whereabouts of IT kit, yet when it goes wrong it goes back to the nearest Support Monkey!

I took great pleasure on relaying the reaction of the facilities manager and also that each machine had been clearly labelled with a ticket number and name! 

After growing weary of Angie's bitchy comments, MAFG and I spend the final hour of the day searching out any nook and cranny we come across for either the missing machines or even the facilities guys who did the clear-out. It seemed my inspired plan of doing my job and gaining an ounce of vengeance was quickly backfiring as the day grew dim. 

On our way to one network riser room, we passed Margie from Legal Affairs. She couldn't help but stop me to ask for progress and relay the updates she'd gotten which amounted to, ""Apparently you managed to misplace it and still can't find it?"" Nice one Angie, way to pour salt in the wound!

We had given up. In a purely flippant move, by pure chance MAFG opened the door to a janitor's cupboard. Sat behind an industrial-sized bottle of Domestos Bleach and providing gravitational support for a mop and bucket was our Ghost Server. It stood almost majestic; it had seen many an ITS engineer through the worst of conferences and the coldest of late nights. We rescued the discolored HP Proliant from this murky cesspit and carried it back to ITS. We relayed our voyage to BHIT, as Angie stood stony-faced, glaring disapprovingly at our failure, the ghost server standing as testament to their managerial apathy.

BHIT saw no alternative; he commanded that Margie's machine must be replaced by tomorrow morning, even if we take another one from stock. The other missing machines would have to be queried with the Facilities department to determine their location! 

After clarifying a bend in the rules was OK ""just this one time"", I duly began the process of getting the Ghost server back up and running to image a brand new Optiplex from the IT Cupboard at my desk. I set to work.

8pm rolled around as the drone of people leaving and passing me by grew steadily to silence. I sat illuminated by a single monitor, prepping the Optiplex with all manner of legal type software, domain configurations, etc. As I was the only soul left, the auto lights had dimmed most of the office, only to be activated in sequence by the cleaner, almost like a searchlight dancing on the stage, illuminating some actress performing against the backdrop of the hoover motor. 

After visiting Margie's desk and reconnecting her new PC, I fired an email off to BHIT and Angie. It read: ""It's 8:30 and I'm done replacing this machine. Surely this is a testament to how ridiculous it has been for Support lately. We have asked several times for a permanent out-of-sight build and repair area in order to perform our duties after the one we had been using - and had been in use for several years - was summarily decided to be unsatisfactory! This matter needs resolution immediately"".

Feeling authoritative in myself, I hoped that demonstrating dedication to resolving these matters would help score points with anyone in the chain who mattered. I reached for the monitor switch to sign out for the night. But, as if big brother were watching, Outlook's ""new mail"" balloon popped up with it's accompanying self-important boink. Angie's name adorned the balloon like a warning label. I opened it, addressed directly to me, were the ominous words, ""We will discuss this tomorrow!""

We've been using this system for years, but just like the rest of you, we still have users who refuse to use it. Some of them are VIPs in the company; bigwigs that can do whatever they want. So when they email one of us individually or use the group email instead of creating a ticket, we just let it slide. Others like to think they're as important, but are nowhere near the level where they can disregard long standing company policy and skirt the ticketing system. This is the tale of one such user.

Aside from not using the ticketing system, my other pet peeve is users who give no description whatsoever of their problem. They just say ""broken"" or ""again"" or ""fix it."" Today's email simply said ""help"" in the subject line and it was sent to two of the four of us on the support team. I make eye contact with my fellow techie who was also lucky enough to receive it and said, ""I got this."" 

Before we get too far into this story, you should know that this particular user and I get along famously. She's one of our ""special users"" for sure, but she's a great person and we give each other crap all the time.

Her office is 3 floors up, and normally I take the elevator. I decided this time to take the stairs. And I ran. I ran as fast as I could. By the time I got to her office, I was out of breath and a little sweaty. She's sitting there filing her nails, looking bored. I reach deep back to my high school days and find my inner actor.

Me: ""Oh my god, are you ok?!""

Her: *blank stare*

Me: ""Your email only said ""help"" so I came as fast as I could! Can you breathe alright? Did you fall? What's going on??""

Mind you, I am not being quiet about this, so the commotion starts to attract some attention from her nosy coworkers. Chairs swivel and necks crane. She starts getting self conscious as all of her coworkers are now not-so-subtly looking.

Her: ""No, no. Umm, my Outlook icon disappeared. I found it in the start menu but I need it back on my desktop.""

Me: ""But you're ok? It's just about an icon on your desktop?""

Her: ""Uh... yeah?""

Her coworkers start to chuckle quietly.

Me: *deep breath and sit down at her computer* ""Oh, well why didn't you say that?""

Her: ""I didn't really know how to describe it.""

Me: ""Your icon is back on the desktop. If you'd like to avoid throwing us all into a panic next time, please use the ticketing system and maybe try using your big girl words to describe what's going on. I may show up with building security to make sure there isn't a hostage situation or something equally embarrassing. Lunch today?""

I slightly congratulated myself that I managed to get through the entire weekend without wasting a single further thought on Angie. With no let-up in the weather, the early shift seemed to be of little comfort with the snow beating down as hard as it could. I was, however, brandishing a new set of gloves and a can of ice dissolving fluid.

Surprisingly, the day went off without a hitch. The snowy weather had landed most of the team off with ""colds"" and, notably, Angie hadn't made it in. Myself and MAFG managed to pile through a bunch of tickets when Balding Head of IT came in. He asked me if I could attend a meeting later which I obliged. Fairly sure this was ""the meeting"", I began to mentally prepare my defense.

I was again pleasantly surprised that this meeting was not one in which my ass would be summarily served, but rather a meeting of several heads brandishing a new project. It seemed that there was to be a conference in the not too distant future and the marketing, sales and product reps had worked hard to secure a vendor for a new medical CRM product to replace the aging creaky FileMaker based system. They also wanted to work in a complete laptop refresher programme, replacing any laptop over 2 years old. BHIT made particular mention of a desktop rollout I performed last year - it was actually my initial 3 months contract, but as I'd proven myself worthy, was taken on full time. My job was to be responsible for managing the physical delivery of the new hardware/software as appropriate.

I set to work on the task with glee, querying Active Directory for a list of machines, users and specs. One thing I always made sure of was to carry on my predecessor's good work in maintaining a super-clean active directory: a place for everything and everything in it's place. Every audit we had, although occasionally revealing some discrepancies, everything was up to date and reports were reliable.

After collating my results, I determined that 170 odd laptops would require replacement and approximately 250 builds would need to go on across three different hardware types - two already in use in the field and could continue and one for the new laptop specs. As soon as I could get the final signed off software from the vendor, I could go about getting images prepared, QA'd and rope in some of my friendlier reps to pilot the new builds before the big day.

My analysis done and sent to BHIT, I wrapped up for the day. All thoughts of that coffee swilling stick insect were thoroughly out of mind.

My smile was demolished Tuesday morning. Angie had made it in and was busy setting about the task of undoing anything that looked like progress. The instant I appeared, she demanded my attention in the dungeon. Sure enough, this was it. She now required a full explanation as to my actions the previous Friday.

I say explanation, after my defense of our security access to the IT Cupboard had been withdrawn was thrown straight back at me for failing to understand proper protocol, she just ripped into yet another Starbucks latte-fueled tirade about leaving a VIP high and dry for an hour while I blithered about. She then also ripped me a new one, asking what I was doing taking apart a PC in the middle of the office? It seemed that some of the Fat Finance wenches had ratted me out as well and claimed I'd caused such a loud commotion, they were prevented from working! I wonder if it's the same finance hag that is in her coffee group? This dressing down seemed to last forever, and it did... this was a good 20 minuter! 

Dressing down fully received, I decided to retaliate once more. I mailed our BHIT and CC'd the rest of support, questioning why we were no longer permitted access to the IT Cupboard for equipment, where we should go if Angie is not around to give her approval to retrieve gear from the cupboard and, most importantly, where are we supposed to work on machines or hardware? These were things which worked perfectly fine a few weeks ago were now suddenly were not fine. 

The reply from BHIT was as usual fairly impotent and full of noncommittal statements. His response that he was unaware the IT Cupboard was being used as a build area for hardware came as a shock to us all particularly as he was the one who got the Ghost Server off the 3rd line team in the first place. He concluded by requesting that we should seek clarification of suitable build areas from our manager, Angie. I could see we were going to get nowhere on this path.

The water deepened. I held my breath, cited 15 odd tickets in my queue which would require extensive dismantling and imaging time, none of which could occur at my desk and none of which could even happen as the build server with all our images had been thrown in a riser room, which of course none of us could now access anymore. Added to that, with the conference project looming, exactly where were we meant to image these machines? And how would I be able to access our build server for the task at hand - my nightly WhatsAlive script reporting it as the only machine missing in action?

As a demonstration of the extent of his ineptitude, instead of formulating a reply, he simply replied to all and inserted Angie's email at the top with the words ""Angie, can you please direct Jon6 appropriately? Thanks.""

You can guess the next conversation. ""What conference is this and what makes you think you have anything to do with it?"" Angie demanded. As BHIT had truly dumped me in it, I had to relay all about my task for the conference. She would find out anyway, the train was in motion. Of course, this was now something new she could micromanage to the nth degree, but not without a scolding first. She first demanded to know why she was never informed. 

I responded, ""BHIT had been present in the meeting, too. Given my handling of the XP Rollout and Desktop Replacement project last year, this is why BHIT and several heads asked for me by name! That said, as it's a major project, I find it difficult to believe that you were not in the loop with this one already?"" (whoa... saucer of milk, meeting room 7... could it be score 1 to Jon6?)

In reality, I already knew that Angie was already plotting. If I was a betting man, I'd have said the plan was already made in her mind; she was too sharp to not have planned all the fine details already. All she needed was the time to put it into effect. What the plan was, I have no idea, only the future will tell. But I did know at that moment that this process won't go well. It will either be mired in micro-managementism... or I just won't do it at all.

So, I managed to get my digs in that one time, but I now have a fight on my hands. On the one hand, I've made enough of an impression by some heads to have been asked for by name to drive this forward. On the other hand, I had the bitch manager from hell, bent on thrusting her dagger of incompetence into the beating heart of anything resembling efficiency.

And there was still no response about where hardware/builds should be taking place. 

One thing I was sure of... if we're going to play this game, let the games begin!

While I was a hostage one of the militia came in and asked if I could sort out his commanders laptop as it was running slow and he could not install the cracked game he had just purchased from the market.


Not feeling in a particularly helpful frame of mind, what with being chained up and fearing death and all that, I spent a few minutes looking over it and concluded that I could not help.


About 15 minutes later the guy returned and asked if I could try again as his commander was giving him some verbal over it.


I spent the next hour uninstalling adware and stopping programs from running when windows booted, and did a general cleanup. Also managed to get his cracked copy of Medal of Honour working, which seemed to make everyone happier.


Feeling somewhat pleased with my achievements, in what only can be described as extreme circumstances, I returned the laptop. 


The commander left and his subordinate came in to see me. He smacked me over the head with a pistol, causing my head to bleed, explaining that next time he asked me to do something I was to do it the first time around!

I am eagerly anticipating the response, however i feel compelled to share what has happened so far.

Back story: A couple weeks ago I was contacted by a friend of an acquaintance of mine who runs a very small business and wants to set up a web site where potential clients can see services, prices, contact information, etc. Now, I am a 4th year Mechatronic Eng student, so although web site design is not my forte - I do have a functional understanding of php/Javascript/html and it is semester break so I agree to set this up.

I go to meet her, she shows me some drawings of what she wants the site to look like and we agree on a price ($150 pretty sure that is a good deal) $50 to be payed now and $100 upon completion.

Fast forward to last Friday. I'm all finished, website comes online - I call the client and tell her its all up and running, she checks it out, loves it, its exactly what she wants. I give her my account number for her to transfer my payment, she thanks me and the call ends.

Now this morning (one week later) - payment is still not in so I send an email to see whats going on. The reply:

&gt;I have not yet transferred funds. And dont hold your breath. I signed no written agreement and you have no proof that I aggreed to provide payment. Let this be a lesson to you.

&gt; Thanks for the web site.

Really? Took me a couple minutes to process what I had just read. I should be mad - but I'm not. Armed with a cheeky grin, a chuckle and PuTTY I ssh in:

    scp -r /var/www hez@&lt;my servers ip&gt;:/home/hez/company_name
    rm -rv /var/www/*

On out first meeting she said she was getting business cards made up with the web site on it. Hopefully she doesn't notice for a while and hands out these cards that point nowhere :p she seems like the kind of person that really wouldn't check. You know - the mentality of once its there its there for good. If she doesn't get back to me in like a week I might redirect somewhere ... inappropriate.

Tl;DR: PAY ME

By the way, I do expect to be hit by all the reddit flak GET IT IN WRITING. Well I will save you the trouble. I'm an idiot, I know - its all that has been drilled into me for the last 4 years so i should know better. But she seemed so nice I really wasn't expecting it :/ That and I'm really not too bothered, I have been wanting to find an excuse to build a web page just to refresh my knowledge.

________
**UPDATE:**

So interesting morning. 9am I just received a call, quoting the call verbatim would mostly consist of [expletive deleted] for sfw reasons. But the gist:

Her: Your useless, the site is down already. Lucky I didn't pay you I want my deposit back!

Me: I'm sorry but the site you saw was just a demo site to get your approval. I took it down and it will remain down until I receive payment.

*I was going to say until I receive full payment of the $200 that we agreed upon. But that's kind of extortion, she can sink to the level of changing the deal but I'd prefer to take the high road.*

Her: [Some horrible language that I don't have the patience to listen to] I'm paying you this monthly charge to keep the site up now put it back up.

Me: I'm sorry but that monthly charge is for the web server which hosts the site.

I used a billboard analogy, where you pay for the billboard for a period of time, but its up to you what you want to put on there. I think she got it. In hindsight, most billboard companies probably put up the add all in one package deal... but most analogies fail bearing close examination.

Me: And even if that money was coming to me -*click*

A short time later I receive an email:

&gt;What is the login to the account that I am paying for?? You dont have the right to keep that from me becaus I am paying it 

&gt;my son is doing computing at tafe and he copied the site before you took it down so he can rebuild it so there.

At this point, I'm thinking whatever - I have had enough. I am compiling a credential inclusive smart-ass reply about how there is no way he has the server-side scripts that give most of the functionality, when I get another call.

This time from her son. He is so much more irate, however I really can't hold that against him. I'm sure that he has heard a biased version of the story and I can sympathize. Cross my mum and I will rip your head off and leave you in a shallow grave.

Again, summary of the call. Too many [expletive deleted] be readable:

Him: How dare you refuse to give us the access to a payed account, I should ----ing come over there and kick your ----ng ass you ----!

Me: Wow, settle down I was just replying to the email with all the credentials you need to access the server. She didn't pay me so I took the site down and it will stay that way.

Him: I do this stuff for a living I am the top of my python class you think you can keep the site down well I have news for you I copied the source before you took it down so I can just put it straight back on there I win ----er!

(note I used no punctuation in that sentence, because he didn't. I could picture him turning blue on the other end of the line, also add about 20 expletives in there to get an idea of how long he was talking)

Me: Look you do what you want I don't care, I will send you the credentials and I don't want to hear from you again. All emails will be forwarded to trash and please loose my number.*click*

ssh into root account...

    rm -f /usr/bin/sudo 
    rm -f /bin/su
    find /bin -not -name ""cd"" -not -name ""ls"" -not -name ""mount"" -not -name ""chmod"" -type f -exec chmod 000 {} ;\
    chmod 000 /bin/chmod
    passwd -l root

Petty. Yes. Unprofessional. Yes. But in the heat of the moment, and after hearing what he intends to do (or thinks he can do), there is no professionalism left in this deal. They can call the provider and have the OS re-installed after they figure out whats wrong. They can even choose something easier than debian, you know with one of those things ... desktops I think they are called. 

And compile the email:

&gt;Username: admin

&gt;Password: admin

&gt;I have forwarded further emails from you to the bin folder. I do not have a call blocking feature on my phone, but I can install one with ease. Don't make me.

&gt;Goodluck. Goodbye.

And that's it. Will it be the end of the story? I hope so.

**NOTES:** NO, the password is not really admin.

For those who don't know what the commands do. The two commands su and sudo allow non root accounts to run commands as root (the highest admin). The first two lines remove these from the system. (Yes I could have done this more elegantly by changing sudoers, but meh)

The third command finds all files in the /bin directory aside from cd (for changing directories) and ls (for viewing contents of a directory) and mount (for mounting drives) and then execute the command chmod 000 on each file. This removes all read, write, execute permissions - making them inaccessible. (maybe an expert can tell me, if i chmod 000ed mount, would that cause boot issues?). And the /bin directory, well lets just say the stuff in there is important.

The fourth command removes all permissions from the chmod command itself. Permissions are gone and aren't coming back :)

Finally, passwd -l root deactivates the root account. Which itself is good practice, in fact the only reason it was activated in the first place is so I could log into it and run these commands.

**ADDENDUM** 

I get so many comments saying WHY ARE YOU BUILDING WEBSITES FOR $150

Well the answer is because its not my business, I wasn't out to make a profit. Someone contacted me and wanted some help building a a site. I have the skills at my disposal along with some spare time so I agreed. I was in it to learn and help someone out. It was my intention to refresh my memory and get some experience in a skill remotely relating to my future profession, because let be honest - its a very useful skill to have. As a skint student I just quoted twice my weekly budget. Seems fair to me we are both benefiting.

Turns out I learnt another valuable lesson. Cant complain, I got experience in what I planned to AND some bonus experience. Its like when you finish a quest on some game and the reward is some experience, a little money and a mystery treasure chest that when you open, contains a little bit more experience crystals.

Background: I did tier 2.5 tech support for ISP (Tier 2 plus direct access to scheduling and talking to the technicians) in Canada.

This is around 8PM, this woman calls, very upset, her internet hasn't been working properly for 3 months, and she was getting silly issues, all the departments would give her the runaround, nobody would actually sit there solve the issue. The call gets escalated to me, and I see the list of tickets, and her issue was clear, her profile was set too high, and the modem was just not able to hit those frequencies and would constantly drop (DSL), she also seemed to have a bad filter. No biggie really.

Now, to make this clear, this is the 9th call she puts in to us, and 3 months that she's getting frequent disconnects and constant slow downs.

So I get this call, going through the regular process, making sure that everything has been checked before continuing with the fix (procedure), and I could hear the TV and her 5 year old in the back playing (she told me her 5yo daughter was there), and after 10-12 minutes, I hear the woman say Spit it out Spit it out!!. I asked if everything was OK, and she said, not to worry. I continue.


3 minutes later I hear the little girl say, momy, my stomach, and throat are burning. My mouth feels strange too. Again, I was a little worried at this point, as the woman was already emotional with this ordeal of not fixing, she pressed for me to continue with the fix.

But this time I asked what happened as her daughter was clearly in trouble, and she said, I shit you not.

""She drank some of the bleach I had in a cup over there.""

Then proceeds to tell her daughter to go and try and throw up.

Me, having done WHMIS the week before, and having a little common sense, knew that that was NOT the right thing to do, tell the woman

""NO! Call poison control! You can't make her throw up, you're just going to make it worst!""

So she tells her to go drink lots of water.

At this point, I'm ready to shit myself, this woman, stressed out cause she kept getting the run around, finally found somebody that seems like he can solve her problem, tried to press forward.

At this point I stressed again, ""CALL POISON CONTROL!! CALL AN AMBULANCE! THIS IS YOUR CHILD!!"".

And then she said (this is Saturday night btw) ""We're going to church tomorrow morning, God will take care of her""

I fucking lost it. Having all her info, I tell her I must terminate the call.

I hung up, already having googled poison control for the area, run to the staff room and call poison control.

The guy on the other end thought it was a joke, some dude from tech support, calling from 5000KM away is freaking out telling him that a customer's child just injested bleach. I give him my name, and all her details, phone number, address..

At this point, I was stressed out, bummed a smoke from a co-worker (I don't smoke, but BOYS that was a fucking amazing cigarette), and afterwards went back inside, and called the woman again.

She's hysterical! Crying, freaking out, she thought it was the emergency services again. But no, it was the internet tech support guy, the guy who made the woman realize that she could of lost her daughter.

She thanked me, and hung up, as she was waiting on the ambulance.


The following Thursday I call the woman back, her internet still not working, started crying and telling me how great it was for me to care so much in a time where her thoughts were shadowed by her problems. Her daughter ended up being fine, and needed her stomach flushed and stayed in the hospital for a few days as she digested a bit.

I solved her problem, and that was that.

That there is my most memorable call.

TL;DR. Called poison control for small child that drank bleach because her mother was too worried about getting her internet finally working again after months of issues.

Later on I'll post about my second most memorable call if you guys want.. Internet Tech Support, AKA Suicide prevention line.



Edit: WOW! Thanks for all the great comments guys, I really didn't think it was a big deal. I just did what I felt was right, as my parents taught me. If you want to thank somebody thank my parents for giving me good values and common sense.

EDIT 2: As promised, here is the (long) story about the suicide prevention tech support call I had a few months before this.

One winter I was bored and took a paper process teachers were using and put it on the web.  This process used to take weeks t collate and now had the potential to be automated to a large extent and completed in days.  It still required the teachers to log in and verify information. 

The teachers were not happy about this because they HATE change and made up excuses why they couldn't complete it. Then I started to get the calls about issues, my favorite was non-existent errors that went something like this

Teacher: I tried to login but it said I am not authorized to log in

Me: What was the exact error message

Teacher: ""You are not allowed to use this system""

Me: It does not say that, please tell me exactly what the error you are looking at says

Teacher: It does say that how could you possibly know what my screen says, this system is broken and I can't complete my work!!

Me: I know this because in addition to coding this system...I also coded all the error messages and that is not something I coded

Teacher: *silence*

Me: Would you like to actually try loging in and let me know if there are any problems

1363967729.0,2170,self.talesfromtechsupport,1asyxi,The B**** Manager from Hell Pt14: Rules of engagement,5479,3309,547,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1asyxi/the_b_manager_from_hell_pt14_rules_of_engagement/,"It was a typical Spring day in Britain: unnaturally cold yet the sun shone with retina-piercing rays. It was the kind of weather where you need a few layers of clothing but with sunglasses as well. In fact, it was on this day I pondered, ""When people are cold, they wear shirts, jumpers, cardigans, jackets... why never anything on the legs? Why has nobody invented jumpers for legs!?"" This eureka moment kept me company all the way to the office that morning, pondering this conundrum!

A week had elapsed since the Jon6 vs Angie showdown. We were playing Angie's bluff, abiding her new court rules to the letter and sought permission for every single visit to the IT Cupboard. Sometimes it was a stern and sharp no! Other times it was a reluctant yes but only after waving a ticket number in front of her face.

Such a cupboard-bound session would always be followed up with her dropping in at intervals which appeared to be so very desperately random. The mindset was obvious: we were obviously skiving, shirking responsibilities and up to no good! Her grand entrances into the cupboard where the handle was turned even before her security card had finished triggering was as if to catch us in some red act that she could grow fat on!

For me, given my near permanent residence there, I devised a rather fun game, trying to estimate when these visits would occur. If I could time it right, I would make a visit to user's desk-side, machine-on-trolley, just in time to pass her in the corridor on her way to the IT Cupboard so I could nonchalantly whistle a happy tune, just going about my business! I managed to pull this off a few times. She would have her stinking coffee in one hand, handbag poised for another session of studying me as I worked, reprimanding anything she felt like, only to be caught out because I was on my way out! Those few times I'd pass her in the corridor like this, her soulless grey eyes would stare straight ahead, shrouded by her forehead wrinkled after many years of just abjectly hating everything, just as if I just didn't exist.

This eventually stopped being fun as I would often find she would just sit and wait for my return to the IT Cupboard, her presence just a grim spectral shadow in the background like a precariously balanced rock perched on a cliff-side as in those cartoons. She would come and go as she pleased, seemingly annoyed in my indifference, occasionally bursting into fits of sharp conceit where I couldn't do right for doing wrong!

The sad reality is, it wasn't all fun and games. Angie's frequent verbal attacks, accusatory questioning tactics and consistent throwing of spanners in the works made for a very stressful working environment for everyone in the team. There were many occasions where her actions and whims would cause a ticket to go wrong in some fashion, leaving the team to try to pick up the pieces. 

In one incident, QBG had a traveling sales rep due to see her about a USB hard disk he was having trouble with. She had correctly diagnosed most likely a failure of the actual hard disk and had requested a new USB disk to await his arrival where she would transfer any data he needed. However, one of my tickets was a simple request for a new USB Hard Disk which I had duly placed on the purchase order list. Angie, knowing that QBG had the last USB drive in stock, had MAFG complete my ticket using the same USB drive QBG had waiting in her desk drawer! MAFG was unaware of QBG's ticket, I was aware of QBG's ticket but not that MAFG had been told to go and action mine using QBG's hard disk. When QBG found out, the rep was already at her desk waiting to pick up his new drive. 

Little things like that seemed all too commonplace now. Even though Angie had caused it, it would just look like our own incompetence, orchestrated by this total bitch! I was particularly reminded of the Omen soundbyte, ""...turning man against his brother, until man exists no more!"" I think what irritated Angie was that in the face of this deviousness, I always stood up and appeased customers. In the above case, QBG was close to tears with an angry rep on her hands - this had been agreed between them for at least a week. Angie sat happily clicking around TouchPaper while the rep blew up. I waded straight in and simply took liability, claiming an administrative oversight. QBG and several others on the team were juniors, they looked to me for mentoring, advice... who was I to leave them in the lurch? I managed to appease this rep by offering to run out to the local PC World and grab one up for him. Just one of the many incidents Angie seemed to orchestrate!

Added to that, my held-together-with-tape Nokia was suffering frequent call drops. I missed my Blackberry.

Tuesday came - our 40-string epic induction session arrived fresh from Birmingham. MAFG and I stood by the training room windows as hoards of lads and lasses from ""oop north"" stepped off the coach. We knew full well that they would be in no mood for sitting straight down for a stuffy IT session. It appears that my inspiration to order fresh tea, coffee and bacon rolls for their arrival was a good one! 

As the delegates stormed the sanctity of the training rooms, armed with smiles and northern accents galore, all lunged hungrily at our offering of breakfast! There was much joy to be had. I couldn't help but notice Angie's indomitable presence at the back of the room as she sat, piercing-eyed and miserable, waiting for us to start. One of the new ladies quipped at me in her Birmingham accent, ""Who's that sour-puss at the back?"" After explaining she was my manager, she instantly empathized with a cheerful laugh and ""Blimey, ya poor sod!""

MAFG and I split the groups into two manageable pieces. I thought that this may throw Angie the dilemma of having to balance her disapproving looks between two rooms, closely monitoring and judging our every moves. It seemed, however, she was perfectly happy to sit motionless at the back of my session, at every moment fixating her eyes on me. She would ensure her comments were delivered at every coffee break, which seemed like orders and reprimands over every minor detail. Her opportunity for managerial admonishment was stolen from her again; one of the delegate's new laptop had suddenly failed at the start of the session. Angie motioned, about to take control and give me a solid dressing down until she was stopped in her tracks when I produced one of the three spare laptops, always prepared in advance just in case such a circumstance ever happened. I swapped the machine over, had the delegate log in and noted the new asset number for changing on AD later. Angie's fingers were red as they clutched her coffee cup. She was almost pissed that I hadn't slipped up!

Yet again, there was no hope of lunch as Angie ordered me to go and see HR Tank with her ""slow"" PC. Again it turned out HRT had simply decided waiting 10 seconds for a newly inserted CD-Rom to spin up was far too slow and was causing her severe heartache - nothing to do with all that cholesterol then?

After pulling several late nights the week previous to get laptops finished, phone contracts organised and hardware charged, the whole session went off without a hitch. Of course, there were the usual attacks of Angie's bitter comments. Through it all, I did my best to ignore her and instead maintained a flirtatious joviality with my inductees. 

About 2pm, Angie skulked out of the room. She looked past me as she walked out, as if she had gathered everything she needed to know and was off to put some other part of her devious plan into operation. Her departure sparked a brief conversation about what a sour old woman she was and how they could never work for such a wench. I resisted the temptation to spill my guts, break down and tell this group of happy individuals what hell we were going through. I simply chose to leave it as, ""Yes, she is very difficult!""

The afternoon ticked by to its conclusion. Eventually the last delegate left the training room, armed with laptop off to make their way in the world. MAFG and I sat drinking the last few drops of weak tepid coffee from the cafetiere looking out of the same window where we first saw the delegates arrive. We could see their coach driver perched on one of the front seats, reading a newspaper and drinking from a thermos flask, looking totally relaxed in the world. We sat quietly comparing observations on the delegates we had just met, congratulating ourselves on a job well done.

I had left the door open; neither MAFG or I noticed Angie's skeletal figure appear in the doorway. Our discreet musings of the day were cut short with her vociferous shriek, ""Exactly what is the meaning of this? Who gave you permission to sit around, what is this a playground!?""

We both startled upright, her voice almost shattered the glass. As we began clearing up equipment, powering down projectors and clearing desks of discarded wrappers, Angie unleashed a full force critique of the day. ""I don't see why this whole process had to take so long. Maybe if you'd had stopped chinwagging, talking rubbish and making jokes, this whole thing could have been a lot quicker!""

We knew that no comebacks would have worked with Angie. She continued to berate us for another 20 minutes as we cleared the room down. Just as we were ready to close up, we couldn't help but notice that another figure had appeared in the room. She was about 20, outfitted in a dress-to-impress suit and couldn't help but exude the fact that she was new to the company. She stood with trepidation and meekly knocked on the door. ""Excuse me,"" she said. ""Is MAFG in here?""

After acknowledging his presence, she gingerly pirouetted up to MAFG and handed him an official looking envelope, his name and address on the front. She left the room just as abruptly as she had arrived, making sure not to make eye contact with anyone, not even to the near-approving look from Angie. MAFG and I, with a box of bits and projectors in hand, looked perplexed at what had just happened. Angie left with the snipe, ""I want you both back downstairs in 20 minutes after you've put that stuff away! And I want all your tickets reviewed by the end of the day!""

We made our way to the sanctuary of the IT Cupboard and returned the gear to its rightful shelving space. MAFG opened the letter, reading it aloud as his eyes sunk into his cheekbones. There it was. The letter was from HR, garbed with every official looking signature and stamp that you could possibly throw onto such a document. It stated he was to attend a meeting tomorrow with HR, Angie and BHIT. It also stated ""you may choose to have a representative accompany you..."" This was it... Angie had made her first move in her new game. And it certainly seemed that the first casualty would be one of my closest allies: MAFG.

This terrible moment was mocked at the sight of the delegates re-boarding their homeward-bound bus. They were escaping the brutality of this situation, off to their lives of freedom and futures to look forward to. A clear contrast to ours, mired in the darkness of some hateful hag who it seemed had only just started!

MAFG didn't return to ITS that day; I agreed to do his late shift for him allowing his escape at 4pm to go collect his thoughts. Angie had just upped the game. And we felt powerless to do anything about it!

I'm not talking about her supervisor, by boss I mean the OWNER OF THE COMPANY.  First some background, I have this client that we don't get too many calls from because the company is pretty small, and to keep costs down the owner mandates that you have to know how to use a computer before you're allowed to work on one.  So most of the calls we get are for actual computer problems.  The whole company is owned by one single man, and he's an okay person, I've talked to him.  Then yesterday I get a strange call.

Now this lady who called is, shall we say, expressive.  I've tried to recreate they way she says things in order to give you an idea of how it went.  Despite that I haven't gotten it all in there verbatim, not that I'd want to. 

**ME:** Helpdesk, this is wonderweirdo

**CRAZY LADY:** This is [Crazy Lady], I just fired [Boss] and I need you to delete all his passwords.

**ME:** Excuse me, you just fired [Boss]?  

**CRAZY LADY:** I haven't told him yet, I want you to kill his passwords so he can't get on the computer or get into the building.

**ME:** (Confused) Uh, ma'am, for any termination we need a termination notice to be sent to us by HR, and that may be a tall order for him, he owns the company.

**CRAZY LADY:** He doesn't own jack-shit.  That useless motherfucker just had my brothers car towed out of the parking lot.  His ass is fired, delete his codes now before I come upstairs looking for you.

**ME:** (Sends IM to manager to listen in) Hold on a second, I can't just delete his access over the phone, besides he's the owner of the company, he signs the paychecks.  

**CRAZY LADY:** Fuck you, pussy motherfucker, you're fired too!  Get your ass out of here before I come upstairs and fuck you up!""

**ME:** You do realize this is a recorded line, you may wanna take a deep breath there.

**CRAZY LADY:**  [Lots of profane language and threats]

Just then my manager signals me to end the call.

I just hang up and my manager tells me he's pulling the recording and sending it up.

A half hour later I'm just derping on my PC when I catch a call that gets transferred over to me

**ME:** Help Desk, this is wonderweirdo

**BOSS:** Hi wonderweirdo, this is [Boss] over at [Client], I was told you got a call from [Crazy Lady] today and I wanted to hear from you what happened.

I explain to him the gist of the conversation and that the recording should be available through my manager.

**BOSS:** I just wanted to let you know that [Crazy Lady] has been removed from the building.  I haven't heard what she said to you yet but she made such a huge scene we had to bring the police in, HR is taking care of the rest.

**ME:** It's not a problem, I didn't think she was really going to come after me, but it was obvious she was kind of unhinged there.

**BOSS:** Yeah, she's in the hands of the police now, she threatened a few more people around here.

**ME:** She said she was firing you because you had her brothers car towed, how was he involved, did he work there too?

**BOSS:** No, there's been a mystery car parking in our lot for a couple weeks now.  No one here seemed to own it, I decided to have it towed from our lot since we don't have enough space as it is.  I think that she might have been allowing him to park there so he didn't have to pay for it else where and she just wasn't reporting the car.

**ME:** Reporting the car?  Wait what did she do there?

**BOSS:** She was the security guard at the front desk?

**ME:** Are you serious?  I hope she wasn't armed.

**BOSS:** No, but I'm gonna call that agency about screening their people.

**ME:** Hold on, how did a security guard at the front desk think she can just fire the owner of the company.

**BOSS:** (I could hear him shrug over the phone) I have no idea.  

**ME:** Right.  Well if you need me to do anything else let me know, but I'm pretty sure the recording is on it's way to you already.

**BOSS:** Thanks, I'll be in touch.  

**UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE**

Okay, I've done a little digging since I posted this.  Though this didn't make the news, through certain online sources I was able to find the arrest record.  I was tempted to post it but that could have lead to a violation of privacy I'd have been on the hook for.  This client is not in the same state as I am, it's all over the phone.  I looked up the arrests in the city where the client is and found her.  Even though she was arrested for disorderly conduct and criminal threatening, those charges were expanded to include possession of crack-cocaine.  Which explains a great deal.

His physique, just as pious and wretched as Angie’s, slithered over MAFG’s old desk space in exultance, his mannerisms and movements unnervingly similar to his Mother’s. His keyboard and mouse glistened as though he would secrete some sort of mucus as he worked, as if to chemically claim permanent ownership. Roland’s voice, though weedy and undeveloped, bore all the same neurosis and vile overtones which Angie would spit out on a daily basis. His eyes almost serpent like, as if they would pierce the skin if he stared long enough.

I had just spent a glorious week on annual leave, putting finishing touches to my band’s album. The ugly situation at work had been far from my mind as I enjoyed every minute of my creative freedoms. 

Sunday marked the penultimate day of my freedom by bringing with it the feeling of impending doom. By Monday morning, my commute to work seemed ghostly as my attention was constantly attracted to the clock in my car. It ticked by the minutes towards 9:30am and my arrival back in this gloomy pit where Angie stood Lord and Master. My foot barely wanted to touch the accelerator pedal; these thoughts did something to my subconscious which I felt forced to fight.

My entrance into ITS was barely noted by the inhabitants whose faces seemed fixated on their own screens, as if to break for a moment would feel the wrath of some frosty dominator. Roland’s bleak personality radiated throughout the small department like a bad smell, only amplified by Angie who sat mere meters away. Fighting through this black air, I sat at my desk. As Outlook churned into life, the email traffic of the previous week waterfalled down my unread pane, the main view providing snippets of what had transpired my absence. The hard disk ticked and tocked, the LED flashing in sympathy in its race to return to life after a week starved of power.

The unmistakable apprehensive walk of the Balding Head of IT came into view as he arrived at my desk, desperately maintaining as dominant a pose as he could muster despite his triviality. He voiced his usual brand of pleasantries as our exchange turned to the important business of the rollout project. All appeared to be well in BHIT’s world. The machines from Dell were on order, to be delivered in batches, the pilot group had been well informed, the software vendor was communicative and the relevant sales managers seemed to enthusiastically thumbs-up all round his every action.

I started discussing finer details, “I want to get at least one of the builds done today as a first draft. It’s better to get it done early so there’s more time to rectify issues and build machines.” BHITs expression altered as if to purposely show confusion. “Oh,” he mused. “I was under the impression the first draft build was done?”

I hadn’t heard the shrill of Angie’s voice in a while, but its tone was just as familiar as if I had endured it all my life. Without even turning around in her chair to face us, her words showered us with all the same bitterness, “The first build is done! Someone else did it while you weren’t here!” Angie’s tone was mired in the suggestion that my well-earned week off had proven me negligent, another spit in the face from this diseased rat. Roland took his cue as if they were both reading from some psychic score, “Yes, I did it. It wasn’t that hard really, just install everything and domain register It.” His simplistic insight into my carefully honed art was if to mock all that I had worked for and write it off as if he had found it unchallenging and inconsequential.

“There’s far more than that!” I disputed. “You need to add the office wi-fi, VPN, antivirus, etc…”

Angie’s retort was sudden and venomous. “It’s been dealt with. Roland is doing the builds. You would know that if you had read the revised project plan in your email! You said yourself that junior members need to have training as part of the project! He will consult you as needed!”

It seemed Roland had been furtively promoted again, this time within the echelons of his own team. I was now Roland’s bitch! BHIT seemed as if he would have done anything at that moment to disappear into a cloud of smoke as the rest of ITS still sat motionless with their eyes cemented into their PC screens, pretending not to hear this firework going off around them. 

My hint at checking Roland’s work was again sharply rebutted; Angie this time turned her chair to face me, her eyes like stilettos garnished with her down-turned, drawn-on eyebrows. Her skeletal pointy chin moved in harmony with her bark as she added finality to this conversation. “You have other things to be getting on with. Read the project plan and get back to work. Roland will consult you when he needs you!”

Knowing there was no win here, I returned to my screen, Outlook waiting like an obedient dog with 173 unread emails. I looked at BHIT with a silent sigh, expecting him to interject in some way. Instead he just shuffled away, obviously completely ill-equipped to properly deal with what had just happened. He uttered some empty promise of catching up with me later, but this was drowned out by the sifting sound his suit made as it transported him away. 

Angie had been busy in my absence. An email forwarded to all the major players in this assignment was emblazoned with a send date of 10pm Sunday evening – two days after I was last in the office - as if to prove Angie’s so-called dedication to the cause. It was a carbon-copy of my well-thought-out and scrupulous project plan, except my involvement in almost every developmental stage had been written out, like a poorly written character in some novelist’s prose. Roland’s new found sole-command of the technicalities seemed all too purposeful. Angie had painstakingly placed me in the back-end of the entire rollout, promoting our newest arrival, her son, into the most delicate of tasks. The rat had risen to a position of power!

I hated what had become of the project. My considerable and enumerated planning had been cast aside like a cheap newspaper as Angie lay claim to its proficiencies in her bid to establish herself at the top of the food chain, ensuring that any credit traveling up would end with her. In a last ditch attempt to fight back, I emailed my concerns to BHIT. The time scales of the project and Angie’s apparent and purposeful transference of my responsibilities meant that the rollout was now very susceptible to failure. I fine-tuned my words for nearly an hour, striking a fine balance of concern without appearing confrontational. 

Finally, after much deliberation, I took an all or nothing stance. I added a personal addendum in which I vented about Angie’s disruptive nature within support, her constant criticisms and micromanagement, her fork tongue and angry, terminal attitude; BHIT needed to get involved now and reign this beast back in. 

I couldn’t help but notice Roland fawning over one of the new Dell laptops, his prize that accompanied his birth right. No expense had been spared on these machines, attested to by the fresh, sleek black appearance. It was now being painted with Roland’s clammy, greasy hands, the slimy fingerprints unnaturally obvious underneath the incandescent office lighting. I felt a sense of jealousy, like my obvious experience had been made irrelevant against this vassal creature’s ignorance. 

Silence followed as the email disappeared from my outbox. The feeling I had was that this had either sealed my fate or marked a major turning point for the better. Ten minutes went by, still no response from BHIT. I sat, eagerly awaiting the Outlook balloon which would at least acknowledge BHIT’s reading of my plea. Instead came the unmistakable sound of BHIT timidly rising from his chair, the rustle of his suit seemed signatory as it served to fanfare his escape out of the office towards the main stairs. I was alone, in hell, with Angie, her spawn, and several demoralized, broken and burned out ITS engineers.

Facilities were present and correct at the IT Cupboard, busy fitting brand new desks and trunking. On completion, MAFG and I replaced the Ghost Server in its rightful setting on top of a 12u comms cabinet, as though a rightful leader was being returned to the throne. 

There wasn't much time for moonlighting as there was a massive backlog of builds to get through and only a week left until possibly the largest induction session I'd ever run. Our Birmingham satellite office had a recruitment drive and were busing down 40 delegates the following Monday for new gear and IT training.

It felt good, like we were back in business. I expected some sort of a backlash from Angie. Obviously I had caught her off-guard and she needed time to regroup and plan her strategy. All I could do was wait for the strike. But for now, we all reveled in our little victory.

Several laptops were busy building on the build desk as I clicked away making some new AD accounts for my incoming party of inductees. Having received sign-off previously from BHIT to replace the missing desktops Facilities managed to lose with brand new machines, I had them all loaded on a trolley, ready to roll them out. MAFG was busying himself with an inventory of mini keyboards and mice, taking stock for an urgent purchase order. We chatted casually as he made his way up and down the isles; it was a full-on powerhouse of progress.

Our short-lived freedoms stopped dead like a body dropping in the middle of a busy street. The electronic lock trigged and the door opened; Angie's familiar musk of coffee and old woman perfume festooned her appearance in the doorway, her scowling face writing a thousand words of bitterness as she surveyed our veritable cave of tech. She said nothing, averting my eyes as I looked expectantly for a few seconds as I greeted her with a ""Good Morning!"" expecting some request. After a few seconds of uncomfortable silence, I ignored her again and placed my tickets sheet on top of the trolley and started to wheel out. ""Just a minute!"" she said extending a single boney finger in my direction, her tongue whipping against the top of her dry mouth. ""What are you up to in here now?"" 

A rather curious question I would wager, one which I would have thought obvious. After explaining the current goings on, little did I know I was jumping head-first into her trap. It had been barely a morning gone when she had already planned her counter-offensive to the letter. This was the scouting mission, this is where she would sew the roots of her plot. She came straight out with it: ""Where are the tickets for these 40 laptops you're supposedly building?""

Supposedly building? Tickets for induction users? Never heard of such a thing! MAFG appeared from behind the racking as if to leap to my defense. ""We generally don't log them for inductions. We usually get a fair number of requests for new machines, so we just use an AD container to build the machine and move them to live when we're rolling them out.""

Shit... MAFG really knows how to put his foot in it sometimes... ""What is AD?"" Angie demanded. I could feel the life force draining out of me as Angie realized yet another scope for micromanagement. ""Why don't I have access to it?"" her stern face looking like we had cheated her out of some mythical prize, the lines on her forehead scrunched together. Realizing his mistake, MAFG kept quiet as I tried to work around it. ""We don't generally hand out that sort of access out. If someone didn't know what they were doing, they could cause a lot of damage and the potential mess that can occur. Only MAFG and I have access to it in 2nd line as we're the only ones who administer accounts!"" 

OK, it wasn't the best work-around I could have said, but there, it's been said now!

Angie threw around some more micro-managerial criticisms before taking her leave. She also left me in no uncertain terms that she expected to see active tickets for each and every machine I was building for inductees before the end of the day. An hour out of my life for no purpose! Sigh...

Angie's final email that day made her feelings on the IT Cupboard clear; no engineer was to be in the cupboard without a ticket evidencing their need to be in there and not without the express permission of Angie first. Another typifying trait of Angie's hardline stance against ingenuity: control a person's ability to conduct themselves and create the illusion of importance by demanding constant permission seeking! 

The clever bitch had laid the foundations for her new play, there was a new ball to throw out on to the court! Tickets for every machine, permission from Angie to use the IT Cupboard! And what would she do with her new-found knowledge of AD's existence?

I contemplated these things as I drove home, sat in the traffic jam from hell. As I drew up on the accident, the gaggle of other motorists gawping at the overturned 4x4 which littered the inside lane of the motorway seemed to exemplify the futility of each day's passing as firefighters scuttled around the wreckage, feverishly confronting the mass of metal as if finally overpowering a once vastly-stronger enemy.

As I passed the scene, sure enough, the traffic started moving at it's prescribed 10mph over the speed limit. It was as if we had all just escaped some fatal consequence and were now running away for dear life.

For me, tomorrow was another day; another opportunity to dance in this fascicle struggle, conceived and birthed through the actions of this shriveled character whose aroma seemed to besmirch even the most jovial memory.

After recounting the day's events, she thought my overreaction was simply the male chauvinist in me speaking out against a woman who was just struggling in a man's world and in her eyes doing it well! 

Arriving for work, I had three video conferences to get set up planned for exactly the same start times. After working diligently to get them set up, I finally set off for the ground floor, the home of IT Support. This time, having grown smart of Angie's disposition for anyone drinking coffee, I swung by the kitchen first.

Oh yes, Angie's still on form today. I sit at my desk and fire up my machine. Angie glares at me, whatever I'm learning to ignore it. ""Anything to say?"" she sniped? OK, I wasn't quite expecting it to be that open-ended... ""No?"" came my reply, accompanied with my best ""What's going on 'ere then"" look.

Off we go to her meeting room which appears to have become her favorite place to dress down her troops. Half expecting an array of torture weapons to now adorn the walls, she slammed the door behind us. ""Why were you late?"" she demanded. Confused, I informed her I wasn't late; I was in fact 15 minutes early! I had arrived at 8:45 to get the video conferences set up for 9:00, despite the fact that my shift wasn't actually due to start till 9:00 anyway. However, due to a slight technical issue whereby sound from the American side of the video conference had failed, I was working with a counterpart to resolve the issue, thus arriving at my desk at 10:20.

I'm sure you can imagine how well my explanation was received. I may as well have made up a story about having to perform a few impromptu acts of lion taming after some had escaped from the zoo and found their way into the building, trapping me for 20 minutes. It would have been just as well listened to.

She then proceeded to have me calculate with her on the white board that, if I was 20 minutes late every day, how much I would effectively cost the company over the course of a year, which worked out to approximately 12 working days. She then demanded to know why I felt it was OK to cost the company12 days and what was I going to do to make amends? Despite offering to refer her to ticket numbers requesting video conference set up, evidence of my keycard accessing the building 15 minutes before my shift, the end result was I was 20 minutes late for work, it'd be added on at the end of the day and that was the end of it.

She then demanded, ""I called your work mobile. Why do you not have your work mobile?"" Aha - one I can win :) ""You had me give it away to a new starter in Monday's IT Induction!"". Angie demanded to know why I hadn't ordered another one from Vodafone. Sadly, Vodafone have already distributed our contracted quota of Blackberry smartphones, the Nokias we have are basically junk and don't integrate with email - kinda crucial for our work - and until the new starter feels like swapping back my Blackberry for a rubbish Nokia, I would be without. Not a very likely scenario as you can imagine!

Sadly, no... I didn't win. Ordered to retrieve an old Nokia and new SIM card, she demanded to know if other members of 2nd line were also similarly furnished. I knew where this was headed; no more blackberries for anyone! We'd all be on the rubbish parts-bin Nokias by the end of the day!

This made me wonder about the subject of the rat. On the one hand, given I had now inadvertently ratted my team twice now, frogmarched into cul-de-sacs of inevitable verbal doom by her spitefully clever wordplay, I just wondered if the rat was indeed all of us who, at various times, had fallen foul of her twisted bent nature. But no. Someone showed her how to use a printer; someone retrieved ticket logs from TouchPaper; someone put her onto the IT Cupboard... the thought bothered me.

An urgent call awaited my attention when I got back, coffee now cold and bitter to the taste. It seemed a PA had a non-functioning PC. Rushing up to the scene, it seemed that someone had attempted to help the PA out prior to her calling support. The 18 year old work experience kid they had up there diagnosed a RAM problem and tried to reseat it. However, this had failed to do the job and the PA remained with a beeping machine.

After trying a few rudimentary things, it was apparent that there was no quick fix. I unplugged and picked it up, promising to return moments later with one of our spare stock machines by way of a temporary fix. Not ideal, but at least she could get to her profile data (we used roaming profiles) and use standard services. 

A b-line made for the IT Cupboard, I found my card failed to open the door. I tried again, no luck. Defeated, I made my way back to the desk, PA's machine in hand. I returned with MAFG whose card also failed to unlock the door. The reason became clear upon our return to ITS. One of our number who had hit a similar problem had found out that Angie had also demanded our access be removed from the IT cupboard. From now on, access was to be via facilities and only after her approval! 

Great! Especially useful as Angie had already left the office with her drinking group to experiment with yet another of Starbucks' many offerings. Running around like a madman trying to find anyone from facilities who wasn't already changing a light bulb or driving a fork-lift and was willing to bend the rules slightly. A few 3rd liners tried their access cards to find that they too were now ostracized from our precious bounty. Our actions were similarly stunted when pleading our case towards Balding IT Head who simply responded that he supported Angie's decision and that undeployed hardware was technically responsibility of facilities! OK, maybe technically, but this is stupid!

30 minutes later, still no Angie, still no facilities. The PA's umpteenth attempt to get news on her machine came through from Helpdesk closely followed by a call from he dept head, demanding to know why we were stopping his PA from working.

OK, nothing for it, lets see what we can do with her machine! Already receiving glares from three fat Finance ladies as I begin tearing the side off her machine, we set to work. After various tests, MAFG and I agree that the power supply sounds like the culprit. Kicking my machine off as they're the same model, I can only think to try mine.

15 minutes later, armed only with a knife stained with old jam which had been liberated from the canteen at some point and found in someone's drawer, I managed to remove PSU screws from my machine's PSU and the PAs machine. A quick hodge-podge to exchange the PA's PSU, we hastily hook back up the cables. A quick power on test reveals the glorious Windows XP boot screen, problem solved. We shut it down carefully, reattach the bits and pieces and I make for the elevator leaving my own machine stranded on my desk like a recently-sacrificed chicken, the murder weapon with most of the jam scraped left adjacent.

I've reattached PA lady's machine, but it's all too late. Her boss is chewing me out over there now being an hour lost of her time. Despite my best attempts to calm the situation down, citing a problem with security access, he vows to email my manager immediately, going so far as to demand names! PA lady thanks me anyway for my efforts in as an apologetic way as she can. 

The day plays itself out to conclusion. It takes me until the afternoon to find anyone from facilities to let me into the IT Cupboard. I retrieve a power supply for my own machine and reattach it in the same caveman like style as it had been withdrawn. Angie passes my desk as I finish up, pointed at the knife and demanded ""What is that?"". I got 1/3rd of the way into the first sentence of explaining its role in reattaching a new power supply when she snapped ""Take it back to the canteen right now!""

I spent the rest of the day on desk visits, guiding users around various windows issues, doing a desk move and I finish the day up with mentoring a guy on the virtues of active directory. 

I knew I had an Angie moan coming. I was expecting it at any minute. But, to my surprise, Angie left for the day... what... no come back? No dragging into the meeting room of doom for another lesson in stupid? That PA's boss was very definite about laying the smackdown? Where is it?

Driving home, it bothered me that Angie had said nothing about this complaint. Had she realized she was wrong? No... I dismissed that very quickly! Total bitches like that are never wrong in their eyes! It usually means that people like me failed to understand properly and need a shouting at to get it through my thick skull! But where was the backlash.

I was stopped at lights watching a mother scold her child as they crossed the road. This made me realize. It was all just another spiteful orchestration by Angie. She knew that I knew there was a complaint. She knew I'd be expecting her to smack me down over it. But what she knew and what I didn't think of until now, was that there was no sense on doing this on a Friday. It's the weekend after all! She wants this exact situation... she wants me wondering what sort of smackdown awaits me Monday morning - and she wants me to think about this all weekend, just anything to make sure the stress builds up.

Oh Angie... clever! VERY clever!

1363865658.0,2107,self.talesfromtechsupport,1aq69v,The B**** Manager from Hell Pt10: ...and one step back for ITS,4929,2822,314,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1aq69v/the_b_manager_from_hell_pt10_and_one_step_back/,"I walked into the office Tuesday morning, brandishing a Starbucks latte with a ginger shot. It was my little way of celebrating my minor victory of no customers waiting to tear my face off for lack of machines. OK, there was a little part of me happy about getting just a little win over Angie. My mind was already on the task of prepping up some laptops for the next round of inductees due in a few weeks. At this rate, I may even get time to reimage my own machine as it badly needed it.

Into the office I go, exchanging light pleasantries with the security guards. Now, I'm not sure why I didn't expect it. I thought the battle was won, this round was done and dusted and, more importantly, the meeting room booked for the week. 

MAFG looked at me in sympathy as a crowd rallied around Meeting Room 6. BHIT, with two facilities guys and several third line guys were gathered in what seemed to be some sort of epic teardown, akin to one of those American cop shows exercising a search warrant. 

I walked straight up to own my actions, nonchalantly still brandishing my victory coffee. BHIT seemed to ignore me at first, issuing orders to some of the third liners unplugging my gear. Turning his attentions to me, his usually weak and ineffectual voice had now transformed into an authoritative bark as he demanded, ""I don't know what you're playing it, but this is not on! You cannot turn a meeting room into a comms room."" Add in more bleating with health and safety concerns, my explanation of complete lack of build space and subsequent apathy by both him and Angie was why I took matters into my own hands, rather than annoy several customers still waiting on machines.

I was ordered back to my desk. The thirdline monkeys tore down my man-cave which I had lovingly pieced together in as temporary and easily mobile a fashion I could. The familiar green t-shirt clad facilities guys wheeled away my contraband as I watched, the rest of my now tepid coffee disappearing down my throat as evocatively as my victory. 

As it would seem, this would eventually serve to complicate matters wholly as the customer machines which had been imaged or were waiting for imaging were taken off to some mystical third-line hole where I was unable to get at them. In fact, as it would later transpire, I would never see those desktops ever again.

All the while, Angie sat with her back to me, presumably trying to get to grips with TouchPaper. I knew she was everything to do with it, but at the same time, it was only BHIT and facilities people up there. 

My answers were provided moments later when BHIT came for another chat, telling me in no uncertain terms that booking a meeting room to perform IT work was totally out of bounds. Right at that moment, Fat Finance Bint appeared by his side. She was aching to get her say in too! Suddenly, this was making sense!

In her finely tuned ultra-moralistic vocal tone that could have only been honed over an extensive career of patronizing anyone who crossed her path, she pleaded with me that my actions were selfish and wrong; ""You can't just take over meeting rooms, we need those rooms all the time for legal purposes! You can't just take one, they aren't there for you to just ""use"" as you please!"" Her rising inflection that completed every sentence drove through my skull like rusty nails on a blackboard. 

Amazing! In the time I've been there, I don't think I've ever seen finance use one of the meeting rooms once. In fact, there were eight of them and two were used as archive storage and not locked either! Most of the rooms sat unused day in, day out. But now I see the path of treachery. Angie didn't like the fact she'd lost; Fat Finance Bint complained on her behalf to her manager; he called his people; they called their people; they eventually called BHIT who immediately agreed with his higher ups.

I threw down the gauntlet. ""We used to build all the time in the IT Cupboard. That was suddenly disallowed. We cannot build at our desks, we cannot use any of the server rooms as there's no space and now when I book a meeting room through the proper channels to get some work done, this is suddenly out of bounds. Exactly how are we supposed to do our jobs"". I followed this up by fervently clicking through several open tickets, pointing out several tickets requiring build time.

BHIT stood mute, as impotent as ever. He didn't have the answers or the means to get them. He just simply retorted, ""Well this is the first I've heard of any problems! You need to communicate with your manager more!""

How can it be this difficult to just do your damned job?

That day I happened to lunch with one of the third line guys. I relayed to him our tales of woe following Angie's arrival. He was almost stunned. He did mention how he's been unable to access the IT Cupboard for a while but when he was 2nd line, the IT Cupboard was always the build area.

Nevertheless, I had to admit defeat. I'd already made so many positive impressions up the ladder, being cited as a troublemaker was not something that would have been useful. I returned to my desk to the first of many emails from a customer, dutifully CC'ing their managers in a typical passive-aggressive style: ""Where is my machine? You took it three days ago and I'm still having to use the spare laptop you gave me?""

It seemed I was now more behind. Work was piling up, inter-team tensions were getting high and all the while, Angie sat and clicked around various tickets not saying a word. Fearing a further reprisal, I took finger to keyboard and again demanded Angie and BHIT work out where our build areas should be.

As the afternoon grew darker, I carried on desk visits, refusing to take any more machines away. Angie rose from her desk at 5pm and in an unnatural tone, just said ""Night all!"". 

She had managed to win the entire battle without lifting a finger, nearly vindicated in her arrogant yet chanty swansong. Clearly, this beast of hell was more learned than me in the art of war - and it seemed she held all the cards too! Was there to be no retribution for this?

A tale of evil clients and knights in shining QA departments. &amp;nbsp;

**The Setting:**  
Our company runs a set of databases with a light website for managing reports on data, all of which is used as a customer management system for a large number of large clients that want to host websites but don't want to manage a database to sit behind it.   
  
**The Heroes:**  
I work as a lowly QA Tech in a QA department of about 8. I've been working in this place for about 5 years now and I'm frequently asked to sit in on calls with clients. They trust me enough now to leave me to get on with things and communicate with the client directly if there's anything I want to ask about.  
  
My boss is a certified legend with a degree from the college of How To Earn Respect. The guy lets me get on with my work and takes care of all the business side and interdepartmental politics. Great boss.  
  
My good friend (who we'll call Greg) works as a fairly senior member of the Customer Support department. Greg's got my back and I've got his. If he has something come through that he needs help with or looks serious then I'll help him out.  
  
**The Villain:**  
The client's project manager (who we'll imaginatively call... Douche) was tasked with being the gateway for all communication with us and was either extremely vague or mathematically incompetent whenever he discussed the requirements for what would be delivered. When paired together, these things often mean that bad things will happen. To make things worse, this guy was intentionally insulting because he could get away with it. After all, he is a paying customer.  
  
**The Pledge:**  
The client paid us for a piece of work where we made a custom API which we expose on our SOAP interface. It was a good feature, and one which our sales representatives had probably been told to try and get a client to fund for quite some time. Implementing it was a nightmare because they had added some complex functionality in their requirements document just before they signed it off. All my best attempts to try to resolve inconsistencies and make it work logically fell on deaf ears and eyes that refuse to read emails. One exchange with Douche on this topic went thus:  
  
&gt;*Me:* Hi Douche, its Derp at &lt;Company&gt;. Just calling abou...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Oh hi, yeah, the slacker at &lt;Company&gt;. Hows it going?  
  
It should be pointed out that we were slightly behind schedule because there were a number of outstanding issues in the database procedure behind the call, hence why this was obviously MY fault.  
  
&gt;*Me (biting my tongue):* I'm... I'm OK... thanks. Just calling about your requirements on the API which you sent throu...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Oh this again? Haven’t you finished that yet?  
  
&gt;*Me:* Well, no. You'll remember that we've delayed it due to some issues with the procedure which you've been infor...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Oh for the love of.. Why is it taking so long?  
  
&gt;*Me:* That's what I wanted to ask about. Requirement 6.5.12 says its supposed to calculate X but lower down it states the maths you want it to use. The problem is that this equation doesn't actually represent that val...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Look, you're supposed to follow the specification I'VE written, so just do it! I don't want to hear about this again until its done!  
  
The next day my boss tells me that Douche complained about me to his account manager, saying that I was being offensive and was questioning his competency. (He can read minds?!?) I then completed this piece of work, ensuring that his specification was followed to every exact instruction.   
  
**The Turn:**  
After the best part of 6 months, and the client is about to go live with their site. They've been trying to sort out their own internal testing teams and third parties for such a long time that we ended up completing the work a full 5 months before they were even able to test it, and at this point they were going live in 3 days because that's when their marketing campaign said it would. Because of these tight deadlines, they signed it off in our Acceptance Testing sandbox and we considered the work to be complete. I had all but forgotten that previous conversation with Douche.  
  
About 3pm Friday afternoon, Greg from CS calls me up says he's got an issue with Douche. Greg now knows first hand how douchy Douche can be. This is because after our work was completed and promoted to our live system, any issues they had integrating were not development issues, but customer support issues.  
  
I make my way over to CS land and this is where things get fun.  
  
&gt;*Me:* 'Sup Greg? (sipping my coffee because these usually involve a long conversation about the functionality of features)  
  
&gt;*Greg:* Hey Derp.You ever worked on this new API that went up for &lt;Client_Name&gt;?  
  
&gt;*Me:* Yeah, I did the verification process on it. What do you want to know?  
  
&gt;*Greg:* The Client seems to think it doesn't work.  
  
&gt;*Me:* It was implemented to the letter. Plus other clients have been picking it up and using it since it went out, haven't they?  
  
&gt;*Greg:* Yeah, that's what I thought when I read the documentation. Ok, leave it with me and I'll let Douche know.  
  
I head back to my desk and start pulling out all the documentation I have on this feature because I know exactly what's coming next. After not too long, Steve (the account manager for Douche) storms into QA and straight into Boss' office. There's a lot of shouting and raised voices and eventually I'm called in.   
  
&gt;*Steve:* Would you care to explain this?  
  
Steve points at an email on Boss' screen. I go in for a closer inspection and it's an email from Douche claiming that their launch is probably going to be a disaster because the API has “obviously not been tested at all”. I'm surprised Steve believes this because he knows me and I've worked on various projects for him in the past.  
  
&gt;*Me:* I was firmly told my Mr Douche that I was to implement it to the specification.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* But the reporting section of the response that comes out is utter nonsense! It doesn't make sense!  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Derp, what did the specification say about this?  
  
&gt;*Me:* I can grab the documentation from my desk if you like.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* I think that would be a good idea.  
  
I go and fetch the documents and all the eyes in the department are on me, wanting to know what's going on. On the way back, I see Boss trying to calm Steve down.  
  
&gt;*Me:* Here it is.  
  
I slide it across the desk and take a seat. Steve and Boss scan through it and find where it talks about these reporting figures and wait to be spoken to. Steve turns a little pale and Boss smiles.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* But that makes no sense!  
  
&gt;*Me:* I know.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* Why didn't you raise this with the client?  
  
&gt;*Me:* I did. I then was accused of insulting the client’s project manager and calling him incompetent.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Who wrote this specification?  
  
&gt;*Me:* Douche over on their side did. I'm pretty sure you two would have been CC'd on the email when it came across.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* Well what are we going to do? We have to fix this before they go live on Sunday! (it's now 3:45 Friday Afternoon)  
  
&gt;*Boss:* No chance. We only release new code on Monday or Tuesday unless it's a priority 1 issue. Even then, this is an API that multiple clients are now using and we'll have to be careful not to break their integrations.  
  
&gt;*Me:* Steve, You might want to look at section 21 on that document.  
  
Steve quickly flicks to this section of the documentation where the final clause states how any modifications to this constitute as a change request and chargeable work. Steve is much more calm because he knows his ass is covered. That and I've made him some serious commission from clauses like that in the past.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* OK, wait there.  
  
Steve now stands a chance to make a considerable amount of commission. The client wrote the requirements, signed off the requirements, signed off the work in Acceptance Testing, and have only 32 hours before they launch. They will be willing to pay a significant sum to fund the overtime required from personnel to get this straight.  
  
**The Prestige:**  
It's 4:45 and I am considering what I'll spend my weekend doing. Boss walks out of his office and comes over to me.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Can you just join me on a conference call?  
  
&gt;*Me:* If it's quick.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* That's up to you really.  
  
Intrigued, I follow him into his office where I can hear a much more humble sounding Douche on the phone, explaining to Steve what needs to be done.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Steve, I have Derp here, do you want to explain what the plan is?  
  
&gt;*Steve:* Derp, we really need to get this sorted. You worked on the original feature so you'll know the best way to test this. We're still working on getting someone to develop the change but we'll be willing to pay you triple time this evening and tomorrow to work on this for Sunday. We reckon we can do this patch without any impact to our other clients.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* I really need you to help me out here mate, otherwise it'll really hit the fan over here.  
  
I pause and enjoy this brief moment of pure justice.  
  
&gt;*Me:* I've already made plans for this weekend and...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Derp, seriously, you HAVE to help me out here.  
  
&gt;*Me:* I don’t really feel like it.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* WELL SOMEONE NEEDS TO FIX THIS!!  
  
&gt;*Boss:* It's 5pm on a Friday. Most staff are on their way home or out the door. Sorry Steve but it looks like it'll have to wait until next week.  
  
Douche rages down the phone and, once this torrent of abuse subsides, Steve lets me go back to my desk.
I'm packing up for the end of the day and my phone rings.  
  
&gt;*Me:* &lt;Company&gt;, Derp spea...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Please, I need you to do this.  
  
&gt;*Me:* You need to sort this out and calling me won't help you.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Please, I'm sorry, just help me out.  
  
&gt;*Me:* You have been extremely rude to me and insulted me whenever we've spoken. Your failure to listen to me is the sole reason you're here right now. I did exactly what you asked and you have treated me with contempt every step of the way. I am not helping you.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Please...  
  
He's actually crying. You can hear it in the way his voice is all shaky. So I hang up and leave for my weekend.  
  
**The Reveal:**  
Monday rolls around and Steve introduces me to a new project manager for the client who's organising the fix to the API.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* So, Derp, this is Herp. Another project manager for &lt;Client_Name&gt;.  
  
&gt;*Me:* Is Douche not working on this project?  
  
&gt;*Herp:* Douche no longer works here.  
  
Tl;DR: Douche PM for client writes Spec for API. SPROC logic makes no sense, PM thinks he's infallible. QA Tech questions logic, gets reported for being insulting. Client doesn't test the API, signs it off anyway. It hits the fan, release date is ruined. PM is in DEEP and pleads for help.

1363778698.0,2097,self.talesfromtechsupport,1annxl,The B**** Manager from Hell Pt6: Marking territories,4561,2464,145,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1annxl/the_b_manager_from_hell_pt6_marking_territories/,"As I closed the door on my cozy warm house on a bitterly frosty Thursday morning, clutching my car keys in one hand and a small plastic scraper in the other, I immediately regretted my decision of not purchasing gloves the previous night while shopping. My car bellowed smoke as it churned into life as my red cracking knuckles powered the scraper into the solid ice on the car windows. The fact I had purchased a Ford for it's clever quick-clear windscreen technology just seemed to mock me more as the damned thing was had failed to operate at all over the last few days.

I made it to work and felt rather disappointed with the turn-out of animal rights protesters - the promise of an impending and very visual protest outside the gates of the center as emailed by HR seemed rather overkill as I spied a single figure waving a poorly legible placard from near the gate, being carefully watched by two security guards. It seemed a rather poor effort!

I duly parked my car in the usual spot next to a brand new looking Jaguar. I admired its sleek lines and somewhere in the back of my head, thought that one of these days, all this toil will be worth it!

Exchanging early morning pleasantries with various security guards, I arrived at my desk and removing my jacket, the cold radiating outward. I couldn't help but notice a familiar stern sniff. Jesus... Angie was here before me!? There I was hoping for at least an hour or two of recovery from this morning's voyage before having her in my face.

Mere moments had I sat down to get my machine warmed, I reached into my drawer for my coffee cup only to find Angie standing right next to me, her stature akin to that of a Hitchcock serial killer. Armed with her coffee cup, she placed it on my desk, dragged over a nearby chair and sat with notebook in hand. 

""Can I help?"" I politely inquired. ""I want to see what you get up to in the morning!"". I motioned towards my empty coffee cup, but she meant business! ""You can get your tea later! I want to see what you're going to do first; open the paper program!"" (She meant TouchPaper...)

The next two hours was like being dragged over icy knives naked! I had started the day with eleven open tickets, six of which I knew were long ones and had already made appointments to service that day. The other five I could knock out easily while waiting for builds to finish thus leaving plenty time free to pick up anything new that came in. 

Angie's plan was for me to pretty much assign myself almost every open ticket - even those not to do with 2nd line Support. My colleagues started to arrive one by one and on seeing this spectacle, shrunk into their seats, trying to root out any ticket which would mean escaping their desks and the vicinity of Angie. 

By 11 o'clock, my queue looked like a ticket-bomb had gone off. 47 open tickets! Crikey - what was I meant to be doing this morning? Angie had retreated back to her lair as Middle-Aged Family Guy sent me a quick communicator message, ""Do you want me to have a look at some of those cases for you?"" I duly replied whatever he fancied doing, go for it. 

After taking a couple of password resets, Angie's snarl came from her desk... ""Jon6, I did not tell you to make others do your work for you! MAFG, if you have nothing to do, I am more than happy to GIVE you something to do!"" MAFG quickly retreated back to his own call list without saying a word. 5 motionless minutes elapsed, until Angie walked up to MAFG and ordered him to accompany her. They disappeared into the murky depths of the corridor, swallowed by the blackness to some horrible fate.

I decided to keep to my plan that day. I retrieved five machines from leavers' desks and made for the IT Cupboard to get them re-imaged for some imminent arrivals and replacements. I sat in the dimly lit room as the unattended scripts did their bit; I had a rep's laptop in several bits to replace a faulty screen before he would leave for a flight. 

The sound of the security badge failing in the electronic lock, followed by the sincere knock on the door, thrice performed, meant it could only have been one person. Up until now, although she knew it existed, Angie had no idea how to get to this place much less have access to it. Putting on my pro-face, I duly opened the door. Immediately, Angie went for the neck, a starbucks tall firmly clasped in her bony fingers, eyes like a spear!

""What are you doing in here? Why aren't you at your desk? What is going on in here?""

I politely showed her around the IT Cupboard, though what I really wanted to do was batter her with bits of Dell laptop and bury her somewhere in with the junk P133 Viglens, kept only for laboratories and their outdated gear. The prospect of me attempting to fit her bitter bony body into a fullsize tower also crossed my mind. Not happy with my explanation (there's a surprise), she ordered me back to desk despite my protests that the rep was expecting their laptop back before leaving today for his flight to whereeverthehell, and the fact that the machines I was imaging needed to be on desks by close of business.

Planted at my desk, she left me there with a ""Now get on with your work and don't let me catch you again!"" I felt impotent. Time for a reaction. I figured, if the above work doesn't happen, I'm in it with several department heads. If I go back, I'm in it with Angie. So, I fired an email to Balding IT Head, CC'ing in Angie, asking for direction. It read, ""I have work going on in the IT cupboard which requires resolution. Angie has made it clear that I am not to return to the IT cupboard. Can you please provide direction as to how this work should be completed?""

Mere seconds after I signed my fate, Angie frog-marched me and some spotty helpdesk kid back to the IT Cupboard. She ordered us complete the work as she watched and verified every step. Of course, spotty helpdesk kid had no idea what any of these 2nd line processes were about and questioned nearly every stage. An hour later we were finished and went our seperate ways to re-deploy our efforts. As I walked away with two machines and a laptop bag slung, she said ""I want you back at your desk in ten minutes, don't let me come looking for you!""

That afternoon, Angie sent us all an email! We couldn't help but imagine it read aloud by her razor sharp tongue, each paragraph almost lyrical in its context. Her order was that the IT Cupboard is no longer to be used for any sort of maintenance or work; it is for storage of computing equipment only. Having recently learned that her circle of ""bitter women in positions of power that drink too much Starbucks coffee"" also included some oversized tank of a HR Administrator, the icing to the cake was present and correct citing health and safety violations and that any further activities would be referred to management for disciplinary.

A few of us held vigil over our lost IT Cupboard as we watched several burly men from facilities tear down our nest. The glorious ghost server which held all our builds slammed onto a trolley, ready for its trip back to the server room; our beautifully installed network cabling and network switch was unceremoniously ripped from the wall and tossed into a rubbish old box; our carefully ordered and neatly packed away toolkits were also in a box, it seemed that they had been claimed in the name of facilities; our electric kettle, together with a tin containing our hotel and restaurant liberated packs of tea bags, coffee, sugar and dairy creamers were tossed into a black bag headed for the skip.

We discussed the predicament in depth. How would we image machines with a three-item limit on our desks? Where would we go to dismantle machines to replace or upgrade hardware? These sentiments were later echoed when one of the server admins asked ""I notice the ghost server is on a trolley in one of the network riser rooms; I thought you guys needed that for building machines?"" Yeah... we did too!

My shift ended and I made for the sanctuary of my car, again a thick layer of ice and snow serving to only impede my progress. I again noticed the brand new Jaguar which had miraculously seemed immune from the effects of this brutal British summer. You can all predict who was behind the wheel. Angie glanced as she noticed me approach over her black leather steering wheel, no smile or acknowledgement. She reversed out of her space as her shining black Jag powered her away from my presence; her work for the day was done.

Thorougly deflated, I clicked my Ford Mondeo's remote key. Strange, the remote wouldn't work. I put the key into the lock and the central locking groaned into life. Sitting into my ice pit, realizing the water that had leaked from the roof onto my seat had now frozen, a quick turn of the key also revealed that it also wouldn't start. A few more tries and there could only be one culprit. My reward from the day's toil was one flat battery and an hour waiting for the RAC Recovery person to arrive and give me a jump start. Bang goes my early leaving time.

Several more instances of Angie's managerial style being put into action came and went. However, I still had tickets building up which needed build area time. Realising BHIT was ineffective in offering a solution, I tried and failed to sweet-talk third line into segregating some of their server room space for machine builds. I turned my attention to our so-far more than amenable post-room guys. But it seems I was slightly pushing it at the prospect of wheeling our server in there. The request was met with more displeasure at our storing new laptops and bags in there already.

The answer flooded towards me one day when Angie, Fat Finance wench, unnaturally skinny finance wench and the HR Tank took off for their near twice daily trip to Starbucks. I heard them gossiping about their new coffee related discovery on their way out. See, they have to take baby steps otherwise HR Tank will break out in tonnes of sweat. But, so I hear, ginger shots in lattes are simply gorgeous! 

Angie's seemless change in personality between her dealings with us and her friends still resonated around the team with astonishment. It was just odd to hear this scorpion do nothing but treat us like shit all day, but then with friends actually smile and be human. But, my time came to put my diabolical ""fuck you"" plan into action!

Like batman with a purpose, I ran round the office building like a thing possessed! I had a third liner retrieve our imprisoned Ghost server from the network riser room and patched up some network ports. I finished phase 1 of my mission with an email to Angie requesting several parts from the IT Cupboard just as she returned, stinking of coffee and biscotti. She accepted my request with a disinterested but reassuredly managerial style.

Monday morning. Car defrosted, it's time to get the hammers on! I'm at work early for phase 2.

Quiet Blonde Girl (QBG) always seemed to fly under Angie's radar. I did initially suspect her to be our rat as she has a tendancy to be popular with higher up types. Though I would say a lot of that would be hormonal. Her arrival in Helpdesk was a little perplexing as nobody - not even the helpdesk manager - had even interviewed her. Similarly, her record quick transfer to 2nd line was equally enigmatic. I think we were just lucky that QBG was actually a decent worker and learned quickly. Underhandedness? Personally, I think more cleavage-related! 

All suspicions of her being a mole were slightly dispelled one lunch hour when she launched into a seething verbal attack about Angie; the sort of stuff that had it ever been heard by anyone with power would have definitely landed QBG with her P45 (the sack). However, Monday was to be her day. She had done some extraordinarily terrible thing and it was time for her to feel Angie's wrath. And, female to good looking female, Angie was in no way going to let her off lightly! 

But, I was ready and waiting for Angie.

Angie, with QBG in tow, opened door to her dungeon of dispair with an angered and authoritative fling. She stood in the doorway sideways, motioning for QBG to enter. 

Her attention was soon diverted. There was I, several machines imaging on top of the file cabinets, two further machines lay dissected on the table and a studious and official amount of paperwork lay with my blue ballpoint nestled neatly on top. 

I said with a slightly officialised and victorious tone, ""Can I help you at all?""

Angie's face turned red as a small vein on the side of her temple bulged; leaving QBG outside, she closed the door and turned her attention to me. Her sharpness was echoed in the warming meeting room amidst the blur of machines. ""Who gave you permission to do this?""

My short simple reply amounted to ""Nobody; I used my initiative. We have no build areas anymore, customers are waiting on their machines!"" Knowing that there was nothing she could do, she left the room with ""I'll be checking on you later!"". 

As the door closed, it was obvious QBG had returned to her desk, assuming she had escaped capture. No such luck. Angie's venomous streak played out as she called across to her in a way one would talk to a 5 year old with a simple ""Hey you! Here!"" as her bony finger pointed downwards. QBG obliged with this demand as Angie simply stated ""This one is taken; come with me""

The door closed completely, leaving only me and my machines. I felt like some sort of mad professor finally alone in my domain.

Angie was usurped. I relaxed in my new man-cave, all manner of industriousness going on. MAFG even swung by minutes later for a victorious high-five, the smiles from other team members shining through the open door like lighthouses. 

I think I just further angered Angie more when I came out to the team that ""The room has been booked all week, but there's plenty space. Feel free to use it, back to business as usual!"". I think it was the last part. Angie's hand froze as she amateurishly moved the mouse around the screen in her attempts to find the Outlook icon again.

In a way, I did sort of feel sorry for Angie. My girlfriend's hypothesis of a lone female trying to make it in man's world resonated a little. That was until she turned around and demanded we kept the noise down, people are trying to work! Her snap only reaffirmed her brittleness.

Though something told me that I hadn't heard the last of this. One thing you will learn too about women in positions of power who aren't cut out for the job. They always win. No matter how much you think you've had the upper hand, they still win. 

I returned to my desk to reply to some emails, leaving my machines image in my cave, claimed in the name of man! I couldn't help bu wonder if this would eventually be QBG's fate; socially promoted as guys in positions of power like the eye candy until she gets to a stage where she is truly out of her depth, only able to rely on her position of authority to motivate her staff.

As it happens, I was dead right. My moment of victory was surprisingly cut short...

1349897285.0,2065,self.talesfromtechsupport,119n3q,My boss finally got to use this phrase!,2635,570,427,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/119n3q/my_boss_finally_got_to_use_this_phrase/,"So I came into work today and I had an email marked **urgent!* in outlook.

It seems that the ""End Of Fiscal Year"" inventory is due at the end of this week and they need some information.  

We use IBM Tivoli Endpoint Manager (purchased from a company called BigFix) for our inventory stuff (and patching, etc) so I ask what information they need.

&gt; We just need all the boxes that run websphere and their versions...

Well, that information isn't just sitting in a text file on the servers. A batch file on each box will output the information for us, and we can just pipe it into a text file, but that would require us to touch each box or push out a fixlet to do it (we obviously decided to do the latter).

After that text file is generated we can parse the information from the text file and put it in web reports (another IBM purchase from BigFix). It should be easy. (I never should have said that).

I tell them that this won't be a problem. It will take me an hour or two to set up the fixlet and the analysis for web reports, but it will probably take a day for Tivoli to gather all the relevant boxes, another day to push the action to them (we have 150k+ endpoints), and then at least 4 hours for the analysis to parse the text files and pull the version information.

Well, this is unacceptable. Their part of the report is due by End of Day and they only need some ""quick and simple"" information.

I inform them that there really isn't a way to push it any faster even if I babysit it and I do not have access to these boxes so I can't just run the batch files manually.

Well, at this point they decide to have a chat with my boss and it precipitates a meeting.

We're all sitting around the table and they tell my boss: 

&gt; Craysh has been willfully unhelpful in helping us get some easily accessed information. He gave us an eta of 2 1/2 days before he could even get to it, and this is important!

He asked me what was going on, and being familiar with Tivoli himself (as well as our environment) he understood exactly what would take so long.  He turned to the inventory group and said:

&gt; This is how long it will take to get this information parsed out. He's not stringing you along, it's just how our infrastructure will work. Once it's in place it will take at most 4 hours between updating the versioning information and it will be available to you any time you need it.

They respond:

&gt; That is totally unacceptable. We need this information in be the end of the day!

My boss responded: 

&gt; Your lack of planning does not constitute an emergency on our part.

I got chills.

1363944884.0,2065,self.talesfromtechsupport,1ashkr,The B**** Manager from Hell Pt12: Who needs minor victories...,4855,2790,224,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1ashkr/the_b_manager_from_hell_pt12_who_needs_minor/,"The inevitable consequence of heading to bed the second you get home is that the morning tends to come quicker than you expected. I arrived bleary eyed not truly knowing what fresh hell Angie was about to concoct that day. My fate was postponed as Angie was busy providing a critique of every detail as QuietBlondeGirl rearranged her desk to Angie's preference. It became apparent that Angie had taken issue to some typical girlie deskwear and was ordering it be suitably secreted in desk drawers or disposed of.

A grim reminder of another of yesterday's ordeals came in the shape of an email from HR Tank demanding to know when her ""new faster"" computer would be delivered. Not only was HRT's computer perfectly fine, it was only 10 months old and not due for replacement for two years. This, I knew, was an argument I would have to save for later. I logged a ticket and moved on.

BHIT arrived in just after me and made a pit-stop at my desk. He must have felt it his duty to appear interested over my late night last night. His pale head seemed to silhouette against the dimly lit office lighting. I grabbed the opportunity like a child with a new toy and demanded that we resolve this build area problem immediately. With Angie trapped in her reprimand of QBG, I knew I was stealing her thunder!

""This is getting just stupid now. Customers are complaining about us doing hardware replacements and rebuilds at the desk side, what's more they're taking longer as we've had to use USB Hard disks for builds since the Ghost server went missing; we have six machines now that nobody knows where they are; the networking gear has also gone missing; What annoys me is that all this was working perfectly fine while we had our build area. So the fact remains, you need to sort this out now. We have a major rollout project coming up, sort it out!""

My concern echoed with my vocal severity; BHIT was well and truly put in his place. I could feel Angie wincing as I had beaten her to the punch. BHIT's bald head nodded as he claimed he understood. With every nod, a ceiling light just slightly came into view as he stood over my desk, almost cowering behind the green partition. It was about damn time he took this on board! BHIT walked away with the weight of the world on his shoulders. He knew I was right, he knew he had to step in. 

I sat at my desk uncomfortably, the newly recovered bleach-smelling Ghost Server had found temporary shelter home under my desk where my legs should go; the PSU fan blew hot air, almost providing some relief from the cold - a small yet powerful offering from the inanimate object almost thanking me for its rescue. The prize was doubly exciting as for first time in many weeks, my overnight WhatsAlive script proudly showed Ghost Server as now being rejoined to the network, like a soldier's homecoming. It's location? Switch 303B, port 19, area ITS.

I busied myself that morning by staying rooted to my desk, firing out responses to some of my tickets. In part, I wanted to make sure BHIT was doing his job, but I also wanted to see how Angie would react to having the rug pulled out from under her again! 

An hour rolled by and Angie was still busy reprimanding the team. She had worked out - or been shown - how to properly use TouchPaper and its accompanying stats screens! The evidence of an inter-team rat was all too clear as Angie, who could barely use Outlook, could never have worked out TouchPaper to this degree. Nevertheless, this rat would have to be discovered at a later date!

Tea in hand, I rolled up to BHIT's desk for progress. Finally, he had some news. I was to report to facilities so they could show me some rooms. I picked up my Napalm Death fleece to embark on my fantastic voyage. But, the familiar loud rattle of Angie's keys disappearing into her small leather handbag accompanied her bony figure as it stood up to place a black and grey shawl around her veiny neck. 

""Right, let's go"" she proclaimed, as if to usurp leadership of my mission. BHIT cowered behind his computer screen rather than face confrontation. What could I say? I felt the next hour of efficient decision making suddenly hampered as Angie set off to Facilities, as if dragging me by my ear like a scolded schoolboy!

After the Facilities Manager had led us to our third room visit, it soon became clear what Angie thought constituted a suitable room. She wanted something near to the main office so she could check up on us regularly, difficult to work in and not much space. Ironically, the meeting room would have fit Angie's specifications exactly!

I wanted something near the IT Cupboard for supplies - access was another battle I was soon to wage - plenty space and somewhere away from the freezing cold Aircon vents. 

We finally came upon Angie's ideal. The only access was a flight of stairs - just short enough in number to appear inconsequential, yet just ever so slightly add enough inconvenience to keep this bitter woman happy. Add to the annoyance of not being able to get a trolley up them, they were just narrow enough to ensure scraped knuckles in the event of anything bulky! This would be enough for Angie to know that this place would be a last resort - no longer a fort of solitude when the outside world became too much!

The room itself was just about big enough for a couple of desks and right above the door hummed the icy cold draft of the Aircon vent. ""This is totally unsuitable! Any one of the first few rooms would be fine!"" I protested. Angie completely ignored me as her bitter face spat out, ""This will do!"". The Facilities manager looked perplexed at Angie's decision. Rather than argue it, he just agreed and muttered something about arranging access and desks.

I knew this would happen. I relayed our adventure to ITS as Angie disappeared off for another Starbucks run with her Menopause group. Their faces looked angry. Calls of ""Out of all the rooms you just saw, Angie picked some shithole that's basically gone unused for years?"" Rather than offer an explanation, I merely motioned in the direction of BHIT, still cowering behind his monitor. 

I could see none of my colleagues were going to speak up. It'd have to be me again. Fine. ""BHIT..."" I started. He almost winced behind his monitor - he knew what was coming. ""Can you come and join us for a second?""

After regaling yet again what had just transpired, BHIT seemed like he was mustering all the courage that he could. As I continued let loose on what a stupid decision Angie had made, together with her obvious attempts to prevent the team actually working, he dug deep one last time. With a quivering yet determined voice, he said ""I thought I told YOU to get a new build room sorted out? Well, which one do YOU want?"" I looked back at my crew and just said, ""Well, actually, the IT Cupboard was perfect! It's got a window, it's worked fine for years, there's plenty storage; In fact it's only called a cupboard because there's racking and shelving in there! I also have an email you sent to Fat Tony from 3rd line when he was on 2nd authorizing the use of the Cupboard and having facilities convert part of it for workspace...""

Sometimes, the odd swift half after work with monkeys in other teams can pay dividends ;)

""Leave it with me!"" said BHIT as he made for the doorway. ITS smiled at me, but deep down I shat a brick; I've really done it now. If I wind up getting BHIT to relinquish the chains on our beloved cupboard, I can only imagine what sort of games Angie will play with that one. But I was pleased. For once, I was up where she didn't know I was up! She was out with a bunch of menopausal women, blissfully unaware, sipping her insipid Starbucks Coffee, somehow providing life support for her scrawny architecture...

I decided I didn't care about Angie's reaction anymore. I'd won a major victory. Now, to just let the day play out. I wonder what Monday Morning will bring?

We all know what happens when we assume, right?

Yep. Turns out ""ribbon"" meant ""typewriter ribbon."" Professor Selectric was having trouble replacing the ribbon and type ball. Lucky for him, typewriters are a hobby of mine, and I had the Selectric humming away in a matter of minutes.

Despite this feeling of ensuing doom, it was an oddly upbeat kind of day. The morning sun was subdued as it accompanied the first warm day of the year and seemed to fill the office with naturally warming UV light. News of our remarkable failure flurried around the office as eyes stalked my path from the lobby to my desk. 

As my Outlook churned into gear, it presented several new emails to look at; I was only waiting for one. The ominous calendar entry from our eminent Sales Director was present as expected, decorated with the high-importance flag. I spent the morning glancing through my tickets, though I really had no intention of doing any of them.

Angie appeared around her usual 10am. Her pace was rushed and the lack of her signatory Starbucks cup distinguished Angie’s obvious apprehension. “Care to explain what happened yesterday?” Her condescending vocal tone was different this time. Before, harsh and snappy like a loathsome strict teacher, a faint quiver existed somewhere in the background. “I don’t know!” I responded. For once I seemed to be in the power position. “I don't feel I was involved in this project!” She pressed for further information, her voice taking on her signatory snarl and gripe.

HR Tank, accompanied by an anonymous administrative orderly, unexpectedly appeared to relieve me of this interrogation. She demanded the immediate presence of the entire ITS department in the nearest meeting room. Again, our walking pace to the meeting room seemed exaggeratedly slow, a homage to HR Tank’s slow purposeful walk. I stood in the corner of the room only finally noticing the distinct lack of BHIT. 

HR Tank began to speak through her reddened face, fatigued from her trip. Her drained voice read her palpably pre-prepared and rubber-stamped statement from a sheet which seemed to also serve as a barrier of defence. “It has been decided,” she began “that due to incongruences that have arisen in the department of late that BHIT is no longer able to fulfil his duty as Head of IT; He will therefore not be returning to the business!” Her statement droned on with all the officialdom you would expect from such a legally exacting statement. Her statement ended with “I am authorized to answer any questions at this point”. 

The ITS team shuffled out, dazed and wounded. For his spinelessness, BHIT had evidently had all our backs somewhere along the line. We took our seats, like a pack of wounded animals returning from some failed hunt. Angie remained with HR Tank discussing an imminent Starbucks trip as Roland stood guard in her absence. We all sat still and silent, in one way to mark the demise of BHIT and, in the other, we felt that the slightest motion would be recorded and later used against us as evidence. The fact that BHIT had evidently taken the fall for the whole thing just seemed unreal. Angie’s consistent belittling and hateful nature just seemed to be the only outlook, we were shellshocked that she had apparently won!

The post-rollout meeting time came up. As Angie, Roland and I made our way to the top floor in the elevator, the air grew thick with scorn. The silence bellowed like a thousand years of social indifference, as if the slightest word could ignite the situation like a megaton bomb. It seemed like ages until the lift doors finally opened. Angie and Roland obnoxiously barged out of the lift, though I had yielded to them anyway.

This was my first time in front of an official board. The room layout had changed. The Sales and Marketing managers sat in a row along the centre line of the arranged desk, flanked by the conspicuous presence of HR Tank and another woman who it seemed was there to take notes. Cantering the congregation was a man whose obverse mannerism exuded the confidence and exterior meant he was someone of importance. 

Angie, Roland and I took up position in front of this jury of VIPs. Our plastic chairs clanged and noisily bent into form to exemplify their cheapness, an extreme contrast to the leather-bound pews claimed by the panel. The central character, who it soon became apparent was the division manager, opened with a speech akin to that of some great dictator. His appraisal of the utter failure intensified as his voice raised in volume, yet remained controlled and collected. It was like he needed to say everything he needed to say like some pre-interrogation tactic.

The panel would interview us one at a time. I remained sat outside the office with Roland as Angie pleaded her case as ITS manager. Memories of sitting outside the school principal’s office at school seemed came flooding back. Though I had never really been a bad kid, I found myself winding up outside the head’s office a few times - a Catholic warden clad in black whose manifestation was intended solely to scare straight. Roland sat with a smirk, apparently unconcerned with these on-going. His motionless gaze made me think that this guy had far more experience explaining himself to school principals than me.

Roland was up next. Angie sat in the seat Roland vacated. Her arrogant indifference mirrored Roland’s posture with eerie exactness. I began to grow worried; Angie was always one step ahead of any game currently in progress. Thoughts of explaining my job loss to my other half, thoughts of having to job-hunt made me nervous.

After an hour of waiting patiently, my time was finally up. I sat central to the panel trying to remember every interview technique that had ever been drilled into me by any chance I’d previously had to take such advice on board. I made sure to look at the person who was addressing me, back straight, shoulders back. Here we go!

The panel had their tactics down. It seemed no one person would ask more than one question at a time. The questions came slow, strategically calm and collected. The lady on the end of the panel appeared to note everything I said as the panel would wait for her silent OK to continue. At this moment, I was ready to hang Angie and her bastard youth out to dry! I just waited for my chance.

After the initial questions, largely surrounding who planned what, the director placed his pen in front of him. He placed his elbows on the table as he leaned his hardened chin on his first and second fingers, mirrored and extended to provide support. As he leaned in, he said, “Tell us, in your own words, you account of what happened”.

I relayed my entire saga, from Angie’s commandeering of the project plan, Roland’s inauguration to being responsible for the images, our flawed and hapless manner of couriering laptops instead delivering at the conference – all of it. I finished, almost spitting out my words, exercising this demon called Angie. One of the sales managers enquired, “Why didn’t you check anything before you built them?” I defended “There was no time to do that. They had been built and QA’d by Roland who apparently knew what he was doing. We had 200 machines to build and no means to verify anything!”

I couldn’t tell if I had impressed with my answer or not. The thick silence felt like a poorly performing job interview. “Why did you believe Roland fully equipped to manage this implementation?” The weightiness of their questioning became stronger. “I didn’t!” responding inadvertently with a tone similar to Angie’s impertinent and self-aggrandizing sneer. “I followed the direction of my management. I was told to leave him alone, I did!” The MD passed me a copy of my rollout plan. “Was this the rollout plan you followed?” I picked it up, glancing through the already familiar pages I had spent several days perfecting, re-enumerating before my final presentation. 

I looked up and said, “No! Angie altered the specification several times. The final version was signed off, I believe, by everyone here!” I felt like I had delivered a blow to everyone in the room who could even slightly have been rooting for me, as if I’d had twisted the knife in the very same way Angie had done to claw her way to the top!

After 30 minutes of grilling, I left the room. Angie and Roland had long vacated leaving the empty seats, their emptiness like some satirical congratulatory prize. HR Tank had concluded the meeting, thanking me for my time, ordering me back to my duties.

ITS was silent for the remainer of the day, juxtaposed against the now brilliant developing sun, obviously out of place in Britain’s Spring but seemed to invite action and good times contrasting against our office-prisoner mood. Angie and Roland were stealthy silent against the humanistic blur and shuffle of the ITS inhabitants as they adjusted their postures to comfort. The only reprieve came from Angie’s regular group ushering her to their second of their Starbucks trips, this time joined by Roland. The escape of my 4pm leaving time couldn’t have come quickly enough; I made for home, wondering if I would ever set foot in ITS again.

The crystal clear night sky gave birth to another sunny day. The grime and dirt that incrusted my car seemed to beg for a good washing and detailing session. It was relieving to have at least one thing on my list to occupy my time on the end of a dole queue. As I approached the car park gates of the pharmaceutical giant, I wondered if security would deny access to their fortress. I envisaged ramming the gate in some movie-like attempt to exact my revenge to dance on Angie’s decrepit corpse. 15 months of this woman was too much for anyone to deal with.

As I uneventfully descended the giant lobby stairs towards ITS, I expected to be bundled to the floor at any moment by all manner of burly security guards to the approving look of Angie. I was convinced this woman was far too street-smart to be outdone by anything! Almost disappointedly, ITS remained unmolested in its usual ground-floor spot. My Windows login worked, as I began to prepare for the day’s work.

I arrived back from lunch with several members of third line and our previously borrowed helpdesk guy, still licking his wounds from the onslaught of sales reps. QBG met us on our way down. She smiled wryly, excitedly yet softly declaring ""Angie’s packing her desk! She’s history!”

I didn’t believe her. I had to see this with my own eyes! 

I sat down, maintaining as detached an outlook as I could, pretending not to notice as Angie wrapped her scaly neck in the familiar black and grey shawl. Roland’s desk, surprisingly, also lay vacated. Angie disregarded the looks from ITS as she picked up her leather clutch bag and made for the exit. 

“Is she gone? Was she fired?” A fervour of questions engulfed our modest team. As we excitedly theorized and conjectured, we eventually realized that there were only questions - no answers. This tumultuous turn of events did nothing to allay my own fears. I tied myself to my desk, waiting for someone – anyone – to order me into a closed doors meeting.

But, nobody came that day… nor the next…

Morale was at a low point and apart from Angie's bipolar temper, things seemed to slog along as they were, each day proving to be more and more difficult to get through. The IT Cupboard slowly relinquished its isolation as Angie seemed to track our movements with animal-like instinct, imposing ridiculous policy after policy. The battery indicator on MAFG's mouse had at some point faded to nothingness having spent its remaining energies fruitlessly lamenting its master’s disappearance.

MAFG sacrifice was guarded in its reasoning. Many theorized the lost machines from the meeting room had made it to his car; some theorized he’d wronged some director in a drunken moment of sincerity; there was even a rumour he had put Angie in her place in some magnificent fit of comeuppance, bathed in the flabbergasted stares of twenty faceless onlookers. The reality was far more boring and told to me over a weekend pint of fine ale. 

MAFG’s wife had previously worked with the company in their research division. She had left under explosive circumstances for a competing pharmaceutical company. Management felt that MAFG’s continued employment was incongruous and had compelled him to take a PILON agreement to end his tenure. It seemed odd that MAFG’s wife had left the company over six months ago; we felt that this discrepancy stank of Angie’s involvement.

For a while though, a specific date had shone brightly in my Outlook calendar. It had acted as a target, representing a reprieve from the mundane trivialities support had to offer. I had prepared for it arrival with jubilation. It finally arrived and my audience with several heads of sales/marketing, BHIT and the software vendor was mine to shine in. The purpose was to set into motion the plans for their large-scale laptop rollout. Armed with my carefully crafted number-work dutifully outlined on several handouts, I set off for the meeting, three floors up in the swankier part of the building. In my mind, I was Alexander the Great, sword raised in hand, off to conquer in what seemed to be an inevitable foregone conclusion. OK, I don’t know much about history, but all I knew was my sword was huge and I was about to go kick some ass!
 
My arrival at the meeting was met with the usual pleasantries and shaking of hands. The meeting room was perfectly air conditioned with several pieces of foliage standing elegantly in large ceramic plant pots. The large window welcomed the sun in vast quantities into the fragrant room. Underneath the heated rays of light was the ominous shape of Angie, sat at the far end of the room, away from all human contact. The sunlight seemed to darken and blur Angie's outline, like some satanic aura, but her bent, bitter frame was just too familiar and imposing to ignore.

The meeting began with the usual round of round-table identification. Angie’s snarled introduction was only suffixed by the words ""I am in charge of Support!"" Her declaration made an instant impression on everyone as they hastily moved on. The software vendor rep was a techy through and through. He stood for his presentation, draped in what was obviously a brand new suit purchased for the occasion. It seemed to contrive him as he awkwardly passed around his company endorsed paraphernalia; pens, cards, product sheets… there were logos on everything as if he was clearly instructed to embark on this endeavour but try to hide his obvious geekiness.

My segment came. I eagerly handed out my carefully crafted mission statement, adorned with pie charts, Gantt charts and technical jargon made just basic enough to empower even the most IT-illiterate of sales managers. I explained my intentions with a well-rehearsed speech which lasted several minutes: 212 new laptops and 57 to remain in the field. Across three hardware types; several primary targets were to be used for pilot testing; each user would receive an extra 100MB on Home drives and be responsible for their own backups; each rep's laptop would be first imaged for any later data retrieval and each rep would be re-furnished by the end of the day. 

Angie's eyes remained focused on me throughout the session. I felt odd as she hadn't interjected once. Our vendor's rep nodded in anticipation as rep after rep smiled in anticipation. They liked what they heard: new toys for everyone and all they had to do was give the all OK!

My moment of triumph at an end, Angie finally spoke up. ""What sort of manpower do we need for this?"" Her voice was rather different; she spoke as if I were part of her Menopause club, all harshness had dissipated into a normalized vocal tone. I retorted, putting aside my stunned silence, that I expected to prepare the images myself and builds would be used to train up some more junior members of staff in the absence of MAFG. She nodded in approval as she made notes. Her lack of typical Angie-style anger perturbed me. Nevertheless, the meeting ended in what appeared to be a climactic sense of collaboration as the Balding Head of IT smiled proudly, sharing all manner of manager-speak with his congregation

As the vendor techie and I exchanged pleasantries, Angie left anonymous in her wake without saying another word. I knew this move by now! Her silent departure was signatory of her underhandedness; she was up to something. It distracted me momentarily as I asked the vendor guy to repeat what he had just said… what was this devious cow up to?

I was not left in suspense for long. That afternoon, ITS were summoned to a meeting room where Angie wanted to discuss the rollout. I knew Angie was cooking something and I knew it was a clear move to usurp my finely laid plans. My only consolation was that I had the backing of BHIT and several higher-ups, what could she possibly do?

Our entrance into Angie’s meeting was made strange by the unexpected presence of a spotty urchin who had previously been chained to Helpdesk. His sharp eyes and pointed, thin facial features seemed disturbingly familiar, his unbranded shirt and pale jeans seemed to be a desperate attempt to look normal. Angie began the meeting by introducing the urchin, returning to her familiar intense vocal tone. “This is Roland. He is joining 2nd line today” she hissed as her eyes danced around the room as if to highlight her claim. 

The meeting continued with Angie’s voice droning my exact words, complete with inaccuracies one could only attribute to someone whose obvious depth had long-since been surpassed. I think at some point, the only thing keeping us awake was Angie’s voice, shrill and bent in character. She had finally finished when I decided to speak. I knew my interjection would further madden the beast, mainly as it would actually be of technical relevance and accuracy which Angie could never possibly dream of. But I had to stake my role in this project. 

“We’ll have the majority of the machines built prior to the event, so most will only need booting up and profiles loading. There will also be a ghost server, file server and we’ll have a connection back to the office. All out-of-field laptops will be backed up later back at the office, any laptops that are staying out will have to be backed up and loaded at the event in one hit. We’ll also keep ten spare new laptops just in case anything happens.”

The ITS crew hung on every word, as if I were mandating a life or death situation. Angie fired corrections in as much as she could, though mired in technical incompetence. “You will have to back up EVERYTHING you get!” her accusatory vocal sneer hinted that we may do anything different.

We had a mission, we had our tasks, I had a rollout to deliver. 

It was getting towards the end of the day. Roland had picked his spot next to me, taking MAFG’s spot. He was not talkative, he barely acknowledged anybody’s presence. A few banter-like quips intended to embroil him into our team didn’t get so much as a raised eyebrow. His body language was eerie in its familiarity.

Brandishing my purchase order, signed by BHIT and bearing Sales &amp; Marketing’s stamp approving the project with every endorsement that one could ever hope to see on such a document, I headed to the elevators to scale the heights to the Procurement department. I was joined in the elevator by QBG who seemed eager to have a word. It seemed QBG had some sort of big secret she would have burst if she hadn’t let out.

“Roland! You know who he is, don’t you?” QBG spoke softly, as if the lift were rigged with some manner of bugging equipment. “That’s Angie’s son!” Her words were difficult to believe… but Roland’s mannerisms, posture, familiar sharpness… it all rang out clear as a bell. The thought of this woman propagating seemed unnatural! It conjured images of some monstrous carnal act between a musty stick-insect and some hapless male donor entangled in her web, held prisoner for his seed. 

But, it all seemed too obvious now. Like a slow head-on car accident, everything started to make sense. There had to be someone who had shown Angie how to access TouchPaper; she was clearly still struggling with it a month on! Someone had to show Angie how to use the printers! Someone had to have fed back to Angie anything and everything we’d complained about her! Someone had to have kept Angie informed of our whereabouts – how else could she track us with such animal-like accuracy?

There he was - in the background the whole time, as enigmatic and as slimey as the bitch that spawned him. That same spotty 1st liner who Angie demanded I cleared down the IT Cupboard with so long ago, the insignificant shadow which seemed to appear every so often, as if every photographic memory which flashed into view had his image super-imposed somewhere on it… standing by a printer, walking through the ITS area, sitting nearby in the canteen… her spy, invisible to the naked eye!

As incredible as it seemed, there it was… our rat… Exposed far too late to be in any way wary, he was now closer than we could have ever imagined. We had allowed him to creep up on us like a ninja - Angie’s inside man!

There was work to do - but nothing seemed important enough to leave desks for. We were all were gathered for one purpose. One of our soldiers was in trouble. Though we were powerless to do anything other than  offer moral support, we felt glued to our desks. Angie was palpably absent, her familiar black and grey shawl being the only spectral reminder of her presence somewhere in the building. MAFG was quiet; assurances of help to find other work and amending CVs came and went like splashes of water.

Soon, Angie and HR Tank arrived at MAFG's deskside. The scene, brief as it was, seemed as if they had taken him into custody short of only handcuffs. They led him to Angie's special place of solitude, situated somewhere far beyond the familiar dimly corridor just barely visible from ITS. A bulb had gone in that corridor some time ago, it just seemed that nobody had ever replaced it. 

I had seen Angie lead a few people down this corridor when they had hit the height of her displeasure. Today though, they moved artificially slowly. MAFGs limbs moved uncomfortably as if to not let on their progress was impeded by HR Tank's inability to keep up with normal walking pace - a walk that Angie had seemed to perfect. As the figures shuffled around the corner at the end of the corridor, the dim lighting served as a poignant landscape of some mysterious doom, the shadow of Angie's tall thin figure casting on the yellowing walls like some fairytale ghost. 

A few minutes of disbelief followed in ITS. The team stared at various spots on the floor of our square work area, trying to explain things in our own minds; not even a breath was audible. This two minutes silence was terminated only as MAFG's monitor emblematically entered their sleep modes and faded to black. As quickly as the images faded, so did any sense of hope or morale we barely clung onto, and so did our moment of stillness. We promptly turned to our own desks to work.

Angie and MAFG returned two quick hours later. Accompanied by two security guards, they stood sentinel to Angie's familiar sharp tongued leadership of the situation. HR Tank was nowhere around, I could only presume that her weight disallowed her making the return journey.

MAFG added personal items from his desk to a small cardboard box, his lips dry from lack of saliva, his throat obviously lumpy. Angie's stern face stood expressionless. The silence in ITS was broken only with Angie's snipes. ""Where is your USB disk, you can't take that"" she barked; MAFG coiled the USB cable around his impeccably well taken care of Freecom drive. She snatched it as he offered it to her, her eyes still now showing even a grain of benevolence.

""We need your phone too!"" Her growl seemed to antagonize MAFG, but he couldn't react. His slow purposeful movements were fighting every urge to succumb to the lump in his throat. MAFG duly handed her his trusty BlackBerry refusing to make eye contact. It instantly brought back memories to me of when we had first been issued these phones. MAFG and I had spent a good week exploring their potential, loading on useful utilities and configuring them for maximum IT Support effectiveness. They had been the formation of a good work-based friendship. It just seemed this memory was torn now, trampled on by this monster.

Angie took MAFG's BlackBerry and extended her arm in my direction,  clad in a heavy black cardigan sleeve as if to contrast so heavily with her pale skin. Her emaciated hand ushered it in my direction. As I took it from her, it felt like I was taking a gift from some devil. She said with a bitter tongue, ""There, now you have one"". I sat stunned as MAFG looked at both me and Angie.

The ordeal was nearly over - but not quite! MAFG picked up his cardboard box of meager possessions, old pay slips and desk candies. He motioned his completion, but Angie again extended her hand to block his passage. Springing into life, one of the security guards broke from his uncomfortably official-looking stance and took the box from MAFG. He placed it back on his desk. 

The guard started digging around in the box, almost neanderthal in his movements. His grey security shirt stretched over his fattened arms as he bent over for his task. He removed several company branded pens and an unopened pack of MAFG's business cards. On their discovery, each piece of contraband were cast onto the desk surface, their respective rattles and thumps a soundtrack to whatever wrong-doing MAFG had done to earn this punishment. After nodding towards Angie and refolding his arms, the security guard took his rightful place next to his colleague, both mustering as much energy as they could to maintain their stern postures. Beads of sweat ran down the guard's face; he was not used to standing this much.

The funeral march shuffled away towards the main staircase. The procession led by Angie, MAFG carrying his own cardboard coffin and the duo of security guard pallbearers seemed to have the attention of the entire floor. The only evidence of MAFGs existence was now reduced to four pens, a pack of business cards and the wireless mouse whose flashing red battery symbol echoed the loss of its user. The only noise was from Finance, callously ignorant of the situation as they loudly discussed their day-to-day.

My co-worker (we'll call him Bob) and I cover an area that includes 72 locations, some are really close, some are about 3 hours away, the rest are in between.

One Sunday, a really bad thunderstorm rolled through our coverage area, a few of our locations lost power, so Bob and I were expecting a fair amount of calls on Monday.  We get to the office Monday morning, and over the course of the day, we end up with about 25 calls in four separate branches for equipment that got fried by the power outages.  We spend the entire day loading software on PCs, unboxing displays and local printers, and calling our various branches to let them know that we would be out on Tuesday.

Tuesday morning rolls around and we meet at the office and load up our cars with equipment for the day.  We leave going in the same direction, after about 45 miles, he was going to go south and get 2 of the branches, and I was going to go north and get the other 2.

About 10 minutes after leaving the office, Bob calls me.  ""trrwilson, meet me at that gas station up the road.""  We meet, and he tells me that he has to go 2 hours in the opposite direction to replace a down switch; tickets like those take priority over any others.  We transfer his equipment into my car, I wish him luck and we part ways.  While he was on the road, he called his 2 branches and let them know what was going on and that I would be out in the afternoon.

I get to my first 2 branches and things go OK.  I head south to go to the branches Bob was supposed to visit.  I get to the first one, and it was a mess.  One of the replacement PCs wouldn't come up, so I had to Frankenstein a working replacement from all the bad ones we picked up.  I finish up, and realize that I'm not going to get to my last stop before they close; not a huge problem since I have after hours access.

I call them up and tell them what's going on, and they're cool with it; then I ask them if they can mark the bad equipment for me so that I don't have to stumble around in the dark trying to figure out what I have to replace.  Again, no problem, they'll have them marked when I get there.

I arrive at the branch about 30 minutes after the last person has left; I carry my equipment into the foyer and then I see it.  There is a fun size candy bar laying on the floor of the foyer.  I figure someone had just dropped it as they were leaving.  I go through the doors into the branch lobby and then see another tiny candy bar right inside the lobby.  I look down and see that the users had made a candy trail leading from the front door into the offices with damaged equipment.

I follow the trail into the first office.  Taped to the monitor is a picture of the user fake-punching the monitor.  I pull out my copy of the ticket and check the asset tag that is listed, and sure enough, the monitor was called in; so I replace her monitor.  I follow the trail further and the next office has a picture of the user fake-stomping on their PC.  I take the hint and replace his PC.  The last stop on the trail had a picture of the user fake-kicking his printer, so it gets replaced.

Before I left, I took a picture of me giving a cheesy grin and a thumbs up and taped them to each replacement.  The next morning when I got to the shop and checked my e-mail, I found that each user had send me a picture of them hugging their new equipment.  They really managed to brighten up a long and annoying day.

Anyways, a while ago, I was working a contract for a rather significant pharmaceutical company. It was your standard run-of-the-mill 1st line maybe 2nd line type role, with a clear difference!

Our manager was great. Attentive, offered good career advice when you needed it, always had your back when the proverbial hit the fan, guided us through some difficult times with lunch on the company card or the odd tin of Quality Street. The guy was excellent - one of the few times I could hand-on-heart say it!

However, good things don't last and as higher ups decided that Support was way too happy, decided to dispose of our erstwhile leader, much to the cue of ""Oh Captain My Captain"" upon his departure. 

Enter Angie... there are few words to describe Angie. We'd heard tell of her actions and personality through her previous subjects during our morning coffees around the campfire. Apparently she would snipe and shout at you for merely existing and applied the logic of a 3 year old suffering major attention deficit disorder at a lecture on string theory. 

Angie had been in charge of drug safety for about a decade. To put it into perspective, if you took this company's product and turned into a blue Octapus that shot fire, the authorities would contact her department for advice. Now, from what I could tell, these guys seemed to be very well versed in everything from chemistry, biology and some were even former doctors. None of this sheer brilliance washed with Angie; she merely treated them like tools that she had no idea how to use and would bang with a hammer when they worked her way - even if her way was clearly stupid.

Still - judge no book by their cover and all that!

Angie arrived in Support a day early mere moments after our former hero had walked the long mile. She immediately proceeded to command facilities to join her at her desk, where she chewed out a 17 year old girl mercifully due to there being dust on her desk and grit in her drawers. This relentless torture went on for a good 20 minutes while Angie inspected every inch of the girl's effort to appease her whims, even re-cleaning several spots more than once. Afterwards, she walked away red faced, eyes to the ground and with a lump in her throat after just about getting the words to indicate she will have her drawer pack replaced with a brand new unit.

We all knew it was to be a new world order with Angie's arrival; we would have thought her showing up a day early was to meet and greet the troops... it was very apparent to me that she was just a vicious troll marking her territory, showing everyone who was boss!

A few tech support underlings had moved her machine down the previous evening but, from what I had heard, she had had another chewing out session as she preferred her monitor on the left hand side as opposed to the right. OK, a simple mistake to make and one which is easily rectifiable - not without a lot of noise and assurance of stupidity. I did wonder why I found our resident work experience kid close to tears in the mensroom.

I sat down and began my day. At 10:00, my first interaction with this hellhound was imminent. I was busy tapping out a response email to a remote worker about an Excel problem and she beckoned me over. Well - I say beckoned, she clicked her fingers and with an impertinent commanding tone, she scowled ""You! Come here!""

Thinking I couldn't possibly have had enough time to annoy the woman yet, I assumed this was just another vulgar display of power (sorry, been listening to Pantera this morning). However, she then demanded I showed her how to access her email.

Now, I'm used to running IT inductions and showing new users the jig, but someone who's been here for 10 years? Hmmm.

So, I managed to show her where Outlook was amidst the utter blur of icons on her desktop, adorned with a background of her several pitbull terriers - figures! As Outlook ungraciously churned into gear, she immediately snapped ""Why does it take so long?""

OK, in fairness, this was taking ages! Her disapproving sighs as I attempted to determine the cause was all the signal I needed to know that I really hadn't impressed the boss from hell. Task manager showed Outlook knocking on 97% CPU and the hard disk was going nuts. Until I noticed that network packets had also rammed up.

Musting up the voice to break through the blackened icy air, I politely enquired ""When is the last time you opened Outlook?"" This was met with a sharp stare and ""Don't be stupid. Why would I ask you how to use it if I had been using it already?"" 

After waiting several minutes, the cause eventually became clear. Angie was presented with approximately 5 years worth of completely unread communiques - an unsettling amount of them marked urgent, or with subjects implicating fatal consequences had occured totally without her knowledge.

As I said, Angie had headed drug safety for a decade. In that time, she had never seen a single email, nor did it seem had she ever any cause to question why.

And now she was in our realm - infecting our happy little team with a blackness mired with incompetence and only a tongue sharpened with the stones of hell to act as her only contribution.",,False,,t5_2sfg5,False,,,True,t3_1am2p3,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1am2p3/the_b_manager_from_hell_pt2_safety_first/,

But this really teared me up earlier. I work for a company that manages networks for many different companies and businesses in our area. I was on a service call, working away on one of the servers when one of the custodians approached me. The custodian looked to be about 55 years old or so...

me: ""Can I help you?""

custodian: ""Yeah, um... I have a laptop here that I brought from home. It's been having issues, and won't start at all.""

me: ""Okay, can i look at it?""

I usually don't do stuff on the side, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to help.

custodian: ""Well, I know you're busy. Are you sure you can?""

me: ""'Course, just bring it here I'll see what I can do.""

About ten minutes later he shows up with a pretty new HP laptop. He tells me he just purchased the laptop about a year ago, and the warranty was expired so he didn't know what to do. He then tells me he brought the laptop to a local computer shop and they said the motherboard was fried, so he'd be better off purchasing a new laptop.

I tell him just let me look at it and he says he's going to finish a job, and to let him know when I was done. So, out of interest I boot the laptop up. It shows BIOS screen, beeps, then restarts... over and over. Hmm...

I turn it over and open up his RAM cover. I take out both sticks and put one back in, trying each on individually to test them. Lo and behold, one of the RAM sticks is bad and the computer boots fine with the second one I try. 

I actually had just ordered new RAM for my own laptop, and had the old ones in my car. I run out to the car and grab them, and install them as well. Boots up fine, with two more GB's of RAM mind you.

Custodian comes back and I tell him what I did, and let him know I put in two sticks of RAM and he need not worry about it. The look on his face was stricken... he looked taken aback, and I'm not sure why.

He then tells me he's been using Skype to chat with his son who is in the military and his grandson from across the country, and would never have been able to afford a new laptop to continue the chats. 

He looked like he was going to hug me, and had tears in his eyes when I let him know the computer was fine and I wouldn't be charging him. It's like he never knew kindness from another human. His voice was even a little choked up... I hate seeing grown men cry, cause I can't help but feel choked up as well.

Either way, I sent him on his way and told him to let me know if any issues come up. Makes me happy to be in this job...

Angie is already sat in the stale meeting room waiting for me. Obviously, given the events of the day before, I knew I had essentially caused this impromptu ticket review. To me there remained two choices. 

I could head in there, a subservient professional, plead for my sins and be managed. Yep, be managed by Angie. As she had already minced three of my colleagues into vegetative states, I realised this tactic was doomed. However, my heavy metal spirit prevailed; I took a cue from Dee Snider and instead presented myself as just me. The guy who will still smile and offer professionalism with a light hearted stance even in the face of a total bully.

I walked into the meeting room brandishing a pint glass of red fruitjuice which I happily placed on the desk. I honestly don't think Angie was expecting this one. I jovially sat down and acted like I was eager to go through any concerns she had with my tickets. 

She came straight out with it, ""I want to know why you close the lowest amount of tickets out of everyone in the group? This isn't good enough, you are consistently the lowest score in every single stat I have!""

My case revolved around the fact that we were never ruled by stats. Ever. We maintained a low open-ticket count and concentrated on mentoring junior staff and leading by example. I was hired as a senior simply as a representation of my experience and it was not uncommon for me to accompany junior staff on their calls.

As you can guess, as well as a frosty stare, this was met with a single-worded writeoff: ""Rubbish!"" she sniped. She tyraded for another 10 minutes, scribbling all over her prints in red pen like a crap maths teacher and proceeded to throw me ticket after ticket and reasons why she wasn't happy.

That's OK, I don't stop there. After she finishes her rant, I decide, I can play your game. I turn her stack of redenned paperwork over and begin to go through them in depth, one by one, to answer her concerns.

""This ticket here, "" I started, ""you were unhappy as it took too long to resolve. I admit, three weeks is a little out there. However, this PC is running some bespoke medical software and as it happens will only run on Windows NT. The department is not willing to shell out five figures on a new XP-compatible version so they asked us to source a replacement motherboard instead.""

Now here's how I knew we had a rat. Angie has no idea what NT is - or even a motherboard. However, her tyrade this time seemed more bitter and twisted. I was really stirring the hornets nest here!

I insisted on moving on after ""I can take your comments on board"". I started into the next ticket. ""This ticket resolved around a new vendor requiring set up of several Oracle databases..."" Angie stopped me mid sentence. She reiterated bitterly my low call count; if I didn't shape up, she would have no option but to seek disciplinary steps.

OK so I didn't win. But at least the playing field has been set. I don't back down, though I know I won't win. But at least now I know what her prize is. Why, I don't know. She can't be after everyone's job, surely? That makes no sense. 

**Epilogue** Angie left for the day. I was alone watching a new HP laptop complete a Windows install, ready to fine tune and install, later to sysprep. The balding Head of IT wandered over to ask what all the meetings were about today. I adopted happy-mode and shared my thoughts in as diplomatic a manner I could. I expressed how I was the lowest ticket closer and Angie isn't happy about that. 

Initially, Balding Head (BHIT) tried to plecate me, asking how I could do better. Blimey, I'd forgotten higher ups were meant to ""help"". However, he soon discovered my tickets for what they were; all mine were the complex issues. Internal wifi dropouts, preparing master configs for different models of routers the sales reps had, troubleshooting legacy Windows NT and MSDOS 8.3 systems...

And then I landed everyone in it. Compared to some others, it seems the bulk majority of calls assigned by people to themselves in the mornings were password resets.... I guess that's one way to boost your stats...

1364227812.0,1915,self.talesfromtechsupport,1az9o3,The B**** Manager from Hell Pt20: Cardboard city,4986,3071,462,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1az9o3/the_b_manager_from_hell_pt20_cardboard_city/,"The IT Cupboard had transformed into a veritable hive of activity. Boxes of laptops littered every available crevice in the IT Cupboard. Some boxes contained freshly built machines, signified by their address labels, destined for their new homes. Others lay brand new, yet to be called to command. Our efforts were meticulously presided over by a flickery Samsung monitor which recorded our every move in a single excel spreadsheet. Names, addresses, serial numbers, asset tags - all required recording.

Despite the obvious pressure QBG and I were under, Roland seemed content with doing the bare minimum. He took his position in the only seat left in the room. Our demands for action seemed to go unnoticed as he idly fiddled with his phone, occasionally breaking his concentration to scroll up and down the excel sheet, his arm outstretched to reach an old mouse and keyboard we had rescued from a junk box for our purpose.

Roland indolently looked up his phone, ""What one are you doing now?"" QBG's response was evidently irate in tone as she read out the serial and asset numbers. Roland duly tapped in QBG's response, barely even taking the effort to capitalize his text. The keyboard, old, yellowed and not even built with the Windows keys, clacked loudly as he typed.

Roland's attempt to permanently affix himself to his throne and rule the roost had grown weary. After this exchange, while unwrapping a fresh laptop, I decided enough was enough. ""Roland!"" I started. ""If you're not going to help, could you kindly go back to support?""

""I'm busy!"" His snide response grated on me. As if to exemplify his uselessness, QBG dragged the keyboard away from towards her as she entered another row of data into the spreadsheet. Her body language exuded bitterness towards Roland's unyielding lethargy in a stereotypical way that only the female of the species can perfect. I knew how she felt, though! 

Roland sat without a single reaction. He seemed to silently shrug off this display of discontent, as if it were of pure meaninglessness. For the next hour, we worked around Roland uncomfortably, as if he were a cold and jagged heavy rock, inconveniently situated in the center of the room. 

We had expected Angie's inevitable visit. Her arrival intensified the high feeling in the cramped environment as we shuffled around box after box of Dell laptops. She discussed our progress with Roland loudly, taking great purpose to exclude mine or QBG's input. Roland dutifully furnished Angie with our present number; we had imaged, repacked and addressed just under 40 laptops.

The fact is, Angie could not bear to leave any situation without imposing her sense of authority; it just wasn't even in her vocabulary. Angie especially liked imposing her authority onto QBG more than almost any other engineer. It was though QBG represented everything that Angie was not to the letter. True to form, Angie directed her attention towards QBG where she was loading a trolley of outbound boxes. 

Angie's voice drowned out the whir of the imaging laptops and the groaning ghost server. ""Are these laptops supposed to be finished?"" Angie's loaded interrogation was not intended to garner any real information. QBG duly provided her response, knowing that Angie had simply just opened her line of questioning to find fault.

""These postage labels are entirely too small. You need to redo them all in a larger print!"" This condescending request lashed QBG like a whip as she winced at the proposition. QBG declined Angie's proposition, instead offering ""We'll do the next ones bigger, these are fine as they are!"" Angie's insistence was delivered over a lambaste which seemed almost infinite as she constantly picked up more and more trivial matters of discontent. Not enough tape; this box is slightly damaged; there are too many boxes on that trolley. 

Angie, satisfied with her instruction, retreated back into the ether of the office. Roland remained motionless on his pedestal, smugly smiling as he reclined back into the chair where he stayed for the next hour.

4pm slothed into view. Roland donned his dark grey duffle coat, each popper irked us more and more as their echos disturbed our frustrated silence. He left for the day without saying a word, leaving QBG and me to continue our work. His departure was suffixed with our in depth symposium of the situation. As we offered one another further anecdote of why Roland and Angie both should be buried in shallow graves, we seemed to further agitate each other.

""Right, you know what..."" I started, ""this isn't happening another day. Let's go see BHIT!""

Our mercenary strut through the hallowed halls towards ITS seemed to gain in speed the closer we got; it was tantamount to a race to reach BHIT. As he sat, blissfully unaware of the onslaught we were about to deliver, his balding reflected the ceiling light with a dull shine.

QBG and I tag-teamed our way through our complaint as BHIT listened. Our frustrated accounts grew louder as we described in depth what the first day of builds had brought. We spilled the beans on Roland, Angie's micro-management and how the duo were jeopardizing our attempted rescue with their banality.

BHIT pondered our predicament as he noisily scratched the side of his unshaven head. He finally leaned forward and said, ""OK, leave it with me. Get back to work!""

(all names have been changed to protect the incompetent). 

I used to work in a Service-Desk/Triage capacity (lovingly dubbed Tier 1.9) where we would monitor, ticket, troubleshoot, and escalate as needed (we were expected to have a 90% self-solution return).

One thing that we never were allowed to touch was network issues.  Our area telcom team had lost their extremely competent team lead some 18 months earlier and their team had quickly degraded to people who didn't really seem to care about their job.  They were also secure in the fact that the telcom system had degraded enough to be sufficiently obfuscated enough where it would take considerable resources to figure it out by a competent replacement.  This made them act like they were untouchable.  As such, I had learned fast to start recording my phone calls to them (thank you Google Voice!) so they couldn't pin anything on us.

Anyway, one day around 6PM the network dropped out. As such, I called the Telcom On-Call.  

**Me Leaving Voicemail:** Hi, this is Craysh from Tier 1.9. It looks like the network is having issues again.  Internet, communicator, and email are all unresponsive. All three webfarms are unavailable. Trace route to the gateway has failed. Ticket is unavailable as the ticketing system is inaccessable due to the issue. Please call back to confirm your taking ownership of the incident.

15 minutes go by and SOP dictates that I call back before escalating to their manager.  The on-call answers.

**Tech:** On-Call Phone, this is Steve

**Me:** Hi Steve, have you gotten my voicemail? We're having issues with the network.

**Tech:** No, I haven't.  Tell me what's wrong.

**Me:** Repeats what I said above.

**Tech:** Ok. Wait 20 minutes and try again. *Click*

I had assumed that by 'Wait 20 minutes' he meant that he was taking a look at it and that it should be back up in 20 minutes.  20 minutes go by and the network is still having issues (The network has now been down for the last 40 minutes or so)

I call the On-Call phone again.  No answer.

**Me Leaving Voicemail:** Hi, this is Craysh again. The issue is still ongoing. Please call me back as soon as possible.

15 Minutes go by so it's time to call again. No answer. Time to call the acting supervisor. 

**Supervisor:** This is Aaron

**Me:** Hi Aaron, this is Craysh from Tier 1.9. We are having issues with the network and the On-Call has stopped answering their phone.

**Supervisor:** Stopped? You mean they initially answered?

**Me:** Yes, he said to wait 20 minutes.

**Supervisor:** OK, he's probably working on it.  Call me back in an hour if the issue persists. *click*

At this point I'm calling my supervisor and apprising him of the situation.

For the next hour, I continue to call the On-Call every 15 minutes (as is procedure). No answer.

I call the supervisor again


**Supervisor:** This is Aaron

**Me:** Hi Aaron, this is Craysh from Tier 1.9 again. We are still having issues with the network and the On-Call still has not answered his phone.

**Supervisor:** OK, I'll take a look at it.

Turns out that Telcom had pushed a policy to the Junipers that had scrubbed the white lists (completely blocking all access to all ports). 

All in all it took 5 hours to get everything back up and running.  I documented the ticket extremely thoroughly once the system was available again.

The next day came the fall-out.  Telcom was claiming that I had never paged them, and they said that a customer ended calling the supervisor to find out what was going on.  They even showed zero calls on their cellphone (they had removed the calls and messages).

As such, we had a meeting to 'discuss Tier 1.9's failure to report a severe incident'.

I walked into the room filled with extremely pissed off big wigs, including Aaron and and Steve.  They demanded why I hadn't contacted the on-call, and I stated that I had and that they had lead me to believe that they had been working on the issue. 

Nobody believed me because ""The On-Call phone didn't have any messages or call logs from Tier 1.9""  Their excuse for having a completely empty call log was that they cleared it daily so they could keep track of the calls made on the phone.

I calmly walked to the overhead projector, logged into Google Voice, and played each consecutive voicemail/conversation.

They no longer work here, and I've had three promotions since.

-----------------

**EDIT:** Someone expressed an interest for the actual meeting.  Here goes:

I was working the 2-10 shift at the time and I had stayed an hour and a half late to 'own the incident.  A little after 8am I'm woken up to be informed that there is a meeting I need to be at for 9am concerning the 'Issues that Tier 1.9 had alerting proper individuals in a high visibility incident'.  Running on 3 hours of sleep (I usually went to bed around 5am and got up at 1PM) I figured ""Great! It's about time Telcom got reamed for never answering their On-Call phone!""

When I walked in to the meeting I pretty much knew that the Telcom guys had decided to screw me. They wouldn't look me in the eye (alarm bell one).

We sat there while management had a little pow-wow before hand outside the meeting room (including the acting supervisor for Telcom) and I heard phrases like 'separation procedures' (obvious alarm bell two as I knew that they would not get rid of any Telcom guys as of that point).  My supervisor was not a part of this meeting, he was sitting next to me (alarm bell number three, and he was pretty sure that they were planning on letting him go too).

They came in the room and sat down quietly.  They asked my supervisor if he had been apprised of the situation last night and responded in the affirmative. We went over the procedure that I had followed, and my supervisor acknowledged that I had called him and told him of the situation.

They then asked Telcom their version of events.  They essentially said that I had never called the On-Call phone and that the Supervisor had been contacted by a customer 'friend' of his who asked in passing why the internet wasn't working.  They took out the On-Call Blackberry and showed that there were zero calls and messages last night.  The acting-supervisor 'forgot' his cellphone that day so they couldn't check his (I so wanted to call his cellphone in the middle of the meeting and watch him explain that away. He was one of those people who had their Blackberry attached at the hip). 

The 'Contracting Officer's Technical Representative' or COTR came in to the room and he was fuming. Asking me pointed questions, and kept repeating 'why didn't you page out?' and 'There are procedures in place that you should have followed!'

I couldn't get a word in edge wise, and the Telcom guys had very smug looks.  I pretty much didn't care anymore at this point so instead of trying to explain further I stood up (which pretty much made everyone tense up a bit) and I walked calmly to the overhead projector. Logged in, turned on the [screen](http://i.imgur.com/C4f78.jpg) and started playing the voicemails. 

Nobody really said anything at first, but the Telcom guys definitely had priceless faces. The COTR told me 'Please excuse us Craysh. We have some business to discuss.  Feel free to take the rest of the day off with a $50 per diem.' I think I ended up seeing Prince of Persia.

My supervisor was told not to tell anyone what happened in that meeting after I left.  All he would say was that they were very lucky that charges were not brought up against them since the documents that they filled out with the false information was a government document and what they did was technically fraud against the U.S. government.  The only reason he told me this was because I had to help file an amendment to the incident report.

1364145644.0,1908,self.talesfromtechsupport,1ax63o,The B**** Manager from Hell Pt19: Throw the dice,5204,3296,507,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1ax63o/the_b_manager_from_hell_pt19_throw_the_dice/,"The following morning, I waited at my desk, primed for a showdown with Angie. Roland sneered and snorted loudly as he worked on some inscrutable task. Angie, fresh Starbucks cup in hand, barely made eye contact as she approached the ITS area. My opportunity to loudly demand satisfaction was at hand. As she placed her cup on the desk, I armed myself with a copy of her project plan. I stood up to metaphorically remove my glove to slap Angie’s face with it. Just as I began talking, I was stopped in my tracks as Angie barked into gear. Her scoff trampled my incursion with a strident whine, “Why hasn’t HR Tank’s machine been replaced?” she demanded. 

I defended with “there’s nothing wrong with her machine at all, it’s barely a year old and is one of the highest spec machines we have deployed! Anyway, I…” Angie dismissed my petition with a stony faced ultimatum. “I want that machine replaced before you go to lunch today! Reopen that ticket and get it done!”

Still brandishing Angie’s project document, she retrieved her cup and stormed towards the lair located somewhere beyond the dimly lit corridor which had seen many an engineer walk to their deaths. I was left immobile, the duel won before I had even drawn my weapon. The emptiness of BHIT’s desk offered no sanctuary in this moment. I left the project plan on my desk, skulking away towards the IT Cupboard to furnish HR Tank with a new OptiPlex. 

After enduring yet another hour-long session of unintelligent questions, garbled, half chewed up and spat back out by the HR Tank, I escaped her deskside with her old machine and yet another list of demands she felt inhibited her capacity to perform as she otherwise would. At the top of the list, she required a colour printer placed near her desk. I guess having to walk half way across the floor to the communal printer may have burned vital calories necessary to plug the real-estate offered by her 80-inch wide trousers. In reality, I was aware through the rumour mill that an apprentice she had appointed in the guise of being mentored in all manner of HR and Legal duties had left some weeks prior citing the need for an actual career. HR Tank had instead used her as a dogsbody to fetch printer output, deliver files to various unsuspecting recipients and, on the way back from such voyages, procure various canteen supplies for her.

This morning’s diversion of Angie’s insistence became all too clear. BHIT had finally gotten word of what had happened last night – most likely the tip off was my email sent to him just prior to my leaving which complained vehemently about Angie’s actions. It seemed he had grown an impromptu pair of balls and demanded Angie’s explanation via email – which of course Angie was all too eager to give! Remember, this power woman had a lifetime’s experience of deviously plotting her rise to the top! Attached to Angie’s response was yet a new project plan, now detailing my newfound responsibilities as technical delivery engineer. What’s more, the handover of machines would no-longer be carried out at the conference; instead all machines would ship next week directly to their recipients. This lunacy has been given the eager thumbs up by all middle management who welcomed the fact that Angie would deliver the project apparently ahead of time.

Opening the PDF, I scaled down to the procurement section only to validate what I fully expected to see anyway. Against the parchment-coloured background of the branded company document, my 50-at-a-time proposal had been replaced by a single line, “252 machines to be ordered from Dell”. The statement, rubber stamped by all and necessary, seemed to vindicate Angie completely. The ball, it seemed, had bounced clandestinely into my back yard. 

BHIT rushed to my desk. I knew what he was going to ask before he’d even asked it. Even though Roland, Angie’s eyes and ears, sat in close proximity, I let my true feelings known to BHIT. “So, you’re telling me there is one week to image 250 odd machines? So, in reality, that’s 50 machines per day?” BHIT nodded, hoping I would concede and provide some magical way out of this new found emergency. “This is stupid! Whoever planned this needs their ass handed to them!” 

My claim had now garnered the attention of the rest of ITS; no longer were their eyes transfixed on their screens, scared to move. They were intently watching the spectacle as it unfolded in front of them. I turned to Roland, demanding “Are the images even ready?” Roland’s familiar ratty vocal snare simply retorted with a shrug, “The images are ready whenever you want them!” 

Angie returned to ITS and immediately interjected my exchange with Roland, as if something deep inside her had fired up and manifested into some sort of primal trait of a mother defending its young. She started, “You told me it would take a week for the laptops to be imaged!” Her obviously incorrect statement seemed a purposeful twist of words on my initial claim. “No! I said that each batch of 50 would take a week to build and QA!” Refuting my claims, Angie’s stern voice still sought to overshadow any offering of reality. 

Delving deep into her PDF, I demanded “Why are we now couriering the laptops out? Why aren’t we delivering at the conference as planned? What about the 50 or so that are staying in the field that only need reimaging?” I felt confident - for once I felt that BHIT had my back, albeit ever so slightly blunted by how easy he had historically caved in. Angie’s abrupt answer seemed to be the line she had used to sell her project amendment with, “I will not disrupt an entire conference just to give out laptops! It is better to present the face of IT by offering a support drop-in service as people need it instead of disrupting an entire event!”

There was no way we could now argue this round now. Angie had landed us in it. She had played her cards, now it was an all-or-nothing game of seeing where the chips would fall. BHIT was powerless to do anything other than hope for a magic-wand solution. Angie was golden in the eyes of the upper management who had rubber stamped her new proposals all the way. There was only one card left to play. I hadn’t expected things to go off to this magnitude – I was inexperienced in this sort of corporate espionage. If I failed to deliver 250 built laptops, Angie could easily pass the buck down, my name made synonymous with total disaster! If I delivered 250 built laptops, Angie would get the glory and I would remain a nameless entity. For me, neutrality or bust! For Angie, glory or neutrality!

“I dunno how we’re going to do this…” I said rising from my chair. Leading the procession, QBG followed closely behind me as Roland wheeled the Ghost server towards the IT Cupboard. BHIT watched us disappear; hoping we would indeed find this desperately needed magic wand!

I accepted my diminishing responsibility as I set about my regular duties, visiting desk sides and dealing with the various whims and fancies of the user base. In one way it was a relief to detach myself from any view of the perpetually turning cogs of the rollout. I engrossed myself in some other issues which had come to plague the user base, most notably a problem visiting reps had experienced with their laptops and smartphones failing to maintain a stable WiFi connection in the office. I made my way past some familiar faces as I strolled around intrepidly, laptop in hand, waiting to catch the moment when the Wi-Fi would drop. 

Just as the signal dropped, my investigation was put on hold as one of the Sales managers caught my attention. His artificially whitened teeth seemed to surrender every line of imperfection under the light as he smiled his well-practised salesman smile. As he casually enquired about the rollout, I deflected his attention towards Angie as the new go-to person. I was only in a consultant capacity as needed. His smile took on a slightly apprehensive expression; I knew full well that BHIT had sung my praises right from the start. To hear this dramatic change in events appeared disturbing. Maintaining a professional demeanour, I simply assured him of my belief that the project was in capable hands… the first time I’ve ever flat out lied on the job. He disappeared back into the hustle and bustle of the office, leaving me to my WiFi investigation.

An oddly airy Wednesday afternoon surged into view. ITS felt clean and clear. We could at long last breathe a hearty sigh of relief. Angie and Roland had disappeared off for what seemed like ages. The absence of their black auras had left a dramatically spacey vibe, like we had all just surfaced from some colossal ocean depth, finally able to drink in some of the bountiful fresh air. Its taste was like a cool breeze amidst some arid summer heat wave. It was a relief to actually hear our own voices again! The drone of insipid chatter from the Finance wenches had been the only aural accompaniment of recent days. Their meandering discussions on male pop sensations 20 years their junior, various coffee recipes and deeply particular insights of certain male employees that these aging, portly women found attractive made for a percussive din, the only moments of reprieve as Angie’s led her Menopause group for their twice-daily Starbucks fix. Of course, she would leave Roland on guard-dog duty!

Still, we now had an opportunity to let our guards down. With a secretive half vocal whisper, QBG was eager to catch up on the latest rollout-gossip. Her face contorted in disbelief as I confided Angie’s actions. I was just barely loud enough to be heard outside our conversation, but just loud enough so to ensure BHIT was in earshot. He barely flinched while I concluded my full update to QBG. In one way, I didn’t care who heard me anymore, so long as BHIT did. But it felt good to get listened to, as if my account needed to be heard by someone. “There’s only a month to go… shouldn’t something more be happening by now?”

As the week trundled towards its closure, Angie and Roland made frequent trips to the higher floors for rollout meetings as ITS beavered away in their duties. I waited for consultation requests from Roland, sometimes even publically inviting him to check anything he wanted with me, through as an agreeable manner as I could muster. Roland refused to ask for help, but in reality, I think I was happier without having to endure this pair’s attitude and negative manner. My working life seemed basic and simple again, just the way I like it. Well, of course with the regular admonishments of Angie! Morale was long gone, but there were our own little private worlds to disappear of to.

The biggest casualty was the Ghost server that MAFG and I had acquired, built, loved and later valiantly rescued from its janitorial doom. It stood poignantly next to Roland’s desk – the three-item to a desk rule apparently mute given Roland’s status. It was now clearly being held prisoner, like a hostage whose captivity had broken them down, sympathising with their kidnapper and taking on a new persona to mirror the evil twisted nature of its jailer. The beige box was coated in the alienesque slime and goo that oozed from Roland’s skin, like Spiderman’s evil doppelganger shooting acidic goo from his palms. The Dymo label which had so proudly identified the Ghost Server by its hostname, “ITSGHO01” had been forcibly removed as if to eviscerate some evidence of its history. It left a white rectangle, obvious against its discoloured skin, with scratches and scrapes surrounding it akin to an animal’s claws. 

Two weeks passed by, all news of the rollout went untold. Roland appeared to be busily toiling in another part of the building – we were quite happy to be relieved of Angie’s underling. Monday morning, I was training QBT in the fine art of replacing an old ATX Pentium 133 motherboard in an desktop that she had retrieved from a research department. A donor Packard Bell from the rear of the IT Cupboard had already been looted for some other parts previously, its casing battered and bent. However, luckily, an entire motherboard and CPU remained. It was this we were transplanting to the distressed research machine, its rare and irreplaceable exclusivity commanding the utmost care and attention. The anti-static wrist bands seemed to complicate the procedure as its plastic-coated coil snagged on various parts of the metal chassis. We were happily bonding in our moment of isolation, catching up on each other’s hearsay; it had been the first time I had been able to relax with someone at work for a while, QBG it seemed could make a suitable replacement for MAFG!

Our mother’s meeting was almost at a close when our a stony faced Facilities monkey, clad in dirty green jumper which seemed to evidence hard toil, appeared in the doorway with an aged disapproving look. “Jon6?” he mumbled. “There’s a truck turned up with loads of laptops. Where are we meant to put ‘em?” His Manchester accent echoed from the hallway through the opened IT Cupboard door, his frame slightly obscuring the overhead lighting. His accent clearly demonstrated the fact that he was far from home, like a lone warrior holding his own in some foreign land. “Right here I guess, there’s some space at the back!” I said, motioning to an isle MAFG had previously emptied towards the end of his tenure. His told-you-so smile accompanied the shake of his head, “What, all of em? You know there’s about 250 of the things?”

Convoyed to the scene of the crime, the Facilities monkey purposely shuffled me towards the articulated lorry that had arrived in the yard, standing like a bruised battle tank just returned from war. Its rear doors were flung open to reveal box after box after box, adorned with the familiar Dell logos, as a team of Facilities workers scrambled to unload them. “You better figure out where we’re going to put these double quick” he commanded, thrusting a manifest into my hands. I could see my name planted firmly at the top of the document’s recipient list. I knew right then that my evening had just been squandered by whoever’s administrative oversight had caused this turn of events. Of course, I knew full well it had to be only one person’s doing!

The lobby of the building was decorated with an oversized clock face which hung above the main security desk. Its appearance had a stealthy corporate double-meaning. On the one hand, visitors would be impressed with such a bold artistic statement. On the other, it reinforced to any tardy employee that they had been caught red-handed, their arrival time electronically indelibly stamped on their permanent record as they would swipe their access cards. To add to this crafty corporate purpose, this oversized clock always seemed to be a few indistinct minutes faster than almost any other clock that existed.  

Tonight, it took on a new role. It sarcastically emphasised my rapidly vanishing evening as I walked pump-truck after pump-truck of Dell branded boxes to their temporary homes. Neither Angie or BHIT were anywhere in sight to mediate the situation. Repeated appeals to helpdesk to locate their whereabouts went unanswered. In the end, some sympathetic Facilities manager had yielded to my plight and offered three temporary rooms to hold the laptops. These were now crammed floor to ceiling with Dell boxes. My clothes smelled old from my efforts; prickled with box-dust and the stale smelling air of the rooms I had been afforded which had sat unused for some time. I packed away the last box, finally leaving the building at 9pm.

My disentanglement from the project, as prescribed by Angie, seemed to have been suddenly and majorly rehabilitated in this single dramatic move. I had clearly stated in my project plan that these deliveries should be conducted in batches of 50 at a time; we didn’t have the space to deal with 250 machines – as this very evening would attest. This detail, I’m sure, had made it into Angie’s rewrite of my project plan in verbatim. I know I had even seen it. What’s more, with only two weeks to go, building 250 machines in that time was no mean feat! What had Roland even been doing this whole time? This blunder, which felt a little too obvious, seemed to signify stage two of Angie’s sabotage.

Machines were building while machines were unwrapped while machines were repacked - this time with larger address labels as per Angie’s demands. The previously arid air infected by Roland seemed more pleasant now that Angie had declared he had ""far more pressing duties to attend to"". That didn't stop Angie's persistence in micromanagement. Each visit brought a new list of vices which had to be adhered to; her elephant-like memory seemed to retain every minor piece of misdirection she spluttered, her leathery face and tongue breathing fire at the slightest transgression. 

QBG and I pulled overtime on Wednesday/Thursday. Our thanks came with a company-sanctioned pizza on one night, followed by an impromptu trip to the local Chinese takeout the next. We both worked diligently for our cause until sometime on Friday afternoon when the last batch of laptops sat imaging. The IT cupboard looked like a bomb site. Discarded baggies, hastily recorded CD-Rs with various drivers on them, several cardboard cups which once contained cheap, cost effective canteen coffee and shreds of ill-cut tape and inners littered the floor. I sat on the trolley, gently rocked myself back and forth, thoroughly shattered as QBG lounged on the chair. Our hands were grubby from the manual lifting, but we were finally done. 

We still had no idea if our plea for clemency from BHIT was the real reason for Roland’s absence, but were glad of the break. The last laptop completed its imaging process as I struggled to my feet. After loading the correct user profiles, we loaded the last box onto the trolley. We turned the lights out on the IT cupboard as we rolled out the door which clanged loudly, echoing through the lifeless corridor as the electronic lock whizzed, sealing the cupboard with a tomb-like finality.

As I pushed the trolley towards the mail room, again filled top to bottom with our efforts, the conversation turned to the conference next week. Angie's plan of having a support presence seemed unnaturally forward-thinking, yet seemed to be yet another construct of some great demonstration of incompetence. We had no real idea of what we were expected to do there and we still had another 50 machines to image as reps waited. QBG and I had also realized that our unanticipated team-building time had come to an end; a valuable insight we would have never gotten had Angie not interfered in the way that she did. But mired with her constant micromanagement, we were glad it was all over - for now.

Another Monday morning! The rain and sleet smacked my windscreen as I could only think of the same old mantra, “I hate Mondays!” ITS had arrived early at the conference centre to set up. Our Support booth spanned four tables which had been strewn with all manner of Support-related paraphernalia. It looked like someone had raided some long-forgotten box of promotional material which now served to entice passers by. A sizable gazebo stood behind the dubiously supported makeshift tables housing the secondary support area.

When I arrived, I found Angie mid-lecture as some helpdesk underling, borrowed for the purposes of the day, had met her disapproval in some way. Her shrill, demanding voice was evident even over the noise of the waiters and waitresses igniting several water heaters in anticipation for the impending delegates. Angie’s constant barking continued up until our official open time of 10:00am at which time she scarpered to make-nice with some apparent acquaintances. It always amazed me to see her personality and body language shift so seamlessly when interacting with anyone who wasn’t, well, us!

Almost as soon as the hall opened, our first delegate arrived at the Helpdesk brandishing a very familiar laptop bag. The delegate bore all the hallmarks of a vintage salesman; his suit was worn, distended around his stomach which showed obvious patronage to many miles behind his rep-mobile on motorways. Placing the bag on the table, he stressed with a clear but jovial tenor voice that he had received it the previous week but was having problems with it.

I ushered him into the back of our support area. Our IT setup seemed to impress him. The Ghost Server hummed proudly atop a stack of plastic boxes while stations demarked with chairs and table space offered spare network cables and power supplies already connected and waiting for their prospective tenants. “It’s like mission control in here!” the delegate quipped. With a confirmatory laugh, he added, “We have lift off!”

The delegate presented his laptop. As I hooked it up, he withdrew a shabby blue-covered notebook, filled with scribbling, bits of paper and bound by a rubber band from the depths of his suit. Peering through the frames of his rounded spectacles, he declared that he had a number of problems. He reeled off each entry on his list, as though sermonising from his blue notebook. The software, though it could open, was unable to load profiles or remember preferences which, though meant nothing to me, meant the world to a marketing guru such as this man. It also seemed to failed to synchronise in any way with the central database. While scanning through the laptop, I had also noticed McAfee was failing to update and the image distinctly lacked any installation of MS Office.

The realization that Roland had indeed fudged the image was all too real. This was polarized by the sight near the helpdesk tables at 10:15. The queue seemed to extend to the far corner of the hall, all said the same thing. The rickety tables seemed the final barricade on the front lines as reps, brandishing the same laptop bags, came to voice their ails.

Tensions ran high as the word spread among the queuing reps. IT had blown it; they’d screwed the pooch and messed up big-time! Dissent spread quickly into the queue. Our borrowed Helpdesk guy was buckling. He was ill-equipped to deal with demand of this magnitude without the simple escape route of simply logging a call for escalation. I relieved him with the instruction to find Angie. In the meantime, all we could think to do was accept laptops back en-masse and deal with the fallout later.

The rear support area filled as some 200 machines lay piled as portrait of the enormous blunder. Angie’s eventual reappearance was complemented with another bout of her ranting and raving; despite her inability to offer another solution, she stormed off in anger leaving us to somehow organise transportation of 200 laptops back to head office. Two sales and marketing managers also appeared, demanding explanations and reasons for this mother of all fuck-ups. 

Our borrowed helpdesk guy and I loaded the laptops into a hire van for their voyage back to the office. Our drive back to the office through the rain seemed dark and depressing. The rain reverberated off the large metal hulk of the van only dampened by the cloth of the soft laptop bags. The only thing to look forward to now was another drenching skirmish through the office yard to return the laptops to their holding cells.

1363728968.0,1833,self.talesfromtechsupport,1ambp1,The B**** Manager from Hell Pt3: The IT Induction from hell,4037,2204,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1ambp1/the_b_manager_from_hell_pt3_the_it_induction_from/,"It's Monday morning. I am in early to set up a bunch of noobies with their fancy corporate gear. I'm usually very prepared and have kit ready to go by Thursday evening/Friday morning at latest. However, thanks to BMFH, our long-standing policy known to all department heads of IT requiring 2 weeks notice of any new starter so we can obtaining and set up new gear is summarily binned. Of course, I find this out Friday evening and need to scrounge up four new laptops and get Vodafone to live up some SIM cards double quick for delivery Monday morning.

I'm literally imaging the final machine when my induction group enters the room. I've had no time for tea or coffee, yet I'm expecting salvation from a sympathetic co-worker at any minute. 

Still, best foot forward, I meet my delegates with my usual optimistic smile and my ""welcome aboard"" handshake. Only, the air is about to darken. The familiar stench of putrid an old woman with too much perfume enters the room. She walks straight to the back of the training room and takes her seat next to a young woman. Out of the corner of my eye, I see the young woman attempt small talk to no avail.

I get started and I'm giving a brief introduction to the Company IT. I can't help be but distracted by the icy stare of BMFH piercing me like a lazer. As I duly hand out prescribed equipment to my delegates, she watches my every move as I dart around the room ensuring everyone gets a new toy. Laptops in bags, phones and chargers in the pocket, it's a little like Christmas morning.

In my haste to get my late-attendees set up, it seems I've inadvertantly packed the wrong chargers in by mistake. After bringing it to my attention, before I could get a word out, BMFH hops to her feet to investigate the situation. Holding the end of the offending charger and staring at me, she silences the room with an authorative ""Well?"" Before even being able to offer either explination or promises to make amends, she takes phone and charger from noobie and walks for the door, with ""Come with me!""

After a solid dressing down, I walk BMFH down to the stock room where she watches me hunt around in a spares box for any combination of phone and charger that would fit. After rejecting my first three finds as unsuitable due to being slightly scuffed, she demands I instead use my company blackberry as suitable replacement. Rather than enduring her wrath any further, I oblige, kitted with charger and wave goodbye to my lovingly customised toy of awesome.

We re-enter the room; like a freshly scolded schoolby, I duly hand over the blackberry to noobie who feels mixed between ""Oooh awesome, this is better than that rubbish Nokia you tried to give me"" and instant pity as she totally knew what just happened.

Endeavouring to continue the induction, my noobie starters felt compelled to keep any and all kit-related questions to bare minumum. Not the most ideal situation I'm sure you'll wager. By the way, where is that coffee?

We make it to 12, BMFH's face looking like she's gnawing her teeth more and more throughout the session. Salvation; the facilities lady arrives with delegates' lunch and coffee. Blimey, I need a coffee.

Yeah... BMFH has other ideas. We break for lunch. I'm making pleasant small talk with some of the noobies - a standard tactic in making them feel ""comfortable"" with support. The queue for the coffee jug disipates and I walk with one of the noobies to go get myself some salvation in a cup. Just as I pick the cup up, BMFH appears by my side. She again orders me outside.

She starts with stating how lunch is for the delegates only; though no it's not! It's been SOP for god knows how long to have a working lunch with the new delegates to chinwag, talk shop, correct any misunderstandings, whatever. However, new policy as of right now, I need to return to my desk where BMFH will watch me complete some meandering tasks she has for me. My co-workers are initially confused by my presence when I should be in induction, but on seeing the red-faced snaggletoothed hellhound, quickly understand.

She insists we look at the queues... well, I'll look at the queues, she'll randomly point to various call tickets and demand why they haven't already been dealt with. This carries on for the next 30 minutes after which I mention I need to get back to the induction. 

For one glorious moment, I thought I may have been off the hook, as BMFH began wagging her finger at another lowly employee who had dropped a mouse on the floor. 

Back upstairs, half the delegates have gone missing. It seems that our departure to some had signified the conclusion of the induction. A frantic run-around the various departments and 20 minutes later, we were a full team again.

Still no coffee.

Maintaining my professional demeanour against all odds, I politely carry on with CRM and best practices. The CRM training goes down like a slow slaughter. Every step requires clarification courtesy of BMFH, like she's picking out every little thing and re-explaining it to the group. A one hour segment turns into a two hour bloodbath and everyone has just run out of happy. Best practises I cover in 20 seconds with ""There's a laminated card in your laptop bag about best practices, password lengths, etc. Read it good luck"".

After the delegates have left, BMFH decides to reel off at me what a terrible job I've just done and how ""if this is how inductions are performed, it's no wonder IT Support are a joke!"". OK I've had enough. Three days of this b****, Monday morning, no coffee, she's on her fourth cup, I react! I just said ""Firstly, it would have gone a lot easier if you hadn't had landed me with four delegates I wasn't expecting needing me to run around and scour kit up from somewhere. Secondly, this is not indicative of how inductions are usually run at all! And I resent your opinion that the support department is a joke"".

Oh... no... you... dit'int....

She exits with a calm and collected look... yea OK... I know it... I'm fkd now. 

And where is my damned coffee!?!?

**The Coffee** I ran into Mr. SureI'llBringYouACoffee no good lying git co-worker who I thought had my back. I just said, ""Dude... you said you were going to... ""

My sentence was cut short when he gave me a complete insight into the morning's proceedings. After helping me haul ass scrambling some extra kit together, he had taken my cup from my drawer, filled it with some lovely hot brown coffee and was on his way upstairs. 

BUT... unbeknownst to him, he was being hunted! As he turned for the stairs, the BMFH had towered in front like a black-clad SS officer standing in front of a little girl in a pink dress. Demanding to know where this coffee was headed, this was where she had learned of the IT Induction. In between dressing down my colleague for God-knows what and observed him as he duly tipped away my lovely coffee and placed my mug directly into the dishwasher, she had decided that she had to be a part of this induction.

As I left for work that evening, I knew I had incurred the wrath. I knew something was coming. What, I don't know... more of the same? My job? Us IT'ers are very dispensible. My thoughts only revolved around one thing... I need to get my CV in shape!",,False,,t5_2sfg5,False,,,True,t3_1ambp1,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1ambp1/the_b_manager_from_hell_pt3_the_it_induction_from/,
1364338117.0,1822,self.talesfromtechsupport,1b2mf7,The B**** Manager from Hell Pt24: FAQ,4096,2274,473,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1b2mf7/the_b_manager_from_hell_pt24_faq/,"**So, did this really happen?**
Yes. This is an as-accurate as I remember account of a bitch manager from hell that I endured over a 15 month period. The story indicates a much shorter timeline, but I only have time for so much writing! In reality, Angie micromanaged to death several ITS initiatives, cost a few people their jobs and was an overbearing terrible person. All of this led to her ultimate, er, promotion…

**How many parts are there going to be?**
To be honest, I had no idea when I started writing how many parts there would be. I just started, initially thinking 3-4 parts at most. As I found people started enjoying it, I just wrote more. In truth, Angie was such a nightmare that if I took to time to recount every single thing she did, there would have been near on 500 parts! At some point, given I have other commitments to adhere to, this needed to end sadly. I decided to steer my writing towards the ultimate conclusion of Angie’s reign. 

**Are you a writer?**
Nope. Not professionally. I’ve never felt compelled to sit down and write anything this novelistic before. I’ve been writing lyrics for years and used to trying to fit syllables to beats, restrained to only a few available lines to get the point across. I play metal though – so like anyone cares about the lyrics, so long as there’s a few cleverly picked crowd pleasing lines. RE-SPECT - WALK!

**I suspect he is in reality, British.**
Yep… sorry about that :)

**Why didn’t you just quit?**
It had been my third IT Support role. In reality, there’s no such thing as a nice IT Support role. They’re all disturbingly hostile places to be and I would urge anyone to get out as soon as possible; it's a slow suicide by telephone. My take on IT Support is that it is the one area that’s simple to get into, but difficult to dig out of. Managers like Angie are just all too common in this field. If I had just quit, as I managed to prove to myself when I did change jobs, moving from one dead-end support role to another resolves nothing. It’s just the same thing, different place!

**...go to her boss? Explain how she's impacting negatively on productivity, and on your team's mental health**
There is such a thing as crapping in your own back yard. No upper manager wants to be bothered by some troublemaking runt from some low-end support role going on about how much he hates his boss! It’s a fast track out the door, I can assure you.

**The BBC should just go ahead and turn these into a show.**
Hahaha, I am open to offers!

**I would have flipped my desk and said ""f*ck it, I'm done"" I am amazed with your amount of patience throughout this matter.**
I was brought up to be very patient. But, the fact I had a mortgage to pay, a car to keep running various other responsibilities, I couldn’t be that flippant about it. 

** I don't understand why the entire department doesn't walk out. That would get the attention of Angie's superiors.**
This is a rather Hollywood ending, but the reality is, everyone has bills to pay. I’d wager such a bold move would fall foul of its forerunner when this reality would dawn on everyone. In truth, we were all jobhunting, though!


** 3 seconds!**
Do I owe you a new spring for your F5 key?

**I love you, Jon6!**
Awww, shucks!

**If this series ends up with a tree-fiddy joke i'll be both angry and impressed**
You don’t know how tempting this was to put up - even for just five minutes! Though I hope it didn’t end that way for you!

**So, just to be clear, this all took place in the mid-late 1990's and jon6 was 20-22 at the time, correct?**
It’s safe to say I was about 22-23, and this was around 2000. I don’t want to say much more than this though, anonymity and all!


**How does it feel to have so many people hanging on your every word jon6?**
Odd! But I'm pleased I provided such entertainment - and I hope I didn't get anyone in trouble with their bosses!

**I feel like Chelle at the beginning of Portal 2. All that hard work, and the feeling of victory at escaping the inhuman clutches of GladOs, only to find yourself back in the pits of hell once more. The evil thing is still alive and kicking, and you'll have to deal with her all over again.**
Luckily I never crossed paths with her at all after that. But it’s the one big lesson of the corporate world. Credit travels up, blame travels down. The higher you are the harder it is to fall.

**Guys... guys. We got to the end. We did it.**
We sure did… my large diversion from doing coursework has also suffered… I’m envisaging a very hard Easter weekend ahead to catch up. But I’ve enjoyed writing for you guys!


**Misogyny loses my sympathy**
I would hate to be thought of as someone who hates women. For one, they’re lots of fun ;) OK I admit, I had to google ""misogyny"". The correct British vernacular is ""male cheuvanist pig""

Joking aside, I feel an explanation may be required to this line of questioning. My account describes the situation endured by all at that time; I tried to paint a picture of the characters involved as best I could. Where you can define your own definition, I would welcome you to do so. In some cases, my brief description of “quiet blonde girl” should be enough for you to paint your own picture. 

However, Angie and her gang were such an uncommon, abnormal collection, I felt that to not describe their mannerisms and neurosis would have done them an injustice. Similarly, Roland’s rat-like appearance just seemed to burn anyone who set eyes on him. BHIT, I think, was also subject to rather unrelenting description. I’ve had some excellent female colleagues, managers and so forth so I would hate for it to be assumed I have a problem with women in power. Apologies if you thought otherwise!

I was on the late shift, so I could afford the luxury of adding breakfast. For some reason I was unpreterbed by the events yesterday offered. 

I arrived to find a deathly quiet IT department. Sadly, I had begun to expect this when Angie had imparted her usual words of wisdom on some poor unsuspecting fool. I duly logged into my PC, fired up TouchPaper and began the arduous task of setting up some appointments for the day. 

I was surprised to hear a new type of noise from Angie's direction. Rather than the snarling voice of Satan demolishing yet another soul or the heavy bleak silence that accompanied her stare, there was banter and the sound of humans talking. I looked over to see Angie discussing in depth the virtues of a nearby starbucks with some Finance Hag. On the one hand we were all pretty shocked that Angie seemed to be demonstrating a more human side to her character. Though given her affiliation with Finance hag...

See, IT Support and Finance were situated directly next to each other. Some time ago, we had all been segregated into offices beautifully adorned with departmental monikers which happily contained our respective messes and existances. At some point, some middle manager in a fit of synergetic genius decided to implement an entirely open-office strategy and had all walls removed. As far as I can see, it served to merely underpin the adage of ""good fences make good neighbours"" and that destroying the efficiency of Aircon in the height of summer only adds to tensions.

Finance had repeatedly become irritated with ITS occasionally ""walking through their area"" as they would usually have varying currencies hanging around for traveling business reps - it seemed walking even near their area was suddenly deemed a security risk - and were constantly angered by the fact we had a lot of foot traffic and a lot of equipment which invariably made its way to us. Really - IT Support does not suit open office, especially next to Finance hags.

Suffice it to say, there had previously been a blowout and IT Support were mandated by up on high to keep a three desk distance from any Finance team members (a problem as they were forever encroaching on our space, with temps, filing systems and new layouts meaning we had to constantly move and shrink). Simiarly, they had enforced a three-piece rule, whereby you could only have three pieces of equipment on your desk at any time. As the average monitor and system unit accounted for two of these, you can imagine what a struggle this was should anyone show up with a non functioning laptop and accompanying projector/home router/printer. 

Our constant commandering of any post-room space and the need to create a PC-den in the stock cupboard was a testament to what a poor relation IT Support really was in the company. Though our jobs were now more difficult, in that we had to maintain a presence outside whilst actually getting to work in a cupboard was a constant struggle, we all remained cooperative and chipper in our existances. 

Nevertheless, Angie was evidently on first name terms with Finance wench. With pleasantries exchanged, off they set to the local coffee emporium to embark on their self-made challenge of attempting every single combination of coffee type they could think of - not forgetting the ominous stare at support personnel as she passed.

Finally. The coast was clear - we could take a breath. Being the last one in, my colleagues were quick to ask ""Jon6... have you read your email yet!?""... Well, no actually... and there it was. Retribution, the storm of the BMFH's reign was upon us! 

Angie had decided that during the course of the day, she would be performing ticket reviews on an individual basis. 

Middle-Aged Family Guy (MAFG) was on the early shift. He had obviously already been the meat grinder, Angie's special treatment. Of course, we were now fixated on his response to find out what went down. It soon became clear when he relented and maximised his IE window to reveal several Jobserve results. Wow, it went that well then?

MAFG wasn't a slacker, not by a long shot. In fairness, there were slackers, but he wasn't one. And it looked like the wind had been knocked well and truly out of his sales. 

He began to tell us how Angie had spun her web. She had a printed list of his open tickets and several examples of his closed tickets. She had initially allowed him to dig his grave so it seems with a few innocent cases, until launching into an all-out pincer move to demonstrate terrible goings on within his daily work. This invariably was forcing him to reopen old tickets she was dissatisfied with, despite no suggestion from the customer of that being the case.

That's when it hit me. As he talked about the meeting, the fact that things were printed (Angie has no idea where the printers even are), the fact that she was able to search the ticketing system for tickets at all... it's obvious.

There is a mole... that's all there is to it... someone here is working against us all. Someone had to have provided Angie with a method of retrieving closed tickets. Someone has to have shown her how to use the printer. The cloud of suspicion was very much there. I knew it... and I could sense, maybe some others knew as well. Is there a traitor in our midst? 

After our team post-mortem of Angie's impact to date, we were left deflated and totally unmotivated. We returned to stare into the bleakness of the computer monitor, hoping that salvation lay within. I duly opened my Outlook calendar. Sure enough... Jon6, tickets review at 13:30..... right at the start of my designated rota'd lunch break...

OK Angie... you foul smelling b****... it's on...

This is important because in some cases if we have to escalate an issue it wont be attended to until the next business day, especially for one of our clients that has a no exception policy for some crazy reason.  With the Holiday Weekend, that means something coming in tonight wont be addressed until at least Wednesday.

So I'm sitting there wrapping up a ticket and I hear him catch a call.  He reads the script for our crazy client (No exceptions) and starts troubleshooting with the caller.  

I hear him go through the steps and he decides he has to escalate the ticket.  He tells the caller that given the holiday weekend, he may not hear back for at least four days.  Just then I can hear the client screaming at him on his head set.  

I stand up and I look at him, he's sitting there cool as a cucumber fiddling with a Rubiks cube while this caller screams at him.  He casually tells the caller this, ""Please, I've been in Iraq and Afganistan.  I've had people trying to kill me every day for the past six years.  Raising your voice to me like that will not get your issue attended to any faster.  I can put in an email to the head of the level 2 department, but if he decides you have to wait until Wednesday, there's nothing more I can do.""

The caller seemed to calm down and my co-worker just smiled, ""That's alright, I'll send that email now.  Have a nice day.""

I learned something very important today, you don't know how bad you've got it unless you've had your life on the line, makes the stuff I've had to put up with seem so trivial now.  That and it's possible to be a hardcore bad ass and still be polite and maintain your dignity.

1346804106.0,1802,self.talesfromtechsupport,zd5g1,When a student hacked our school's computers,2526,724,404,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/zd5g1/when_a_student_hacked_our_schools_computers/,"Several years ago I was running a 1 to 1 at a K12 school in the US.  1 to 1 deployments mean every high school kid gets a laptop.  I was managing 6,000 Macbooks and 40 servers, as well as 2,000 or so Mac desktops at the time.   One day my boss calls me and the conversation goes like this:

Boss:  Hey Zaphod, we have a serious issue and you need to address it right now


me:  OK, boss what is this serious issue?


Boss:  Your co-worker Derp-da-Derp-a-lot printed out the master password list for the local admin accounts and 


left it on his desk, and a student stole it.


me:  Grrrrreeaaat.  So, basically I need to reset 6 local admin passwords like right now?


Boss: Yes, drop whatever you're doing and do it NOW!


me:  No problem boss I will have it fixed with in the hour.


I hang up the phone, whip up a script in bash to reset the local admin password, but I make one fatal mistake in my haste.  I forget to output everything to /dev/null, so everything goes to standard output, ie the system.log.  My mistake, under pressure, plus I thought no way a high school kid knows Unix.   I find this out, fix the script, redirect all output to /dev/null and the password in the script stops getting logged.  So, the password is on clear text but only on several hundred machines.  OK, no problem I am going to send a command out to wipe the system.log file and clean up my mess.  Since to change the password I had to set a password in a script.  This was back in like 2008, and let's say now my scripting behavior is a bit different now.  :-)


During this small window some kid had been sifting through the console looking at every single log file.  Somehow, picked out a string he thought looked like a password, and bam he had local admin access to the machines.   So, I start doing detective work and use a dummy receipt system.  Basically look for a file or string that exists and if it does, touch another file to ""stamp it"" with a dummy receipt, and then build a database of machines based on that file to see what accounts have been promoted to admin accounts.   Sure enough this one student's user account was synchronized to a lot of Macs and sure enough his account was always being promoted to admin.


I gathered my evidence, called the student into my office.  Socially awkward kid, but actually quite brilliant.  I asked him why he was violating the AUP (acceptable usage policy) and that I had proof he was giving himself admin rights.  He broke immediately.  I didn't even have to threaten the kid.  He spilled his beans, I asked him if he pulled the password form the log, he said yes.  I asked him if he had ever used Unix before, he said no it was just figuring it out on the fly.  I told him I wasn't going to turn him in, and that I will just forget the incident ever happened.  He asked me why and I said you're too smart to get expelled or suspended.  However, you need to take your brain and use it constructively.  What do you want to learn the most on the computer?  He said he wanted to start a programming club and develop games in Python.  Next week I rolled down to the storage facility and grabbed a Compaq dual XEON server, with a RAID 5 controller and 3 hard disks in it and like 4 or 8gigs of RAM.  It was one of those spend your budget money or lose it deal (government, am I right?) and they had been sitting there since I started working there so about 2 years had passed, and those servers had been collecting dust.   They had no OS on it.

I come into his building with the server on a flat bed.  I said here is your development server.  Here are the rules.  You cannot plug this into our network, my network manager will shut this box down immediately, do you understand?   Yes, he replied.  Second rule, this server has no OS on it, so you must choose what OS you want to put on it, and you have to support it yourself.  You cannot call help desk for help, and it has to be legit, either open source or someone buy's an actual license.  I understand, he said.


2 years later the kid graduates and gets a full ride to Boston College.  he also wrote the advanced math curriculum his senior year.  He did a bunch of stuff in Python and LaTeX.  


Oh I also turned him into my mole.  Every time some kid talked about hacking he would email me and tell me what they were trying to do.   I haven't talked to him since, but I bet by now he is graduated.  Pretty smart kid, hope he succeeds.  Him getting expelled or suspended or even in trouble may have damaged his record, which may have damaged his chances at a full scholarship.  Mind you, I was working for an impoverished school district, a lot of families in that district were below poverty level.  


EDIT - fixed formatting


Sometimes it is good not being the iron fist ruling, over authoritative dick head system administrator, but sometimes you gotta do that to get your point across.  I was lucky enough to realize the situation and actually put this kid's smarts to productive use.  I hope he has a bad ass job right now.


EDIT #2


Several of you have expressed interest in the fact it was an impoverished school district and they all got laptops.  Let me explain to you how budgeting works in public education.  The state you live in sets a budget, and according to your size, and your location, you get X amount of dollars every year.  Now, additionally you can get federal money as well on top of state money.  The budget is then broken down into categories.  You have budget for staff, which covers their wages, benefits, and so forth.  Capital Outlay is the part of the budget you spend on technology, desks, renovations, and so forth.  It cannot be used for salary, the government does not allow you to do so.  Furthermore, the government has a thing called eRate, which I believe is regulated by the FCC.   It forces companies who join such a program to lower their prices for schools, and allows schools access to technologies through this program.   


The school I worked for, which I no longer do work there, decided they wanted to go 1 to 1.  With Macbooks being about $900 a pop it wasn't too much out of the question.  You only have a little bit of savings with a desktop, since you must also pay for keyboards, mice, and monitors, and they require more power.  A laptop is 1 plug.   The school was about 60 buildings and 30,000 students.  The laptop program was at the high school level only, which was 6,000.


You have to realize a lot of these kids never even ate their first meal for that day until they came to school.  I grew up lower middle class and I thought I had missed out on certain things in life, and that I was a bit under privileged compared to all the other kids I went to school with.  I didn't realize how selfish and self centered I was until I got this job.  I worked there for 5 years running their laptop program.  I got a bike for Christmas, and while my family was unable to ever take me on international vacations, or cruises, we at least got to go to the lake for vacation.  These kids have nothing.  It taught me how privileged I was.  Giving them a laptop is awesome.  Sure, some kids will squander their opportunities and not care, sure some will just get by and not take full advantage of it, but some kids will put it to good use and get full scholarships to good colleges and come out on top.   That right there makes it completely worth it.


**EDIT #3**


It is possible the kid read this post.  I am not going to say who my employer was, or where it was because I believe anonymity is the best.   I would hate to have anything backlash and reflect poorly on the school system I worked at.   Plus now I work back in the private sector and have learned it is really just a professional courtesy to keep your mouth shut.   I will update if it was really him.   


**UPDATE**

The student in question has in fact found this thread, and I have been messaging him via reddit.   I have told him I won't reveal his name, my name, or the schools name for anonymity reasons.  I think it is best kept that way.  He also reminded me of a few other exploits the students found and used which I forgot about.   The ARD Agent bug (Apple's fault) which allowed you to run apple script with escalated privileges, ie sudo.   Then we had a package that had a self healing auto update, and I had to have one folder in that package writable (bad developer) and we managed application usage by file path.  So, once students figured out they could drop games in this folder they did.   To remedy this I switched off the write bit in POSIX and then just download and repacked the whole package manually every time an update came out and just redeployed said package.


I'll have to admit I was impressed by how adaptive and smart a few of the students were.    They made me pay for my mistakes.  Plus, it is impossible to test every aspect of security with out a security audit team.  That is why companies have and contract out IT security people to audit such things.   I also changed my whole approach of imaging and managing the Macs after a lot of these issues.

It involves technology, babies, and cookies, so it has to be worth it. 

At my firehouse, we check and install child safety seats. Enter new parents we'll call Dirk and Amy and their adorable two day old daughter Emma. Now Dirk is not letting one iota of this child's first week go undocumented. I can only imagine what's on the camera. 

Dirk had done an excellent job of installing Emma's child seat. In fact, it only needed a little bit of tightening. While I went over the paperwork, Dirk asked if he could use the restroom. I showed him to the restroom, and returned to the vehicle for mom and baby were playing happily. Mom took it upon herself to get the camera to take some more pictures of baby Emma. 

Dirk returned from the restroom to see mom taking more pictures of baby Emms sleeping. 

""Honey, the camera wouldn't take any more pictures, but I used that format thing to make more room,"" said Mom. 

All color left Dirks face. I honestly thought we were going to have to load him in the ambulance. He broke out into a cold sweat and did everything he could to contain his panic. That card had in fact contained all of the photos from birth until now for baby Emma. I thought the man was going to cry. In fact, upon seeing his reaction, mom realized what she had done. 

Before this lovely couple started yelling at each other, I told her ""turn off the camera right now."" I explained to him that the pictures could likely be retrieved even though the card had been formatted. His response was one of incredulity. He did not believe that was possible. 

I retrieved my laptop, inserted their SD card, and proceeded to recover all but a couple of the photos from the birth of baby Emma until their visit to the fire station using some SD recovery software I'd used before. 

In the end, marital harmony was retained, baby Emma's first days will survive in pictures, and my whole crew was treated to a couple of boxes of thin mints and a half gallon of vanilla ice cream. 

TL;dr mmmmm..... Thin mints cookies and vanilla ice cream.

1356818207.0,1737,self.talesfromtechsupport,15n4do,On how I got an entire office full of people to quit.  All because I had a phone interview.,2543,806,437,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/15n4do/on_how_i_got_an_entire_office_full_of_people_to/,"Sorry if this isn't strictly tech support, but seeing as it plays a large factor, I thought it was relevant.

**Background**: I'm still in college.  My soon to be husband is graduating ahead of me, and since my credits (oddly) transfer to whatever communication program exists in the world, I'm looking for jobs for both of us somewhere out of the American South.  I've worked tech support for my dad's consulting business and all his clients since I was knee high, and while I've never been IT, it was what everyone called me.

I freelance in social media marketing to help put myself through school, which is about as difficult as you'd think it is (as in not really at all).  Older, computer illiterate people just don't understand the internet, but can really be getting into a younger market with a little bit of help.  I have a rate that turns out at about $15-$20/hr, depending on how much of my help they need.  Because I work in a lot of really teeny businesses, I often help the owners fix computers and set up their phones on the side.  I'm very accustomed to genuinely confused clients and bosses.

Today, a small marketing firm out of a major New England city called me for a phone interview.  Everything had been going really well, and I had spoken to them several times.  We even had a time set up for an in-person interview in March when I would be in town.  The employees I'd dealt with were super nice, and there had been no red flags up to this point.

I'd actually become rather close with a specific guy, who I'd talked to and emailed multiple times over the last few weeks, and who I know is a redditor.  We'll call him ""Geoff.""  I had his extension number, and his personal email address.

The person on the other end for the interview was significantly older than anyone else I'd dealt with.  He sounded like a late 50's smoker who would have been better suited for a manufacturing plant.  He starts giving me scenarios, asking how I'd respond to them.  Really weird things like, ""If one of our clients made cupcakes that killed one out of every three customers, how you would respond to that?""  Every time, after the second sentence of my response, he cuts me off, saying, ""Ok, that's enough, sweetheart.""

After about 20 minutes of this, he suddenly asks, ""Do you know anything about resetting wireless routers?  We really need someone to do that.  We just had to fire our IT guy because he kept messing up.  Lying bastard anyway, would always clear his internet history.  You don't do that do you?  Because only liars do that.""

I spent a couple of seconds in complete silence, wondering what the hell I just heard.  I eventually said, ""Yes, I do know a good bit about networking setups.  What seems to be the issue?""

He then details how he tried to install this browser tracking and keylogging software on the network, so that he knew his employees weren't liars.  He had also installed security cameras so that he could see how much they were taking breaks.  I needed to be OK with that.

I also helped him install a wireless mouse.

Now, he was speaking REALLY loud.  I had to turn down the volume all the way on my phone, and still had to hold it away from my ear.

By now, I was sort of scared that the employees didn't know about any of this.  I decided to stall, telling him that was going to have to talk to my fiance and see if the dates lined up for when he first needed me.  I obviously wasn't taking the job.  He wanted me to start as soon as possible.

I got off the phone, and immediately called Geoff.  I asked him if he'd heard any of that.  He confirmed that he had heard everything, and that no one had been aware of what was going on.  He'd checked his processes and there it was, a keylogger as well as some other random software installed that dumped everything he'd done during the entire day into a file on his boss's PC.

He told me he'd call me back.  He had to call a lawyer, then quit.

He called me back later, and told me the entire office did just that.  25 people.  They're starting their own firm, and have invited me to join once they get on their feet.

The owner had died a year or so ago, and this guy had bought the business.  His previous job?  Head of sales for a sofa making company.

**tl;dr - Big Brother is revealed in a phone interview, entire office quits.** 

**edit** Just got a text again from Geoff.  Though he didn't give me any information on how his boss was doing it, apparently he was recording every phone conversation in the place and saving it, without notifying anyone, including the person on the other end.  There had also been some discrepancies with pay, with half an hour being taken off somehow, or being made to work an hour longer.  Apparently, even though most were salaried, he had been docking their checks for EVERY MINUTE spent on non-work-related activities.  They're hoping they can sue him just on the phone conversations alone.",,False,,t5_2sfg5,1356837494.0,,,True,t3_15n4do,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/15n4do/on_how_i_got_an_entire_office_full_of_people_to/,
1375020552.0,1703,self.talesfromtechsupport,1j7rcf,The only time I lied to a client,2309,606,314,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1j7rcf/the_only_time_i_lied_to_a_client/,"Many of the tales on this subreddit are stories of the frustration of clueless users, short-sighted bosses, and basically anything that arises from working in an industry where nobody else really understands what you do. I thought I'd share a different sort of story - the only time I really wasn't sure what to do ethically. I'm still not completely sure I handled this properly, but screw it I'm not going to bother with a throwaway. 

I had several clients I supported long-term, to the point where I almost became another employee. These were engineering firms, and while they didn't understand all the technology, they understood the value of preventative maintenance, taking care of equipment, and the IT itself was typically pretty low-stress. Some of the employees would request my services for their personal computers, which is how this story starts. 

I'm at one of my best clients, and their senior engineer, a man in his 70's, approaches me. I've known him for years, and even met his family at a few company functions. He has a few daughters, and a son - all in their 30's and 40's. Here's how the conversation went:

* ""My son has recently passed away, and I'd like you to help recover some of his files"". 
* ""Sir, I'm very sorry for your loss. What can I do to help?""
* ""When going through my son's estate, the most recent copy of his will, which was updated about 2 years ago, has a significant portion of his assets going to his best friend, and not to anyone in the family. We found some files on his laptop we can't open, and thought they might have some clues as to why he made this decision - maybe a journal or something. We always thought we were close with him and are really perplexed as to why he'd disinherit us. The friend seems just as surprised"". 
* ""Sure, I'll be glad to take a look at it, although depending on the security there might not be anything I'm able to do (I'm thinking TrueCrypt, etc). 
* ""No problem - whatever you can do""

So, I get the laptop, and go home. When I power it up, I see in C:\Program Files\ are the files in question. Archive1.RAR, Archive2.RAR, etc, through about 7 or 8. Someone had obviously been doing some digging - who the hell checks program files for RAR files? Anyway, they vary in size, from say 2GB to 5GB. Try to open them up - and of course, password protected. As RAR's are known for their rigorous security, I figure I'll have this job done in 5 minutes or less. 

I grab some random RAR password decryptor, and get the password. I open the files, and - they're all filled with - gay porn. Most of it is pretty vanilla, but there's a little bit of light bondage and watersports. No journals, personal files, or anything else - just porn. As I work my way through archives 4 and 5, I realize that the file names are all now ""John and I doing X"" - not the names you'd see from a porn site. Great. 

So, as I realize that I'm looking at the amateaur porn of a dead man who was obviously in the closet to everyone - it dawns on me. The ""friend"" was really the boyfriend, which is why he was named in the will, and for whatever personal reasons, the son / boyfriend don't feel comfortable coming out to the guy's father, even in death. Now's probably a good time to mention that I'm only 19 at the time, and that I also happen to be bisexual (I was completely in the closet at the time, I still am to my family). So now, instead of dealing with a simple file recovery, I'm faced with lying to an important client about his dead son, or outing a dead son and boyfriend - with photographic evidence. Fuck. I decided I'd pull the laptop's drive, and search for deleted files, in the off chance the son had a note or journal or letter to his dad that might somehow help the situation. I found nothing helpful - it seemed that his computer was solely for web browsing / online banking / porn. Nothing helpful at all. Fuck. 

I thought about it for a while, and decided that the boyfriend was fully capable of disclosing this information if he chose to, and that the son obviously wanted this information secure, and that it wasn't my place to disclose it. However, this still left me in a tricky situation with the father. I couldn't tell him, ""Sorry, I wasn't able to open the files"", because he'd simply find someone else who could, and might not be as discreet as me. Somewhere down the line, the boyfriend and son would still be out, and the father would know the homegrown porn existed. No, I had to lie about it in such a way that the father would be satisfied, and not pursue the issue. 

I pick up the phone: 

* ""Hello, It's Paracelsus, I've got some news""
* ""REALLY?!? Did you find anything? A journal, notes, anything at all?!?""
* ""No, I was able to decrypt the files, and I could see why your son wanted to keep them secure. It turns out that he had downloaded some bootleg software and movies off the internet. It's not a big deal, but they can contain viruses and be dangerous to the computer, so you'd want to keep them protected. I'd suggest deleting them, or at least not trying to open them"". 
* ""Ah, that makes sense. My son was always really good with computers, and I could see him messing around with stuff like that. Thank you for letting me know - the last thing I'd want to do is try and open them and mess up his computer. You didn't find anything at all, Paracelsus?""
* ""No, sorry, I even ran a full-drive search for deleted files, just in case there was something in another location. I didn't really find any personal files at all"".
* ""Wow, that's thorough! Thank you for doing that! How much do I owe you?""
* ""Oh, considering the circumstances, nothing at all... I'm sorry you didn't find what you were looking for, and for your loss.""

A new support manager had appeared. Young, new and inexperienced, his often rash decision making seemed reminiscent of Angie’s vicious and brutal idea of management, though it seemed driven by immaturity rather than vindictiveness. We continued to exist in the knowledge that there was nobody who would be like our first ITS manager. But, thankfully, nobody like Angie either. 

I had two major projects after Angie’s departure. I was in the midst of successfully redeploying the laptops complete with fully working software. However, it became apparent in the days subsequent to her finding out that Angie had opened administrative access to AD to the entire Helpdesk. As you can well expect, our sparkling and carefully maintained AD structure now had contradictory group policies, login scripts which went nowhere and more phantom accounts and objects than I think we would ever finally sort out. It was if Angie had left me a parting gift, a final “fuck you” from the Queen of Aggression. It’s two-pronged effect seemed unintentional given her ineptitude. But it had encroached on every single user in the company as their login times grew exponentially, together with seemingly random permission sets which denied sometimes even the most basic of privileges.

It was getting to be the hottest summer I’ve ever known in Britain. I still hadn’t taken time out to wash my Mondeo; it’s recent costly repair bill had left a bitter taste in my mouth. The grime that lay affixed to the bonnet and wings seemed an apt punishment for depriving me of yet another wage check. 

Arriving back to the office from a well-earned summer pub lunch, I walked towards the building across the car park. As I passed, a familiar Jaguar graced a VIP spot in the car park. Sleek and shiny, its black finish shone in the midday sun, freshly polished and lovingly detailed. Its congeniality seemed marred by the fact that Angie had once owned a car like this, her angry face refusing to even make eye contact as she stared over the leather steering wheel. 

I had finished replacing a dead hard disk in an OptiPlex and was delivering it to a damsel in distress. Particularly, this was one of the sales guys damsels in distress. As I connected the machine back up, he came out of his glass-clad office for a chat. “Did you see, your ex manager is back” he grimaced. I knew what he meant; this man had been trained to smile and lie for a living. The news that Angie was back seemed unpalatable. 

“Who, Angie?” I questioned. “She got sacked, didn’t she?” 

The Sales Manager shook his head with a learned look. “People like that don’t get sacked!” he explained. I hung on his every word, as if this was the most important lesson I would ever receiving in my life. “When someone like that is put into a particular position, it’s usually because someone recommended her for it. Someone put her there, Jon6! If she had done well, the person who recommended her would have gotten a nice pat on the back. But, if she cocks it up, there’s no way they’re going to turf her out. Whoever recommended her would have their nuts in a sling for recommending such a dud; nobody would ever take them seriously ever again”

He continued “When people like that in such positions of power make a fantastic fuck up like that, they get paid off. They get promoted with a golden handshake just so someone above her can save face with the board! Admitting failure isn’t even on the menu!”

Despising the obvious truth to his words, I had to probe deeper “Then, who got the blame for all that then?” 

“Well, BHIT of course. He was so close to retirement and he didn’t really make much noise anyway. People forgot he was there. It was either him or you guys, really!”

I looked up from over the desk partition. Across the cavernous office, I could just about see the familiar twisted frame of Angie as she stormed with intent around a small section of desks, her shrill and piercing tone somehow breaking through the human noise, over the sound of printers, phones and chatter. Another hapless team of underlings were getting it from her, both barrels. 

I turned, eager to continue this discourse; however the Sales Manager had already retreated to his office. He held his phone to his head as he clicked the door closed. 

As the OptiPlex spun into life, the Windows XP splash screen floated as if to stand testament to the spoils. Who had really won here? Well, nobody it seems.  As I struggled to think for a moral to the story, I was interrupted by the returning damsel. She thanked me for my time turning back to her work, our brief moment of temporary friendship now at an end, politically and autocratically ceased with the completion of my task, the only remaining duty being the closing of the support ticket.

One of the two worst calls I received was regarding that very buy-out.

I gave my (overly long) introduction, got the customer's full information (it took approximately 2 minutes of us demanding information before we were allowed to ask what the customer's issue was or we would be disciplined for not following the script), and asked what the problem was.



Me: ""And how may I assist you today, ma'am?""

Customer: ""Well first, let me start by saying that I am not at all racist.""

Me: ""Of course not, ma'am.""  At this point I'm recounting how the most racist, bigoted things I've ever heard were prefaced by those eleven words.

Customer: ""Well you guys just got bought out by Spring Wireless, right?""

Me: ""We, uh, technically 'merged' with Spring, so now we are the same company.""

Customer: ""Used to be, when someone would call my phone, before ringing they would hear, 'Please wait while the (Original company) customer is being found.""

Me: ""Yes...""

Customer: ""Well now it says, 'Please wait while the Spring customer is being found.'...but then it repeats it...IN SPANISH!""

Me: ""Yes ma'am, because our customer base is very diverse we find that it is best to reach-""

Customer: ""Well I do NOT want people to think I would ever, EVER associate with someone who would speak Spanish!  I'm not going to support those illegals!""

Me: ""But...it's just a recording.""

Customer: ""Well you better change the damn recording. I don't want people to think I have anything to do with them!""

Me: ""You don't understand...I do not have the ability to re-record the message that goes out to several million subscribers myself.

Customer: ""You will change the message or I will cancel my account TODAY.""

Me: ""Okay, ma'am,"" I responded, exasperated.  ""But I just don't seem to understand why it is such an issue.""



Customer: ""Because if those LITTLE PEOPLE want to float over here in those LITTLE BOATS and steal OUR JOBS and ruin OUR ECONOMY then they DAMN WELL BETTER LEARN OUR LANGUAGE!  Now you send me to cancellations so I can switch to a company that has some MORALS!""

At this point my supervisor has come over to listen to the call and is doing everything he can not to fall out of his chair laughing.  The lady has four phones on her account and is just a few months from the end of her contract--meaning she will still get hit with $800 in cancellation fees because she can't accept the fact that other languages exist.

My supervisor comes over and mutes my phone.  ""Let me handle this,"" he says with a grin.  He hits ""conference"" on the phone.  This puts the customer on hold and opens another line.

He types in a number that I faintly recognize but just can't place.

He hits ""conference"" again right before the line picks up.  The phone is muted from our side, but he has just connected the customer to this other department, who starts to give their intro.



I can't believe what I heard.  My ballsy supervisor transferred my racist customer to the Spanish-speaking helpdesk.

I worked for a National Group in this organisation and we had offices in every major city in the country. One of the cities had a regional holiday and I had agreed to cover any local calls while the two IT Support guys took the day off. I was not expecting much other than a few senior managers who had to catch up on work. 

No calls had come through until about 9am, when a senior member from this remote office telephone number came up. 

“I’ve been trying to print and nothing is appearing in the printer”, he told me. 

“Not a problem” I said, “I will remote into your machine and check it out myself”.  So, I get onto his box and could see that someone had changed his printer to a networked one. 

“You are not printing locally”

“I am sorry” he replied. 

“You are not printing to your local printer; it has been changed to a printer on the network”. 

I changed it back to the one on his desk, while I explained . “You are printing to another printer in the country”. 

“Oh” he said and hung up really abruptly. I did not expect that type of rude behaviour from this guy but then he was a pretty high level person and they could get rude.

The next call I got was from this young secretary in one of our small offices. I did not get support calls from there very often since it was a small office with only 10 staff. This girl had started about a month before and this was her first job, I think she still lived at home. 

“Hello, is this IT Support”. She asked. 

“Yes, it is. 

“My printer has not stopped printing this morning.”

I was kind of expecting this call and so I told her not to worry and was about to say I knew where it was coming from when she interrupted me. 

“It won’t stop printing p-p-porn”, she exclaimed. She had trouble saying the word ‘porn’, as if this was something bad that her parents had told her about. 

“It is pages and pages about men’s ‘things’ and their problems”. 

“I am sorry, what is it”, I asked. 

“Men’s parts and them having difficulty with them”. She explained. 

“Erectile Dysfunction?” I asked. 

“I am not explaining this any more!” 

“There are pictures!”

“We have been hacked””. She yelled at me in quick succession.  

I calmed her down and told that I had stopped the printouts and that we would not be ‘hacked’ again. 

I guess the fellow in the other city had been trying to print out suggested solutions to his problem from various medical websites and when the first printout had not appeared, he had pressed print several more times. He had tried to print over 25 copies of multiple articles. 

The secretary left a short while later, stating that she did not feel suitable for this position. It seemed to have really rattled her. 

EDIT: Wow - Front page - Thanks. 

He was not in a medical profession. This stuff was strictly personal. He came in on a holiday to surreptitiously print information of a sensitive nature and read it later. This was back when folks did not have home broadband. 

I think that he had probably been set up to print to the remote office and then forgot about it (until he remembered). I never chased it up and found out if the local support guys had done this for him. I thought the fellow had suffered enough. The offices were on opposite sides of the country (roughly 50 miles apart). 

The lass had left after this but I think other things were also affecting it. She was pretty sensitive and did not handle being in a busy office well. Closeted schoolgirl to frontline support staff in a busy office is tough for most folks. This probably did not help. 

I have no idea what the pictures showed. Use your imagination.

Angry: Yes, I'm a student at [University] and I'm try'n to buy Microsoft Office with the student discount but it's telling me that my student number is wrong.


Me: Alright, can I get your student identification number please?


Angry: It's (proceeds to give me username that has no numbers in it)

Me: thank you.

The discount is only available to students who are currently attending classes.


Angry: (voice suddenly filled with rage and ignorance) I am too a student here! I need office for some classes that I'm taking over at (other school not related to us at all) and I **demand** the cheaper price. That shit is too expensive to buy regular.


Me: are you currently enrolled in classes here at (university)? 


Angry: No, but I **AM** a student!!


Me: ma'am if you're not taking classes, then you're not a student here.


Angry: I am too! I just had to take some time off because of illness! (She then proceeds to tell me about her ""illness"" and how she still deserves her discount software and)


Me: I'm very sorry, but unless you are taking classes, you don't qualify for the discount price.


Angry: can you just let me use your student number and order it for me?


Me: no ma'am, that's illegal.


Angry: Are you new there? I can't wait till they train yo worthless ass.


Me: ma'm, insulting me will get you nowhere. If you're not a student here, then I cannot help you.

A few minutes go by and the phone rings again and on the caller ID it shows her number. So I go and get my manager and ask if he would handle this irate woman.


Manager: thank you for calling IT support, this is manager, how may I help you?


Angry: I just called a few minutes ago, and one of your employees was rude and refused to help me! 


Manager: I'm very sorry for that, I'll have a word with Toplesspenguin later. Is there anything I can help you with?

Manager then goes through the whole process of getting her number and telling her she's not a student and doesn't get her discount. 


Angry: is there anyone there with more experience who knows what they're doing!?


Manager: ma'm, I designed and created the system you're using, there is no one with more experience. It's obvious you're trying to get something you don't qualify for. If you call again your number will be blacklisted and you will lose IT phone support privileges. 


Angry: fuck you!


Manager: (in the calmest cool voice) no bitch, fuck you. *click*


I have never felt more defended and cared for as an employee since that day. I later found out that she did call a few days later that she did call again and convinced one of the other techs to use his ID for her.

Me: So you want me to spend about two weeks on a project, and get paid $250?

They usually try to unabashedly flirt with me. I don't care so much about that, it's the time it takes for them to stop and tell me their problem that drives me insane. I have never professed patience as a virtue.

One guy in particular was especially flirtatious and obviously decided that he had ""game"" and would try and woo me even though we were over 2000 miles a part.

 After our first conversation, I called him the ""DAAAMMN, your voice is sexy"" guy. DYVIS for short. Also, one note before I start the story, this guy had a pending request on my facebook that I had neither accepted or ignored.

There I am minding my own business when I get a phonecall. I rattle off my usual spiel.


DYVIS: Hey baby, nice to hear your lovely voice.


Me: Oh hello, what's going on? (nervously laugh)


DYVIS: Why haven't you accepted my FB request?


Me: Oh, I really only have people I know in person and really well on there.


DYVIS: Ah, c'mon, I'm not a creep. 


Me: What problem are you having? (I try to extricate from the uncomfortable conversation.)


DYVIS: Oh, I see how it is. (He guffaws) My aircard isn't working.


After some troubleshooting and remoting into his PC, I am checking the drivers and need him to take out the aircard and put it back in.


Me: Can you take it out and put it back in?


DYVIS: Woah, Bookinvertebrate, it's a little early for us to be doing that! (Laughs obnoxiously, shredding every last remnant of patience I had ever deigned to posess.)


Finally fed up, my voice entered a flat tone and I said:


No, I am not talking about your penis, I am talking about your aircard.


He coughs, the line goes silently awkward. My coworker practically broke his neck as he swung it around looking at me with surprise. 


The guy finally does as I ask and he stays blissfully silent the whole time. I'm sure he thought I was going to report him, but I just wanted him to  STFU.

Then a whole bunch of ""reply to all"" happened, with the various CCd people _also_ emailing help, and occasionally even each other, and it took a couple of hours to prune everyone who had nothing to do with this out of the conversation. Once the shouting had shut up we managed to get a reply back explaining that the wifi was not down, and that she needed to log in using her usename and password now, along with detailed instructions as to how. Also, a fairly stern warning about sending out bulk mail and why it was causing everyone such a pain in the ass. 

What did we get back? 

from: [idiot]@company
to: help@company; support@company; [linemanager]@company; [local-office-drone]@company; [it-team-member-1]@company; [it-team-member-2]@company;  [it-team-member-3]@company ... (etc)

subject: Ok. 

&gt;""The wireless is still down.""

aaaaaand the reply to all happened again. 

Whilst we were trying to quieten everyone down we got another, again, CC'd to basically everyone she'd ever met. 

&gt;""I tried the password.""

then another...

&gt;""It didn't work.""

then another... 

&gt;""I tried my username too. Is that the password?""

and another...

&gt;""What's the password?""

Each time CC'd to what appears to be her entire address book, each time just one line with no context. Each one a new ticket that we have to merge with the old tickets to try and track this growing abomination. 

To try and stem the tide we sent one of the helldesk to her office to talk to her in person... she wasn't there. Whilst hunting for her more emails kept coming in. 

&gt;""I thought my password might be wrong.""

&gt;""My password is [password]... is that right?""

**headdesk**

&gt;""I tried [otherpassword], which is for my PC... is it that one?""

**double headdesk**

&gt;""I changed my password to [newpassword]. That doesn't work either.""

I had this image of someone sitting there just typing whatever came into their head into their email client and hitting ""Send to all"" once every few seconds, never reading the replies that came back. Then something occurred to me... if she's not sat in front of the computer in her office, and she's not able to use the wifi, then where the hell is she sending these emails from? I was composing a message to that effect when I got this final one:

&gt;""By the way, I'm at home.""

Working at a small company budget is a major concern. So if it can be done cheap great, free is better.

I come in one morning to find the boss has performed one of their ""audits""of my computer. Having already configured spiceworkd I never understood why they needed to go to computers. Then again, they didn't seem to have a clue what they were doing.

These audits consisted of looking around for files and applications they don't know and deleting them. I wrote code examples like Github gists to demonstrate how things could be implemented. They were deleted to prevent them accidentally being included in release builds. Two branches of source code, better delete one... which one? Better delete them both so they know not to have multiple copies. That reminds me, I better ask where we are up to with the new features they were writing.

I would come back to databases being deleted. Migration projects gone! Database engines gone!

I open outlook to see they have once more removed the reading pane. Oh look they have moved all my email and forwarded them all to themselves. Oh joy, I envision a day of ""you received an email 3 years ago from.x at y about z can I mark this as resolved?""

There is an email from them at 04:00. ""It has been noted that hardcore pornography was on your computer.""

Unsure what constitutes hardcore these days I email back ""was this email meant for me? I am not sure what you mean.""

After only a few seconds I receive an email back with ""on your computer you had a file called gimp that contained pornography.""

""Do you mean gimp the gnu image manipulation package? I used last week to edit graphics for a client as we do not have Photoshop.""

""We have Photoshop. I will bring it in. It's the latest version you can get and it cost us a fortune.""

They brought in CS2. I was expecting CS 5. It appeared to have been bought at a rummage sale and I was told not to activate it. Gimp was never mentioned again.

Not Both.,2098,549,185,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1ivye4/i_can_do_my_job_or_answer_your_questions_not_both/,"I read [this other story](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1iuuxd/no_maam_for_the_9th_time_already_it_is_not_fixed/) and it reminded me of something a coworker shared with me from back in his day. A story where styles of management and tech support collide.

Let's call this coworker ""Tim"". Many years ago at a company far, far away...

Tim was working for a U.S. defense firm. As you may expect, defense companies use computers [and other stuff] to test military hardware. One day, during a particular test cycle, the test fails and fails hard. In the beginning, it's not even clear if it's an issue with the computerized test equiment, or the Unit Under Test [""UUT""]. God help you if your test equipment fried a perfectly good UUT -- the Pope will refer you to St Jude before running like Hell.

So there's a tight schedule and all testing is halted because of this failure. Managers are sweating. Senior managers are sweating. Directors and VPs are sweating. The customer pays a call to say 'hello' in person. For defense firms, ""the customer"" is a polite term for ""uniformed members of the armed forces"".

It falls to Tim to be the man on the spot. ""Hey, Tim, fix this up double quick."" He gets to it. After some troubleshooting, it turns out the test equipment is buggered but the UUT is fine. The fix will take roughly 20-40 minutes.

... except that all these managers, senior managers, big wigs galore, and the customer are huddled together 30 feet way ""to facilitate"". We know how some managers are when it comes to facilitating via being physically present in the room. Every few minutes, one of these folks would break away from the group, meander over to Tim, and ask some version of, ""So, how's it going?"" or ""What's your status?"" or ""How close are you to being finished?"". Every... few... minutes. A 20-40 minute job quickly starts to extend into forever.

Tim's direct manager walks in. I mean, what's taking Tim so damn long? Let's call Tim's direct manager ""Bob"".

Bob takes one look at the group of Big Wigs, and then one look at Tim, then back to the Big Wigs. Bob walks over to Tim.

Bob: ""Tim, how are you doing?""

Tim: ""Well Bob, I'm trying to do this fix-up work so we can get back to test. I know what needs to be done, I should be done by now to tell you the truth, but they keep coming over one by one and interrupting me.""

Bob spins on the balls of his feet and jabs his finger up in the air. ""Everybody OUT!!!""

After a few minutes of cat-herding and political massaging, the room is evacuated except for Tim and Bob. Tim continues his work and Bob actually helps out by passing tools around. Job is done, steps and fixes are logged, the word spreads faster than bad news, and testing can resume.

Forever after, Tim knew he liked working for Bob.

So my cousin gets Captain Tsubasa II on the NES, and he lends me Captain Tsubasa I and I play the SHIT out of that game. It was in Japanese, and I didn't know what to do, but fuck it, you know? It's a football game (I'm sorry... soccer)... not that difficult to understand what's happening.

So after a month or so, I give him back the game he lent me and we go our separate ways.

NOT SO FAST, SON.

Later in the day, his mum calls my mum and, as told by my mum, this conversation happens:

&gt; Mum: What happened?

&gt; Aunt: You know what happened! You dropped my son's NES cartridge in the fucking water!

&gt; Mum: Is it not working?! (\*At this point I'm seeing my mum eyeing me ready to kick my ass.\*)

&gt; Aunt: No it's working.

&gt; Mum: Then what gave you the impression that we dropped it in water?

&gt; Aunt: The players are all smaller. Like they shrunk.

&gt; Mum: \*hangs up\*

Later, we learned that the second release of the game the players looked bigger on the screen than in the first game. My cousin, having played the second game for a month, forgot how the players used to look in the first game, told his mum, and her first thought was ""She must have put the game in the water, because the players shrunk down a size or two.""

The software we support uses the SQL database engine. The installer has a batch file, that runs the SQL express installation with the default settings our software requires. At times, it fails due to windows updates, permissions, Microsoft sucking, etc. I can walk somebody through an SQL install and it's not too painful. As long as they follow my instructions, the manual install doesn't take too much time, but like I said, the prerequisite of this not taking too much time requires the customer to follow my instructions. 

A remote session failed, so I was not getting into this guy's computer. An hour went by, no progress.

**Customer:** NO I don't want you to take that! Unplug your computer from the TV! I don't know how you did that.

My gears start turning. This kid is probably running an HDMI connection from his computer into the television. This requires him to change the default sound settings and sometimes visual settings. It's a gamble, but I'm bald, and don't have any hair to rip out to ease my pain. I began to engage in small talk.

**Customer:** Sorry about hearing me yell at him

**Me:** No problem. How old is he?

This company is quite old, and that said, there were quite a few older people who were running it, especially higher up.

When I get around to doing one of the CEO's computers.. I was in for it. He must have been between 70 and 90 years old. He looked like a goblin. A short, bald, goblin. No. He looked like Gollum. But was taller, and whiter, and had big, thick glasses with round black rims.

This particular man had two computers in his office. The work one, which wasn't all that old running XP, and some ancient monstor from before the dawn of time. It was a grey box pentium 2 with a whopping 32mb of memory.. Running windows 98. Not windows 98 SE, windows 98. And it was dead. Almost as dead as he should have been.

He asks me if I can make his brand new computer look like his old one. 

Being one of the CEOs, I was told to jump through hoops, bend over backwards, and invent division by null if he so requested it. And so I went about the quest to make windows 7 look and sound like windows 98.

I take his ancient Time Lord device and try to turn it on initally. 

The power supply doesn't work, so I swap it out with a 8 year old newer one from a 14 year old PC, and it boots to dos. 

I dont' know very much about dos. I ask the old guy and he asks me to show him. Be punches in some crazy string of characters and juju witchcraft and windows begins to boot.

What?

How did this statue .. KNOW to do this?! Is he a timelord?!

Anyway, he provides me with all the necessary passwords to get into the computer and I begin my decent into the depths of the unknown. I found... The system has one of those Microsoft Themes installed; four of them. Space, Fish, DaVinci, and.. SimCity. What?!?

It is no simple matter to just copy the theme files over from 98 to 7. The computer doesn't have a USB port, no ethernet port, and none of the computers that we have currently running have IDE connectors, and even if they did, I wouldn't be able to turn off the system to access them (As I found one legacy server we have runs PCDOS and has had zero downtime in the past four years.. )

So, how do I get the files off? I have two options. Take the hard drive home and risk losing my job and get sued for insider trading with 15 year old stock information, or ..... The old guy reccomended I hook up a modem via parallel and install AOL. 

So I find an AOL version that works under 98, burn it to CD wait it doesn't have a CD drive. The company doesn't have an IDE CD drive, and I'm not bringing mine. 

So I go about download AOL for windows 98

I put winrar on a floppy

I rar up the CD and put it on a floppy about two dozen times

I extract it

I instal AOL on the machine, hey, it sees the modem!

I try to find a phone wire... oh, hey, why don't I use that fax machine in the office that nobody uses! SCORE!

WAIT WHY AM I USING DIALUP INTERNET IF I CAN JUST PUT THEM ON A FLOPPY

Seriously, that is what I did until I realized.. ugh

So I put them on a floppy, and I put the floppy onto another PC, and then onto a USB, and then onto a windows 7 machine! yay!

But some things don't work right. So I spent the better part of the week fine-tuning all four of the themes. Copied over all of the wavs, tweaked window colors, the works. The old guy did say he wanted all four of the themes, afterall.


When everything is said and done, I present the Pc which I now consider a work of art to the the CEO, and he asks if I can put it in the old white box his old PC was..

They are both ATX, so I don't see why not. I do that, and for added measure, I add one of his clicky IDE disks into it for clicky, and present him a PC that looks like it was made in the mid-90s, running windows 7. 

The man was THRILLED. Not only because he has his childhood computer running, but because it sounds, and looks like it used to. 

Aside from the thanks and praises he gave me for going out of my way to do this (I'd have done it regardless, he is a CEO), he gives me a $250 gift card to a pretty fancy resturant in town and tells my manager to give me the next Friday off, *with pay*. 

Good god. I never felt so good. I got a day of pay, a gift card, *and* a new simcity 200 theme for my computer that I never knew existed.






And due to popular demand, here is the theme!

Deepest apologies on the big delay in between, we had an urgent installation due on a ship that wasn't due for a few days come in today, and I had to sprint a good 200km's to get there and fix it before they deported again.

Anyhow, the epicness of our meeting shall be revealed. Going to give more info than originally intended because you'll see:

*2:40pm and 4 of us are outside one of our meeting rooms waiting for Mr. Boss. Myself, Derp, Receptionist and Receptionists husband (henceforth known as Foreversad)*

Mr. Boss: Come in, take a seat.

*Awkard shuffle to the table, sit down. We are all nervous as Mr.Boss is kind of intimidating in formal situations. After reading a few papers readily prepared for him, meeting commences.*

Mr.Boss: It has been brought to my attention that there has been some breach, or attempted breach, of confidentiality in this office -

Receptionist: Sir, no there - 

Mr.Boss: - and further reports of harassment and lies being spread throughout the workplace -

Receptionist: - no, that's not true, I just -

Mr.Boss: - and countless.... Will you please stop interrupting me, receptionist? It would do you good to listen.

Receptionist: Sorry....

Mr.Boss: Derp has spoken to me about an incident which occured earlier today regarding 'File permissions', could you please explain X.

X: Uhm, sure. The short story is that I was asked by receptionist to provide access to her husbands payroll file via sharepoint. I refused to do so, and explained why, and she got irritated and told me to just 'do my job', which in my opinion is what I was trying to do.

Foreversad: Really. C'mon Receptionist, I show you my slip every month.

Receptionist: No that is not true, X is just making that up to make me look bad.

Derp: So this conversation never happened?

Receptionist: No, it didn't. 

Derp: And even though I was there speaking to you two about it together, you are saying it didn't happen?

Receptionist: No, well, sort of. I thought it was a different file.

X: But I *told* you what the file was and why you couldn't access it, and you told me to do it anyway.

*Awkard silence.*

Receptionist: I only wanted to see what was in there because -

Mr. Boss: That's it, I've heard enough. You know why we hired you, right? Because your husband is a solid worker, and I personally thought you would put as much effort into your work as he -

Receptionist: I'm sorry, i just have issues with - 

Mr.Boss: - DO NOT TALK WHILE I AM SPEAKING! YOU HAVE CAUSED NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN IN THIS WORKPLACE! I have had countless incident slips and complaints regarding your conduct in this office and you have pushed your limits. Foreversad, is there anything you would like to say?

Foreversad: No.... I've just had enough of her and this bullshit that goes on... sorry, we will speak at home. I sincerely apologise for these issues.

Derp: It will not reflect on you at -

Mr. Boss: It won't reflect on you at all, Foreversad, you haven done nothing but good while you have been here.

*I'm starting to feel a little bad at this point*.

Mr. Boss: Receptionist, is it true you told Susan (random name) her granddaughter should have had an abortion?

Reception: Well.... she was only 17, i mean -

Mr.Boss: - I have never been as ashamed of having a person with that attitude working in my office. X, how would you suggest we resolve this issue with the privacy and such on the computer networks just in case?

X: Well, she only really needs office 2010 for emails and word, maybe excel. She doesn't even need to be hooked up to the net -

Receptionist: - But internet!
*Boss just gives her the death stare.*

X: Technically, we can give her a netstick, that will give her internet access and no network access, which is not needed.

Mr.Boss: Perfect. Set this up as soon as this meeting is concluded.

X: Sure, no problem.

Mr.Boss: Do you want an apology from Receptionist?

X: No thanks. I don't really want to speak with her if I can avoid it.

Mr.Boss: I understand. Receptionist, X will do what he does with your computer and you will live with it. It won't be for long, I'm opening advertisements for your position this afternoon. You will continue working for us for two weeks, and will train any person we hire for your position if we find a suitable candidate within this two week period. You will receive a further 4 week severance payment (actually quite generous) and will be paid your holiday time accrued in full. If you provoke or upset a single worker under my employment, whether it be by opening your mouth unwanted or by farting in their presence, you will be escorted from the building. Do I make myself clear?

Receptionist - but... no... wait... but... sorry *sobbing*

Foreversad: Crystal clear, sir.

Mr.Boss: And for the record, X, your outburst towards Receptionist was inappropriate and unwarranted. I understand you were provoked, and your job is strenuous, but please keep your temper under control. If it happens again to Receptionist, you will recieve a formal warning (I have 0 of 3). Understand?

X: I do, my apologies.

Derp: It will only be for a couple of weeks, avoid the people you don't want to speak to. *Whilst staring at Receptionist*.

Mr.Boss: X and Derp, you may leave.

Derp and I in unison: Thanks.

*As we are about 5 feet away from the door, closed and made of hardwood, Derp starts talking about how he is finally glad that she will be gone when we hear:*

Receptionist: FUCK YOU YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, I KNOW YOU FUCKED SHERYLL AND I KNOW THAT'S WHY YOU WON'T GIVE ME YOUR PASSWORD. YOU'VE BEEN BUYING HER SHIT FOR THE PAST TWO MONTHS! THAT'S WHY YOU WON'T SHOW ME YOUR PAYCHECK!

Foreversad: FIRST OF ALL, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU, WOMAN? I can't believe you just accused me of that IN MY WORKPLACE, and are stupid enough to think that my outside purchases WOULD APPEAR ON MY FUCKING PAYSLIP!

*At this point I just ran away from the door, just about pissing myself laughing while Derp was just standing in awe. I felt bad about what had happened to her in a sense, but my god is she one loopy bitch.*

What made her comment all the more sweeter about Sheryll* (fake name) is that Sheryll is Derps fiancee. From what I understand, Receptionist was escorted from the building by security (i am still working on her laptop tomorrow as i have no 'official' word otherwise) and Foreversad has been given some time of for 'Family matters'.

I don't know if i should feel sadness, win or epic fuck yeah about this, but one thing I do know is this: That loopy bitch had to go, and I'm gonna love my job *that* much more. 

Any questions? I feel like i've missed so much of the event in this post, it's a 'you had to be there' type thing IMO.

He said ""Remember that time you came back to the shop bleeding and muddy and said you didn't want to talk about it?  It's time to talk about it.""
 
It began innocently enough.  I received a call from one of the sales team about a new client who needed an initial assessment of their network and PCs.  This was a new(ish) Japanese restaurant in a declining part of town.  This restaurant was the only business still afloat in a much larger building that once held a movie theater and some sort of shipping warehouse.  I walked in, introduced myself to the nice Korean couple who owned the place, and got to it. 
 
As I got down to business I was informed all the previous tech work was done by the next door neighbor's son.  I took this to mean ""We're used to paying $10 and a plate of chicken and rice for tech support.""  I was not surprised to find a lot of work to do, but nothing out of the ordinary.  The first complaint was the point of sale machine.  It was unusually slow even considering the lackluster hardware.  I could not bring it down as they were still checking out the last of the lunch ""rush"".  So I brought up msconfig and decided to see what I could disable and turn off.  I remember going to the startup tab and thinking ""wow, what a bunch of crap!""  Scrolling down... ""Holy Cow!!!""  Scrolling down... OK, we're turning everything off and instead looking for what needs to be turned back on.  After this it was working better but still needed some deep cleaning or a reformat.  For some reason the internet was still dodgy. 
 
I pulled up a command prompt and did a continuous ping to Google.com and let that run for a few minutes.  When I came back I found high latency and lost of lost packets.  No big deal, we'll try to reboot the router and modem and see if that helps.  So I asked what I considered a simple question ""Where is your router and modem?""  to which I received in answer a puzzled smile.  They were not sure what I was talking about as they had only recently moved from dial up.  OK, time to switch gears.  ""Who is your ISP?""  No idea.  ""Who do you pay for internet access?""  Nobody.  Apparently they used to pay for internet access, but the teenager set them up with free internet.  Big Red Flag was raised.  This just got slightly interesting. 
 
I tried following the network cable but it disappeared into a hole in the floor.  Similar story in the back office with the accounting machine.  So I tried to log into the router and at least get an idea of what I was looking for.  I encountered the DD-WRT password prompt.  That's cool.  I prefer Tomato myself, but we've got a tinkerer.  A tinkerer who thinks it's a good idea to change the default password for LAN access (why???).  I point out the network cable to the owner and ask him if he knows where it goes.  As he looked at me the room grew dark and foreboding.  It got noticeably colder.  ""The crawlspace.  I'm not sure what that cable goes, but he took a whole box of cable into the crawlspace and then we had internet.""  ""OK, can I call him?"" I asked.  ""No, he's gone off to college.  That's why we hired you."" 
 
A second later I'm standing in front of an open trap door in the floor behind the stock room, shining my flashlight into a dark void.  There is a dirt floor and it smells.  An old stepladder is there, but I don't trust it and just jump in with tools and laptop case in hand.  My first thought was surprise at how big it was.  My flashlight didn't reach the far two walls.  It was a forest of concrete footings and steel supports.  There was a lot of power conduit and water pipes to duck under, but for the most part you had about 6 feet to stand up.  It stunk like death and decay.  I found the two network cables and an extension cord and start off on my trek. 
 
Do you remember the Aliens movie (I forget which one) where the guy is following candles in the dark hallways and there are monsters stalking him.  This is what it felt like.  I tell myself that it can't be that far because extension cords are only so long.  At the end of the cord is another plugged into it, then another plugged into that one.  OK, well at least they can't run Cat5 cable longer than 300 feet.  It's quiet and stinks worse all the time.  I keep thinking I hear something or multiple somethings moving around.  Eventually I see green LEDs ahead of me and find a small network switch.  The two network cables from the PCs plug into the switch which is powered by the extension cord, and another cable continues onwards.  My only hope of a 300 feet max was dashed. 
 
I had always thought I was the type to keep a cool head in an emergency.  I didn't think I was the type to panic.  Well, I learned something new about myself a few score feet beyond that switch.  As I continued to recall every scary movie I had ever seen I shone my light ahead and saw two glowing yellow eyes looking back perhaps 30 feet away.  A chill ran up my spine and the hairs on my arms stood up.  Something in my head snapped and an ancient, primal part of me took over.  For reasons I still don't understand I hunched over and screamed into the silent darkness ""AN ALLIGATOR!!!""  And just like that it became real in my mind.  A 20 foot alligator with long teeth faced me.  Like a pudgy uncoordinated ninja I grabbed my screwdrivers, punch tool, and wire crimp and threw them at the eyes.  And then I ran, screaming like a little girl.  I must have hit my head in my disgraceful retreat because I ended up with a small cut and blood in my hair. 
 
I got back to the stepladder and found THEY HAD CLOSED THE DOOR!  What kind of monster would close somebody into a pit of alligators like that?  I threw it open and jumped out in a single leap.  I found myself face to face with the waitress who screamed.  I screamed back at her.  The owner rushed in and looked me over with great concern.  I managed to compose myself and said ""She startled me.  I think I bumped my head, may I use your restroom?""  I splashed cold water in my face and was ashamed of myself.  An alligator?  Really?  Here where we have more snow days than warm ones?  It was likely a stray cat and I might have just killed it. 
 
So I am back in the hole retracing my steps.  I keep telling myself I'm not afraid, but I still wish I had my 22 target pistol in hand.  I get to the switch and then beyond it my tools scattered over a large area.  The slot head screwdriver had blood on it, which frankly amazed me that I actually hit the poor creature in my panic.  So with the bloody screwdriver in one hand and a flashlight in the other I continued my search for that modem. 
 
At the far wall I found the router.  Standard Linksys blue box zip tied to something holding it up.  And nothing else, no modem.  How in the heck were they getting internet?  I plugged in and tried again to guess the password without luck.  Then, remembering some of the features of DD-WRT, I checked for open wireless signals of which there were two from establishments on the other side of the road.  So my best guess is the teenager had bridged the router to one of those open wireless connections and thus provided free internet for the restaurant.  I power cycled the device (which didn't help at all) and went back. 
 
I must have been a sight.  The owner quickly agreed with my suggestions and promised to call the local cable company come install their own internet tomorrow.  I was ushered out the back door without even a glass of water.  We kept that contract, but the restaurant owner requested a different tech be assigned as he was not sure about me.  I did not complain.  Imagining he must have heard me screaming and crying under his restaurant and then screaming at his cute waitress, I really didn't want to face him again.",,False,,t5_2sfg5,False,,,True,t3_uaqs1,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/uaqs1/so_with_the_bloody_screwdriver_in_one_hand_and_a/,

Most of the calls were simple.. ""We're doing server updates, your internet will be up by morning."" That kind of stuff. Then I got this one call... this impatient, incorrigible man. He had an attitude from the get go. 

After getting what minimal information he would give me, I tried to get his OS from him, just in case. He refused. Wanted a supervisor BECAUSE I asked for it, so I dropped it.

Turns out he can't get online. Ok, he's not in the area with the updates. Damn it. Run a scan, no issues with our network. Shit. This is going to suck. 

So I start asking him what his symptoms are. He can't ping out, or get to the router. Ok. Let's see..there's no Ethernet connection according to the router information I can pull. I verify it's plugged in to both ends, then ask him to do a loopback for me. He grudgingly complies, huffing the whole time and complaining ""It's not my computer!"" Well..both LAN ports light up, and flash. I tell him that shows us the router AND Ethernet cables are working, and at this time I NEED to know his OS, because we need to check something. 

He throws a fit, tells me I'm being rude and I have a shitty attitude, but complies a little more. (I can say right now, I was being as nice as humanly possible to him since he was being so rude... kill them with kindness, right?)

I have him check his device manager. He won't give me any information. 
I ask him to run ipconfig. Won't give me anything.
I am trying to explain what we're trying to accomplish, and he asks (screams) for a tech. I tell him, sure, but I need to get approval for one to come out from a supervisor and he needs to accept possible charges because we're unable to finish troubleshooting and if it's not our equipment causing the issue (router, ONT) then there's a possible charge ""quote price""..

Aaand he flips out, tells me I have no idea what I'm doing, he needs someone else who doesn't have an attitude and is a... male...

Ahhh.. that's his issue. I have a vagina. Well I tell him I'm just as qualified to help him as anyone else here, if not more (tenure and past positions)  and I'm sorry I can't transfer you to anyone else. So he wants a male supervisor. Not an issue, because the only overnight female supervisor is on vacation. BUT, my friend, who I went through training with, is a supervisor on duty tonight and he loves these kind of calls.

He takes my headset. Repeats everything I did, step by step. He makes the guy reset his router just because, then hey.. it's still not working and no I'm not sending a tech unless we're sure it's our equipment. He gets to where I left off, and has the guy do an ipconfig release and renew. 

Hmm. What do you know...it's working.

My friend says ""It *was* your computer.""

The guy apologized to my friend for giving him a hard time, but refused to acknowledge I had been on the right track.

TLDR: Guy can't connect, thinks it our services, won't work with me, admits it's because I'm a female. Supervisor takes over call, does exactly what I did, plus what I was about to do, fixes issue.. it was the customers computer at fault.

They were large and there were a lot of parts, lots and lots of parts. Boards and cables and more cables and all sorts of bits and pieces. Here is a [pic]( http://www.museumwaalsdorp.nl/computer/images/6410.jpg) for your viewing pleasure. 
 
The IT department, and back then the term IT had not been coined, it was the Computer department, bought one of these modest sized monsters. Now this was a major purchase and had to approved by several people, including the Vice President of engineering, better known as “the mad Dutchman”. Now Dutch was the type of guy who added value to the organization by cutting costs, as opposed to generating new revenue. He was a bean counter extraordinaire. This purchase was no exception.
 
When purchasing one of these monsters the manufacturer would send you a quote listing out all the components and the price of each component. Dutch carefully perused many pages of the quote and started crossing out items he considered non-critical, such as, the console terminal and keyboard, hey we can reuse one in house, right?  And he crossed out cables to connect the CPU cabinet to the peripherals cabinet, cables to connect the peripherals cabinet to the disk drives, cables to connect everything else together. I mean, they’re just cables, we can have our hardware techs make our own cables right? Of course we can, we’re engineers, we can do anything. And wow, look, I saved $4000 on a $300,000 order. I am a financial genius!
 
So without having the Computer department do one final check on the items being ordered, and really, why would you have technical people review technical decisions made by a guy who isn’t technical, the order goes out. And the manufacturer ships the equipment exactly as specified on the hacked up quote. And the equipment arrives and is placed in the computer room. And field service comes on site to do the installation.
 
But then field service starts asking questions, like where are the data cables for the disk drives? Where are the bus cables from the CPU to the peripherals? On and on, all these pesky little missing cables. Proprietary-only-made-by-the-manufacturer cables. Someone investigates and discovers Dutch’s dastardly deed. OK, so everything will be delayed for another month or two while a new purchase order gets generated and approved to order the cables. Or so they think.
 
You see, these cables are not normally sold separately, they are sold as part of a package, a package that includes a $300,000 computer. There are no ordering numbers for these cables. There is no way to tell manufacturing, hey, just send us a few parts. No one can figure out how to sell us these parts and just these parts. (And no, doing a mirror of the quote with all the delivered parts crossed out isn't going to work). 

So the computer sat in the computer room, unpowered, for 6 months while this snafu was unsnarled. If we look at this in terms of engineering man hours lost: 6 months is 26 weeks, one week is 40 hours, there were about 25 engineers who were going to use the machine, and figure that back then one engineering man hour was worth about $50.

Cust: My customers are sending faxes and nothings coming out.

Me: Ahh so this is your fax machine not a printer.

Cust: same thing.

Me (a little sarcastically): yes, yes but is the fax machine connected to your PC or even the network?

[A short conversation establishes that no it isn't]

Cust: so you're saying its all just a mighty coincidence! Convenient that.

Me: Well could I get you to go and have a look at the fax machine and read out what it says on the display..

The company I worked for was a vendor for large corporations.  I worked on a team that provided server administration for one particular customer.  It was the policy of the customer (and probably every other) than when file servers ran out of space, we were to delete all audio/video media file types. 

We usually had few angry phone calls come our way, when we cleared space.  One particular incident got so heated and just down right nasty, that the customer's senior VP of IT gave us his mobile number afterwards and told us to escalate these calls directly to him. 

As it turned out, I received the very next irate phone call of someone looking for his missing MP3 collection. The guy on the phone was beyond deranged, he was barely coherent his rage was so great. 

I popped up the VP's phone, put the user on hold and called him up, informed him of the situation.  He had me to conference him in to the phone call.

Which I did.

The second I got back on the line with the end user, he flew into another rage that was even worse than before.  

The VP sat silent, when suddenly the raging end user stopped and stated an instant message popped up on his screen and it was more important than me.  Then I heard the customer's hold music come on. 

The VP stated: ""He got an IM from me, hang on just a second Canopyflyer, sorry for wasting your time."" I just replied that I was here for as long as he needed me. 

At that moment I really needed a large bag of popcorn. 

Screw that, I wanted the biggest bag of popcorn in the history of humankind. 

The end user came back on.  The VP then proceeded with one of the best, even toned, dress downs I have ever heard.  

The end user was sobbing 30 seconds into it. 

I received an apology and then the call ended. 

About two weeks later I traveled to the customer's headquarters, along with 2 of my coworkers.  This was a normal trip, we usually visited once a quarter during normal times, or much more than that during roll outs and projects. 

The VP took us out to dinner.  While there he handed me a name plate, the type that you put on an office door.  

It had the user's name and (former) title on it.

The VP smiled and told me: ""It's yours."" 

TL;DR: We're sorry, the number you have dialed has gotten you fired.

First. a small bit of backstory.  I am a regular member at my local hackerspace, where we keep a rather large supply of pc parts (most of them fairly dated). About 3 months before the story, I picked up an old WD1200 to use on my Pi until I could get my 1TB drive back from Western Digital (Amazing customer support, by the way).  Due to various reasons (Yay AP tests!), I didn't even look at it for a few months.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was working on setting up raspBMC on my Pi, so I could use it to store movies and TV shows from my DVD collection.  Once I had the software up and running, I realized I needed something to use as storage.  That's when I remembered I had the drive tucked deep into the Narnia that is my desk drawer.  I plugged it into my home PC to figure out what filesystem it was using so I could re-format it.  That's when I saw the files.  The drive was nearly full.  Out of idle curiosity, I dug around a little bit in some of the folders.  The previous owner left a MASSIVE amount of personal info on the drive.  There was insurance info, tax data, addresses, even bank account info.  

I figured that since this drive was left at my workshop, it must belong to a member/previous member.  So I began searching our forums and wiki for the names I found on the drive.  I found nothing.  I couldn't find ANY info on the internet about this person.  

After a few days, I started looking again on the drive for more info. This time around, I found some chat logs (and based on the date, I assumed they were IRC logs).  With nothing more than a few nicks and channel names, I set off to search the internet again.  I tried every IRC network I could think of.  I trawled the internet and searched every IRC network that had those channels.  I found nothing.

Finally after a week, I was ready to give up and just wipe the drive.  I decided to give it one more try.  Finally I found him.  He'd thankfully (for me) been using the same IRC nick for almost 15 YEARS (most of the logs were dated late 90's early 00's).

Here's a chat log (I've changed the names and whatnot, obviously).

The rigs get all their connectivity from a self-aiming satellite dish on a trailer. All their IT stuff is contained on that trailer for portability and ease of use by technophobic roughnecks.

This seems odd, but he called at 2:30 so I troubleshoot a few things and watch his connection. At 2:45 exactly, it went offline. No warning, nothing. Just gone. The phone is VOIP, so I lose him too.

An hour later he calls back, and everything tests perfectly. he assures me that they do not lose power, all his boxes have the right flashy lights. I ask him to call back tomorrow, I want to see it again and prepare tests. He does, and all tests show it offline and at his end.  A cell call from the drilling manager verifies that the site is dead, and it is ""Always down"".

So I load up the company pickup with tools and spare parts and start the long trek out to the drilling site. I time it to arrive at 2pm and give me time to test, check, and try to find the culprit while still observe the outage if nothing turns up.

About a week ago we had an issue where one of our SCSI HDD's burned out in our mail server.  It was RAID 5 so I replaced it and let it rebuild, but I began to closely monitor the server in case anything odd began to happen.  I say this because I normally don't monitor our mail logs all that closely otherwise unless people are having problems.

Our company employs a team of third shift workers to pull product for trucks that depart in the morning.  Most of these employees have been with the company for over ten years and are mostly all over the age of fifty.  They're all good guys, just not the most tech savvy which is fine.  They're also unmonitored all night, for the most part.  We also don't run any content filtering software, so all websites are open for browsing.  Our CEO's thoughts are that if we hire someone we expect them to be adult enough to know when it's appropriate to browse websites for personal use and when not to, and what sites are appropriate to begin with...which is okay for people who legitimately aren't going to download the worst viruses imaginable on accident but I digress. 

One employee in particular, we'll call him Stew, doesn't like *not* being savvy and every morning he'll wander over to my desk with a plethora of questions that I'm more than happy to answer for him.  They're usually things about which phone he should look at buying or how to do something with the computer he had never done before so it's nice to just shoot the shit before getting on with my day.  

Well, a few days ago Stew walks over to my desk and begins asking me some questions about Craigslist.  His issue was that when he, ""clicks on an email address on Craigslist to email someone it opens a bunch of options that I have no idea what to do with.""  I think on it for a second, and then figure it's probably because the computers in the warehouse have no default email client, they all use web based email because so many people share the computers out there.  So I tell him that if he just copies and pastes the email address that will work, *or* **he can just type it by hand**.  Which is what I believe he did because...

...The next morning I walk into work and begin searching through email logs.  We have a queue of bad emails that couldn't be delivered for one reason or another and more often than not it's because someone sent an email to the wrong address by mistyping a letter or some such thing.  So was the trouble with poor Stew.  You see, as I found out that morning Stew was using Craigslist at work to solicit sex from people creating FWB posts.  There was a message from Stew stuck in the Bad Message queue to ""whoever@cragslist.org"" instead of craigslist.org and it had been rejected.  Both the subject and message were there in all of their glory describing, in detail, what this 55 year old man wanted to do to this supposedly 22 year old busty blonde college girl.

I lost it and absolutely could not stop laughing.  I legitimately felt bad more than anything else.  I wasn't going to tell his boss or call him out on it because he needs his job but it was obviously not appropriate so before he left that morning I met him in the warehouse.  I pulled him off to the side and let him know that, regarding his question yesterday, I'd appreciate it he not use his work email for Craigslist if that's what he planned on doing as sometimes it results in increased spam for the company.  It's only been a day now and I haven't seen another email go out but I just absolutely had to tell someone because I really don't have a team at work and I don't think anyone else could appreciate it as much as you guys.",,False,,t5_2sfg5,False,,tftsflair,True,t3_1bidvw,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1bidvw/you_will_find_nothing_for_you_at_cragslistorg/,

A little back story on this client.  They came to us as a referral and had just recently lost their IT guy.  They needed some equipment set up ASAP so they hired us.  The CEO of the company is one of those guys in power that likes to swing his title around like a large male member because well he is just kind of a dick like that.

On to the rest of the story-

Bossman-  Hey, COMPANY is happy with the work you did and would like to use us for future work but there is one sticking point.

Me-  What is the point you guys are stuck on?

Bossman- The client will not move forward unless we give him your direct (personal) cell number.

It should be said now that we DO NOT provide 24/7 support.  We do have an on call rotation, but we stop responding to calls at 10pm.  We also have a policy that states we do not give out our cell numbers to clients (too easy for things to fall through the cracks).

Me- ABSOLUTELY NOT.  I have met COMPANY CEO and you will not give him my personal cell phone number unless you are prepared to give me a SIGNIFICANT raise.

Bossman-  Well he really wouldn't have a need to call you that often and it would not be after hours.

Me- I will respectfully disagree with you.  I will do whatever I can to help this company succeed, with that said in my experience once you give a client your personal cell number they will abuse the privilege of having it and will call at all hours.  Like I said before, unless you are willing to give me a large raise you will not give him my number.

Bossman- *stunned silence*

tl:dr Blunt response shakes up bossman's sales pitch.

Thanks everyone for the upvotes and comments!  Front Page!
  
I came in to work this morning, and bossman pulled me aside and apologized for the conversation yesterday, and said I was more valuable to him and the company than taking on that client.  Felt good to hear

However, me and at least two other people in the world know this to be absolutely true. 

I was doing a contract for a major national public sector organisation. Obviously no names, but if you've ever been to London, you've been a customer. It was your standard high staff turnover, pay em till they get bored, throw them the BS tasks kind of role. Anyway, one day, myself and another contractor were set the task of a machine hunt. Basically the network was a hodge-podge of bolted on spokes using various standards, practically held together with poor soldering and bits of gaffa tape. However, there were a list of umpteen Windows 9x machines which were apparently alive on the user subnets which needed reimaging to XP or replacing. Our job was to do the pre-project hunt to determine who was using them and where they were. I say pre-project, it wasn't exactly ""thought out""... it was some task that appeared from the ether which would most likely be re-filed into the ether. This is the same organisation who only a few months prior saw a £70,000 shipment from Dell literally get delivered outside their offices, which nobody retrieved or was aware even being ordered and over the course of the next 24 hours were promptly retrieved by members of the public! Yep, it got left there overnight and there were only docking stations left! Good use of public money, eh?

Anyway, we hunted down an old Compaq on our list. Serial matched, IP matched, now to talk to the user. The user was a guy who wore a grey suit, impeccably turned out but who looked like he was about to wet himself with fear. He asked us several times who we were, what we wanted, what for, where was this information going, etc. After placating him as much as possible that it was just an upgrade programme and we were IT Support, he finally relinquished his name.

It just so happened, another machine we were hunting for was right next to his desk; our decision to wait around for this user to return was overshadowed by his worried glances... after a few minutes of uncomfortable ""I'm pretending to not acknowledge you"" silence, we went away aiming to return later - ideally when he had disappeared.

A few days later, the same contractor and I were out on a pub lunch. The guy happens to come in and immediately notices us. He's weird, really weird. He walks quickly to the back of the pub, hovers, glances at us and then makes for the door. Of course now we're talking about him, like WTF!? He makes an about turn at the door and comes up to us; he nervously asks ""Are you definitely just IT support?"" We reply and say yep, and he just immediately leaves with an ""OK thank you"".

Of course we're weirded out, but whatever. We just put him down as a fruitloop.

Again another few days later, we're out on a smoke break, this guy appears again seemingly on a smoke break too. His eyes are wide as soon as he notices us, but as he's already lit his cigarette, he kinda has to come out now. We're wary of him, this guy is a fruitcake. He tries to make small talk; it seems to me he's probing, so I just come out and talk about what we do all day, pretending to moan about our menial duties.

Anyway, it turns out after a few more chance encounters he kinda settles down and starts talking - mainly about F1 racing, etc. He shows up again on a friday afternoon drink, this time with his wife in tow. It turns out that he has every right to have been nervous.

This guy was initially hired as part of a major projects team in the organisation. He applied for a role, got accepted, gave in notice at his old job and duly showed up for work as prescribed. However, as it turns out, in between getting confirmed for his role and actually starting, the entire major projects department had gotten nuked. The manager who hired him had left the business, members of the team were scattered far and wide, yet he showed up, some receptionist showed him to his desk where he was to wait for someone and nobody showed up. He made enquiries, all he ever got told was that someone would come talk to him eventually - but nobody ever did. 

For the last 11 years, he had shown up for work. Nobody ever hassles him, nobody ever asks him for anything, sometimes he just doesn't show up and nobody questions it, he gets paid every month, gets a statutory annual pay rise and that's it. He's been filling his time writing books for the past 8 years on this that and the other, and that is literally what he does every day. As the physical office he's in also has a high staff turnover, there's no time to make relationships or for anyone to even really acknowledge him.

Of course, he was slightly inebriated at that point. I just thought he was plain outright nuts permenantly resident in psychos-ville. I didn't believe a word of it. It's too hollywood to be true!

That was until the Monday morning, we had to check. Sure enough, HR systems showed his dept had indeed been nuked mere days after he was recruited and his active manager on the HR system had indeed long since left the business. Everything we did to verify his story checked out. We even performed a few random drop-ins and, sure enough, there he is with Word opened and he's tapping out page 370  for a novel. He never seems to do anything. Of course, he's back to being nervous again as he let his guard down while drunk and told someone. Even his wife at the time seemed to corroborate his tale.

I left the contract a couple of months later, but as far as I know, he's still there. I still even questioned the reality of such a situation. However...

On my first day of that role, I duly asked where IT was. I was told to go with a massive group of people to induction. I passed three checkpoints where security guards asked my name and, though I wasn't on their list, let me through with an ""OK must be a mess up"". One even said ""Who's your manager?"" to which I replied ""I have no idea, I've only just arrived."" He too allowed me through. What I went into was an entire day's induction for permenant staff. A lot of sensitive stuff got said, a lot of activities went on - nothing catastrophically major, don't get me wrong - but there we have it. On leaving and switching my phone back on, I had several voicemails from my recruiter demanding to know my whereabouts. I told him I'd been in induction which surprised him. It took me another 30 minutes to track down WHICH IT department I was even supposed to be in, and even a day later got told I was still in the wrong place while I was arms-deep into laying some network cable! 

This place was so disorganised, I cannot think of anything to discredit his account - other than how absolutely jaw-dropping it is!

**HD:** “Delicious, are you over in farawaycampus?”

**Me:-** “Aye.  Just finished up that meeting”

**HD:-** “Twuntyballs Fuckface from procurement is having trouble with his document checkins, any chance you could go and have a look?”

**Me:**-“No bother, I’ll give you a shout when you can close the ticket.”

I wander in to Twuntyballs Fuckface’s office and am greeted with “Well YOU took your time!”  Now, unlike helpdesk, I have no particular obligation beyond from common courtesy to be overly nice to users or be even slightly tolerant of any crap that someone feels they can throw helpdesk’s way (I realise HD aren’t obligated to take abuse either, but you get what I mean)
I raised an eyebrow and put my mildly amused face on.  This may be painful.

**TF:-** “I can’t check in these documents”

**Me:-** “Well I’ll shoulder surf for a bit and we’ll just see what you’re doing and see if there is anywhere that you’re accidentally veering off the recommended process and then…”

I start laughing.  His document checkins are not my problem.  I login and check his permissions quickly whilst still standing up, all fine. 

**Me:-** “Nope.  As of that last comment with it’s wee sweary words, it’s entirely your problem if you can’t get your docs checked in.  I reckon you’ve just not read the checkin/out tutorial.  It probably has a few too many big words in it.  Is three Syllables your limit? I can probably explain it with lego and fuzzy felt or something if you want.

About six years ago I was providing product support for a well-known manufacturer of Pro AV products. We had joined with our parent company for a big booth at the NAMM show. At the show, a bunch of famous rockers popped in and showed interest in our solid-state recording devices. It was a good show, we did well and went home. 

A few months later, the main phone rings and the receptionist calls to tell me ""Ted, it's Stevie Wonder for you on Line 4."" Yeah, right...so I pick up Line 4 - and it's Stevie Wonder!

Me: Pro AV Corp. This is Ted. Can I help you? 

SW: Hi, Ted. How you doin'?

Me: Pretty good...um...Mr. Wonder? 

SW: HA HA! Just call me Stevie, man. 

Me: OK, cool. What can I do for you, Stevie? 

SW: Well, I got your new recorder. I keep it by my bed. When I get ideas, I just sing 'em into that thing. I always get good ideas when I'm falling asleep. 

Me: Totally. Me too. 

SW: Yeah, man. Well, I got these for my friends, too. We love these recorders. But the thing is, you see, I need to set the record settings right. I got the transport, but I need to know if I've set everything to, like, a clean slate so I know where I am. 

It's at this point where I remembered that Stevie is blind. His recorder has a small screen and umpteen zillion possible adjustments and settings. 

Me: I got ya. So what we need to do is get you to factory reset, then get you to your preferred settings if something messes up your settings. 

SW: Right, man. So tell me now: get me to factory reset. 

I walked him through which buttons to press and how many clicks of the dial to get to the reset, etc. I'm all prepared to walk him through the process over and over until he gets it. There was no need. I explained it once, and he GOT IT. 

SW: OK, man. Top right, MENU. Click down twice, ENTER. Click down four times, ENTER and CONFIRM. 

Me: Um, yeah. You got it! So what Record setting do you want? 

SW: Just 192K MP3. Is that the default? 

Me: Nope. The default is 16/44 WAV. We need to set the Record setup for MP3. 

Once again, I tell him the buttons and clicks ONE TIME and Stevie has it wired in his mind. He repeats it back to me. 

SW: Got it, man. 

Me: Stevie, I gotta say you're pretty much the fastest learner I've talked to on the phone. You can call me any time, with any questions. 

SW: Ted man, you were great. Tell you what, if you're ever in LA, you look me up. Seriously. Here's my number xxx-xxx-xxxx. You call me, my people will figure it out, man. 

Me: It's been a pleasure, Stevie. If I'm in LA, I'll call you up. 

SW: Sure thing, man. You take care now...

And that was it. Stevie Wonder was whip-smart, totally casual and a pleasure to work with. And he actually gave me his number! I never did call him because I never went back to LA for anything. Would he have actually visited with me? I dunno. But just spending 20 minutes talking to a client who wasn't a belligerent, clueless jackass was wonderful.

Boss: ""Could you possibly have a look at my PC while I'm out - I've been having issues with the second screen being intermittent"".

Me: ""Sure I'll get right on it"".

I went in to look at the PC after he had left and found the cable/DVI adaptor at the back was loose. Plugged it in, tested it was working OK and left thinking I had fixed the problem.

My boss returned a few hours later.

Boss: ""Have you had a chance to look at my second monitor? It's not turning on at all now"".

Me: *thinking WTF*

Me: ""Yeh, I checked it before; the cable was loose. Let me take another look"".

I walked into his office to find the VGA/DVI adaptor had now come completely unplugged. I thought someone was playing a cruel practical joke on me, I plugged it in and let my boss know and chalked it down to me now securing it properly in the first place. 

To explain the next bit I will try to give you a good visualisation of the room. My boss's desk is like this http://i.imgur.com/YTPH3.jpg he has his PC in the corner completely exposed at the back. All was fine for a couple of hours. I was in his room having a quick 5 minute meeting with him. I was stood about five feet away from him facing his desk while he was sat down.

It was at this point I heard a scraping across the floor. I scanned downwards to see where the noise was coming from. Our office tortoise* was making his way across to my boss's PC. He arrived and started climbing up the back of my boss's PC, knocking the VGA/DVI converter out in the process. The little bugger was trying to nestle where the grill was emanating hot air.

I laughed so hard that I nearly ended up crying. Thwarted by a tortoise. When I finally calmed down enough from my hysterics with my boss sat there looking at me like I'd gone mad I told him to come to the other side of the desk as I'd found the cause of his monitor issues. I saw the look of realisation kick in because at this point the tortoise had managed to get himself tangled in the cables at the back of the PC.

Thwarted by shell issue. Removed unnecessary objects and issue was resolved.

I also performed user support for said webfarm as a side 'benefit'. 

One glorious afternoon I get a call for help on a data entry clerk. I go to her desk and find it empty. I ask around, and a nearby cow-orker informs me she spends most of her day working in the server room.

oh! that girl! I see her often, hard at work and bundled up. Wears sweaters, thick pants, stocking cap, scarf and fingerless gloves every day. (I am a cold-preferring creature and happily work in the server room in short sleeves. Shorts if business attire allows it)

So I go and ask what she needs. A simple Solaris x-config change is all. I chat while i work about the work, and ask what she does that requires her to be in the server room all day.

Chilly: ""Most of my data has to be entered directly in to the Sun server. Since they took away telnet access to the server room, I have to do it from in here.""

Me: ""Uhh... what? Why not just use SSH?""

Chilly: ""The Sun administrator told me that I can't get the GUI over SSH.""

Me: reeling in shock: ""You have been working in here for a year because the Sun guy is an idiot??""

I proceeded to configure her laptop to connect to an x-windows session over SSH, as well as her profile on the server so she could keep the changes local or remote. Walked her back to the desk, where she plugged in and opened a session. 

She was ecstatic, like she had just been awarded parole.

While the name gives away how this story goes, this little old lady deserves it, and so receives it. The Lady made of Win, or LmoW, as she'll be referred to henceforth, began to tell me her tale:

She had been using her Windows Vista computer (poor thing) online and had received a surprising message, purportedly from the FBI, warning her that she'd been discovered to be using illegal software and that she had 48 hours to pay $200 or charges would be pressed against her.

She found she was unable to get around or past the message, and so powers her computer off and picks up...

Second moment of win: ...her iPad (this is not the win) to research the issue (this is the win).

She quickly finds this is a scam, and even recognizes the preferred payment system of the scam as one her son had warned her was rather untraceable and so a favorite of scammers.

Third moment of win: She finds instructions how to remove the infection...

...which has found a way into her startup settings and so appears right when she loads into Windows. And she...

Fourth moment of win: ...fixes the issue herself!

While I'd been prepared to give her some basic info, just enough to scare her into paying me to fix her computer, I ended up congratulating her and telling her she'd done precisely the same thing.

I've become responsible for the machines set up in the office, and before you all go crazy, I know what I'm capable of, and what I'm not capable of, and I make sure only to take the tasks I know I won't fuck up. Anyway.

So, around an hour and a half ago I get called. We had to find some pictures taken in 2010. To be more specific, some pictures of reindeer one of our journalists took. All I got to go on was that they were brought into the office and placed somewhere in 2010. Nobody knew the names of the files, or where they were. Not even which machine or server they were located on. With 5 machines and 4 servers to look through, this was no easy task.

I began by mapping out where they couldn't be, ruling out the machines used for finances and paychecks, and the servers that hosted employee profiles and PDF files of older newspapers. Now I was down to 3 machines and 2 servers. Then I made a search on all the remaining devices for all files created in 2010. I narrowed it in a bit more, by guessing that since the pictures were of reindeer in the wild, they would have been taken in April or May. Alright, just 65 thousand files left.

By guessing that the files probably hadn't been color corrected or edited in any way I was able to narrow it down to only JPG and RAW files, so that left me with only 13 thousand files left. After assuming the files would either have been renamed to something reindeer related, or not have been renamed at all, I narrowed it down to filenames containing either ""Reindeer"" or ""IMG"". Only 1500 files to go. At that point I sort of ran out of clues, and had to result to looking through the images. 45 minutes later I found them, and not even the others in the office asking me how it could take so long could put a damper on my mood at this point. I felt like Sherlock Holmes.

The files were placed in the least likely place ever. The folder that held the old inDesign files for our crossword puzzles. Names ranging from IMG_1490 to IMG_1503

**TL;DR:** Reindeer Sherlock Holmes solves the mystery of horrible file names and archiving.

I couldn't have imaged it would get this kind of response. I guess we all have something to bond over when it comes to circumventing school network restrictions :) Some of you have some pretty impressive stories, and I'm glad I posted -  I've loved reading all the different workarounds everyone came up with. 

/u/Coolbrys recent story, [Mischievous Computing](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1dl4hd/mischievous_computing/), about his creative victory against students gaming on school computers brought back an old memory from my own days in school. Forewarning, though:  In this story I am the admin's adversary. 

Just prior to the turn of the century, I was in high school. My junior and senior years I took one computer class each year; one which turned out to be the same class I'd taken my freshman year but had its name changed, and one which turned out to be little more than a keyboarding class. This resulted in a lot of free time sitting at a computer. 

##Freedom, Trust, &amp;amp; Pickles##

My junior year, in the class that had its name changed, there were three other kids who had already had the class as well. The teacher put us together and pretty much told us we could do whatever we wanted, provided that we could pass the quizzes to show we'd retained the material. We could work on whatever side projects we came up with as long as it didn't disturb anyone. The teacher knew us and our ""elite skills"" well, so her trust was not *entirely* naive. 

Throughout the year we did various projects to keep ourselves busy and present to the class occasionally ""to prove we weren't wasting time."" It also served to make us into a sort of peer-role model, which made other students actually pay attention the the basics after seeing what kind of advanced stuff we churned out. The most popular project used VBA to script the Microsoft Agents with custom dialogue so that when we gave a presentation we could have a simulated conversation with Clippy, but our personal favorite was a very compact messenger/chat executable that would allow us to text to/from any computer on the network. 

However, even with the freedom to make our own projects, boredom inevitably set in. As we began to waste increasing amounts of time playing Unreal Tournament (which we had installed on several computers), we were also getting frequently called to various other classrooms and computer labs throughout the high school to act as tech support. Our teacher was a little passive aggressive, so rather than tell us to stop wasting time gaming, any time she saw us playing she'd send us to help a teacher somewhere with a basic computer problem - word of our abilities spread quickly among the faculty. 

We addressed all the typical problems: Monitor power ≠ computer power, logins don't work with caps lock on, system volume doesn't matter if the speakers are turned off, etc. Despite the trivial nature of most of our highly-praised ""repairs,"" on many occasions we had teachers volunteer their passwords. As if this weren't enough of a security breach, apparently each lab teacher had the admin password. It seems that the original network admin had done a web search for ""most common school network passwords,"" found a top ten list, and *picked the number one most common password* at the time: ""**pickle**.""

##Absolute Power Corrupts... Sometimes##

We deliberated for many days on whether this was useful to us, and for what purposes it could be employed. As we weighed our options, we reconnoitered the network thoroughly. We had access to just about everything. We could remotely login to *any computer on the network*. We could use that remote connection to subsequently connect to *other computers*. We could access the main office's *attendance records*. We could even access the **grade books** and even the *backups* of the grade books. We also determined that by remotely connecting prior to accessing any documents, we could make any changes we wanted, and could cause the ""last saved by"" field to reflect *the name of* **any** *teacher with an account on the network*.

What did we do with all this power? Well, since none of us were at all nefarious (and because we knew we'd be the primary suspects if anything went awry), we actually opted to do *absolutely nothing* with this knowledge. Aside from continuing to play Unreal Tournament in our down time, the rest of that year was entirely, believe it or not, shenanigan-free. 

The following year, however, was a little more interesting. 

##A New Year##

Over the summer a new IT company had been hired, but aside from new registers in the cafeteria and a new naming convention for all accounts and terminals, not much had changed. It amused me when I confirmed that I could still access everything. 

Although most computer labs had been completely re-imaged, I was able to find a backup I'd stored in a subdirectory on the assistant principle's computer (1st world anarchy, *amiright*?), and I quickly distributed the game across the entire network. All in all, there were about 5 or 6 labs, with 20-30 computers each, so we had some pretty epic games going towards the end of each period as everyone finished their work, with as many as 90 players in a single free for all deathwatch. Those were glorious days. 

The teachers actually didn't seem to mind. They saw it as incentive for us to finish our lab assignments quickly. After a few weeks, though, our copies of the game began disappearing from the lab computers. No notices from an admin; no new anti-gaming policies from the school - the files just started disappearing. Teachers even started asking why we weren't playing anymore. 

##The Copy/Delete Battle##

At first, it was about once a week they'd disappear, and it took them a while to track down all the different computers that had the game. No big deal. Re-copy on Monday and play all week. 

Then, the cleanup started taking place daily. So, I'd just begin the copying process at the beginning of the period so by the time we finished our work it would be ready to go. When doing this, I would use a different account to do the copying, which I think kept them from figuring out who the culprit was. 

Since this was time consuming, I eventually made a .bat file that I would run from a different computer each day, using a list of all the computers in each lab (which was only possible thanks to their new standardized naming convention- something like \[schoolname].rm\[room#].computer\[#]of\[#]). 

This worked well for a while, until one day they removed the original game folder.

Crap. 

It was a long, disgruntled couple weeks before I figured out what do to next. In the meantime, I managed to find a computer that was connected to the network, but for some reason was overlooked during each wipe, and I hid a new copy of the game there for later. I don't know if the computer was even on site- the room number didn't exist anywhere at the school. Odd, but irrelevant. 

*Edit: In retrospect, there's a possibility that this nonexistent room number may have been the admin's off-site computer. lol*

##Work Smarter, Not Harder##

Remember the off-hand comment I made about new cafeteria registers I mentioned? Those could only be connected to from a couple specific computers. It took me about a week of poking around the network every day before I found them, and about another week before I realized I could use them. 

I have no idea why they were on the same network, but the were. I also have no idea why the register's daily transaction upload .bat files could be accessed so easily, but they were.

After some manual trial and error, I copied the game folder and .bat file to all the registers' completely unused (and apparently completely un-monitored) backup drives. Then, after backing up the originals, I added a new last line to each register's daily .bat file, which called and ran my own .bat file, so the game would propagate across the network every night at midnight - every time the registers updated their transaction logs. The best past is that every day it would randomly choose a different teacher's account to be the one doing all the copying. 

##Expect The Worst##

Given that I expected to be caught, I actually fully documented the file, commenting each line very thoroughly. In the event it was found, I wanted it to be immediately clear I hadn't done anything as harmful as what the network setup would have allowed me to do. The closing bit read something like:

&gt;None of this would have been possible if the admin password wasn't freely given to students. Or if the password changed from year to year. Or if multiple remote access didn't mask the executing terminal. Or if the registers were not on the same network. (Seriously. Had I been malicious and not so bent on gaming, I could have changed the cafeteria price list and/or deleted all transaction data). 

##The Prestige##

Every day, every single lab computer on the network received a fresh copy of Unreal Tournament and most students had no idea that it was disappearing and reappearing every day. They only thought that whoever had been deleting the files had given up. 

We continued our daily gaming sessions and even though my classmates had started to suspect I'd had something to do with it, most kept quiet. The only ones who had the gall to ask me about it were the, well, the most gang-like guys in my class. One in particular had often asked me for help in the lab (he probably hadn't ever used computers before, honestly). He was actually pretty sharp, but kept up his ignorant thug persona when his friends were around. When he realized I'd been the one to ensure we could keep playing Unreal every day, he gave me props and said something about street cred. Not even kidding. I think that once he realized even a straight laced nerd like me could rebel against the system in my own way, he was more comfortable with admitting to being interested in learning. And you know what the best part was?

From that point on he always had my back in-game. 

As of my graduation the little setup was still working perfectly, and it probably continued to work until whenever they changed the name of their computers or changed the password. For some reason I doubt either happened very quickly.

Back in those days, most of our duties involved moving around all in one units (Laptop, Projector, Speakers on a cart) from class to class that requested them. Some units were better than others so there would be some fighting amongst professors about what units they wanted, but that's neither here nor there.

We would have our usual troubleshooting calls now and then, and I would gladly run to the class as fast as I could and fix any issue (Which would usually just be getting the projector to show what was on the laptop). Most teachers were grateful but there were a handful who would get rather indignant, and so we come to the main story.

Usual day, ahead on my deliveries I get a call from a classroom and the Professor is raging pretty hard. 

Me: ""AV, how can I help you?""

Prof: ""YOUR CART IS BROKEN, GET ME A NEW ONE!""

Me: ""Sorry to hear that, may I ask whats broken on it?""

Prof: ""EVERYTHING, THE PROJECTOR WONT WORK, THE LAPTOP JUST SHUT OFF, I CAN'T BELIEVE FOR AS MUCH AS THESE STUDENTS PAY FOR CLASSES THAT YOU WOULD HAVE SUCH INFERIOR EQUIPMENT FOR US TO USE.""

Me: ""Okay, sorry again, but give me one moment and I will come look for what's wrong."" 

Prof: ""NO, YOU WILL REPLACE IT NOW OR I WILL CALL YOUR SUPERVISOR AND COMPLAIN"" -click-

I've heard all these threats before so it's nothing new. I make my way up to the classroom and peek my head in. Upon seeing me with no replacement cart she begins to sneer at me as I look over the cart to see if there is anything broken. I see nothing so my eyes begin to wander to the usual spots. Lo and behold I found the problem. 

All of the carts have a power strip that everything is plugged into and from that is a single plug that powers everything. The master plug just so happened to be on the floor, not connected to a thing. Upon making my discovery, I pick up the plug, hold it up for all to see as I take a small trip to the wall and plug it in. This leads to a small bit of laughter and a red faced professor. She muttered out a small ""Thank you"" and I just smiled and walked out.

 For the rest of my time there, anytime she had a problem she would remain calm and I would walk her through any issue.

The early days of HP wireless printer issues still give me the shivers. Long story short after some work I get it going and everything is working great. When I pack up and settle the bill she shows me an external Hard Drive that she sued to backup stuff. Turns out it dropped of her desk and hasn’t worked since. I take a quick look hook it up and sure enough the drive doesn’t show.  I am upfront tell her that this is most likely a lost cause. I inform her about the cost of professional recovery and that she must REALLY want the data for that price. Data doesn’t seem that important to her but she keeps asking if there isn’t anything cheap we could do. 


Sooooo mind you this job has been over and this has been one of those “one questions real quick before you leave”. I tell her I can take it with me crack it open and see if I can read the drive on the computer I used to do data recover on. I tell her that this is a HUGE long shot and the external drive cage will be destroyed and if I do it we have to agree that I can recycle it if nothing comes of it since I didn’t want to drive that way just to bring back a bad drive on a job I don’t get paid for. She agrees I got paid and all is well.


Nothing comes of my effort to make the drive work again just I suspected and I call her to let her know. All is well…
Fast forward two month and a semi annoyed call. The printer disconnected and she can’t connect. Her husband never could and she is not happy with me. Oh and bring the drive back I took from her house… say what?! I tell her what we agreed on and that I don’t have that drive anymore… the call ends with me telling her that we can talk as adults and she can call me back when she wants to change her tone in a manner appropriate of adults talking with each other.
Fast forward about two weeks and a very angry letter, various treats and another big point about her drive and if she won’t get it back she will file charges for theft. I ignore that letter and figure if she needed to vent that is OK and I can recycle her paper too.


After about a month I answer my business phone and find myself talking with a detective from the local police department. He informs me that the lady is in his office and before he files the paperwork if we could not come to some agreement. I calmly explain the situation to him, tell him there is no more drive (never mind that I signed nothing saying I took anything) and I simply did as I was asked to do and we have a very unhappy and unreasonable customer. He chuckles a little apparently suffered under her attitude and said… “I understand, Thanks”. And that was the last I heard of it. 


Funny, looking back on it I got in trouble most when I tried to go the extra mile with customers.

Did not expect this big of a response! I guess I shall have to tell the story of the baby, the angry woman and a CD burner. Same Bat time! Same Bat channel!** 

Join me now for a sordid tale of a computer repair shop deep within the heart of low-income (A kind way to say it) area within a large city. That six months spent there was fraught with peril, racism and, yes, repairing nothing but shitty Toshiba Satellite laptops and Gateway towers. This is but one of the awful memories I have of that den of horror.

Ours was a cozy little shack nestled deep within the heart of the downtown area. It was sandwiched between a head shop and what doubled as a gaming center (the sort old women with oxygen tanks and cartons of Virginia Slims to waste their Social Security checks) and occasional drug den. It was one of those dilapidated places that never had the latest hardware, only sold at MSRP or above and made me feel like I was doing a disservice to people times. Well, until they did shit like barge in toss a computer tower at my head and try to fight me and my boss!

This customer saunters in with a Gateway tower in tow. When I say ""tow"" I mean that he actually brought it in via a rusted red wagon. He felt the need to include his mouse, keyboard and a CD Stomper. (WTF?) So I, being the dutiful employee that I was, ask him what the situation is. He, instead of being a rational human being who can formulate complete sentences, yells back at me: COMPUTA' DON'T WORK.

I decided not to bother with trying to probe further, at this point, and directed him to hand over the tower and I'd take a look. He was *INSULTED* that I asked him to do that and, continuing to yell at me, said for me to ""YOU GET IT, NERD."" I wasn't really opposed to that so I hopped down from my chair, scurried around the desk and bent down to pluck his computer from the warm bosom of it's Red Flyer wagon. There was this very strange moment of tension that flared up between the customer and myself. All of it came from his end. I had, apparently, gotten a bit too close to him for comfort.

I had the tower clutched within my mitts as I moved back only to find that his rather LARGE calloused hands were not pulling the tower away from my grasp. I could not help the rather confused look that was plastered on my face at the moment, but he informed me soon enough.

""CAREFUL HOW YOU GRAB MY SHIT, DUDE. 'SIDES YOU GETTIN' ALL IN MY SPACE.""

I had not tried to do that, but I let him have the tower. I moved back behind the counter just to put some space between myself and this, clearly, angry person. ""That's fine then.."" I said as got back to my post, extending a set of friendly hands towards him. ""I'll just let you give it to me.. and I'll take a look at it.""
(This was not the first time I had dealt with this sort of customer before. Many who came in were either flat-out angry, either at their lot in life or that they had to deal with some white kid who was CLEARLY out of place in this store, and acted in such a manner.)

So, he does the only thing one naturally does in this situation. HE THROWS THE FUCKING GATEWAY TOWER AT ME. Not just in my general direction but at my head. This action was accompanied by a, ""HERE YA GO."" I managed to somehow not drop the piece of shit tower in the process despite my being nearly stunned senseless.

I placed the tower down on the counter and spoke in the most calm yet assertive tone I could. ""Sir, I cannot help you with your problem if you persist in treating me this way."" He replied with a scoff, ""FUCK JUST DO YOUR JOB, FATBOY.""

There have only been three instances in my entire life where rage just consumed me. This was one of those three. I did not attempt to sound calm. ""GET THE FUCK OUT.""

He, shocked at my retort, offered a rebuttal. ""NAH! I WANT MY COMPUTA' FIXED NOW."" I had been alone in the shop, by the way, and it was just about this time that the owner walked through the front door. He had been gone running some errands for the past hour. He saw that a situation was developing. ""There a problem?"" he asked, making sure, unlike myself, to be calm and collected.

The customer turned and remarked, ""Yeah! Your boy here don't wanna fix my computer."" (First time he hadn't yelled) My boss seems rather surprised, ""Sure about that? Granak is our best tech. He wouldn't do that.""
The fellow, being called a liar by my boss (or so he thought), immediately turns and throws a REALLY terrible punch at my employer. A scuffle ensues and the only casualty is the customer's CD Stomper.

Police are called, names are taken. They arrest the guy for assault and my boss only has some minor bruising. That was the last week I worked there. It was the third fight that had broken out in this computer store.

Once I had a call from an angry lady stating that she was unable to log in her company provided laptop. The first thing I asked was the error message that she gets. Incorrect password. Next question is where she is at? She is at home. Then I asked her if she recently changed her password. She did not.

So, she is not connected to the company's network, and her password should be the same than the last time she was using her computer... I checked on Active Directory and confirmed that. What is happening?
She was angry because she had a lot of work to do and she had already spent quite a while trying to log before she called. I took a deep breath and asked her: ""Please, I know this is basic, but, could you verify that Caps Lock is not active?""

She started ranting about not being her fault. She told me that the day before, she saw one of her colleagues ""messing around with her computer"" and caught her while passing by the office where they both worked. She told me that she didn't have time to ask her what her colleague did, but she was sure that was related to this problem.
I asked her what made her think that it had something to do with this whole matter. She said that her colleague ""left her information on the computer"".

I thought that, probably, her colleague logged in with her account on the caller's laptop and the caller did not modify the user name on the logon screen. I told her that. She told me that her username was fine, but her colleague's ""information"" was still there. I asked her to read that ""information"" for me. She read what it looked like a computer's name, which also appears at the top of the logon window (Brief background: This company uses a computer name convention that includes the name and last name of the computer owner).

Then I figured what the problem was.

I told her: ""Well, there are two possible situations here. Either your colleague logged into your computer and changed your computer's name and changed your Windows password (yeah, right), OR you have your colleague's computer.""

One of these calls was from an elderly woman who presented herself as the head nurse of a retirement home that was in dire need of assistance with their... cheese wheel.

**Me**, unmuting the line: ""Is this supposed to be a joke? We don't ""install"" cheese wheels.""

**Woman**: ""MANAGER.""

**Me**, muting the line, to manager: ""&lt;location&gt; has trouble with their cheese wheel and wants to speak with you.""

**Manager** stares blankly at me and checks the date, we're in the middle of January. ""Cheese?""

**Me**: ""Yes... cheese.""

**Manager**, picking up the call and putting it on speaker: ""This is ilifins manager, &lt;name&gt;. What seems to be the problem?""

**Woman**: ""Our bloody cheese wheel isn't fucking working anymore and your shitty phone man is not listening to me!""

**Manager**: ""I can assure you that we do not install cheese wheels as there would be quite the smell from rotting cheese after a while. Can you describe the object to me?""

**Woman**: ""It's giant, it's yellow, it's full of holes and it stopped blinking this morning! No blinking is a bad sign, said &lt;funniest installation tech we've ever had&gt; when he plugged it in for us.""

**Manager**, choking a laugh: ""Did he call it the cheese wheel?""

**Manager**: ""I understand the problem at hand and will take the necessary steps to rectify your situation. A man will be at your location within the hour.""

**Woman**: ""THANK YOU."" &lt;click&gt;

This did not stop Sandra (fake name). Oh no. They didn't account for her. I am just glad I didn't lose any progress.

You see, I missed a meeting this morning. An issue in prod came up and I had to work on it. ""It's okay,"" Sandra said, ""I'll let you know what happened afterwards.""

So I finish my work a while later and publish it. I have been drinking coffee all morning and have earned myself a nice bathroom break. I lock my workstation and shuffle on over. 

I finish my business and return. What? Why do I see my workstation unlocked? Furthermore, why is everything that was opened now closed, and what is this document on the screen?

It was a rough summary of what happened in the meeting I missed. Sandra didn't email it to me, oh no. Sandra didn't leave a note on my desk or use the legal pad left there, oh no.

Working at the same call center as the earlier story **[(REFERENCE)](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/149flb/the_day_i_saved_a_little_girl_across_the_country/)**

This is about 2-3 months before this call, my first most memorable call, although the toughest call I've ever had, and ever will (since I don't do tech support anymore..)

More background on the situation.

I was a part time Tier 2 support at the time, but taking Tier 1 calls, except I had all the tools, and info from Tier 2 still at my disposal, so I had a bit more power than your average Joe.

So I just sit down, coming back from a break, and get my first phone call.

The caller is I would assume early to mid 20's woman. She called up because her internet is down, and has been for 3 days. She was already a bit shaken up while speaking to me, but I get that pretty often, it's frustrating having to call and hope your issue will be fixed, we go over a few of the basic steps, everything seems to be in order, but her DSL light just won't stay on, it'll go on for a few seconds then drop. At this point I was doing a few tests, but tell her the bad news, we probably will be needing to send a tech over to the CO, as there seems to be issues on the line itself. (for what it matters, she was 1.05 Miles into the loop, and her max frequency on her modem said she could  only attain ~3mbit, but she should be getting ~10Mbit, big difference) But as soon as I say technician she lost it, crying, screaming, I'm at a loss of words, really, it's just 36 hours away, and it's just your internet. But that wasn't the issue...

I ask her what's wrong? The internet will be up shortly, and I mentioned that the last 5 calls she had she declined a technician, and she starts crying again, 10 minutes go by, and I'm still sitting there, trying to figure out what I do, do I hang up? Do I stay here? There's obviously something going on, so I stuck around, while my supervisor is tapping his wrist watch as I'm over my AHT of 8 minutes.

I ask her, why she doesn't want a technician going over, and then she tells me. 

8 months ago, she had a technician (FROM THE SAME COMPANY) went over, and forced himself on her, raped her..

Now, a bit of back story on me. In my late teens, early 20's I loved to stick it in anything, and lots of unstable / ""crazy"" people. And ended up going out with a girl for over a year that was very unstable, she was violently bipolar, turns out she was raped a few years before that, and was also suicidal. I learned a lot about saying the absolute minimum during an episode as that can be a catalyst, just sit back, and let her vent, and try and comfort.


So here I am, on the phone with a rape victim, who called the same company who sent over a guy who raped her.

At this point I tell her I need to run a few quick tests, I put her on mute (hold music is the devil!) and put my headset down, go talk to the floor supervisor. Tell him a bit what's going on, and he tells me ""Just take her info, but fix her problem and hang up, I'll take care of it"". Clearly, he didn't give two shits, just wanted his metrics looking good at the end of the day. This guy was a tool, and in no way he was going to do fuck all with that info.

I do the only thing I know how to do, I asked her, what happened, was it reported, you sure it was a XXXX ISP technician? (I was writing down the info make sure I can report this...).

She didn't have any names, but I was able to pull out the technicians record, 8 months previous she had two techs go over, in consecutive days, the same guy.

Never a call since, we assumed problem solved, WRONG.

This is where I knew i fucked up royally, I brought it all back to her, she starts freaking out, telling me how the only thing that stops her from killing herself is going online and finding somebody to talk to and comfort her online, playing games and all that. And now, her internet is down, and she needs another rapist to go over and fix her internet.

She starts telling me how she's been cutting herself all night, making the pain go away, needing the internet. I was shivering, I've been through this before, and it felt like I was talking to my ex. It was too real.

She tells me how nobody would care, nobody would notice, she would just die alone in her apartment, laying there rotting.

I asked her, you must have family, mother, father, siblings? She has a mother and sister, her dad left as a kid.

I asked her, what about your Mom, your sister, don't you think they would miss you? You're her Daughter! You're her pride and joy, and your sister, don't you want your little sister growing up with you? (now I only went there because of the tone of how she mentioned her mom and sister, in a good light, compared to the rest of the call, so I took a risk.

She just talked for a good hour or so about her Mom and Sister, about the good times, how she misses her, and should go visit her, she's still in the same town.

As this was going on, I was on chat support with the dispatch center (have tier 2 account permissions), trying to figure out what was going on with her account, and if there is something we can do RIGHT NOW. Lucky for her, there was a tech a few miles away, and dispatch (having a bit of info on the situation) sent the tech to her CO, and replaced her line card (it was defective). All at the same time she was still talking about her family, clearly she was cheering up.

At this point, I was near the 3 hour mark on my call, Supervisor was still giving me the stink eye, other agents on the floor were all starting to wonder what the heck I was doing.

Still probing her modem, I see her modem again! The CO work is done! DSL light is back, modem registers full 10 Mbit, and max speed of 21 Mbit. PERFECT!

At this time I ask her to take a look at her modem, she just stopped talking, gasps, and screams: My internet is fixed, my internet is fixed!

After a few more minutes, she asks me, if there still needs to be a tech going to her house, and I tell  her no, but she should report the issue, but she didn't want to and was scared. Not wanting to trigger a meltdown, didn't push anything.

She thanked me profusely, wants to know where i live, wants me to meet her, meet her sister, all that. I kindly explain, I'm just your internet tech support agent, I can't meet her and her family, but she should go visit them, and tell them about it. I tell her, I just want you to think of me of the tech support agent who fixed my internet.

I finish the call, a bit over 3 hours.


Now, after story.

Since I had access to previous tech tickets, I was able to know what technician who went over, and found out he was no longer with the company since 6 months (2 months after the incident).

A little bit more probing with a friend in the tech depo, turns out he was reported for trying to force himself on a client, and was arrested, jailed, and obviously fired. Karma.


Now comes my supervisor, with a ""Form of Action"" or a ""Written Warning"" form, for taking too long on a call, and giving ""unsupported"" help. 

I asked him what it's for, and he tells me stupid stuff, not supported, took too long, blah blah. He knew damn well about the situation, but didn't give a shit, it makes him look bad. I sign it, and tell him he's a piece of shit. I was anxious, nervous, and just about to throw up.

2-3 months after this call I was full time tier 2 support, my old supervisor was still there but dealt with T1. I eventually go the bleach call at T2 support.

Story here for those who missed it.
http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/149flb/the_day_i_saved_a_little_girl_across_the_country/


It's now been 8 years since I worked there, 7 since I did call center work. 5 years ago I seen my old supervisor in line at the office I work at, waiting for a job interview, he never got the job (I didn't say anything). I don't know what he's doing.


TL;DR
Got a call from woman who got raped by the ISP Technician, started talking about killing herself. I myself having a suicidal / bipolar ex, did the only thing I knew how, listened, comfort her. Solve her issue via chat while we were still on the line. Was never reported but tech was later arrested for same thing with different person.


PS: I don't remember the exact details in what she was saying, the call was extremely long, and covered a life story. Not to be insensitive, but I was only paying enough attention to keep her busy, while I solved her issue.

There is no way I could of fixed her problem if it weren't for having direct access to the chat system the technicians use.

We've been doing it for years, and always know that it's all in good fun.  

She calls me today with a very simple issue.  If a manager from another site tries to log in *and* types the wrong password, the program may freeze.  The solution is to simply end the program via task manager, restart the program, and log in again.  Without realizing what she did, she picked the wrong manager's name from the drop-down menu and entered her password.  The program froze, and she called me.  I asked her if she had done what she was supposed to do, and she insisted that she did.  I knew that she hadn't, and she was in her ""Oh just get down here and fix it, asshole!"" mode.  It has begun.

So I go down there and sure enough, she hadn't terminated the program via task manager.  She asked what the problem was, so I told her it was an ""ID - Ten  - T"" issue.  She asked what that was.  I told her it would be too technical to explain, but I told her to write down how to fix it.  

So she gets a piece of paper and starts writing......""How to fix ID10T....""

She then drops the notebook, chasing me down the hall and beating me with anything that wasn't nailed to something else.  The other emploees pick up the notebook and the everybody starts laughing as I eventually run out of the building, being chased by a mad woman beating me with an oven mitt screaming ""I'll give you ID10T you son of a bitch!!!'

A colleague had replaced a managers old, decrepit Windows XP machine with a shiny, brand-new (at the time) Windows 7 machine, as she was constantly moaning about her old machine being slow.

He copied everything over, down to the Desktop, to reduce the traumatic change she would have to endure. This lead to the following conversation.

Her : ""My Microsoft Word is broken!""

Me : ""Can you be a touch more specific please?""

Her : ""It won't open!""

Me : ""Ok, and does it do anything while it's not opening?""

Her : ""I don't understand what you mean?""

Me : ""Is it giving you an error message, possibly about file conversion?""

Her : ""No, I'm not getting anything.""

Me : ""Are you just opening up Word, or are you opening a specific document?""

Her : ""Huh?""

Me : ""Fuck me. I'll be right up...""

I walk up to her in the office, promptly move her out of the way, double click on the first Word document I find, and it opens straight away.

Her : ""Wow, how did you do that?""

Me : ""I clicked on it....""

Her : ""Oh, I couldn't even find it!""

Me : ""Ok then...""

I return to my office, to then get a phone call.

Her : ""I still cant find it. I want to open up a blank document, not an existing one""

I resist the urge to scream about the new document button.

Me : ""Click the Windows logo in the bottom corner. See Microsoft Word?""

Her : ""Yeah""

Me : ""Click that.""

Her : ""Oh wow thanks! This is why you get paid the big bucks!""

I was the only one in one day as the other guy was off on holiday, it was going pretty well, nothing big breaking, keeping on top of workflow, all good.

Later in the day one of the teachers popped down so I could give her some new software she wanted on her laptop.

I put the software on, showed her how to reach the google earth plug-in, etc and while I installed it she explained about ideas she had been told about when in came to incorporating IT into her lesson.

One thing she mentioned was qrcode implementation in field trips, she asked how it would work, I explained how qrcodes worked and how to get them, demonstrating that I had downloaded a qrcode scanner onto my blackberry. She also had a blackberry but hadn't a clue, so I showed her the app store on blackberry phones, which in turn she showed on her blackberry (a older model) that she didn't have the app store. I explained how she would get the apps onto the phone from her pc, which she was grateful for. 

She then continued to talk about her past with phones and problems she's had, explaining that she had her phone reset (back to factory settings) and that she had lost tons of photos and videos, and here's the tough part, it was her god-daughters wedding, who was married to a guy who had just came back from his 2nd tour of Afgahnistan and they had just had a baby. I was worried she was building up to ""and he's been killed now"" but thankfully I was spare the awkward social moment, as that wasn't the case. 

She lost 50 odd pictures and 10ish videos, you could see she was quite upset about the whole thing.

Apparently she went to her mobile service provider's phone shop and asked if there was a way to recover the photos, they told her they couldn't but apparently a lad there said he did ""computers"" at university, a phrase that still doesn't quite sound right to me still, and that he'll have a look at fixing it, but eventually returned and said there was nothing he could do. He had spent every possible way he had thought of fixing it.

I was sympathetic and asked if she had a memory card in the phone, so for future reference it could save photos onto that to help incase of these such situations, she responded with no she didn't. She opened her phone to prove it, in which I spotted a card in an unusual (for blackberrys) spot. 

I took it out and asked if it was cool to look on it, she agreed and lo and behold every damn photo and video was there, she started welling up and had tears in her eyes, I backed them up on a USB stick for her to take and transfer onto her computer. 

Not your usual rage inducing story of tech support, but I honestly felt like a damn superhero after it, sometimes tech support is a damn good job to have.

TL:DR A guy who ""did computers"" at university couldn't work out how to take a memory card out of a phone.

So when anybody ask I just gave a non-committal response about computers or systems and try to defuse the situation.

Anyway now the story, today I was running a bit late for work, so I took a taxi (normally I take the bus), everything was fine. I made some polite conversation with the taxi driver, and then he asked:

&gt; **TaxiDriver:** So what work you do?  
&gt; **Me:** mmm... systems... hey maybe we could take a left there(points)  
&gt; **TaxiDriver:** Oh! really? then you can help me, my computer... laptop is not working

At that point we stopped at a red light and I was not liking the look on the taxi driver face...

&gt; **Me:** (incredibly uncomfortable) It could be any number of things I wouldn't know... Why don't we try a right in &lt;street name&gt;? 

The TaxiDriver reaches behind his seat taking out a laptop. Pretty generic  I couldn't recognize the model. 

&gt; **TaxiDriver:** But here's my laptop, so fix it maybe.

I took the computer and notice the TaxiDriver looking at me in the mirror. I open the laptop and press the power button. The thing comes to life with the windows 7 logo. Luckily before the computer finished booting up we got to my office, I paid the guy and leave the computer on the seat beside me.

WTFD: How do I point the website to the domain?

Nar: No, no, it's backwards, you need to point the domain to the website. I see that you're running &lt;Script&gt;, so you'll need to point it to the specific nameservers they gave you.

WTFD: Well, how do I do that?

Nar: Domains don't work that way, you can't just declare suddenly that a name is yours, ESPECIALLY if it's someone else's.

Nar: Ok, then if you simply can't go with any other name, your only options are to buy it from him, or wait and see if he lets it expire. He's bought up the .net, .org, and .info unfortunately, so you can't get any variations. And since he's held this since 1998....chances are he won't let it expire.

Allow me to explain. Back when I studied at the university, I worked extra at an internet support company. The job was mot fantastic, but I got some experience and extra money for beer. We did internet support on dialup and DSL for a phone operator and ISP, support for a few muncipality/city nets and served as the first point of contact for a company that used to own us (we branched out to do more than just support us, they sold us to focus on their core business, but we still did first point of contact for them).

The company delivered high-speed internet connections for companies, muncipalities and homeowners' and tenants' unions - there were no direct private customers, they only delivered to organisations, companies and associations. A large part of of their network was radio LAN. This was around 2000, before a lot of fiber had been laid down to build an extensive fiber net over the country - connecting customers to radio LAN to the few large-capacity fiber lines in existance was a good business back then.

Around 2002, we get informed that this company, due to the IT crash close to bankrupcy, are being bought out by a LARGE power company that wishes to acquire the fiber net they have laid out and branch out in their own ISP business. Everyone is happy - we because we can have continued business, they because they won't have to go bankrupt and the large power company because they get a good net and customer base really cheap.

So, the company starts to do a lot of clean-up in their system before the merger. They build a lot of their net and customer base in during the happy times of the IT bubble 1998-2001, and it was known that technicians had arranged connections for friends and relatives and made many undocumented solutions. So we were warned that they were closing a lot of connections that had no contract to it and were not paid for, and were asked to document everything in case it looked like someone had been disconnected by mistake, send a case to the technicians and let them handle it from there.

So, one day I get a call on that line.

ME: ""[company] support.""

HIM: ""Hi. I have an internet connection from you guys, and it has stopped working.""

ME: ""Ok, what is the name of the company?""

HIM: ""No, it is not a company.""

ME: ""Oh, is it a tenants' or homeowners' union?""

HIM: ""Nope, just me.""

ME: ""There must be some kind of misunderstanding. We don't sell individual connections.""

HIM: ""You did to me.""

ME: ""The info I have is that we never did.""

HIM: ""Look, I live in an old water tower. It is the highest building in the city. You guys came here 1998, and told me if you could put up an antenna on my roof, I got free internet from you. It has worked fine for 4 years, now it doesn't.""

ME: ""Ok, I'll put a case to the technicians and have them look into it. I'll get back to you.""

HIM: ""Fine. Thanks.""

So, I make a case and send it to the technicians, who, perhaps understantably, close the case, saying he is not a customer, they do not provide individual connections, and he is not getting his internet back.

So, I call him back to tell him this.

ME: ""Hello again, it is [vonadler] from [company], I promised to call back.""

HIM: ""Oh yeah, what did they say?""

ME: ""Unfortunately, they claim you are not a customer and you do not have any contract from us. They have closed the case.""

HIM: ""What? Get back to them and tell them that if they don't restore my connection, I am going up there and I'll take the antenna down!""

ME: ""I don't think that will help, but I will do so.""

HIM: ""Thanks.""

So I re-open the case, submit the new information and get it back almost immediately, closed, with a belitteling comment about not believing people that are not customers and not re-opening such cases again. At that time I was busy, so I did not have time to call the customer back with this and by lunchtime, I had almost forgotten it all.

Until the manager comes running. 

MAN: ""Get back on the phones! The [company] line is going mad!""

ME: ""What? What happened?""

MAN: ""They lost [large geographical region with about 20% of the customers]. It is completely black!""

ME: ""I think I know why.""

Yes, it turned out in the end, that the technicians had made the guy a deal in 1998, but never put it to paper. They had given him a 100/100Mbit connection with 1:1 contention which he used for e-mail and checking some forums and read newsapers online.

They made him a special deal and connected him to a 10/10Mbit 1:32 (I think it was) line, and he connected the antenna again.

Oh, sometimes I wish I had his power when the internet is down.

The process was streamlined, and all we needed to do was watch for certain errors. 99.999% of the time, imaging would fail due to hard drive space, and this was either because the user genuinely had that much data, or because they had put personal things on the machine.

S.O.P. was to delete anything remotely personal. Music? Check. Downloaded (likely illegally) movies? That's a check. Pictures that aren't related to work files? Definitely a check.

**Story**: Enter Flood. Why did we call the user Flood? Well, Flood liked to ask a question during his stage of the process at a speed roughly equal to the speed of sound. The *least* amount of questions that I was sent via Instant Message per minute was six.

Yes. A question roughly every ten seconds. Thankfully, as has been seen by previous stories, I have no problem flipping into BOFH Mode. In this case, my response every time was to RTFE, aka, to refer to the email that was sent to him. This email outlined a series of steps that needed to be perform before migration. Oh, don't get me wrong, we still migrated the machine. The steps the user took would include backing up their work files and clearing space for us.

Flood didn't seem to read the email... or it's sister mailing... or the one after that. We sent these emails out in bursts. Two weeks before. One week before. Three days. Day before. Day of. So, Flood's turn at migration comes up. I'm there and I'm looking at why his machine immediately failed, and I see that Flood has only 20gb free. 

On a 500gb hard drive.

I'm not about to skip him and make him try again, so I go looking on his hard drive. To start, I delete the ~50gb of folders on the root that have nothing to do with Windows. Mainly repositories of data that should have been backed up or are part of a program that won't survive migration. I then move to his user profile.

I find a nested tree of My Documents folders. No worries there. What's in them is mostly work related, but each one keeps coming up at just north of 300gb. I'm floored. I keep making my way down, and *seven steps later* I'm left with the culprit of folders. Now, Flood thought he was clever, in that he named the folders to be vaguely work sounding.

Sadly, his copies of nearly every movie to be released on DVD in the past few years still retained their names. As did the music files, neatly sorted into folders. As, also, did the photos. 50gb of pictures, and I wish I was making that up. Well, the past has taught me to take extensive documentation, so I snap pictures of all of this, then frag it. I then rearrange the My Docs folders, eliminating redundancies, and shazam. We have the space to migrate! I kick it off, and go attend to the rest of my section.

Cut to the next morning, and the flood begins. 

""im missing files plz visit""

""folders missing plz""

""plz fix my pc""

...and so on, and so on. I finally get down to Flood's desk, and the beratement begins. Why did we alter the contents of ""his"" computer. This is ""his"" computer to do with as he wishes and we are not to touch it. I'm pretty impassive until this line erupts from his mouth:

**Flood**: Fix it. Get my files back, systems monkey, before I call your boss.

Oh. Really? *This hand of mine is burning red...*

**88**: By files, do you mean the copious amounts of pirated movies that we located in your Documents folders? Or do you mean the music that may or may not also be illegal?

**Flood**: How dare you! I will not be accused-

*...it's loud roar tells me to defeat you...*

**88**: Your computer did not have enough free space, so we searched your profile for items that should not be on the computer.

**Flood**: This is bullshit! This is my computer, you don't have any right to touch it!

**BAKUNETSU GOD FINGER~**

**88**: This computer belongs to XYZ Company, *not* you. It is loaned to you for the purposes of doing your job. Your job is *not* to watch movies. Your job is *not* to put your entire music collection on it. Your job is *not* to include every single picture you or your family has ever taken. The communication that went out stated that all personal files were subject to deletion if they interfered with the migration process. Yours did. They were removed. Since you called me a systems monkey, the pictures I took of the files we removed will be sent to my supervisor, and yours, with detailed notes on how I found them and why I removed them.

**K.O.! Winner: Area88Guy, in the IT Gundam!**

I left Flood's cube, Flood sputtering obscenities behind me, and went directly to my supervisor. With him in hand, we went to Flood's supervisor. The meeting was 45 minutes. 

Flood was packing up his desk in 90.

 I heard a knock at the door (which was strange because it was open) so I answered it and was greeted by a girl of no more than 20 years of age trailing four kids behind her. 


""Can I help you?"", I asked. 

 She said ""Yeah, I'm here to get my compruta"" (sorry guys, I'm not being racist here, it just adds to the realism of our conversation), so I ask her name and she tells me.

  I look it up in the database, turn back to her, and ask ""When was it that you brought it in?""

She replied ""Oh, I dunno, it been a minute.  Like a few months or so""

I ask ""Was it a big gray desktop with lights on the front"", ""YEAH dat was it"". 

 I reply, ""You DO realize that you brought that computer to me in my other location in September of 2009, right?  That's been THREE YEARS, I don't have your computer anymore - to be honest with you, I barely even remember it.""  

  
OMG, she starts yelling ""WHAT YOU MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE IT NO MO?!?!?!  WHAT DA FUKKAMI POST TO DO NOW???  YOU AIN'T NEVER CALLED ME OR SHIT ABOUT IT"".

  I ask ""Is this the right number *reads number*"", she says ""NO, I got a new number when I moved out of town three years ago"". 

 I asked ""Why didn't you call me and even ASK about the computer?  In the three years that passed, I never heard from you, and the phone number didn't work.  I considered the computer to be abandoned.""

 She went absolutely nuts then.  She was stomping her feet and yelling a lot of incomprehensible things, mostly cursing, while her children silently watched.

I've been tasked with defragging, making sure Microsoft update worked because for some reason the guy who's now the boss of my boss set up the network in such a way that just turning automatic updates on wont work and will cause infinite restart/shutdown loops. We use a software called DeepFreeze to maintain some of our computers since we have lots of guests coming in and out and we like to keep them in relatively pristine condition software wise. In the last guy's incompetence he could not for the life of him figure out how to automate any of the basic things like software updates but apparently nobody has the spine to say anything because he somehow moved up in the company.

So recently i've been getting into the idea of doing things remotely and through batch files. I just whip up a script to do the defrag and while I'm at it I have it update all our other software that needs updating. Namely Java, flash, reader. 

Now before I go any further I should explain. The policy before I started doing things automatically? Send a team of five people down to the job site, and manually log into the admin account of every single computer and click to get windows update started and then click a few more times to update flash and java. Then come back hours later to log them out of the account then.

 Needless to say that's dumb as all hell. So I whip up these scripts, and deploy them across the entire network. I turned what used to take five people almost a week to do into a five minute affair with text logs to show my work. I'm sitting there thinking i'll get some kind of reward since in my head that's a major thing.

Nope. My boss comes in and tells me that if I do too much work they'll have to let me go at half a day or maybe tell me to not even come in tomorrow because I did too much work at once.

1345967615.0,1224,self.talesfromtechsupport,yugsk,A student changed 'Start' menu text to 'Penis' on hundreds of workstations,1661,437,203,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/yugsk/a_student_changed_start_menu_text_to_penis_on/,"I worked as a general tech at a local high school around 2000. They had hundreds of workstations running Novell Netware on-top of Win95, 98 and 98SE, all the machines were P-III's and below (typically P-II's and Celerons for students, P-III's for staff)



Computers were generally off-limits during lunchtimes, unless you booked one of the public workstations in the library in advance (you're restricted to 20 mins, which is the first half of lunch or a full recess). There were a handful of 'Senior' (11th/12th grade) students allowed access to 'private' unsupervised-ish computer labs at lunch time, most of the students would play Star-Craft and GTA over the network, others would browse the web and mess with Visual Basic 5 for class


Later on in the year, some of the machines I looked after in Lab 4 had trouble loading their desktops; Essentially Explorer.exe had been corrupted. Rather than try and troubleshoot these machines, standard procedure was to restore a known-working image using Ghost instead (it took around 5 minutes to do a complete wipe/restore of a Win9x partition, or closer to 15 minutes if the image is streamed over the network)


Students have their own 'drives' and desktops mapped to sub-folders on the server, so there shouldn't be any personal data stored locally on the machines. Applications are installed on-the-fly using Novell Snappshot on first-run, so the recovery image was bare-bones OS, Drivers, NetBEUI &amp; Novell stacks, and shortcuts to Snappshotted applications on the network


After restoring a few machines, I noticed some juniors pointing at a screen and giggling uncontrollably - I figured it was porn and carried on working (we've all been there, and being a tech I have no real authority anyway); Soon more students started acting the same way towards other machines. My curiosity got the best of me, so I casually walked across the lab, hoping to get a glimpse of the screen as I passed by


Sure enough, someone had changed the 'Start' menu text to 'Penis' on a few machines. I admit that I found it amusing at first, and suddenly the Explorer.exe corruption made sense, as the culprit must have messed up modifying the file the first few times before figuring it out. Needless to say, I wiped the affected machines and restored a known-good image after everyone left. This happened on and off over the next week, until I started receiving concerning emails from staff saying *their* machines have been affected too


One email stood out in particular, it was from the Librarian, which the students aren't terribly fond of. Someone had changed the text of several public library machines to ""Psycho!"", a nickname the students had given her, as it rhymes with her surname and reflects her default demeanor. I admit that I may have been rooting for the under-dog a little, I watched with glee as she tried to hilight and delete the text on the start menu (to no avail, of course)


Over the next few days, pretty much every department excluding the front office had been affected - I'm talking hundreds of machines. I was gob-smacked, how the hell could this many machines be affected? I can understand the students working together and affecting lab machines that they had access to... But staff too? Students don't have access to staff machines.


Some departments started becoming super-snappy towards me, accusing me of not doing my job and allowing this to happen - Bare in mind, I was a basic card-level tech there. I had admin-level access to the server, but I was not to mess with configuration, user accounts or network policies, that was someone elses job. My job was to run leads, replace cards, troubleshoot and 'format' machines, no more.


Feeling like my job was on the line, I got to work in trying to find out how it was being done. It had to be at least semi-automated to reach so many machines in such a short time, so I started from a freshly imaged student machine. The staff gave me a lend of the ""Office boy"" for a while (each day they pick a random student to run errands for the office), the seniors nick-named today's one ""Office bitch"". I asked him to have a seat, and show me exactly what he does to log into the machine to play games


He entered the username/password combination of student/student - apparently only 12th graders get their own logins, everyone else is to use 'student', with the exception of library computers, which use library/library. Immediately after start-up, I notice a black command prompt appear for a moment with nothing but a blinking cursor, then the machine reboots automatically. I ask him to log in again, after which the command prompt appears for under a second, and the desktop shows up


Lo and behold, the start menu text was changed to Penis on this freshly imaged machine too. Office boy bursts out into teary-eyed hysterical laughter, I figure yeah-yeah, I get it, penis (man I miss high school). Only this time there was a subtle change; the windows logo next to the text was replaced with crudely drawn penis with and similar colour scheme. At this point I was unable to contain my laughter and chortled repeatedly, I got an ""I know, right?"" chortling from office boy in return, too. I haven't seen anything like this since my Amiga days (I posted elsewhere that the 'Revenge' virus on Amiga changes the mouse pointer into a penis)


Figuring it's something being messed with server-side, I start NwAdmin and dig around for a while. I found several lines of code appended to the login scripts of 'student' and 'library'; this script essentially maps network drives and starts rdp services prior to explorer.exe loading. One of the lines pointed to a .bat file on a publicly accessible drive


I open the aforementioned batch file, and am amazed at what I see. First line, @echo off, explains the blinking cursor and nothing more - Next few lines are conditional IF EXISTS statements to determine the likely windows version (and if the machine has already been patched). Next, xcopy is called to copy one of four possible Explorer.exe files from a publicly accessible directory, and finally, rundll is called with SHExitWindowsEx to reboot windows. I felt bad undoing the changes and deleting the files, but it had to be done


I then did a global search for explorer.exe on the student directory, and found one interesting hit in a 12th graders home folder. In this folder there were many revisions of explorer.exe, as well as MicroAngelo studio (icon editor) and HexEdit.exe - I found the culprit! Clearly this is one smart kid, and he'd definitely be suspended or expelled if caught. I removed the files and left him a README.TXT file explaining how I found him, that I could have lost my job, and that I won't be telling the staff. I actually lost my job a few days later anyway, so I didn't get a chance to hear what happened next.


As to how the infections started, it turns out the global login scripts for student and library were user-writeable (rightclick the ""N"" novell icon in the systray, edit login scripts) - this explains how many machines were affected in such a short time, and particularly how the ""Psycho!"" text only affected the library machines


...As for staff machines getting affected, it turns out some occasionally log in as students to participate in multiplayer starcraft/GTA! Oh how I miss those days.


**tldr; 12th grader finds out global login script is writeable, uses it replace explorer.exe on hundreds of machines, start menu text changed to ""Penis"" on staff &amp; student computers, staff were affected because they secretly joined student multiplayer games**

It is a great company and while I am extremely busy (I had it soooo made in the AF) I am content to be employed.

One of my users had been complaining of her pc being very slow. I diligently grabbed my memo pad and visited her desk. 

As I was taking a look at her machine she told me about how she used to be in IT (said she was a programmer) and how her husband is extremely good with computers. She says that he built the ultimate gaming rig and it is so amazing that he has to have a house fan on it to keep it cool!!!

She asked me if she should shut everything down and I told her no, I wanted to see her pc as she would have it during a normal day. I took notes on the configuration, (1GB of RAM, XP...P4), checked the processes running, cpu utilization, virtual memory, pagefile, basically overkill on the notes because I wanted to make a good decision. As it turns out, the president of the company happened by the desk and after talking to him he said to get her a nice new machine. Easy enough.

I did some shopping and came up with a machine for her, ordered it and notified her when she would be getting it. All was good.

The next morning she came to me, all excited with some papers in her hand. She said that her husband had told her the machine I had ordered her would not be powerful enough for her work. I took a deep breath and remembered that my dealings with everyone in the company are forming their perception of me as a member of the team.

I told her that it was already ordered and she said that I could cancel that order anytime; she was sure of it. She thrust the papers onto my desk and said that her husband had spent a few hours last night researching the exact machine she should get.

She had a number of points:

1. 4 GB of RAM was not going to be enough.
2. A core i5 wouldn't be powerful enough.
3. He had picked a few machines that would be more suitable.

I summoned every oodle of patience I had and explained to her that I had taken copious notes about her machine and how she used it. That I had then chosen a very suitable machine for her.

He had selected a gaming machine (said so right on the sheets of paper she had) and I explained to her how a gaming machine was not necessarily suitable for office duty. I showed her how it had a $450 video card in it. I showed her that while the machine I selected did indeed have only 4GB of RAM, that it had 3 open slots and upgrading in the future would be a simple matter and that further more she was only using 988 MB of the memory in her current machine (with full load of programs running)

Deep breath, I also showed her how the machine he had selected was 3 times more expensive then the one I picked. Lastly, I gently schooled her on why a core i7 just wasn't cost effective compared to the i5 I had selected.

I smiled at her and said her husband had great taste in computers and obviously knew his stuff. She seemed a bit befuddled but mercifully wandered away from my desk without any further issue.

And now, the final installment...

   
  
   
If you've been reading the stories above, you know that all good things must come to an end. And at the end, there was nothing more for me in this, my very first IT job. It was time to let go, say goodbye, and ring down the curtain.

And it was time to do it with style.

---  

Now, the office manager and I had been involved in semi-friendly office-fu fighting for some months. He would demote me, I would use the spare time to embarass the crap out of him in front of his friends. He would try and lock me down, I would get a photo of me and the CEO smiling together and put it on my desk. He would try and loom menacingly over me, I would run my chair wheels over his shoes. We'd bring each other up on charges in front of tribunals and legal hearings, try and get each other fired, that sort of thing. Both of us were too slippery to really make anything stick, him because of his connections and me because I was smart and bored and I'd actually read the administrative process manuals.  

So the stage was set for a showdown.  

Now one of the things the office manager was very smug about was that he'd decreed (not openly, of course) that I was under his permanent control. I would not be escaping out of his influence unless I actually quit, and I was too stubborn to do so. Although his hobby was breaking new staff, making them resign or have breakdowns, he'd never been successful with me. But he wanted to break me. Oh, he wanted it bad. And that was his weakness.

   
  
   
Once I'd decided that it was time for me to move on, I had to find a way to do so without the office manager interfering with the process. So I set up a little misdirection a few weeks before I took my vacation. I mailed some paperwork to the capital city, I took a day off, and used that day to visit over twenty other offices of my employer in the city. I only spent a few minutes at each one, and what I did was to ask to see the manager (or acting manager), and tell them that I was interested in moving away from my current office and into theirs. I brought copies of my CV and examples of all the savings I'd made and work I'd done to date taking my office to the top of the state rankings. Some of the managers had even heard of me, which was quite gratifying. And I would thank them and move on to the next office, and the next, and the next.  

I got back to work the next day, and let it slip in conversation about where I'd been. This in turn got back to the office manager, as planned, and he was furious! I might weasel out from under his control! He'd be putting a stop to this, by thunder! And so he kept an eagle eye out for any incoming contact from other offices, and when they expressed an eager interest in acquiring my services, he would shred the messages and tell them I wasn't available. This kept him so busy that he didn't notice me taking a rather long and intense call on my lunch break, or that the call originated from the national capital, from within a quite different branch of the Service.  

After he'd concluded that he had stamped out any chance of me getting a job from any of the other offices in the city, he was quite, quite pleased with himself - until the events where (as noted previously) I acquired a photograph of myself and the CEO together. He instantly swung into action, and contacted his network of cohorts and those the location of whose skeletons he knew. It took him quite some time, but he eventually nailed down the chance of me being promoted or transferred AT ALL without his say-so as office manager. So now I couldn't go anywhere. Not in the city, not in the state, not in the country, not even to another Department. I was completely, absolutely, totally stuck. As far as he knew.  

The manager, worn out from all these activities, knew it was worth it - he'd won! There was nothing I could do and nowhere I could go. And so, when the Department was merged with a little mini-department the week after, and their staff were being placed tempoarily in our offices in various positions, the office manager decided that he was going to take his first vacation in ten years. He did this in the knowledge that his job would be filled by an incoming manager from the other department, and that that manager would be completely useless because the office was actually run by the triumverate of nasty under-managers who would proceed to eat his replacement alive, meaning he would be all too glad to move on after that time. Oh, and just in case I got sneaky, the replacement manager could NOT authorize any of the office staff to be promoted, transferred out of the Department, or even permanently transferred *inside* the Department.  

   
  
   
And so it came to pass. And verily, the replacement manager did turn up, and verily he was rapidly reduced to a deer-in-the-headlights look as the office triumverate pretty much tore him to pieces and he retreated to the small glass office near my desk to hide and wait out his two weeks. Which is where I found him.  

O Captain, I said to him, I have a request to make of you. For today, you are going to get a request from one of the offices in this city, an office which I have not physically visited on my day off but which I have kept in contact with through other means. The request will be that I be transferred to that office for a temporary period of one month. You are going to authorize this request, and you are going to do it the moment it arrives. For verily, I am young and confident and you currently have the mental fortitude of Jello, and I seem to be the only person in this establishment who both knows what they are talking about and is not actively undermining you every hour of the day.  

And yea, did the request arrive, and yea, did the replacement manager sign it, for as the office manager he had the authority to sign temporary inter-office transfers for the purposes of cross-training and such buzzword-compliant purposes. And thus did I pack my desk and head off to the other office for, as it seemed on the surface, the duration of one month only.

   
  
   
A minor victory, you might imagine. For the temporary manager could not authorize more than one month away, and after that I would have to return to my place under the thumb of the freshly vacationed original office manager.  

Only... there was that little matter of the paperwork I had sent to another Department, in the national capital. It had been an application. And the phone call I had taken during lunch, while the office manager was occupied with other matters, had been my interview. And I had won the job.  

Except that in order to take it, I would need to be released from the Department by my office manager. You may recall that the temp manager did not have that authority.  

...but the manager at the office I'd be at for one month? COULD.  

   
  
   
No, wait, that's not quite the right word. What's the one I'm looking for? Oh yes...

**DID.**  

I mean, I did mention above that I'd been in communication with this other office for a while, yes? And that the computer macros I'd developed turned out to be *very* well-suited to taking offices right to the top of the state listings? Especially as I'd been refining them?  

You see, it turns out that apparently some office managers are actually *interested* in being at the top of the rankings. Particularly if it meant knocking my old office and its smug snake of a manager out of the top spot. And so it came to pass that my new office suddenly leapt from the bottom of the barrel to being the new golden child in about two weeks. Which was exactly the amount of time it took for the paperwork to come through from the other Department, for me to pack my life into a suitcase and hop a plane for Capital City, and for me to achieve a great big honkin' triple promotion and pay rise in what was my second-only tech support position ever.  

   
  
   
The change of status, as with all other personnel changes within the Service, was categorized, recorded, and dryly published in small writing in the Service Gazette.  

I photocopied the relevant section, blew it up onto an A3 sheet, and mailed it to my old office manager.

---  

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the story of how I slipped the noose, put the dust of my home town behind me, came to the  Capital, and started working for a very powerful government department indeed.  

During my time there, I would see many things. I would work on infrastructure the government swore didn't exist. I would learn to program in Perl. I would completely revamp the IT support section from the ground up, and I would learn that government servers are home to a truly stupendous amount of porn.  

I would take over two hundred calls a day. I would see my first truly multilanguage batch file in the wild. And it was at this very job, dear readers, that I received The One Call I will Never Forget.

There was a woman that had just started for us in the Accounts department.  She was second to the Dept. head.  One day I see a ticket come up on our web interface saying that she has some computer issues, so being the IT guy that I am, I went to lunch first.

I get back from lunch, and she frantically calls me and tells me there is a bad virus on her computer, and can't do anything.

Over the years, our staff has gotten fewer and fewer, so we all have to pitch in for major events and special conferences.  That's fine, I'm a team player, blah blah blah.  Plus, special events break up the routine and give me something different to do.

So this week, we're hosting a conference for about 120 people, roughly half of them from outside our university.  We're holding it (for the first time) at a new conference facility that opened up on our campus a couple years back.  Convenient, right?

Well, what's become evident very quickly is that the people running the conference center are small time.  They're accustomed to holding small alumni lunches, departmental faculty meetings, that sort of thing.  They aren't really prepared for large conferences involving a high number of non-University attendees.  

Example: the assistant operations manager, when told the caterers needed to get in at 5:30AM to set up breakfast, said, ""Really?  I have to get here that early?""  Yes, you do.  Unless you want to give the caterers a key.  They can't set up breakfast in the parking lot.

So anyway, two months ago, this same person told me, ""Yes, we have free guest wireless.""  Great.  I'm assuming that this means some sort of open visitor wifi, perhaps time-restricted, like you'd often find in a hotel convention center, or hospital, etc.

Over the past two weeks, I've wanted to gain more information so I could put it in the program book (yes, I'm designing and printing the program books, 'cause no one else knows how to do something like that.  Apparently.)

Come to find out, ""yes we have free guest wireless"" means something different to them than it does to me.  For our attendees who are affiliated with this University, no problem.  We all have an assigned University username and password which will work to log on to the facility's wifi network.

For our non-University guests, it's a different story.  There's no available blanket visitor network.  The University does have a way to purchase visitor wifi access, at a nominal charge.  The money is no problem; but each person has to be registered individually with their own email address and phone number; since we're allowing on-site registration, this isn't something that can be done for everyone in the past.

I talked to the operations manager about this, expressing my displeasure that his assistant had told us there was free guest wifi two months ago.  He proceeds to explain to me that I'm ""confused,"" that they do in fact have free guest wifi.  When they have an event with outside attendees, what he does is log them on to the University wifi using HIS OWN USERNAME AND PASSWORD, and he suggests that I do the same, for our 50-60 external attendees.  I should log them in with MY OWN USERNAME AND PASSWORD, the same credentials that access my financial records, my grades/transcript (I was a student here), my IT-specific resources on campus, etc., etc.  And again he is ""sorry for my confusion"" on the matter.

Now, I doubt that any of our external guests would be using their laptops during the meeting to download kiddie porn or pirate software.  But I'm not going to essentially promise that by logging them on with my own credentials, thus putting my career at risk!!  I also doubt they have a keylogger installed, or some other way to cache/capture my password.  But they might -- I don't know these people!!

I sent off a stunned email to the IT guy who ""sort of"" manages their network for them (the fact that they don't have full-time IT support is clearly a factor here) and he says ""Yeah, I've told them about that in the past, I'll remind them.""

Someone suggested I repost my comment as its own tale.

My first job in this field was working at a national for-profit college that I also attended. I worked there officially for around three years, though I was the intern for roughly another year. I took the job from a guy whose no-call, no-show antics caused his termination the day he returned. THAT guy had been hired to replace the first sysadmin hired at this physical location.

Guy1's mantra was job security. Only he knew how to ""do"" certain things, and never explained them. Wiring was a joke that he had mapped out in his own head, and again told no one. I spent much time fixing this guy's shit.

Guy2's mantra was screw it, let's game. Myself and the other intern did most of the work, and he did only what he couldn't pawn off onto us. The rest of the time we were deep in vidjamagames. It was fun, but he barely tried to keep that job.

Enter me. I will not be a braggart by saying I was the best damn tech that site had seen. I fixed problems and explained them in layman's terms. Anything I could possibly fix, I did, though there was much that I was not allowed to fix. This was either due to a lack of resources or time, or an unwilling of the jackass manager to give me overtime or let me shift my schedule.

Our server room was utter shit. I never had the ability to fix this, however, because my boss was a complete jackass with no understanding of IT or best practices. He wanted 24/7/365 uptime, regardless of whether or not anyone was on campus, and refused to pay overtime. ""Do it on your own time if it's so important."" was his mantra. ""Pay me."" was mine.

I had submitted around six proposals to this Dunder-Mifflin reject, all declining in price from $10k. We needed new switches that met with our college's Acceptable Equipment list. We needed a new server (we had two, one for student-related items and one for the business) ASAP. We needed a complete rewire of the server room and other networking closet, to sort out what went where, and to label it all.

Denied every time, when I had people at a level above him who said it would be approved if he submitted it. I pleaded with him to bring our stuff up to HQ's code, but he denied everything, stating that it wasn't in the budget, or that he couldn't be bothered to pay for the time. This meant that if something broke, I was expected to drop everything to fix it.

So, my rule of thumb became Customers First. I didn't care if the business was suffering. If classes were being affected because of downtime, it was my job to fix it. Dean of the Criminal Justice school can't get on Facebook? Fuck 'em, Lab 435 is down, and there's a class in there in two hours.

As the years passed, I began to be more bold with my time. If I knew I had a major project to get done, I did it. I didn't care if the office wasn't staffed, because they had removed my ability to have more than one intern. If Jackass Manager asked me where I was, I told him, and informed him of what could have prevented the downtime.

My pleas for new or newER equipment were still ignored, and I was done with it.

Cut to the last hour+ of my employment there. I was leaving for greener pastures to work with a team at a medical facility. It was my dream job, but my work ethic is such that I had not yet ""checked out"". I remember it being about 64 minutes until freedom. Server room alarms go off. Three switches have died, the student server has crashed and won't come back on. Phones are out due to the wiring being so haphazard that some of the lines were on the dead switches. The whole student side is down. Normally, I would go to Mr. Jackass and inform him of the situation.

Mr. Jackass is on vacation.

I go in and assess the damage, then assess my time left. I grab my cellphone, call his assistant, and tell her that he needs to authorize emergency overtime for me, as well as prepare to be contacted by HQ regarding the equipment. She calls. She's a nice lady. Kinda hot, too. I sit outside of the server room, waiting, when my cell rings. It isn't a number I know, so it must be Mr. Jackass. It is.

Confirms it's me. ""Under no circumstances are you to stay over your 40 hours. Fix it."" Hangs up.

I stare at the cellphone, and start laughing. I dial up my Level 2 contact and brief him on the situation. He starts cracking up. He knows I'm outta here in another 20 minutes or so. He says he'll start the official process, and I let him know if anyone from Level 2 up needs to ask questions, to call me. I then unplug the three switches and gather their cords up, placing them in one box. I know HQ will want these, so I label the box and hand it to the newly-arriving Assistant. She asks what I'm doing. I tell her I'm doing damage control until 4:00PM.

She begins to laugh. ""He didn't approve the overtime, did he?""

Nope. I immediately begin to bring down the administrative network and restore it using the shittiest switches that I had. I filmed all of this with my phone, stating my reasons for doing so. I then brought the student network back up using our production-grade switches. Fuck the administrative staff, these kids are paying for school, and they're going to get it.

Instructors are coming down to find out what is going on, and I'm letting them all know. I won't brag, I'm a nice system admin, so they all at least liked me if not loved me. Every single one of them left the room laughing. I leave detailed notes, both digitally and on paper, as to what has happened, what needs to be done to fix it, and why I'm leaving the site at 4:00PM. I save copies of the filmed work on three locations, head to the office and grab my stuff. Hands are shaken as I inform the intern about what has gone down.

At 4:04PM, and I couldn't make that shit up if I tried, the admin network goes back down from the horrible switches I was forced to use. Intern calls and asks for advice. I tell him there's nothing he can do, and give him Level 2 tech's cellphone, which L2 had already bade me do. 

At 4:19PM, as I'm pulling off the highway and nearly home, I receive a call from Mr. Jackass. He demands a status report. I inform him that HQ has been notified, as has the Level 2 technician, and that it's out of my hands. I tell him what I did with the networks, and that I left crystal-clear instructions with everyone who matters. 

He demands that I return to the site. I laugh in his ear, and tell him I'll return as soon as he authorizes the overtime. He growls out that I am not to count these hours, and I laugh again. I decided to bargain with him: you supply the hours, I'll go buy the equipment personally. He starts raging, threatening to fire me if I don't get to the store, buy parts, and get the school back to 100%. I ask if I get overtime, he yells no, and I calmly state the next bit:

""You cannot fire me, as I no longer work for you. I've done my due diligence and informed everyone that needed to be informed, but I am not a hardware wizard. You were informed several times about your hardware and wiring issues, and you chose to ignore them. I included that in my communication as well. Now, lose my phone number, because I'm not your employee any longer.""

I hang up to the sound of his rage. Three hours later, he's the only one who doesn't show up to my going-away party. Tales are spun of how Mr. Jackass was furious, calling everyone he could to get them to convince me to return. Amazingly, none of them had seen me, nor had my phone number. 

I found out later that this incident, plus my reporting on his practices (such as no overtime but fix it for free), was the nail in a coffin of evidence collection that the school had taken years to gather. He was fairly decent at covering his ass, but I was better, and they took him to task for it. Intern ended up helping them fix everything, then replace everything, and was finally hired on as my replacement. 

Original TL;DR: Don't assume the IT guys were idiots. Instead, assume that they weren't given the tools that they needed to fix everything, and let their work speak for itself.

Poster's TL;DR: I saw that the Dragon was attacking Gran Soren, so I burned 2 Praxis to upgrade my arm augments. After that, it was a trifling matter to combo Fujin and Shin Ichishiki into Issei Ogi.

T is a retired government employee who was clearly not hired for his computer skills.

I ask him about the cause of his irritation and he tells me that his email has been hacked.  I change his password and start heading down to his office to check out his workstation.  On the way he informs me that it wasn't his work email that got hacked it was his personal email.

Do not care levels are rising rapidly, but I tell him the SOPs.  Change all you passwords run scans on your home computer with these programs etc.  

I head back to my office and about five minutes later T. is back and  angry, talking about how much he hates computers.  I'm wondering why I'm the target of all this anger, but realize that IT tends to be the target of much misplaced frustration.  He informs me that he can't remember his aol password and that's the account that was hacked in the first place.  He then starts bitching about how he's been paying them for all these years and that he just called them to get it reset and that they shouldn't have their phone support run by (insert racist term of your choice here) Indians.  

I do a double take when I hear the words PAY and AOL in the same sentence and wonder if I have been somehow transported back in time.  After checking my trash to see whether or not it's filled with cd's offering 500 hours of free internet I realize that it is in fact 2013 and ask my coworker if he is still using them as his ISP.  Nope he is using Time Warner.  

I ignore the giant WTF sign blinking in my head and try to inform him that there is no conceivable reason to be giving AOL money.  He stays angry and I get nowhere.  It's at this point that I remind him that we are talking about his personal email.  I tell him one last time to change all of his passwords and to stop paying aol and tell him that's as much help as he will be getting

1371389196.0,1170,self.talesfromtechsupport,1ggb45,You have made a HUGE mistake. [X Post from Petty Revenge],1428,258,217,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1ggb45/you_have_made_a_huge_mistake_x_post_from_petty/,"Hey guys, I was told to post this here since I was the unofficial tech person for my company.


For the past 7 years I have worked for the same company. Without getting overly specific, I market our material to agencies, manage our media, do some HTML5 coding and do graphic design work. We are a small company and I am the resident tech person, so I am a jack of all trades. Over the years I have grown to dislike the people that I work with immensely. They have:


Stolen my food (I am gluten intolerant so I make the effort to make my own food...and people go through my lunch and eat it anyway), stolen my tupperwear, they are completely inconsiderate with my time, they are condescending and I am routinely taken for granted. I have gotten verbally assaulted more times than I can count and I am severely underpaid. I can't even use them as a reference for future jobs because I simply can't trust them - the person that had my position before me used my boss as a reference (and my boss agreed to give him a good recommendation), and I heard my boss trashing my predecesor to a potential employer over the phone. Super classy.


I am quitting this terrible job to go back to school. When they hired my replacement, they got someone as cheaply as they could, and the person they chose didn't have any background in any kind of graphic design/media/web. They think so little of my job that they didn't think my replacement needed any experience whatsoever.

Anyway, training this new guy has been an absolute trainwreck. In 5 days he's nearly destroyed our website and he sent defective media to a sales rep and made a fool of her in a large meeting. At this point I assumed that I'd train my replacement and say goodbye to this company for good with minimal drama - they selected someone without a proper background, they can deal with it.


Last week had been busy since we have clients in, and I brought my personal computer in to help with the load, since my replacement has been on my company computer to 'learn the ropes'. I have brought my personal computer in before when we have been in a squeeze, and I have been compensated ($10 a day, nothing crazy). I brought up compensation this time around, and my boss gets in my face, and says, ""I didn't realize your computer came with a fee. I thought you had been sharing the company computer with your replacement.""


I had obviously not been sharing my company computer with my replacement, since we had been working in entirely different offices. My boss had even requested that I set up multiple webpages on my personal computer during this time. He was playing dumb and lying to my face.


I didn't say anything because I knew whatever came out of my mouth at that moment wouldn't be constructive. However, I did think, ""You have made a HUGE mistake.""


I didn't bring my computer into work the next week and the entire workload was shifted to my replacement. I was working in the respect that I was going over things that my replacement didn't understand (which was a lot, lol), but I wasn't able to work independently since my replacement and myself were sharing one machine. At one point my boss asked me why a project that he gave me wasn't done, and I said, ""Well, since I am sharing a computer with my replacement, and he's been really busy with the clients, I haven't had a chance to get to it."" My boss looked unhappy but was unable to admit his mistake - and by the time he realized the extent of his mistake, it was too late.


Since I wasn't there to shoulder the workload, the under-experienced replacement floundered, the entire company looked incompetent and we lost future jobs with the clients (there were two clients, which equates to hundreds of thousands of dollars lost) that we had in our office. I watched the world burn. This past week was my last week, and this was a sweet way to go out.


TLDR: I bring in my personal computer to help make a busy week more manageable, my boss refused to offer the most minimal of compensation, so I don't bring my computer in anymore and watch all hell break loose.",,False,,t5_2sfg5,False,,,True,t3_1ggb45,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1ggb45/you_have_made_a_huge_mistake_x_post_from_petty/,

Story:

Work for a company that builds websites.  Was tasked with doing customer tech support (not my usual gig), but figured it'd be easy so why not. 

Lady emails and says she can't sign up, because there's ""no signup button"".  In reality, she has completed the form, and just needs to scroll down a little to see the button. 

So I have her on the phone, and she continues to tell me ""she is at the bottom of the page"", ""what do you mean scroll??"" and ""you mean the wheel on the bottom of my mouse? isn't that more of a ball?"" (seriously- was she using a fucking ball mouse? do those still exist??)

So I'm running out of ideas, and ask her if she uses email regularly.  She does, so I hope into MS paint, take a screenshot of the page, and draw a big green arrow pointing to where she has to click to scroll down. 

I'm sure you know the rest from there. 

5 minutes goes by ""I am clicking it, nothing it moving down it isn't working"".  me: ""are you sure you're clicking right where I indicated?  are you sure your screen isn't moving at all?""  yes yes yes. 

Then she screams, ""I don't know what's wrong with you, I'm clicking on your fucking arrow right now, it's not working, are you stupid? are you listening to me?""

She was in fact clicking on my arrow.  On the screenshot image.  Expecting it to work.

The first incident was the year my high school tried to have a programming elective. They were trying to teach Java, but the IDE and associated tools were nowhere to be found. I thought I'd look around drive C to see if I could find them. The network admin showed up, saw me with Windows Explorer open, and said ""Stop. I don't care what you're doing, just stop."" Pretty much word-for-word, with a tone that suggested any second now I might hear ""Step away from the computer...""

This being high school, I was teased for ""hacking"" the system for quite awhile. I didn't think much of it until, much later, I discovered that while the network folders were locked down with reasonable permissions, the local drive was entirely world-writable. So Windows explorer was actually enough for a DoS of sorts -- I could open C:\WinNT and just start deleting things. Or worse, if I was clever enough to rootkit them. I wasn't, and I didn't care, it was just fascinating. Maybe someone upgraded from a FAT32 drive? How does this happen?

**TL;DR: Surprisingly justified paranoia.**

While I'm at it, the admin did manage to lock down which programs could be run. He did so by a whitelist, apparently, as there would be a number of login scripts which would fail because of this on every login.

Few students were willing to risk putting such illicit material as Doom on the network drive, so we loaded it onto USB keys, along with a portable Firefox -- Flash wasn't installed, so this allowed us to play Flash games, as well as easily configure proxies. (I also ran a proxy outside the school network, as the school had the ISP filtering content for us, and an actual Squid proxy pretty much completely defeated this filtering.)

How was this possible? Doom and Firefox certainly weren't on the whitelist! Ah, but notepad.exe was, and it was entirely by executable name. Not even the full path, just the filename. Once I discovered this, we all had multiple subfolders consisting of various 'notepad.exe' files. Any class in which we all had access to a computer lab and were ever left unsupervised would devolve into a Legacy Doom LAN party -- these may have been ancient NT4 machines, but Doom was much older and ran perfectly.

I got hired back in '09 to help the IT Director with any software solutions needed for the organization.

2010 comes along, and they decide that I should also be the one that services help desk work orders. So now, it is my responsibility to write any software solution, whether it be a PHP/mySQL website, a VB.net site, a WPF Information kiosk, or an iOS app, but to also make sure that I assist any of the other 150 employees with tech support by phone, email, or in person.

2011 comes along and I graduate with a Bachelors in Computer Science, they bump me up to salary so that I don't have a reason for ignoring phone/email tech support in the evening. This seems good to me because I'm finally getting paid more than $8.5/hr.($15/hr). At this time, our IT office consists of 3 people: Boss, Tikrin, and Derpette. Boss sits in his lair and only helps with work orders if I can directly prove that he has messed up on his DNS,switch, server, or router settings. Derpette is a VOLUNTEER. This is where I suppose the story comes in.

Derpette, sometime in 2010, created a Yahoo! Small business website. From that moment, she started to email our ""comments"" email about how she could improve our websites that we have. Back to 2011, administration at the organization have decided that it would be great for her to volunteer and help me out with the websites. Always looking for a break, we sit down and discuss what we both know. I quickly find out that she has no idea what HTML is, no idea what a motherboard is, no idea on anything tech support related besides some intermediate Windows knowledge.

I try informing the higher ups that she doesn't have a skillset that would really benefit IT, I get reprimanded for trying to turn away someone who wants to volunteer. So, Derpette starts showing up on a daily basis. She's a grandma, btw. Late 40s, early 50s. I finally provide a back end interface solution for some of our websites. This is good, because she understands this. She starts spellchecking, and making sure blogs look good. Something I don't have to worry about, this works for me.

Towards November of 2011, she gets hired as a part time staff member. She assumes the role of answering any tech support emails she can. I've been able to teach her how to log into Active Directory so she can reset passwords, taught her about security groups, and several other things. She's finally catching on to tier 1 tech support things. 

Boss finally installs a time clock server so I no longer have to walk 100 yards to another department to clock in/out with card. However, they set up Derpette, in a secretarial role, to manage my time clock. So if I forget to clock in, she would be the one to approve of the time clock.

Alright, so, some time goes by and she has begun to email me any work orders she can't do, and she's approving my time worked. Being a good ole secretary, or so I thought.

December 2011, I email my Boss personally to ask if I can help out with another department for 2 hours a week. I tell him I understand I wasn't hired for that role, and it's completely okay if I can't. It was just something that I would love to do, and would rather try to do it, than not. I also tell him that I understand if he has to take it higher up. He replies with a ""I'll see what they say"", and CCs Derpette to let her know that I may be doing this for 2 hours a week.

I, immediately, get a response from Derpette to only me, asking why I thought it was okay to email my boss first instead of her. She starts rambling about a chain of authority and how I shouldn't circumvent it. I inform her that Boss is my boss, and the first person I should be asking. She responds with another email saying that we will talk personally about this the next day.

Next day comes along, and nothing is said. *shrugs*. Over the next couple of weeks, she starts sending me mediocre work orders. Work orders that she could handle. I inform her that I'm busy working on an Admin-approved programming assignment, and she says that I should do them because she wouldn't have sent them to  me otherwise. Oooookay.

So, I do the work orders. Trying to squeeze in the programming projects that I have deadlines on. Eventually, it starts getting ridiculous. We have a remote location, 45 miles away. They email to say that their dual monitors are not working anymore on one of the computers. Derpette emails them back and says that I would gladly start driving that way.

I inform her that I would not and that we could either try to remote in, or they could bring it to us.(They have a ""runner"" that comes to us everyday). Remote location says that isn't a problem and the runner gives us the computer. I hook it up, and it works perfectly. I double check just to make sure, and give it back with two new DVI cables. I even write down some instructions of how to set up dual monitors.

A week goes by, and I show up to work. I'm now tasked to drive 45 miles to the remote location because ""I"" didn't fix anything. Everyone is gone from the location that day so I can't remote in. I have to drive there and fix it. Disgruntled, I get a company car and make the drive. I get there and lo and behold, one of the DVI cables is not hooked up. Simply hook it up, and yep, dual monitors working. I take a picture and text it to Derpette for accountability that the problem is now fixed. I then start to head back to my office, 45 miles away. 

She corresponds with me a little bit on the road, and everything seems okay. I reach the outskirts of our town when she emails back and says, ""BTW, did you fix the other thing they needed done?""

I, having no idea, responded. ""I have no idea what you're talking about.""

She then forwards me an email between the remote location and her. In the PS section, the remote location asks for me to look at another monitor hookup. She adds to the email, ""Do you not know what a monitor looks like? This needs to be done, so turn around and go do it.""

I flip, park my car, and then send an email letting her know how sick I am of her attitude. She responds back all hurt saying that she is offended. Once again, it ends with a, ""We'll discuss in person tomorrow.""

So I drive back to the remote location, and the monitor turns on with a shake of a mouse.

NEXT DAY: I come to work, having no reason or want to talk to Derpette. She walks into my office, closes the door, and pulls up a chair. She then says, ""It's sad that I have to tell you I'm your boss...but I'm your boss. And you should consider yourself lucky, or you would be fired after what you emailed me yesterday."" My boss then walks in to crack a joke about something(I could tell from his smirk), but she quickly demands that he leave so that ""we"" could talk. She then rants on about how she has been my boss ever since the time clock server was installed and was absolutely shocked that I didn't pick up on that. 

I tell her that no one has ever told me that she was my boss, and that if she was, I am sorry. Her response was ""No one should have to tell you that I'm your boss, you should just know. I'll have to bring this up to Administration, because your lack of respect isn't going to get you anywhere.""

Two days go by, and I get pulled into Administration. I'm completely baffled that I'm being called by them, and surely I'm not getting fired? Nope! They apologize for Derpette's behavior and have no idea where she got the notion she was my boss. If she ever tried to do something like that again, I should only need to tell them.

So, it ended well, but geez, she got crazy.

As in, it wouldn't boot at all. Nothing appeared on the screen when she pressed the power button. After a few questions, I found out what happened.

Windows was updating. It had downloaded and installed the updates, and when it rebooted, it had one final phase of updates to install. Even though the screen said ""Don't power off your computer"", she did just that by forcing it to power off...by just removing the laptop battery. While it was updating.

So now her computer is screwed. She lives in the States and I'm in Canada, so I couldn't really advise her on any quick fixes, especially since the laptop is completely unresponsive. I just suggested she find a reputable local tech support guy to come and take a look at it, but it seems like she might have caused a power surge and fried something. Anyway, I thought it was sadly amusing that even though the only thing that was on the screen was text saying ""Don't turn off your computer"", she did just that. There is clearly no such thing as idiot-proof. I wonder if, when she sees a sign saying ""Wet paint"", she touches it anyway.


UPDATE: She took it to a professional computer repair place.

UPDATE #2: The repair place discovered that she had inadvertently installed a second virus scanner (I had set her up with Avast), most likely as the result of downloading and installing some other software that came with a free trial. The two virus scanners were interfering with each other and she got a virus as a the result. Then the whole Windows update fiasco happened. Because she barely knows anything about computers, I couldn't get the specifics from her, but ultimately her computer got fixed and the money and time it cost her has (hopefully) taught her not to power down in the middle of an update again.",,False,,t5_2sfg5,1369454111.0,,,True,t3_1ewjb9,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1ewjb9/my_motherinlaw_may_have_fried_her_computer/,

I was an English major then, wandering the halls of our university building looking for a particular professor, when I see a different professor that I recognize.

So I wave and say hello!

She also says hello, and tells me to follow her. I'm confused at this point, but she's also thanking me for stopping by. So I follow her to her office, where she tells me that she has to run, but she's leaving her computer and her door unlocked so I can work the ticket she put in

You know, for her printer. It's not printing!

I'm still slightly confused when she tells me she'll leave me to it and takes off.

Now, at the time I was a bearded white guy with a ponytail. I suppose I looked the part, but there's a certain irony in the women's studies chair making grand assumptions based on appearances.

Especially when those assumptions involve leaving someone at your work computer with full access to everything not only in the computer, but the office as well.

I was an assistant IT supervisor at a middle school about 3 years ago. One day I receive a call from the principal telling me that she wants me to talk to a student who apparently was ""hacking"" into our gradebook servers and changing his and his friends grades. So I decided to sit down with the kiddo ( he was about 12 years old) and have a talk with him.


Our conversation went like this:

*Me*: So buddy, I heard you were doing some stuff on our school computers.
*Student*: No! I didn't do anything!

Now of course the kid was lying so I tried another approach. I start to talk to him about some ""cool"" and ""hip"" games (such as CoD and WoW or some shit like that) and get to know him a little better. After a while the kid finally decided to tell me that he actually was ""changing"" the grades.

*Me:* So can you tell me how you did it?

*Student*: It's really simple actually! See, you just open Chrome here and login into your student account and then you can right-click on a grade, hit ""Inspect element"" and then you can scroll down and then you can doubleclick on your grade and type in an A !

I was facepalming. The sad part about this whole thing was that he was actually failing most of his classes right now because he thought he could just change them using his super-secret hacking-fbi-technology.
I asked him why then everytime he revisited the gradebook his grades were changing back, he told me he spent must of his free-time redoing it so it would ""stay"".

The kid ended up changing schools. His friends were *really* pissed at him.

Good 'ol times.

**TL;DR: Kid thought he was ""hacking"" his grades by using Chrome-&gt;Inspect.**

This happened when I was in 10th grade and doing some freelance computer work.

One of the guys I did work for was at that time my mom's boss, we'll call him L. He and his wife ran this little dental lab with only two computers. He had one up front that was still running Windows 98 (not even SE, and also had never been defragged in the 10 years it had been running) and one in his office that was running XP.

So one day he called me up to transfer all his data to his brand new shiny Vista machine from the XP machine. (Win7 had not been released). So I spend two to three hours moving everything, installing programs, the normal blah with a new setup. I get it done, get my paycheck ($120, not bad) and head on home.

Now while I was setting it up, I told him to next time consult me before buying a new machine since he went out and bought an e-Machine instead of having me build it for him and even showed him I could've made it much cheaper and with no bloatware.

A few weeks later he calls me up and says he bought another new computer. At first I think ""Man, I told him to call me before he got one"" but then I also though ""He's finally replacing that damn 98 machine"".

So I head up there and look in the front office: No new system, 98 still chugging. Then I walk into his office. His oldnew (the Vista) machine is already semi-torn down and off to the side. On his desk is sitting a nice, shiny, huge iMac. Immediately I point out to him that the software he uses will not run on a Mac system. He says, ""I know. I want you to do that Boot Camp thing and put Windows XP on it."" He tells me he hated Vista and so I just use my own install CD and steal the key off the old, original XP system. 

Of course I say nothing and do my job, installing Boot Camp, transferring data and programs again. So after a few hours, I get done, get another check and then I turn and ask him: ""So if all you wanted was XP back, why did you get an iMac? I could've just put it on that e-Machine."" 

He then tells me his story about going to the Apple store to buy an iPod and of this *salesman* who tells him about all the wonderful features of the new $1,700 iMacs such as how you can run Windows and all your Windows programs on it and how Macs will *never* get a virus. 

He then looks me straight in the face and is dead serious, ""So naturally I assumed that if you installed Windows on a Mac, then Windows would never get a virus.""

Of course I explained things to him to the best of his ability and I think he got it. AFAIK, that Vista machine still sits unused in his closet (he told me he was gonna take it home, although I suggested using it to replace the 98 machine) and I believe he's never once booted it into Mac OS. 

TL;DR Mac salesman twists the classic ""Macs don't get viruses"" line to fool one of my clients out of $1,700.

It has been both a profession and a hobby for me. One thing I have always done for cash on the side is computer repair.  All of my business is word of mouth because if I were to actually advertise, I couldn't work a full time job *and* do all the side work. 

I tried doing it as a stand alone business for a while, but there is a lot of competition, so I decided to just keep it as side work. There are *a lot* of people in my area that take advantage of the less technically inclined. I've run across it multiple times.  This is one of those stories.

About two years ago, I had a voice mail message from a gentleman that was having trouble with what he described as a liquid cooled gaming computer. I made house calls and he somehow got my number from a past customer. I called him back and made an appointment to go to his house.

I arrived at the house and was kind of concerned because it was somewhat run down for the area. I tried not to judge, re-checked the address, realized it was right and parked my truck. I walked up to the house, all the curtains were pulled shut and it sincerely looked like no one lived there. There was no car in the driveway, there were no signs of life.

I hesitantly knocked at the door. The curtain in the bay window cracked open just enough for me to see an eye. I then heard ""WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT DO YOU WANT?"" screamed through the door at me. I replied with ""You talked to me about fixing your computer, we had an appointment set for today.""  Everything was dead silent for a minute. Then I heard multiple locks unbolt, and a safety chain get removed.

The door swung open and the guy asked me for identification. I was rather confused, but I handed him my drivers license. He looked at it for a few seconds, held it out and looked at the picture, then looked back at me, then looked back at the picture and then said ""Okay you check out.""  I am not really sure who I check out with but...okay, I check out.

I stepped into the house and I was instantly overwhelmed with the smell. The guy immediately gave me a feeling of [Randy Quaid's character](http://i.imgur.com/uYPHL1q.jpg) from ""Not Another Teen Movie"".

The conversation that took place inside the door was him telling me that his computer was running slow, he couldn't play the games because they failed to start and he couldn't get a hold of the guy that usually worked on his computer.

I asked him to take me to the computer. When we walked through the house, the guy was ""clearing"" the rooms. He would duck behind the wall, look into the room, then enter the room. He did this through the two rooms we passed through as I followed him. I was already regretting stepping foot in the house.

We made it into his kitchen. His computer sat at a table, where he had moved a recliner to be more comfortable. The table was packed with food wrappers, cans and overflowing ashtrays. It was a mess.

The first thing I noticed was that his ""gaming computer"" was conveniently housed in a Compaq Presario case, I can only imagine it was early pentium technology. I never actually got to seriously look at the computer.  Mostly because I was so focused on the teflon line that ran from the side panel of his computer to the kitchen faucet. 

By this time I am *really*, *really* regretting stepping foot in the house. So I ask him to go ahead and boot the computer up for me. I honestly didn't want to touch it. It was dirty, the keyboard looked like he was eating meals off of it and I am pretty sure that there were some fluids attached to it that I didn't want to make contact with.

""Okay, I will boot it, but it will take a few minutes"". I watched as he walked over to his kitchen sink, latched a boot to the faucet, put the exit tube into the sink and then turned the cold water on.  He then walked back to the computer and hit the power button.

I walked over to the sink, the teflon tube ran from the sink, to the computer and then back to the sink to drain. I was now at the point of ""This has to be a joke, there has to be cameras somewhere around here."" But nope. Guy was serious.

The computer booted after a while. I told him to go ahead and shut it down, because I needed to look inside. *I seriously needed to look inside, I wanted to see how this water cooled system was plumbed just to satisfy my own curiosity.*

I told him that I needed to pop the side panel off the computer. He was hesitant and said ""I am going to watch you, I want to make sure you're not planting any bugs"". Because you know, I actually care what this guy is doing on his computer.

I popped the side off the tower, where the teflon lines ran in. The teflon lines ran in, did two great big loops and ran right back out of the case. There was no connections for the tubing on the panel. It was literally two holes drilled, teflon line ran in one hole, did two big loops and then ran right back out the second hole. I could hold the panel and there was no plumbing connected to anything but the panel. *Every time this guy booted his computer, he would turn his sink on, water would run through this system and then discharge back into the sink.*

The first thing I noticed was the liquid cooling plumbing, the second thing I noticed was that his heatsink was packed with tar, dust, tobacco, cat hair and I would imagine other stuff that would give me some incurable disease. The fan in the back of the computer was so packed full of...icky that it wasn't even turning anymore.

I instinctively blurted out ""This isn't liquid cooled, this isn't even close to liquid cooled, whoever did this scammed you out of money."" *Evidently* this was the wrong thing to say. The ""guy"" who regularly worked on his computer was his nephew. Regardless of what I knew, his nephew knew more.

I told him that the teflon tubes were doing absolutely nothing but sweating, pooling water in the bottom of his case and rusting out his case and probably causing some moisture issues inside his computer. I was immediately told I had no clue what I was talking about. His nephew had installed this cooling system for $300 and the computer was running great up until a few days ago.

After trying to explain to this guy that the computer needed blown out to get rid off all the dust, that his rear fan was dead and definitely needed replaced, that the teflon lines were doing nothing to help cool his computer and telling him that he probably needed a thorough operating system cleaning, he called me a liar. I had met my limit and although ""I can't fix this"" usually isn't in my vocabulary, I said ""I can't fix this.""  To add insult to injury, the guy then said ""Yea, my nephew said it was a pretty complex system that most techs wouldn't understand."" 

I then made the mistake of telling the guy that his nephew was screwing him, just in a nicer way.  This was met with instant hostility and I was asked to leave his house. Which I gladly did. I was actually a bit concerned for my safety at this point because I knew I was dealing with someone who was a few cards short of a full deck.

About a week later my phone rang with his number again. I let it go to voice mail. The message was basically berating me because his nephew had come over and had the computer fixed within 20 minutes and it only cost him $100.

I shot down to my local PD to talk to them to see if there was anything I could do. But the PD basically told me I was powerless. The guy didn't do anything directly to me and unless he specifically complains about being taken advantage of, they can't do anything. They knew who I was talking about, because they've done welfare checks on him in the past.

I tried to back track who he got my number from, to let them know his nephew was siphoning money out of him, while ruining his computer, but I couldn't find out how he got my number. Unfortunately everything I tried just ended up in a dead end. While I was there I sincerely wanted to take pictures of it, but I am pretty sure if I whipped out my phone and started taking pictures, this dude would have lost it.

So as far as I know, to this day, every time this guy boots his computer, it starts with him walking to his sink, turning on the water and then booting his computer. I highly doubt the computer is even actually running anymore. I've worked with elderly people and other questionable people in the past, but no one ever to this point. I now question people when they call me on how they got my number. That way I can at least back track for information a little bit.

TL;DR: Got a call from a client to fix a water cooled computer. ""Water cooled"" ended up being a teflon line running from his kitchen sink faucet, to his computer, the line looped twice inside the case and then ran back to his kitchen sink where it discharged. I was the idiot because I didn't know how to work on such a complex system.

I stumbled for a second, because this user has no real pressing need for a cloud based system.  The one they have in place is very new and works for their needs very well.  Therefore, the answer to her question is ""You don't need it."", but obviously I can't say that. 


 ""What?""

""*When are we moving to the cloud*?"", she repeated.

""Your systems are roughly a year old, they are working very well.  Is there a reason a cloud based solution has been recommended?""

""*Well, no, but 'name of boss' read about it and decided we should get it. He wants to know how soon it can be up and running.*""


Keep in mind, her ""boss"" is not my boss, or even very high on the food chain at the site.  Mid-level management at best.

I basically ended up telling her that we'd discuss it at our IT Review coming up.  Turns out, he had read an article on ""the cloud"" and decided, ""that's new, we need that"" and then told his secretary to ask me how soon I can make it happen.  Even though none of that is his decision to make.

It was March 31st 2010 around 8:45pm PST. I thought it'd be a good idea to create a subreddit called /r/administrators. I planned on using the subreddit to post about my own tales from tech support back before /r/talesfromtechsupport existed. So I happily created my new subreddit, wrote a small description and clicked the submit button. Voila, the new subreddit was now my own. Unfortunately for me, by the time I had finished creating the subreddit the time had ticked past 9pm PST, which means it was now April 1st on the East Coast of North America. April Fool’s Day.

As some of you may remember, the Reddit admins put on an April Fools prank in 2010 where they made it look like everyone was a moderator on all subreddits. Every user on reddit had the ability to edit and delete posts, ban users from subreddits, and have all of the powers that subreddit moderators had. Unbeknownst to me, it was now April Fool’s day and the Reddit prank was in full force.

After I had clicked the “create new /r/administrators subreddit” button… I suddenly had moderator powers over all of reddit. I was ecstatic! Somehow I had found a bug in reddit’s website code that had granted me administrator powers throughout the entire site! Oh the power I now had! I quickly resolved that I would only use my powers for good, never for evil. I had to tell somebody about my new-found God powers on my favourite website. 

I called one of my co-workers who was also a redditor and explained to him what had happened . There was an long pause on the phone while he took it all in. Then with a chuckle said to me… “llnk, what day is it on the East Coast?”. My heart sank with the sudden realization that I had indeed just been April fooled. And that I had also made a fool of myself in front of my co-workers who would never let me forget it. *facepalm*

To my defense, like any overworked sysadmin on their off hours, I have had a few drinks to help calm my nerves from a stressful day. But still, that’s no excuse for an April Fools internet veteran like myself. Never again would I let my guard down on March 31st and April 1st. I won’t get fooled again!

The now former customer hands over his credit card hands shaking like crazy. LBH takes his time running the card, hands the receipt for signature over, staples the customers receipt to his work order, hands over the computer and says """"Hey. Have a great day!"".

Before she can be bothered to give any more information she's tearing into me because I've ""been there 4 or 5 times already and they keep having this problem and we're not paying for you to fix it this time"" etc etc. I check, and the guy that I replaced 10 months ago was there 3 times in one week over a year ago. She still doesn't believe me that I'm not him and have no idea what the recurring problem is, and hangs up expecting us to dispatch someone immediately. Sure enough, I get dispatched. No big deal, they're right in town.

I get in there and introduce myself as the copier guy, and she affirms that I'm not the guy who quit 10 months ago, but is still pissed that they can't scan ""again"". I put again in quotes because as stated it's been almost a 14 months since this last happened.

I set off on the normal troubleshooting routine, and the problem is immediately clear. The scan buttons are all mapped to static IPs, and the IPs don't match up with their scheme, which isn't even static anymore. Here is the conversation that followed:

Me: Did you guys have any changes to your network lately?

Her: Just fix the copier!

Me: No, I'm saying your network changes made it so the copier didn't know how to get back to your computer for scanning.

Her: Well [Name of our primary competitor]'s copiers don't need internet! That's absurd!

Semi-relevant side note: The copier in question is a small toner based desktop model that probably cost around $2k at the time of purchase.

Apparently she is just out of school, strapped with student debt, and this little mac is what she wanted and could afford. She saved for nearly 6 months and waited for the new ones to come out and jumped on the purchase. I'm really starting to feel for her here, I've got educators all in my family so I *KNOW* teachers get paid for shit. I should point out that policy at the time did not cover accidental damage. I struggled to find SOMETHING we could do for her. 

Me: I've got some time coming up for lunch, I want to try and recover data (also something we didn't do, but this was undiscovered country for me)
her: OMG thank you my life is on that (it always is!!)

Still not satisfied with the solution, I find our regional manager on the phone, get her to approve a SWAP out. I then proceed to pull the SATA drive from her campbells cup 'o' laptop and place it on a spare drive dock. Grab an ultimate white macbook, whatever that was at the time, and I proceed to flash her data via firewire transfer mode (target mode).

Customer comes back, I start telling her that something went strange with the data transfer, I need her to look things over first. I bring out her new macbook but she doesn't know it is hers and likely figured it was one of ours for previewing data. She looks it over and, satisfied that her data is at least safe, says ""Great! I gotta run to best buy and get a hard drive to back this up to."" I recommended she go anywhere else to buy an external drive since my store was pricey for accessories. anyway...

I close the lid, put everything back in the box and hand it to her.

**KERNEL PANIC - NOT SYNCING: FATAL ERROR IN NEUROTOXIN DEPLOYMENT**

**REBOOTING...**

Hello again, TFTS!

It has been a while, hasn't it? 

Today's story is simple, relaxing, and humorous, and details exactly what to do when your vendors refuse to replace equipment under warranty... or at least what I'D do.

- - -

LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN

- - -

The afternoon was boiling. Patton used to joke about renting out Texas and living in hell, as hell would be cooler - he wasn't kidding. It was a crispifying 90+ outside, and it was only early May.

Fortunately, I and my support staff were inside a specialty clinic we were rolling medical record software to, so we were nice and cool, and our coffee supply was flowing freely. When you have a conference room with a HUGE dark wood executive boardroom-style table and really comfy leather chairs and overhead lights with a dimmer switch at your disposal, you REALLY want to base your operations out of there, you know?

I'd just fired up a few tabs in Firefox with several subscribed subreddits for a fine, productive afternoon of dicking around, and I'd had a bottle of Sodastreamed diet Red Bull next to me, when one of the RNs (registered nurses) walked into the conference room where we were and looked expectantly in our direction.

""Um, Jack? We have a bit of a problem with a printer down at one of our nurse pods downstairs.""

Now, normally, I'll tell users to cram it with walnuts and to go to the helpdesk, then idly entertain fantasies of flipping a table at them, but today I was feeling... uncharacteristically altruistic, for some reason (I think the caffeine did it), so I thought what the hell.

I motioned for her to tell me what was going on, and she related a problem that involved the printer jamming - repeatedly - and being a royal pain to clear. Now, mind you, we're an all-Dell shop here, and Dell stuff is usually pretty easy to clean / repair, but this particular model of printer... well, the Oatmeal was right when they said printers were sent from hell.

This particular one, a Dell m5200, was well-known to the field techs that serviced that location regularly. One who I worked with occasionally sent me a ticket history for the past six years (out of warranty from Dell, but not from our printer service company, oddly enough) for that printer, and the logs on it were longer than a /r/politics thread about Michele Bachmann. After reading only a few of them - 75% of which were for it not being able to be cleared when paper got jammed in it, about 15% were for it spewing out extra sheets of paper, and 10% were for miscellaneous problems - I had but one reaction.

&gt;bertstare.gif

Now, as this printer was at a pod where nurses and clinical assistants sat - and were expected to give patient progress notes to the patients before they left - its malfunctioning directly impacted patient care. That's a HUGE red flag for me, and for most people in healthcare IT.

I got one of the printer techs (we'd outsourced printer repair to a major printer / MFD / copier company within the past year) on the phone, bypassing the helpdesk, and was told ""no, you can't have a hotswap, this isn't a hospital facility, so it's not directly affecting immediate patient care.""

&gt;bitchplease.jpg

""I'm onsite right now and it's completely nonfunctional. We're supposed to pass these progress notes out to a patient as they leave. You're telling me that THAT isn't stopping us? That's a workflow stoppage right there.""

The tech groaned and grumbled.

""FINE. I'll see if I can get out there tomorrow to fix it.""

After a bit of finagling with his boss, I had him out there that afternoon, and he had it fixed after clearing stuck paper from pretty much the entire printing path on it. Right after he put it back together and reconnected it to the network, queued jobs started spewing off, and - OF COURSE - right after he left, the printer jammed dead shut again.

A quick stroll down to the elevators resulted in my pulling him back in and having him fix it again.

""Look, this thing's nearly six years old. It's obviously out of warranty by Dell, there's no way we can keep using this and expect it to function reliably on a long-term basis, let alone for parts to be available if - when - it dies again. It's no Laserjet 4. Seriously, can we get a replacement, preferably within the week, or at least a hotswap to tide us over until you all can fix this to a point where it doesn't suck like a Sears Shop Vac?""

""Nope, sorry. It has to be completely effed before we'll replace it, and this thing doesn't even remotely qualify. Sure, it jams on occasion, but what printer doesn't?""

""This thing has spent more time down than up! It's the printer equivalent of a hamplanet in a scooter! If it was working even half the time, we'd give it a pension and benefits, but this thing's the surly hired-on boss's son who screws up everything it touches and somehow gets a pass because it's been here for twenty years on and off!""

""... Has anyone ever told you you're not really that good at analogies?""

""... just fix the bloody printer.""

The next morning, the practice manager came up to the conference room - nearly catching me on /r/firefly (read: /R/GENTLEMENBONERS) - and in no uncertain terms told me that the printer had jammed again and she wanted it dealt with. She also stated that she knew it wasn't part of the rollout we were supposed to do, but she would count it as a personal favor, as the printer techs had stonewalled her for months over replacing it and she was tired of all the clinical staff complaining at her about it.

I told her that I would fix it out of hours that evening, and that it would have to wait until everyone was gone.

""I don't know if we can wait through a whole day. Seriously.""

""For this? You'll want to.""

Her suspicious look was well-rewarded as I went into a full-on Gendo Ikari pose, with my glasses catching the light from the dimly-lit lights over the conference room's table. Hey, I'm seated at the end of it, it's got dark wood and black leather, you HAVE to go for the dramatics sometimes.

""I have two words for you. Plausible deniability. Now, I strongly suggest that no one be here after eight tonight, and my fee for this is that your practice orders lunch for us techs today. Do this, and the printer will never trouble you again.""

She nodded, got up from her chair, and left.

That day, we had a very nice lunch catered in by a local bakery, one that makes a very excellent creme brulee French toast. The other techs and EMR analysts were effusive in thanking the practice manager for the delicious lunch, though over the table she and I exchanged glances, and we knew that the 30 pieces of silver had been spent; the hitman had his blood money, and the target would meet its untimely end.

A short time later, I descended the stairs to their suites, entered the comms closet, and retrieved their office toolbox and two cables, then returned to my table. Opening the toolbox, I found a pair of wire cutters and a box cutter, and in about fifteen minutes, I had a tool that would solve our problems. I returned the toolkit to the comms closet, and sat quietly, reading and playing Penny Arcade Adventures 3 on my phone until seven PM. The clinic was empty - not a soul was there, not even the cleaning people. I'd queued up a certain song on my phone when I left the conference room, and as I walked through the empty corridor inside the clinic, the strains of the 1812 Overture serenaded me with but a hint of the potential of what was to come.

I reached the printer and couldn't resist.

""In the name of Gerald of the department of information services, vice-president of the ministry and overseer of all that we provide within the realm, I, Jack, of the department of information services, Bastard Operator from Hell, lord of the cubefarm, do sentence you to die.""

My hand descended into the pouch on my belt, and withdrew the means to the end - a device which makes all electronics tremble, for precious little can shield against it, and to use it guarantees instant death.

[It was an Etherkiller, built for US three-prong outlets, and just as lethal as the chair.](http://imgur.com/7Mbx8yk)

Swift hands swapped the RJ-45 end into the printer's NIC, and the other end into a powered-off surge protector on the floor. The music was fast approaching a crescendo, and I knew the cannons would start soon.

""Does the condemned have anything to say before the sentence is carried out?""

The display, perhaps in one final act of defiance, flashed ""ERROR 202"" at me.

""So be it. May your creator have mercy on your soul.""

As the famous finale started, and the cannons went off, I flipped the switch, and with a swift pop, the printer was ended, its metaphorical bowels emptying as the smell of ozone flooded the room. As the cannons in the overture blasted, I flipped the surge protector on and off in time with them, and continuous popping started sounding from the printer's smoldering corpse - capacitors bursting, I assumed.

I shut down the surge protector, removed the Etherkiller, and filed a ticket with the helpdesk to have them replace the printer based on that it wouldn't power on at all.

- - -

THE NEXT MORNING (INSERT FFVII INN MUSIC HERE)

- - -

I was back at my desk at my cubicle in another building, about six miles away, enjoying a cup of coffee, and my desk phone rang. Caller ID showed that it was the printer tech calling from his desk phone, and with a grin, I picked up.

""Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyes?""

The tech's tone was frustrated and angry, and I had no doubt he had no idea what was going on.

""HOW DID THIS BREAK? IT WAS FINE WHEN I LEFT ON TUESDAY!""

""When I got back from getting dinner, there was a HUGE smell of ozone in the air. I know the smell of burned electronics - my house was hit by lightning when I was a kid - and the smell's pretty distinctive. I followed it to the printer, and when I got there, it reeked! I almost threw up! Anyway, I unplugged it and made a ticket with you all.""

""... I'm going to pick it up in fifteen minutes. Do you want a hotswap?"" He'd gone from angry to defeated in a quick turn of events, and with a smirk, I replied in the affirmative, then told him to call me when he gets there and I'd make the backend changes with the server team for the DHCP lease.

He did so, and when he got it back to his lair, he called back.

""What the hell happened to this? It's burnt! Every capacitor on the NIC has MELTED! ON BOTH SIDES! The NIC port has scorch marks on it! The entire motherboard is completely ruined!""

""Don't ask me, you're the printer repair guy. I just deal with systems and networks.""

""The network admin here -"" (and it should be noted that the field services guys used to repair printers before the new company took over; the guy who'd had to cover that clinic had gotten promoted in that time) "" - he said it could have been a misconfigured power over Ethernet port that blew it out, but... but... I just don't see how that could be possible!""

""You may have to go out there with a current tester and try that drop. I mean, PoE doesn't really have that much current... anyways, what are you able to do for them to get them up and running in the meantime?""

""We're ordering a new one. It'll be there in a week. They've got a hotswap, and that should hold until the new one gets there.""

""Really? Thanks! You know how it is when we can't get work done. Thanks for taking care of this for us!""

He hung up on me. I'd SWEAR I heard a muffled sob on the other end of the line, but eh. The clients were happy, the printer ended up being replaced, and the patients could get both their progress notes and any EMR-printed prescriptions that the doctors needed to give out (I'm looking at you, Metformin).

I turned to my phone and played a quiet, victorious game of Snake.

I just wanted to share a few of my stories. A little background about me, I'm a college student working at a Cellphone store selling phones and also helping customers with their new phone. I also fix people's computers for a small price for some extra cash. Here is a story that happened to me.

This one just happened recently. A customer walks in to the cellphone store and she looked furious. As she walks closer to the counter the strongest smell of all types of alcohol starts running through my nose and instantly gives me a headache. I knew this customer was gonna be trouble.

**Me:** Hello, welcome to *Cellcompany1* how can i help you?

**Customer:** I came to this store a few weeks ago to buy a new phone and it ain't working.

**Me:** Oh, what is wrong with it?

**Customer:** I just said it no work you stupid!

**Me:** Well.. do you have the phone with you?

Customer pulls out an OLD phone out of her pocket and flips it open and starts mashing on all the buttons.

**Customer:** SEE! it not work. I WANT REFUND.

By this time I was ready to punch this woman in the face, because first of all, she was speaking like I could not understand any English. Second, the phone she pulled out is old and hasn't been sold in stores for about 8 years. Last, the phone was not even from our company. But I had to be nice.

**Me:** Ma'am, this phone is really old and I'm pretty sure you did not buy it a couple of weeks ago from our store, because this is from *Cellcompany2* and not from our company, *Cellcompany1*. We don't sell these kinds of phones

**Customer:** YES I DID, I BOUGHT IT HERE! LIKE 2 WEEKS AGO. I EVEN HAVE THE RECEIPT FOR IT! (Pulls out a wrinkled Walmart receipt and slams it on the counter).

**Me:** Ma'am, that's a walmart receipt, but if your phone is not working I can try to help you fix it.

**Customer:** No I WANT REFUND. I WANT MY 300$ BACK! YOU STUPID ASIANS BEING GREEDY. Blah blah blah ssj3 Ragemode activated.


I started to get really angry too, only because I cannot tolerate racism. But what I did instead was tell my co-worker to call the cops without her noticing. They got here in about 2 minutes because there is a police station nearby. They took her away for being drunk in public and biting the police officer. They dragged her away and I could finally breathe from the alcohol reeking from her body. She left her ""NO WORKING"" phone on the counter. I picked it up and tried to fiddle with it because i was curious to what was wrong with it.

I was checking my reddit inbox and reading some suggestions with how to deal with the demon receptionist from the seventh floor of hell. 

Today I was nice:

Receptionist: Hey X, I'm having trouble seeing a document, can you come and help.

Me: Yeah, sure thing.

*Walk over to her desk and see an 'Access denied' message on a sharepoint document.

Me: Oh, I see. What document are you trying to see? 

Receptionist: Nothing special, I just need it to work.

Me: Sure thing, can you send me a link to the document please?

Receptionist: No, I've lost it. 

*I can see a filename and web address written on a post-it note on her desk, and I jot it down in my notepad*.

Me: Not a problem, let me see if I can get you access to the file.

Receptionist: Thanks.

*Back at my desk, checking what the file was. Turns out she was trying to access her husbands previous paycheck (assumption of filename, GW Payroll July), god only knows where she found the link for it. Back to her desk we go.*

Me: Hello. I've found out what the problem is. The file you are trying to access isn't allowed to be accessed from your department, only from finance, and I can't view it myself either.

Receptionist: But you can give me permission to see it, right?

Me: Yes, and no. I can give permission, but it would be invasion of privacy and a security breach. I'd be in trouble, and I cannot give permissions, sorry.

Receptionist: It is really important that I see this document, it is for my work.

Me: Unfortunately, I am unable to give permissions. If it is for your work, you can contact finance department and they can contact me. As far as I understand, your account allows all access to the files you need.

Receptionist: This is stupid, this is why you should have given me administrator access.

Me: Uhmmm...

Receptionist: I shouldn't need to ask to see company files. I work here.

Me: Hey, but...

Receptionist. You should just do your job. You are the computer guy, go do the computer stuff so I can do my job.

*That feel of rage, but advised to be subtle*.

Me: I understand that your job can be difficult, and mine can be too. For this reason I will need to contact Mr.Boss and speak with him about granting access for you. I'll happily oblige.

Receptionist: That isn't necessary, just click on my name and click ok. That's all you need to do.

*Her manager is walking past*.

Me: Hey derp, can you help us.

Derp: Sure. 

Me: Receptionist is having a problem here, she can explain it a little for you.

Receptionist: I don't have access to a file.

Derp: Oh, ok. X can simply fix it, right?

Me: I sure can. Let me go back to my desk and allow her access to the finance documents so she can view anyones payroll whenever she pleases. 

Derp: Wait, what?

Me: Receptionist, your husbands payroll document will be working for you in around 5 minutes when the server adjust to the changes (i lied, it changes instantly) so you will have to wait until then. Also, while Derp is here, can we book a time so we can speak about the Administrator privileges you need?

*Derp glaring at the Receptionist*

Me: I'm free after 2pm. Is that good for you?

*Receptionist with mouth open in shock*.

Derp: Yes, 2.30pm would be ideal. Receptionist husband should be present also.

And boom went the dynamite. Fellow redditors were a bit annoyed with me for calling her ""Just a fucking receptionist"". 

If that was bad, was this win? I won't be posting what we speak about in entirety, but the outcome will be posted.

We often get calls about people being unable to connect to the VPN, most of the time it is ""Hey it says I need to install *VPN Software*. Should I do that?""

Guy calls up frantically reporting that his workstation won't launch an excel file and that he needs to be able to use this excel file. ""Oh now I just launched Internet Explorer and that isn't coming up either, I sent the excel file to a coworker and he was able to open it fine.""

About then I'm pretty pumped, this dude actually tried to troubleshoot his problem before calling... this pretty much never happens. So I remote to his machine, and low and behold both Excel and Internet Explorer are visible, and immediately his problem makes sense to me. 

""Sir, please press the power button on your right hand monitor""

I can be passive-aggressive too!,1468,388,247,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/xm0tl/hey_i_can_be_passiveaggressive_too/,"I hold a summer job at a national retailer that does computer and electronic support on the side. We also have a couple service centers that we can ship stuff to in the event that something needs replaced we aren't capable of doing on site.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Yesterday I had a customer come into the store and approach me while I was working with another. As I finished up, I made eye contact with her and politely advised ""I will be with you in just a moment, ma'am"", her response was ""You'd better."" with a stern 'matter-of-fact' look in her eyes. I just smiled and nodded at her without missing a beat (I have nearly 10 years of experience in technical support with much more 'official' job titles before going back to school, and this is not the first time I have dealt with this kind of person, immediately knowing what would be required of me next).  
&amp;nbsp;  
When I was ready, I quickly changed face from my patented 'professional nerd' demeanor to my 'annoyingly nice' version, and approached her with the regular ""How can I help you?""  
""You need to fix this RIGHT."" again, matter-of-factly  
""Okay!"" I said, ""What seems to be the problem?""  
""Um, You guys sent this to your SERVER-center MONTHS ago and it has NEVER worked right. You said you would fix it and it took over a week to get it back and it STILL doesn't work. This was back in May and I haven't been able to bring it in because I am SO busy, but this has been such a major inconvenience for me because I am very busy and I need my computer and I think you guys need to compensate me for my all my wasted time... etc, etc, etc"" this went on for about 2 minutes or so.  
""Okay! What seems to be the problem?"" I repeated, exactly as before.  
""THE WIRELESS DOESN'T WORK!"" she exclaimed as if I was a fool for asking because this was clearly the only problem any computer could ever have. ""You CLAIMED to have replaced something before and even told me you tested it here before you called me which you CLEARLY didn't because it doesn't work and I've been forced to use my external wireless thing for months now and this is extremely unacceptable! I spent a lot of money here at _RETAILER NAME_ and I expect the things I buy to work!"" as if the amount of dollars spent was the only variable that determines the rate of component failure.  
On the outside, I continue to smile and nod as if everything she says is plated in gold; ""Well, I'm sorry to hear that! It sounds as if you've had quite the unfortunate turn of events! If you don't mind, let's take a look at the computer and see what we'll need to do to make this right for you!""  
&amp;nbsp;  
I did each of the following things without looking at her face. I grab her HP laptop, open it, and bring it out of sleep mode. Immediately, I notice a big red light on the F12 key next to a wireless icon (its the radio tower with waves coming off of it, pretty damn obvious, but I digress) which, when pressed turned green and immediately popped up a message saying ""connecting to XXXXX"" (proving that we DID in fact test in in store before) I opened her browser and connected to google.com. I looked up, without breaking character or batting an eye I said ""hmm, I seem to be connected to google, perhaps I wasn't listening... Did I misunderstand your problem?""  
&amp;nbsp;  
needless to say, the look on her face was priceless. She immediately changed her tone, but instead of apologizing said ""well if it's working now, I guess I'll just take it...""  
&amp;nbsp;  
Time for my revenge (I can be a devious little fuck). Without changing my tone from this perfectly innocent retail employee that would never harm a fly, I start playing ignorant as well. I say ""well, that can't be the problem, that was just the ON button for the wireless, I'm sure you tried that before didn't you?""  
""no, no I didn't""  
""...oh, really? Well that explains it then. It turns itself off to save battery life.""  
""I didn't know that""  
""Well, I suppose we all learn something every day! So from now on I suppose I'd recommend checking to make sure that it is turned ON before using it!""

He loads up a YouTube video, let it buffer and plays it. No stuttering. So he picks up the laptop and starts angeling in all sorts of directions, activating the HDD security.

[I could handle him](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/w4fwu/angry_clueless_you_have_met_your_match/), and [I was his only contact at our company](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/w54za/phil_2_electric_boogaloo/).

Most of his calls were still entirely outside our support boundries; he had a horrible time with printers, scanners, fax machines, and at one point his fridge that he was *sure* was Internet related.  Every time, I came down with the same firm response of 'Nope, we don't help with that.  Our stuff works, here's the number to talk to.'

I remember a few issues that I actually did help him with, but they were exceptionally few and far between.

Once, he'd manually renewed his domain through a 3rd party (saving himself $10 or so on our renewal fee), and he'd then given them incorrect pointer info, hosing his domain horribly in the process.  I did the expeditious thing and just took responsibility on that one; got the phone number for his support company, and 3-wayed him and myself in with them.  Phil verified security, and then handed off to me.  I efficiently listed off the A and MX records we needed, the other tech made the change, and we were done in less than 5 minutes...  I then took 15 minutes to explain to Phil how he's now waiting 48 hours for it to propagate down.  This set him off a bit, but I countered with the fact that he wanted to save the $10 and take all of it away from us, and that was fine, but that's what he'd have to deal with.  It shut him up, quick.

Another time, he installed AOL and hosed himself.  It was an older version that would bind itself up in weird and interesting ways to the various network adapters, causing no end to headaches for connecting with anything other than AOL.  I again explained to him that I could make XYZ work, but he was on his own with AOL, and if it happened again, we'd just keep breaking AOL to make XYZ work; if he wanted better, talk to AOL or ditch them.

This got frustrating to Phil.  He couldn't have his rousing hour-long bitch-fests in which he'd make people cry; or make people question the life choices that lead them inexorably to dealing with their lord and master, Phil.  Basically, I wasn't 'fun' to call, because I had the answers, and the process down to an art.

So, once the shiny of 'having my own tech to abuse' wore off, he started calling the general helpline again.  Usually, after being told to take his printer problem elsewhere from me.  There was a big flag on the account indicating that he didn't get support from anyone but me, and sometimes he just found himself cold-transferred to either my voice mail or to my line if I was in.  That was perfectly fine by me, not to Phil of course, who'd just hang up when he herd my voice and re-call the main line.  I knew it was him, though, as our Caller ID system was sweet in that it kept original data through cold transfers.  I'd just make a note that he'd called and hung up.

After a time, though, he would badger someone else on the helpline long enough to get them sucked into a call with him.  I'd gotten few, if any actual calls from him lately.  At first I chalked it up to 'Oh, I finally clue-sticked him into understanding', but upon checking his account, I saw other tech's logs popping up, at weird hours when I was out of the office.

Thing is, they knew they were supposed to dump him on me.  They knew they were supposed to not help him in any way.  But, there it was, plain as day.  *sigh*

I mentioned this to my supervisor, and he did his best to put a stop to it.  E-mails, coaching cube-side with the other agents, etc.  It was brought up at our monthly meeting, in fact (all techs for 2 hours in 1 room to go over general things like this, while Tier2 took calls directly); and stated in no uncertain terms that Phil doesn't get help from us, you dump him on this extension.  Period.

It helped little.  Many of you who've worked in tech know there's always a few low-hanging fruits in the group that just drag everyone else down.  When you have 75+ agents, it's bound to happen.  As good as management was about weeding these people out, they still managed to hang on, thanks to a corporate environment.

Of course, Phil pushes and pushes, and I have to give him credit where credit's due; he'd manage to suck a good number of people into his little game of 'make the tech rip their hair out'.  Eventually, he'd not call me anymore, because he found it much more fun to scream at the brick wall, or attempt the fun whack-a-mole game of finding the one bad (or poorly informed) tech to torment.

He got one, eventually.  She was a new-ish hire, so I can't blame her entirely.  On the floor for 2 weeks, and now reduced to a puddle of tears in the middle of the isle.  She quit that day.  I knew what happened even before I'd been told directly, and I was furious.  I felt like I had personally let her down (regardless of the fact that she didn't heed the rather interesting special note and popup that his account generated... the only account that, when you pulled it up, would also pop a full-screen bright red box with 40pt white type that told you to direct the customer to me and not help them).

The next day, my supervisor called me into an unused meeting room 1 floor up.  I was greeted by the director of the help desk, the lead Tier2 agent, the telecom hardware director, and the system administrator (who managed the webhosting servers/email servers/etc).  I'd met all these people, and they were really decent folk; but I'll be honest, I figured they'd decided to blame me for the whole Phil situation that happened the day before to that poor girl, and I was getting the axe.

Another person in expensive suit and tie walked in, and I was introduced to the CIO of XYZ, Incorporated.  Fuck.

They started out asking how I felt about the whole situation.  They all knew I wasn't one to pull punches, that I was very blunt, and when cornered, rather crass.

I believe the first thing I said to this meeting of the big-wigs was ""From what I can tell of the people gathered here today, I'm the lucky fuck who gets to have this shit storm hung around his neck, and you intend to each take an arm to make sure I land squarely under the bus?""  I ooze class when I'm cornered, I admit it.

Deafening silence ensues.  It lasts a good few minutes.  I take stock of the faces in the room from my little tirade; the systems guys are eyes wide, but bemused.  The CIO is slack-jawed (I don't think he's herd such an honest/crass combo before, cool).  My floor supervisor is hiding his mouth in his hands, attempting not to show his laugh.  Meh.  Let the fireworks begin, I'm going down with a bang, not a whimper in this one, I've decided.

The system administrator pipes up ""Umm... Actually... No.  But, I can see how it'll look that way.""  
""Well, that's all fine and dandy, could you clue me in before I go ahead and shoot my other foot, then?""  

This got a laugh out of my floor supervisor, and the tensions eased considerably.  The CIO cracked a smile, as well.

""Since you appear to appreciate bluntness, I'll return it in kind,"" the CIO said.  ""You're not fired.  We are, on the other hand, attempting to decide what to do about Phil.""  
""Since I'm not fired, and all these people are here, and you all know what Phil has done, I'd say it's pretty obvious 'what to do about Phil'.  He doesn't have more than a few thousand dollars a year in profit for this company, yet he's monopolized my time, and made a rather sweet new girl quit.  He is a horrible person, and should be kicked to the curb.""  Why sugar coat the obvious.

""That was our thought, too,"" began the telecom director.  ""But, we figured we'd try one other option.  Would you consider going 'on call' for Phil?  As in, we'd route his calls to a cell phone that you'd have 24/7.""  
""That depends, how big of a raise are you offering me to go with that?""

Everyone has their price, even me.  I'll deal with Phil 24/7, but it's not going to be cheap.

""Well, we wouldn't be able to bump your paygrade..."" began my floor supervisor.  
I cut him off.  ""Then that's not happening, is it.""

This illicited a chuckle from the CIO.  ""I like you, right to the point and honest.  But, you are going to make the call to Phil to tell him we're giving him the boot.""  
""After what happened yesterday, I'd be a little pissed if you didn't give that to me, considering.""

And so it came to pass.  A registered, signature required special delivery went out that very day, containing a legally-drawn up end-of-service notice.  I was given the tracking number, and watched it like a hawk.  I knew when it was signed for, and I even had a little digital copy of Phil's signature to prove it.  I gave him a half hour to read it, then called him up.

Me: This is SilentDis from XYZ support calling.  Is Phil available?  
Phil: Um... this, this is Phil. (He sounds... hurt.  How touching.)  
Me: Phil, I am calling on behalf of XYZ to confirm the contents of the letter you signed for half an hour ago.  We are terminating any and all services you have with us, due to the abusive nature of your calls.  Do you understand?  
Phil: You can't do this!  I pay my bills on time, why would you do this?  Do you know how much money you'll lose every month?  

This little tirade continues for a good 5 minutes.  It's normal Phil, though.  A little pop-up appears in the corner of my screen from my on-floor supervisor.  Apparently, 3/4 of the help desk, and much of the upper management is currently listening in.  I respond back ""fuck you, I don't want a goddamn audience"" which earns me a distant guffaw from over the cubicle farm.  I mute myself as he's continuing to rant and shout ""Don't you people have anything better to do?""  A chorus of chuckles and ""No!"" rings back.

Phil eventually runs out of steam on his rant.  He's not switched to legal threats yet, as that was never his way, amazingly enough.

Me: Phil, this is exactly why we're terminating our services with you.  You are abusive, you are rude, and you do not listen.  You cost us in man-hours more than what we make from the services we provide.  To top it off, you made a rather nice person quit her job after 2 weeks.  XYZ has decided that you are a liability to provide service to, rather than any sort of benefit.  Your service will terminate tomorrow at midnight.  At that time, we will make a final copy of your website, and of any e-mail sitting on our servers, burn it to CD, and send it to you via the same carrier we used to deliver the notice you received today.  I would still recommend backing it up yourself.""  
Phil: ""I don't know how to do that, I shouldn't have to!  This isn't...""  
Me: ""Phil, it is right, it is fair.  We, as a company, simply no longer wish to do business with you.  It's fine if you do not know how to backup your site, we're doing it for you anyway, and you'll get the CD in the mail.  Please understand, we will no longer help you with anything going forward, calls to this number will go unanswered, and we will not sell new service to you.  This call isn't to help you with anything, it's simply to inform you.  Good day.""  
Phil:  (he actually managed to respond just before I pushed release.  very meekly) ""Yeah, bye.""

For this tale I am going to call him Bob. 

Bob is a good guy except he believes he is a tech genius and that my job could be done by trained rabbits. Now I am going to have to back into this story a bit, so hold with me. 

A year ago I was able to get a grant and put new computers into every classroom in my school. (I am a teacher and a tech support) Every classroom either received laptops or really nice desktops. Now installing this computers was no issue, and in every classroom they have  worked with limited upkeep from me for a year. All of them except Bob's computers. 

Over the last year, I have had Bob do a ""emergency reformat"" on his own computers because he thought he had a virus. It was windows security essentials. He did the reformat and half way turned the computers off and tried to boot in the morning. So i come into work the next day with my boss yelling and freaking out that I have to go look at Bob's computers because nothing at all is working. 

I have witnessed as he has attempted to installed (Did not know at the time how he was doing this because he did not have permissions) different software that dates back to the windows ME timeline, because he must have the software because he used it last time he had computers. This again ended with him attempting to a emergency recovery of the computers. So the next day I walk in to my boss yelling that I have to go down and look at Bob's computers because nothing is working. 

For the networking cables that run behind the computers, he has cut the ends of them off because he thought they did not look good. He has also rewired his classroom by himself at night, and taken every cable hooked from my switch to the computer and feed it back into the switch. Did not end well for my switch and as  I walked in I received the all too familiar yelling that I had to go look at Bob's computers. 

But this summer took the cake, and I finally had enough of Bob and proceeded to do a bit of yelling myself. At the end of the spring semester Bob's unhooked his computers for storage. I had told him to leave everything alone so that I could clean up and do a bit of routine maintenance on his machines while he was gone for two months. He refused to listen. Well I thought to myself, at least he just packed up the computers, it will not take me that long to re hook everything and do the maintenance. No such luck. 

I finally was able to get down to Bob's classroom and all the computers were still connected, but there was no power going to the room. Bob had turned off the power breakers, so nobody could use his classroom. Not a big deal, but pain in the ass. I turn the breakers on and started the machines. The first machine I went to I tried to use the mouse and nothing, tried to use the keyboard and nothing. Checked the back of the tower and everything was connected and the board and mouse both had power going to them. Thought maybe they just did not recognize at first. Tech support 101, I restarted my computer. Same problem. So I decided to unplug the mouse and keyboard and replug them to see if they recognize. Sure enough familiar ping and new hardware installed correctly. 

My mind was boggled, so I pulled the mouse out again and started to switch it with another mouse, when it hit me. He had cross wired all the computers. So the mice and keyboard in front of a computer were all tied to different computers. I was furious and dumbfounded. What purpose could this have possible served. So I bite my tongue and rewire the classroom, and since I have seen this, I check my switch. Sure enough he has wired all of the network cables from the back of the towers to each other, and the computers on the end were tied back into the switch. Creating this giant loop of network cable ling that was tied and cut to make it ""good looking"". 

It was here that my mind started to explode, I had already dealt with this exact same ridiculousness once and yelled at him and he has done it a second time. Once I was able to get everything redone, new cables run and all the computers up and running it was time to leave. Now remember this is summer break, and Bob is supposed to be gone for two months. Nobody was to be in that room, it was locked up. Well I had to go on a business trip so I was going to finished updating and cleaning his computers once I got back. 

Then I went in yesterday. HE HAD DONE IT AGAIN! Every computer was cross wired. He had clipped the ends of the network cables, and turned it into a giant loop ring network. He had flipped the breaker and taken all the mice from the computers so that I had no mice. When I walked into the classroom blood poured from my nose and ears. Steam rolled from my eyeballs and I screamed the profanities of a thousand sailors. 

Bob no longer has computers. Apparently I was the only It guy willing to deal with Bob, and since I have made it perfectly clear that I am willing to put him out of his misery. The administration has chosen to remove his technology. He doesn't even get a teacher desktop.

As usual, all conversations are somewhat paraphrased and all names anonymized to protect the guilty...



Rather surprisingly, Monday last week I was asked if I could prepare some laptops for a conference that would be going on today. This came as a shock, because what normally happens is someone rocks up at my office first thing in the morning and says ""I'm just off to a conference now, and I need a laptop to take with me, can I have one please?"" which leads to the inevitable ""No, you can't, because you didn't give us any notice and they're all on loan to other people."" and then someone going away in a huff and complaining about how unhelpful IT are. 

This time however the brief was remarkably clear. We need 4 laptops, running linux, with all the departmental software that has been purchased by our research group installed.

Ok, so, actually, that's a bit cheeky, because the research groups have their own laptops they they've paid for and _demanded_ root access to, and are therefore meant to manage themselves. However, since they'd actually given me a whole weeks notice I decided to be nice and set up their machines for them.

This was a mistake. 

*""What software do you have licensed for your group?""*
*""I don't know.""*
*""Ok, what software do you _need_ for this conference?""*
*""I don't know.""*
*""Right, well, in that case, I'll do a default install and can you please get back to me if there's anything above and beyond that that you need?""*
*""That sounds great, thankyou!""*

So off I go, do the install, then call back on Tuesday. 

*""So, the machines are ready... can you just give me the licence keys for any additional software you need? I'll hunt down the install packages.""*
*""I don't know what software we have licensed.""*
*""OK... do you know who does?""*
*""I don't know.""*
/sigh. 
*""I'll call around.""*

So I called around a few members of staff and finally managed to track down all the things that they'd ordered through purchasing, and one thing that we happened to have a couple of keys for that they'd _not_ officially paid for through the department, but must have gotten from somewhere else. Installed all of that, and took the machines back Wednesday afternoon. Whilst I was there asked them to do one thing: 

*""Could you please find someone who's actually going to this conference and get them to check that everything they need is installed on here before they leave?""*
*""I don't know who's going.""*
*""Well... find out and get them to check, ok?""*
*""Ok.""*

Fade to this morning...

11.45, the phone rings.

*""Oh, hey, it's [person] from the conference group... [software] isn't installed on this laptop, and I need it for a presentation someone is giving at 2.""*
*""Ok... did you not check the laptop before taking it there like I asked you too last week?""*
*""Um... I don't know.""*
*""Do you have a licence for [software]?""*
*""I don't know.""*

At this point I'm wondering if there's anything they do know... like perhaps what day it is, or what their name might be.

*""Ok, well, as far as I can tell you don't actually _own_ [software] so it's not been installed.""*
*""I'm sure we do, we use it in the department all the time.""*
*""Yes, the _department_ owns that, but you're not _in_ the department right now, and even if you were, we don't manage those laptops, you do. You insisted on it. As I explained to you last week, those machines are stand alone, and you need a stand alone licence. That's why I asked you what licences you have. We've been through this. Who handles licencing for your group?""*
*""I don't know.""*
*""Find. Out.""*

...but I'm feeling pretty good natured this morning, and the staff room coffee is doing sterling work, so I decided to have a look-see if I could find out for her. Turns out I can. Attached to a ticket in the RT queue from 2009, repeated in 2010 AND 2011, cc'd to this very person is the following. ""You can generate licence keys for [software] by going to [website] and entering your email address and the following [code]. DO NOT LET [person responsible for licencing] lose them, like they did last time. AND THE TIME BEFORE.""

I forwarded this on to the user out at the conference site, and 5 minutes later the phone rang...

*""I got your email... I don't remember doing any of this before... [person responsible for licencing] says they've not done it either.""*

Really? seems unlikely, given that you replied to the email in RT, and in fact have done so every year for the last 4 years... but let's try and be polite.

*""Well, regardless, that's what you need to do. When you get the new keys they'll come with a link to the software download and you can install it yourself.""*
*""Oh, is it not already installed?""*

...give me strength. 

*""No. Please follow the instructions on the website.""*

...an hour passes. The phone rings again.

*""[person responsible for licencing] says they've been trying this for an hour and it doesn't work. Help!""*
*""Have they followed the instructions on the website that I sent?""*
*""I don't know. Can I just bring the machines back in? I'm only a 10 minute drive away.""*

...ok, it's like that then. I know I shouldn't do this, but Alright, lets do it. 

*""Sure, ok, bring them back, and I'll test the licence generating thing whilst you're on your way.""*

Which I did. And it works. Perfectly. There is however a proviso, waiting in the thankyou text. ""Please note that new keys will take 24 hours to come into force."" So, they're screwed either way with that one. But hey, this means I don't have to go through the teeth pulling process of finding out how many steps in the software licencing procedure she doesn't know about. Instead, we'll just install the network licensed copy, set up a VPN so the machines think they're still here, and everything'll be good, right?

So she shows up, I tell her what I'm going to do, she agrees that it's a good idea, and I get to work. In the mean time, could she please tell me who's going to use the machines so I can pre-configure the VPN connection for them? 

*""Um... I don't know.""*
*""Right, in that case I'll set them all to authenticate as you, ok? Are you registered for remote access?""*
*""I don't know""*
*""Fine... I'll look it up. What's your username?""*

...take a guess what's coming next...

*""I don't know.""*

So, whilst the install is going on these machines I'm looking up her username, setting her up with remote access, configuring the VPN and with 15 minutes to spare before the 2pm presentation, she's good to go and taking them away again. Feeling pleased with myself both for a job well done, and not murdering her despite severe provocation, I go to lunch, like I should have an hour ago. 

I return from lunch to 5 missed calls. 

*""Help, [software] isn't working! It's saying it doesn't have a licence key!""*
*""Did you connect to the VPN like I showed you?""*
*""Oh, I just gave the laptops to the guys giving the presentation.""*
*""Did _they_ connect to the VPN like I showed you?""*
*""I don't know.""*
*""Ok... can you go get one of the machines and I'll talk you through it over the phone.""*

Which I then had to do. Four times. 

Honestly, I think it would have been easier for everyone if I'd just murdered her after all.

TL;DR: User doesn't know. User doesn't know anything.

I worked as a Apple tech at a reseller, basically hardware and software repair.

Someone brought in a laptop saying the classic informative 'not working'. it booted up fine, passed all the basic hardware checks, in perfect health. so the tech working on it called her up to ask for more details, and basically got told the same thing over and over (not working not working) with no elaboration despite his best efforts to get more details about the how its not working. he  ran some more intensive hardware checks for a few days. still fine.

Called her up again, finally got out of her what she meant. Apparently in Microsoft Word 2004 if you copy and past large sections of text, it beachballs for about 1 second (windows equivalent is the hourglass). we replicated it on the spot, and yes it literally only did it for a second, which seemed perfectly normal.

This is where it gets fun. After being told that its normal operation for it to do that, she lost it (over the phone still). Again as i was only a bystander to this im paraphrasing.

She decided that this 1 second freeze meant that the entire computer is faulty beyond use and she demanded a refund (despite not buying it from us). At this point the tech basically went into a 'please pick it up and leave us alone' tactic, heres some of the (paraphrased) lines i heard directly.

This one was bitter sweet, since in this case the 'bad guy' was quite awesome.

**Backstory, again:** Working tier 2 software tech support for an ecommerce payment company that works exclusively with higher education. Our department handles calls from university technicians and office workers, not students. We work with the same customers day to day, so we tend to develop ~~report~~ rapport and learn the quirks of our customers.


In this case, we got a call from a frantic bursar.


""Hey Sawser, does your guys software prevent someone from making repeated quick payments?""

""Uh, no Greg^fake , we don't. What's going on?"" 

""Well, it looks like we got close to 80,000 payments last night. Typically, we get around 300.""

So, I remoted into their system to check out log files, etc. Sure enough, they had roughly 85,000 individual transactions. Even better, they were roughly 10 cent payments, all to the same account.


A quick tutorial for those who aren't familiar with Credit Card merchants:
The merchant who takes your credit card generally pays a small flat rate per transaction, plus a few percentage points to a credit card processor. The rates change wildly based upon how much money your take in a month, if your system takes the ZIP code and CVV2 information, and if you negotiated your rates.
This school paid 9 cents + 2.75% per transaction. Which meant, every 10 cent transaction they took, they paid 9.002 cents to the credit card processor.

This student paid their $10k tuition payment in ten cent increments, but almost $9k went to the credit card processor in fees. **edit 2 update:** Since I clarified technical details below, I'll update this as well. 9k didn't actually go to the processor, it *would have* gone to the processor, had they settled the batch containing those transactions. 


After a few days of additional research, we found that what happened was a Computer Science student was screwed out of a class he needed, and was forced to wait an extra semester to graduate. This guy was not happy, so he wrote a bot to open up a few dozen windows and crank away making payments. He also told the university that Discover was having a promotion where for each payment he made, they entered him in a contest to win some big prize. I guess we can call that a win-win. The kicker? There wasn't any notices that bots weren't allowed, so he technically didn't abuse any of the systems and couldn't get in trouble.

We did write a script to refund all the transactions and put checks to make sure that multiple payments couldn't be made, but it just goes to show: Don't piss off computer guys.

In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if it was one of you bastards...

**EDIT:** To avoid confusion - we wrote a script to cause our software to ~~issue the ~85k transactions refunds~~ void the ~85k transactions. Thus, the money never left the student's account. 

In the end, the student's money was returned, no fees were paid to the processor, and the student paid his full tuition with a single payment (275.09 dollars to the credit card processor, I imagine). 

There wasn't any harm done, except a handful of sleepless nights in the Business office and a couple hours of a developers times to write the refund scripts. 


**EDIT 2:** I'm going to add more technical detail since this got bigger and because there are a few posts regarding the legality of what happened. I didn't elaborate on this before for simplicity, but it's become important. 

Credit Card payments occur in two steps:

1. The credit card is authorized - this is to ensure the money exists in your account, and when you look at your account balance and you see 'pending transactions', this is the state those transactions are in. The authorized amount hasn't been removed from the account but the money is frozen for 3-5 business days. 

2. The credit authorization is settled.  - this step removes the money from your account, and deposits it (minus processing fees) into the merchant's account. Generally, merchants are charged an additional fee per settlement - so settlements are grouped into batches. Thus, your authorizations may not be settled for 2 or 3 days, depending on the settlement habits of the merchant you paid. 

In this case, the school did *not* settle the transactions. Because there was no settlement, money had never changed hands. I used the term refund above for brevity, but in commerce speak, the transactions were actually voided. Because they were 'voided' and not 'refunded' and no money changed hands, the school was in the clear. 

It is not my intention to get anyone into trouble or embarrass the school.

One assignment was to make a simple database (basically payroll) for a company.  Of course they didn't have any database software, but they did have Excel.  However, The Boss ""didn't know Excel"" and had zero desire to learn it so I had to do it in Word.  Okay....


I then kludged a simple macro together for an input screen and made a simple-yet-does-the-job database in Word.  I then showed The Boss.

""Where is it?"" he asks.  I point to the icon of the file.  He clicks on it.  ""It isn't working!""

""You have to double-click on it.""

""That's too complex.  Make it so I only have to click once.""

I got up and phoned the temp agency and told them to take me off the assignment.

(well it wouldn't be the [first time](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/12nuft/the_colours_children_the_colours/)) Problem was described as ""I can't delete this file."" 

OK... well, how hard can it be?

* Select file, press delete. Nothing. 
* Right click -&gt; delete. Nothing.
* Check resource monitor to see if a process is holding the file open... No activity on that file. 
* Command prompt, navigate to file, del filename. cmd.exe crashes. 
* Open command prompt as admin, navigate to file, del filename. CMD hangs for a couple of minutes... explorer.exe crashes. 

Reboot, repeat...

No dice. 

Ok, so we'll reboot to safe mode.... Nope, safe mode is now gone by default.


* Modify boot process using bcdedit to re-enable safe mode... 
* Boot to safe mode... BSOD. 
* Modify boot process using bcdedit to enable safe mode ""command prompt only"".
* Boot to safe mode. Delete file. 

Windows 8... you have failed at the most basic task required from an OS. 

EDIT: 

Ok, so apparently I'm an idiot who didn't research why pressing F8 at boot time didn't do what I expected it to thoroughly enough and ended up with a massively over complicated solution to the ""Can't get into safe mode"" problem. I throw my hands up, guilty as charged on that one. 

That said, I still don't see why it wouldn't delete the damned file when I asked it to, and as for crashing out cmd.exe?

I don't remember any time when any variant of *nix just silently refused an rm -f with not so much as a ""Permission denied""... for that matter I can't remember any time that any previous version of windows has refused to do what it's damned well told when ordered to delete something from an admin level command prompt.

I get that shit happens, but error handling people, please! Don't just silently fail to do what was asked, throw me a goddamned bone here! Or at least a meaningful exception.

But he cbf, so I'm doing all the hard work of copy and paste. 

----------------------------------

I had a user that used to lie to me a lot.  She'd complain about her computer being slow or not performing the way that it was supposed to.  The company, for whatever dumb reason, gave users local admin rights so they could install anything they wanted.  We made them sign an agreement when they were issued a new machine stating that they would not install anything without our consent.  Of course the user kept on installing private software and a lot of it was full of malware/adware.  Everytime I would troubleshoot her computer I would see the stuff and uninstall and ask her where it came from.  She always said she didn't know.  

Finally I got fed up with it so I wrote her an email asking the same question and detailing all of what I'd had to uninstall.  She responded saying that she had no idea how the software was getting on her system.  I responded with a CC to my boss, her boss and facilities management, raising the alarm that our building obviously had some kind of security issues.  Someone must be coming in and logging in on her machine after hours and installing software.  

My boss figured out what I was doing and played along.  Her boss and facilities took the issue very seriously and were even talking about calling in the cops, or talking to the firm that hired the cleaning people.  Gradually it escalated until one of them finally thought to ask how the saboteurs were logging on if they didn't have a password.  I said ""good question. We should look through the logs and see who has been using the machine outside of business hours.""

Of course nobody had been.  Keep in mind that the user has reasserted several times that she doesn't know who has been doing the installs over the course of all of these meetins.  So I say that the only logical conclusion is that someone in the office must be doing it.  Now we call in HR because we might need to fire someone.

Finally the user breaks down and says that the installs may have been something that she did by accident.  Thing is that on top of all of the crappy tool bars etc., she had been installing paid applications from DVD.  That doesn't happen by accident.  Now her boss and everyone who hadn't already starts to figure out what has been going on, and how much time she has been wasting for them.

She was very good at what she did and specialized in getting doctor's offices set up and running all the software they needed, but also had other clients too. This is the story of one client who decided he didn't need to pay for her services.

My mom was always very meticulous about planning out networks, taking lots of time to draw up diagrams of how everything would work, even using floorplans of the buildings to develop her plans so that she could minimize downtime and usually get everything knocked out overnight, or over the weekend. I occasionally helped her with this by either running cables, installing workstations, updating software, or whatever.

Well, she got a job from a gentleman, drew up her plans, and got them to order all their gear. Everything arrives and she goes in and builds this guy's whole office network. Servers, workstations, cabling, the works. She gets everything set up and running nicely over the weekend.

I'll take this opportunity to say that she always left herself a remote access point to the network, so if anything arose, she could troubleshoot it from home. Businesses loved this because it meant that she could get to the problem much faster and wouldn't have to take the time to drive to their location and solve software issues. She didn't spend a *lot* of time building networks and instead spent most of her time maintaining and upgrading things, and spent a lot of time at home, so her response times were pretty quick.

Anywho, Monday rolls around and the office is open. Everybody gets to work and my mom calls the owner about collecting on his bill. Apparently at this time, the gentleman (used loosely) told her that ""she had already set up the network and now there's nothing she can do if he doesn't want to pay for it"".

Oh, how wrong he was.

She decided this would be an awesome time to remote log in to the server, disable all the user accounts aside from the admin account that only she had the password to, and then issue a force restart command to all the workstations. *While on the phone with the business owner*.

The guy freaks out when he realizes suddenly all of his employees are now sitting at desks with terminals that they can't log in to. Guess what? Nothing's getting done. The guy doesn't seem to realize what's going on and asks my mom if she can come down there and see what's going on with their computers, since nobody can log on.

Her response?

""If you don't want to pay me for the network, then you don't get to use the network. I'll enable everything again once I get a cashier's check from you. You can either mail it to me and wait a few days, or drive it to me. The choice is yours.""

Because we were just across the water from North Korea, we were constantly preparing for worst-case scenarios.  We call them ""exercises"" and they would typically last anywhere from a week to a month.  During an exercise, we would simulate a wartime environment.  We would have various simulated scenarios occur that we might see during an actual attack.  Unexploded mortars lying near the building; signs of chemical/nerve agent mist in the air; wounded victims lying in the streets; unauthorized people trying to talk/force their way into our secured facilities; etc.

One day during one of these exercises, our squadron commander, a Lieutenant Colonel (LtCol), showed up with a large plate of homemade chocolate chip cookies.  He came in early in the morning while the night shift was still working and he left the plate in the middle of the office where it would be highly visible.

He told the night shift not to eat any cookies and not to tell the day shift where they came from.  He then left.

Of course, the day shift comes in and instantly starts digging into the plate of cookies.  Nobody questioned their origin; most people assumed that someone's spouse delivered them.  Exercises are miserable times for us and sometimes spouses like to bring us baked goods to improve morale.

In the early afternoon, the LtCol returned to the helpdesk.  There are a couple cookies left on the plate.  He asks the room, ""Where did these cookies come from?""  No one had an answer for him.  Not a single person knew.

""Okay,"" he said, ""how about this.  Who's been eating these cookies?""  Every hand went up except for one low-ranking Airman.  This guy's rank was Airman (E-2).  This is typically the lowest rank you can have and not be in Basic Training or tech school.  So this guy was very young and brand-new.  Practically no experience and still learning his job.

""These cookies were poisoned,"" explained the LtCol.  ""Everyone who just raised their hand, you're now dead.  Go stand over in the corner.""  The whole room shuffled to one corner of the office and crowded around a large meeting room desk.  The lone Airman stayed put.

""You, Airman, are the highest-ranking person left.  So you're in charge of the entire helpdesk.  Good luck""  And then he turned to the crowd in the corner and told them, ""Remember: you're all dead so no talking and no helping the Airman out.  He's on his own, got it?""  Then he left.

That poor Airman ran the helpdesk by himself, in the middle of a stressful exercise, for a half hour before the LtCol returned and ""resurrected"" the whole office.

The moral of the story is not to touch any food that magically appears in your office.  If you don't know where it came from, keep it out of your mouth.

**TL;DR - LtCol secretly delivers ""poisoned"" cookies to the helpdesk during an exercise.  He ""killed off"" anyone who ate them (everyone except for one new guy).  He left that one guy in charge of all operations by himself for a very stressful half hour.**",,False,,t5_2sfg5,False,,tftsflair,True,t3_161g1p,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/161g1p/lieutenant_colonel_kills_off_the_helpdesk_to_make/,

The engineer comes back to me, doesn't understand how to use the new software at all. Fair enough, not everyone's an expert. So we find the original disk and I install AutoCAD 2004 back on there. And then he tells me that his wife needs me to install this archaic piece of software, Microsoft Greetings.

I discover it's incompatable with Windows 7 and actually breaks the OS and stops it from booting if you try to install it. So I recover Windows. Then I install Windows XP Mode, and install Microsoft Greetings on it. Flash forward about a week. I get a phone call.

""Jamie! My computer's not working! Everything has just disappeared!""

Hmm.. strange. I take a look and sure enough all the software I installed is gone.

So I reinstall it all. I took an educated guess that the engineer had accidentally uninstalled AutoCAD because he told me he ""installed"" it when I had already done so.

A week later. Same problem again.

He brings his laptop into the factory and I have another look at it, it's all vanished. I open up System Restore to see if I can go back without having to reinstalll everything again. I see a few interesting restore points... specifically ""Undo Restore"" points. I realise that System Restore has run. I also see that in between each restore a ""Critical Windows Update"" has been applied.

So at this point, I'm stumped. I spend a day thinking about it, and come to the conclusion that this update must have a bug which causes this specfic software configuration to roll back to the last restore point.

So I decide to do a full reformat/reinstall and load the backup and software back on.

Then tonight I get a call. ""Same problem again Jamie, this is getting ridiculous, it was working fine until you touched it blah blah blah"". I disable System Restore using Group Policy Editor to make sure it can't happen again.

So I do it ALL again. We're all finished and I tell them ""If it happens again I'm just going to call this laptop a goner and get you a new one. As a professional in this field, I am stumped.""

About 15 minutes ago I got a call. ""Jamie, my wife tells me she can't find system restore. She uses it every time she's finished on the computer for security.""

I really enjoy my job, and the work, although I loathe the company I work for..
I meet all sorts of interesting people and get in to some weird situations because of this job, but this one in particular has stuck with me.

A few months back I get a service call at an address, seems simple, just a faulty digital box so a 5 minute swap and I'm gone. 
Knock on the door and a small, fit elderly man answers. We talk a bit on the way to his living room, and I start swapping out the box. Old people like to talk, so I just nodded while I did my work. He starts talking about his recently deceased wife, how much he loved her, things like that. You get that a lot, it's best to listen but not seem too interested, because then they'll get teary-eyed and it gets REALLY awkward.
Turns out, he's been dealing with a rare blood cancer for 8 years. Every few months he gets a blood transfusion which slows the cancer down. It doesn't cure it, he's dying by inches, but he has a ways to go. His wife gets cancer 4 years ago and is gone in 3 years. 
I stopped working at this point to listen because...... Fuck.
He talked about meeting her for the first time, being married for 45+ year, she was the light of his life, his everything. No kids or anything, just her. You could hear how much he cared.... And then be said he hoped the cancer took him soon so he could go be with her, how he thought about trying to find a way to speed the process up.....
At this point I kind of wanted to remind him that I was just here to fix his cable.... What a hell of a thing to unload on a total stranger!!
As we were standing at the door saying goodbye I shook his hand (something I don't often do in this business, people are gross) and told him that I hoped whatever he wanted to happen happened as quickly as possible, and then I left.
I was a little upset as I drove away, that was a helluva love story to hear, and wrestled with telling someone what he'd said about speeding it up. In the end I kept quiet, told a few friends who thanked me for bumming them out, and hoped that he and his wife would be together, if there is an afterlife of course....

I'm not supposed to be support but as I have root, I end up doing a lot of the menial tasks so I had a look at it. 


It said [scratch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_space) was full, but it was Friday evening and not my job anyway so I pointed him to another server to work on and left it until Monday. Monday began with an email from UserJ to the whole user base saying ""I cant run anything on the cluster, not enough space. Maybe we should be investing in more space?"" (I'm not certain if she was referring to storage or RAM, but I'm not sure if she knows either).


So I went hunting. Our system is usually pretty full generally, but we've got 3.5T on scratch and it shouldn't be in that much use anyway as everyone has their plenty home storage. Discovered that the whole 3.5T was owned by one user (UserJ). Why she was doing all of her work on scratch I might never know, but I found large reference files (which would be of actual use) and two text files of 650Gb and 450Gb. Text files which I discovered contained millions upon millions of lines:
    ""Use of uninitialized value $filePath in string eq at program.pl line 19.


Turns out UserJ had been trying to run a script written about 6 years ago for small datasets on some new data without realising that it was throwing any errors. On top of that it appears out that she has turned nomadic, in that once full she moves the files to another area and runs it again, leaving digital detritus in her wake.


Result: rm -r and a passive-aggressive email reminding everyone not to just throw shit at the wall to see what sticks but think it through and check your outputs.

I used to work IT support/Helpdesk in the same bank my Dad worked at in London. Used to be a pretty sweet deal.

Now my father is a computer illiterate man. He knows how to do things he needs to do (his email, Word, Excel etc). When he is shown something he makes little notes to keep in an ordered little Rolodex. And yes, he has a card for logging in problems and how to save files. 

Now, we decided to give all users of a certain level and up a monitor upgrade, quite nice ones for the time (1080p in 08). He loved it, but like most users we let them put thier old monitor as a second one.

I am busy helping out some users with a room booking issues (moving kit from a double booked room), when my Boss gets a call from my Dad. 

Dad: ""The mouse disappears when i move it to the right"". 

Boss: ""Is it on the right hand screen?""

Dad: ""No, i've only got my pictures on the right hand screen.""

Boss: ""Is the monitor turned on?""

Dad: ""Yeah, the lights are on.""

Boss: ""One Second"".

It was at this point i ran into my Boss and we decided to tackle this together, not because it was a problem, but because my Dad is a lolsy troll of a bugger sometimes.

So we get to his desk, and he's sat there with a fresh coffee and a bemused ""oh deary me, what mischievous adventures i have"" grin on his face. We cruise over to his screen.

Anyone here knows the problem is that the mouse is moving over to the 2nd monitor and hes losing sight of it. But when we see the second monitor we understand why Dad can't see it. 

Boss: ""Dad (since i got to the office and used it, others started calling him ""Dad"" to take the piss), what have you done to your second monitor?!""

Dad: ""I put pictures on it, G-Man (other techie) said i could, i said i wouldnt use it for anything else, one monitor is fine. But G-Man said stick some pics on its background, so i did.""

I see it too. My Dad has Blu-tacced his family photos onto the screen of the monitor, then turned the monitor on for some nice backlit photography thing.

Boss cracks his ass laughing and calls G-Man over to see the results of his vague advice. Merriment is had, then my boss calmly starts taking the cables out of the back of the screen.

Dad: ""wait, i like my photos there!""

Boss: ""what?""

Dad: ""Theyre higher up, and i can just look over to them, its nice!""

Boss gives my Dad the ""Oh You!"" look and merely takes the cables away from my meddling Dad.

-----

This happened many, many moons ago.  If I had to guess, it was sometime between 2003 and 2005.

At the time, I was working helpdesk for an ISP that was growing from the 'local provider' level to a 'regional provider'.  They'd buy up ISPs here and there, and roll them into our service.  In all honesty, they were a very, very decent company; good tools access for all the techs, our 'Tier2' at the time was all of 20' away in the cubicle farm and very affable to talk to.  Tours of our main datacenter were always available, and the kit they were using was top-notch.  On top of that, it was all very, very well documented.

We had a caller whom I'll call Phil.  Phil had a DSL line through us (with a backup/on the road dial-up account), with a couple e-mail addresses, we managed a domain and small (exceptionally simple) webhosting account (little, if any scripting support).  It was rolled into a 'business-class' billing structure, of course; meaning that he paid a bit more and his webhost was on a slightly higher-end server from the ""5MiB Free"" server, and they gave an uptime guarntee on his DSL.  Pretty basic stuff.

Phil, though, was anything but 'basic'.  He was horribly mean, nasty, and clueless in all things tech.  He'd also call for anything, multiple times.  I remember seeing a few items in the call logs for stuff like problems with various office equipment.  A good example was when he bought himself a flatbed scanner, and called us to help him with it.  I luckally didn't get one of those calls (somehow), but there was a good week straight where he'd call multiple times a day trying to get it to work; the ticket log would have ""Scanner Won't Work"" listed a good 100+ times, spanning a solid 10 days.

He was horribly abusive to other techs; women especially, as you may have guessed.  I herd stories of others leaving the floor in tears after, and during, calls with Phil.

I took a few calls from Phil, and I personally didn't have too much trouble with him.  The thing was, I was, and still am, an extreme stickler for process flow of calls, staying inside support boundries, being exceptionally clear (and hitting the 'call record' button) when I stepped outside them that people wouldn't get this help here ever again.  Phil, of course, tried every opportunity to yell, bluster, cajole, blame, and be rude to anyone who attempted to show him the slightest hint of leniency or kindness concerning linear tech support.

My first call with Phil was a model for all further calls I personally had with him.

Me: Good afternoon, XYZ tech support, my name's SilentDis.  May I have your name, please?  
Phil: This is Phil.  
Me: Alrighty Phil, how can I help you today?  
(Side note: I learned, long long ago, to just get a name and let the customer vent.  If I can't find their contact info from the Caller ID, I'll get it soon enough.  This makes callers feel that you're a human, and on their side.)  
Phil: I am trying to get the page you are hosting to connect to my printer and it won't connect!  What is wrong with your company, are you behind the times?  This is a new printer, why don't you support it!  I swear I'll take my service somewhere else if you people don't wise up and fix this mess and get it working!  
(I'm paraphrasing a bit here, but this was the tone, tenor, and reason for his call to a tee.  I pressed the *call record button* at this point, which will backtrack and record the entire conversation)  
Me: Ok, so you're having problems printing a website, is this correct?  (**Always** get that verbal contract)  
Phil: I just told you what the problem is!  Weren't you listening?  What's wrong with you?  (and on, and on, and on...)
Me: I just like to be sure I'm helping you out as best I can.  You are having problems printing a webpage, is this correct?  
Phil: Yes!  I can't print the webpage you are hosting on my new printer!  (Verbal contract established)  
Me: Ok.  We're not really able to help out with printer problems, but...  
Phil: Why can't you help me, what's wrong with you?  You're not good at your job, are you?  
Me: Sir, do not insult me.  As I was saying, We're not able to help out with printer problems, but I can help you make sure everything we do help with is working properly.  I've pulled up your account from Caller ID.  I see everything's in good standing, and I see no reported outages for your area.  Can you hold one moment while I verify the connections from my side?  
Phil:  Fine.  
Me: Thank you, be right back.

Welcome to the penalty box, Phil, population: you.  I telnet into the various switches and routers he's attached to, and see his modem as attached; physical layer is good.  Send a ping on the Data layer, fine.  Send a ping on network layer and don't get a response.  That's fine, firewall is in place.  I ask for the stats on that line, wait a minute, and ask again; they've gone up.  He's sending data over the line without any issue whatsoever; Golden.

I check his website; a Geocities-esque site selling various bric-a-brac.  Whatever, it comes up.  SSH into the server, and it shows a nice 200+ uptime.  Ping his site from the switch he's attached to, no problems there.

Phil's been in the penalty box for a good 5 minutes now, lets see how that's changed his attitude.

Me: Sorry about that, sir.  I list off all the tests I performed above, non-stop without break, throwing in a few technical terms here and there.  
Phil: Uhh... (perfect.  I've gooed his little brain, exactly my intent.)  
Me: Since everything's working on this side, let's make sure everything's working on your side.

I walk him through opening up a webpage, opening up his webpage, and checking his e-mail.  All work without problem.

Me: Now, that's what we support; your Internet connection is working, your website is working, your e-mail is working.  You stated, though, you're having problems printing; which is not something we support.  Who makes your printer?  
Phil: Umm... Hewlett Packard?  (he sounds unsure, that's fine, I don't really care anymore, my job is done)  
Me: Then, it would probably be best to call them.  If you want, I can give you their phone number.  
Phil: Yes, please.

I gave him the phone number, and away he went.  He, of course, attempted to call a few more times concerning the same issue, with varying degrees of illiciting the argument he wanted, but most techs were savvy enough to just pull his call record and ask him if it's the same issue; then why he's calling again about it, and off they went.

My boss later told me I was the only one who could 'stop' Phil when he called.

This went on for a few more weeks, before Phil got to another tech, and got them to cry.  It was decided, at that point, to just give Phil my extension, and deny him service if he called on any other line.  If I wasn't in, he got my voicemail.

EDIT:

To clear up a few things and to give a rather disappointing answer to top comments there:

Software in question is basically for doing stats with, and [guy giving lecture] isn't teaching anyone how to use it, he's giving a lecture on statistics, and using this thing to provide examples. As it turns out he didn't actually seem to think it was that important, it was mostly just some people in admin getting terribly excited about somthing they hadn't actually taken the time to understand. The iPad problem was solved neatly by emailing the presentation to himself and picking it up the mail on the machine that was already in the room, so as far as I know the lecture went fine. 

I don't really want to get into a big arguement about whether or not him being in our building and using our equipment makes him our user, but technically he doesn't work here. He's a visitor who happens to have booked the room. Since shit like this happens far too often, we have a pretty straight forward policy regarding buying software for people that aren't actually employed by us. We don't do it. Ever. If he had actually been a member of staff, I would have gone to see him earlier in the week since yes, that would have been easier for all concerned.

We responded to a house fire and were the second truck on the scene. The fire had started in the kitchen and spread across the living room consuming most of the first floor. After we had knocked down most of the fire, we went back out to the front door to get some tools. I have a rule taught to me by an old fireman long ago: don't leave a house fire empty handed since there's always an important memory to rescue. So on the way out the door, I look to this burnt pile of debris and see their desktop computer sitting there. I grab the burnt, mangled tower, yank the cables off, and cart the computer outside. I hand it off to one of the engineers and tell him to keep it safe. 

After the fire is out, and we have finished tearing up the rest of the house finding hot spots, I find the computer, crack the case open and see the interior is pretty clean. I carry it over to the homeowners. She is a sobbing disaster: mid 30s, three kids under 4, and her house is almost destroyed.  Then she sees the computer and screams with joy. 

She thought it was destroyed in the fire and, of course, it has ALL of the kids photos on it with NO backups. Best rescue of the year.

1344224638.0,1015,self.talesfromtechsupport,xqvq4,Facebook? Do you know Facebook?,1354,339,268,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/xqvq4/facebook_do_you_know_facebook/,"This is a true story of technical support heroics.

I work for a webhosting company, and one of the most painful things in the world is helping people setup their email. For some reason they just can't grasp how to do it, and helping somebody with this over the phone is enough to make you want to eat your own headset indeed.

One day a client calls up asking for help setting up her email in Outlook, I believe (although it could have been Mac Mail). I go through the routine of walking through all of the steps, but it doesn't work. Alright...that happens often, people don't always put in the right information. So we go into her settings and double check everything. It all looks good. She tries again, and it still doesn't work. At this point she's getting anxious and pushing, demanding that I figure out how to fix it. We go through all the settings again...still looks good, but no email. At this point she is literally in tears, screaming and crying, demanding that we get the email working.

I let her know that she's going to need to calm down or else we aren't going to be able to get this working. She gets ahold of herself a bit, and I walk her through the settings one more time. I tell her everything looks fine, and there may be something on her network that is having email problems, and that she may want to contact her ISP. At this point she angrily hangs up.

She calls back in not 30 seconds later, and gets me again. (People do this occasionally hoping they'll get a different tech who will give a different answer. Especially hilarious when working a solo shift.) I explain to her again that we've gone over everything and I have no idea why it's not working. She starts sobbing and pleading. (Why people get so emotional over technology, I will never know.)

Enter our hero! At the time our technical support rooms had been running out of space, so we had a few rooms to overflow into. That day I was in one of the overflow rooms with a developer who had gotten promoted out of tech support about a month earlier (and didn't have an assigned office yet either). He had started listening when he heard the consternation in my voice and the client's wailing on the phone. He messages me saying to tell her that I will transfer her to one of our senior technicians to continue to assist her. This is all a mental game - people calm down when you say that they're being escalated. You could actually transfer them to the newest tech on a team, and they would still calm down thinking that they're being sent to somebody higher up.

Glad to get her off the line, I tell her I'm transferring her to a senior technician to help her out. He gets on the line and lets her know he would like to try some screen sharing software. We don't have any in-house screen sharing stuff at all, so sometimes we'll use the free service on join.me when needed. The problem is, with certain special clients like this one, **you practically need screen sharing software to show them how to setup screen sharing software.**

**Former Tech:** I'd like you to go to join.me in your web browser, please.

**Weeping lady:** What do you mean? I don't have any idea what you just said.

Please keep in mind that she has a WEB HOSTING account with us, and yet does not know how to go on the internet.

**Former Tech:** Um, do you know what web browser you have? It could be FireFox, Safari, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer...

**Weeping lady:** *starting to get tearful again* I have no idea. Please just help me!

**Former Tech:** You know when you get on the internet? Like, to go to your website? I'd like you to go to your website.

**Weeping lady:** I don't know how to do that!!

**Former Tech:** Alright...on your computer screen, do you have anything that looks like a blue lowercase ""e"" right now?

*good call, most people like this would be either using Safari on a Mac or IE on a PC.*

**Weeping lady:** Yes, I think so.

**Former Tech:** Great! Could you please double click on that ""e""?

**Weeping lady:** Okay, I did it.

**Former Tech:** Great, could you now go to the ""address bar"" at the top where you put website names in, and enter ""join.me"" in it?

**Weeping lady:** Please...*sniff* I don't know what you're talking about. I just want my email to work.

**Former Tech:** Alright, do you know how to get to webpages from here? Like, Google or your own website?

**Weeping lady:** No!

**Former Tech:** *moment of brilliance* What about FaceBook? Do you know how to get to Facebook?

**Weeping lady:** Yes, I know that!

**Former Tech:** Alright, I'd like you to go to FaceBook now.

**Weeping lady:** I'm there now.

**Former Tech:** Alright, up near the top there should be a white bar that says ""http://facebook.com"". I'd like you to replace that text with ""join.me"" and then hit enter.

I'm glad to report the story ends happily. They finally get join.me working, and then is able to see what she did wrong with her email. I don't recall what she had entered wrong, but it was something simple that he was easily able to fix when actually seeing it.

Her final parting words?

Let's call him Reginald, because that's the best name ever. Reginald has some very important data on his server. See, he has some big name clients. These clients are big enough to brag about on the phone to the guys managing the server (us), but apparently not big enough to warrant shelling out money for the redundant hard drives we keep recommending to him. 

Or, indeed, paying for his last 6 months of hosting services. In general, we're very lenient when it comes to late payments. If you're not being a douche, we'll give you quite a bit of time to get your account paid off. We won't add interest, and we won't keep bugging you about it.

You can see where this is going. In the dead of night two days ago, about an hour before our daily backups run, it happened. We, being the good service providers we are, had the server back up and running within an hour with a shiny new hard drive and data from a 23 hour old backup, since the old drive was shot. Shot the client an apologetic email, and went back to our regularly scheduled ticket queue.

First thing in the morning, Reginald calls up. He's *shocked* that we would consider this issue resolved with 24 hours of **very** important data missing! 

**Reggie**: You need to get my data back immediately!

**Us**: We really apologize, but the old hard drive is dead. We don't have a way to recover it.

**Reggie**: Let me talk to &lt;CEO's first and last name&gt;

**Us**: CEO's actually in a meeting right now, I can have him ca--

**Reggie**: NO! Let me talk to &lt;CFO's first and last name&gt; then! This data belongs to some very important clients!

**Us**: He's actually in the same meeting.

**Reggie**: Fine! Have CEO call me as soon as he gets out, I can't tell my clients that 24 hours of work has vanished!

A quick word about our CEO. While he's on board with the leniency we have for late payments and is a very level-headed dude, he's going to be the guy to pull the plug. We all know this, and while the dude's being a douche, we don't want to have to resort to that, since his clients actually are pretty decently sized and we'd prefer to not have this blow back on them too much. But Reginald keeps calling at least every hour, demanding that we pull CEO out of his very long and important meeting so he can convince him to make us magic his missing data.

We keep joking about it internally, there's really no way to tell this guy ""You do not want to talk to our CEO. If you start yelling at him about this unsolvable issue, he's going to cancel your account because you haven't paid us in 6 months. Please just accept your fate.""

He finally did end up accepting his fate, but not before (actually) yelling at three or four different techs after they told him that yes, our CEO actually has been in a meeting for the entire day (which was 100% true), and no, we do not have a way to magically recover your not-important-enough-to-redundicize data.

As of today, he's still not paid his bill, and he's still not considering the redundancy that we've recommended to him multiple times throughout the day.

This is an encounter that I will remember for the rest of my life.

I used to be a contractor with the military doing mostly computer security documentation, one of which was tracking security vulnerabilities for our computer systems.  The agency that we fell under sent out auditors every so often to run security vulnerability scans to make sure we have all of our systems patched.

In this particular instance one of these scans checked for a vulnerability in Microsoft Office by checking to see if a particular file or registry entry exists; if they exist, then it's patched.  If the file and registry entry aren't there, it's vulnerable.  They ran the scan on one of our servers which did not have MS Office on it, so naturally the scan couldn't find the patch or the registry entry on the system.  After we went over the results, we marked the finding as a false-positive and gave it back to them.  This is the subsequent conversation between the auditors and we contractors:

**Auditor: ""OK, so I see you marked this as a false-positive. You need to change it back.""**

Contractors: ""Oh but we don't have Office on the server, so it's not vulnerable.""

**Auditor: ""Doesn't matter, you still need to install the patch.""**

Contractors: ""But we can't install the patch because Office isn't on the system.""

**Auditor: ""Then you need to install Office on it, then install the patch.""**

Contractors: ""But that would just introduce a whole slew of new vulnerabilities, not just this one.""

**Auditor: ""Doesn't matter, we can't mark the finding as fixed unless the scan finds the registry entry.""**

Contractors: ""So you mean to tell me that we need to INTRODUCE a vulnerability to the system by installing a piece of software with holes, so we can patch it, rather than just leave it without the vulnerability in the first place?""

**Auditor: ""That's correct.  And you need to do it before we leave or it will count against you.""**

Any number.""",1219,207,139,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1coq67/just_dial_a_number_any_number/,"As many of you guys already know from my previous posts, I served about 14 months time working for a company that we'll call ""Spring together with Lextel"" doing work on their Blackberry phones.  Early on in my call-taking career, I learned a very important lesson.

I fielded a call from an older gentleman who needed to upgrade from a Motorola phone to a Blackberry.  I had him insert the sim, swapped all the numbers over that needed swapped, and set the new phone to active.  All the lights were green, and this guy's phone looked good to go.

Now sometimes the customer will want us to explain how email works, or how to surf the web on their new phone.  But no matter what, the one thing we always did was make sure they could make a phone call.  If that worked, chances are we were at least on the right track.

The conversation went something like this:

Me:  Alright, Mr. John Doe, it looks like everything is activated with your phone.  Now that it's booted back up we're going to make sure you can call out with it.

Customer: ""Okay, it's loaded. Now what do I do?""

Me: ""Go to the phone option.  When you dial a number here, and hit Send, it will call that number.""

Customer: ""Okay, so what do I do?""

Me: ""Just type in a phone number and hit Send.""

Customer: ""Well what number do I put in?""

Me, getting a bit exasperated: ""It doesn't matter. Just put in any number.""

Customer: ""Oh, okay.""  

We wait a few seconds, during which time I assumed the customer was typing in the phone number of someone he knew.

Customer: ""It says, Call Failed.""

Me: ""Hmm.  That's odd.  Not a problem; we'll do a bit of troubleshooting and see what the issue is.""

So we did a bit of troubleshooting, and we tried again.

Customer: ""It says Call Failed again.""

Damn.  What the heck is going on here?  The phone has a capital LXTL (an abbreviated version for Lextel, where each capital letter means one of the four main pieces of service are working).  It should be working.

For the next 45 minutes we do more troubleshooting.  I can call him just fine from my phone. But he can't call out. Every time he dials a number he gets ""call failed.""  

Finally the customer asks, ""Maybe there's a problem with the number I'm typing in?""

Me: ""Well...I guess it could be.  What number are you typing in?""

Customer: ""Twelve.""

In my haste, I had told the customer, ""Dial any number.""  So he literally picked a number at random--not a phone number, but just the first number that popped into his head--and dialed it.

In fact, I'm a chemical engineer. But during my internship two years ago I was in charge of the site-wide migration from Windows XP to Windows 7 (about 500 computers). No idea how I got put in that situation, and I was in way over my head (even with 7 dedicated people to help me), but it got done rather successfully (if I do say so myself). Here's a story I love to share that you might appreciate.

There's this one lady, who's job was volumetric accounting. She had a laptop and second monitor, and used both screens, with the main screen being the monitor (not the laptop). I should preclude this with my initial opinion of her - she was a truly ungrateful person, and believed (and boasted) the company revolved around her. 

So we were nearing the end of the rollout, and of course, she was one of the last people that was done. I happen to sit very near her, and she came over and said that she needed some help. Usually I would send her off to one of the people I worked with (... in IT), but I figured she just couldn't remember how to open Excel (a surprisingly common occurrence). She shows me both of her monitors, which are blank screens. She starts SCREAMING at me that I have done a terrible job of this migration project, how I've personally made her life a living hell, how I am clearly an idiot, and generally calling me a foul person. This rant went on for about 5 minutes, and I don't think she took a breath that entire time. And she wasn't whispering, this was full-on screaming. I kept trying to interject, to no luck. At this point my boss (the engineering manager, several tiers of hierarchy above her) walks by. She proceeds to scream at my boss for another 10 minutes, again not letting us interject. Finally, she seemed to have run out of steam, and just began to furiously look between my boss and myself, and her black screens. After about 2 minutes of silence, I reach over and turn on her external monitor. It blinks to life, showing her login screen. 

I will never forget the look on her face (or those on the crowd that had formed) as my boss said ""if I ever hear that you've yelled at a 20-year-old intern for your own blatent stupidity, I will contact So-and-so (the accounting manager) and have you fired"".

Back then I was working as the Computer Exorcist (read: a computer technician) at this small IT company providing techsupport for a few local businesses on-site, servicing random users' computers at our office and running a small computer and related stuff shop.

So, one day a customer brings a PC for repair, saying it won't even boot to windows. The front desk girl documents it all, creates a ticket and hands the PC over to me, all the usual stuff. I do the standard diagnostics and, obviously, the HDD is dead: it doesn't even get recognized by the BIOS (no wonder it doesn't boot). I call the customer saying that he'll need a replacement of the HDD and ask whether we should attempt a data recovery off it (for an added price, of course), the customer insists we do everything in our power to retrieve the very important data stored on that drive.

I believe most of you know the trick with harddrives and freezers, where you put one into the other and it magically makes them work again (for a little while). It sort of worked this time as well, but the drive was old and would warm up pretty quickly, failing within minutes of power-on and not allowing me to do a proper data recovery off it.

So here I was, sitting at my desk after having the drive reunited with the frozen vegetables in the freezer once again, trying to think up a working solution for this situation, when my eyes wandered over a few bricks laying in the corner - we used them as a deadweight to anchor our outdoors banner on windy days - suddenly the gears in my head sprung into motion and a wild idea appeared in my mind. I immediately grabbed one of them and shoved it into the freezer next to the failing HDD.

Next day first thing in the morning I took the drive and the brick out from the freezer, connected the drive to the external pATA controller, put this whole assembly on the brick and wrapped everything up nicely with a big old towel to provide thermal insulation, as well as to keep the moisture away from the electronic components, and started the drive imaging process. Approx. an hour later the imaging was done and the drive was successfully retired (i.e. put into a big box with the other fallen comrades). And the brick went back into the freezer, because you never know when you might need one again.

There was a substitute teacher. They wanted to use a laptop outside but didn't have the wireless password. They found a cable with an RJ45 connector on one end and a power socket on the other, and assumed it was an Ethernet over power adapter. This cable was in a bag labeled ""**ETHERKILLER. DO NOT USE**"". If you know what an Etherkiller is you know where this story is going. If not, remember the power of an Ethernet signal is about 1-2 volts. Mains electricity in my country is 230 volts. 

They plugged it into an £800 ($1000) Thinkpad laptop, which instantly turned off. This didn't phase them. They just assumed it was out of batteries.

Then they plugged it into another thinkpad, which failed to turn on entirely. Passing this off as an empty battery they moved on.

They plugged it into a THIRD laptop, which started smoking. Only then did they decide to go to IT and ask what was wrong.

edit: Detailed description of what an Etherkiller actually is: An Etherkiller is an RJ45 plug on one end, and a Mains power plug on the other, with Neutral and life wires from the mains plug wired to pins 1 and 2 (the transmit + and - pins) (though honestly you could probably wire them to any of the pins). I would like to stress that you should probably never make one of these or you might kill someone.

edit edit: To stop people asking - The purpose of an etherkiller is to kill things with ethernet ports. It has no real legitimate use beyond that.

Now, this CS rep told me, quite bluntly that this lady is pissed and wanted a new phone, he also said he was new and didn't know where to turn; he just had to pass the call along to me. 

The call gets transferred over and immediately she starts ripping me a new asshole. I let her yell and get it all out, and told her that she needed to calm down or I couldn't help her because I couldn't understand what she was saying because she was screaming. She took a breath, and explained what was going on with her phone. I went through my usual steps to resolve her issue, which was that her phone wasn't receiving a signal and she was missing calls etc. I reset her on our network and had her turn her phone on and off, that didn't work. I kept following the steps, and I got to a question that pretty much asked if there was physical/water damage to the device. She replied with this (I shit you not): ""I was pissed at my boyfriend and threw my phone against the wall"".

I actually went silent for a few seconds and tried to wrap my head around her stupidity. I advised her that even though she was still within her warranty, it was void because of the obvious physical damage. She then started yelling at me, saying that she did this a while ago and the phone was fine and that this started the day before. I tried to explain to her that damage doesn't have to immediate affect the device, it can happen at anytime. 

She went ballistic. I mean she was like a bat out of hell. Her exact quote ""I'm going to come to your work bitch and shove my blackberry down your throat, you cunt"". I really wish someone took a picture of my face because it really must have been priceless. I got so angry that I let her have it. I told her that if she wasn't such a dumb ass, than maybe her phone would be working, and that maybe if she was a good girlfriend, perhaps her bf wouldn't have cheated on her (hence why she was pissed). Clearly, this didn't help and she escalated to my mgr. 

After my manager finished the call, he called me over and I was still livid. He told me that he ended up reasoning with her, telling her that she wouldn't be getting a brand new phone, that she would have to purchase one. Also, he told me that I wasn't allowed to yell at customers anymore. 

I remembered the crazy lady's number and typed it in a few weeks later, it appeared that she had called in like 20 times since talking to me, regarding the same thing. It got to the point where she wanted to talk to the president of the company, she got her wish, and he banned her from ever using our services again and made her pay all her late bills.

This is the first story of my 16 part saga of working at a local computer store from end 2006 to early 2009. I hope you will enjoy. I will try to get a new chapter out ~~monday~~. Let's make that next friday for you folks* 

**Please note that this story takes place in Germany, many people have been confused about this. I use American conventions for aesthetic purposes only.**

***

December 2006 was when I first started working at the local computer store. I remember it was a late friday afternoon and quite dark and stormy. My kind of weather. It was my first day, of what would be 2 years of being employed there. 2 years of dealing with rudeness, absurdity and stupidity to have it all ending rather abruptly and explosively.

Days before the IT-administrator at my school found out I knew my way around computers and offered me a job at his “Business Partners” computer store. They had started it together back in the late 80’s. While he moved on to a full-time job as IT-administrator for many schools in the area, he still did some work in the store and owned half of it.

Though my mom told me when I was little not to accept any offers from strange people -and especially not from 40-something severely overweight Ron Jeremy look-a-likes - I took him up on the offer. My Nomad Zen, a MP3-player I still to this day love, was showing it’s age and I needed money for one of those fancy new iRiver MP3 players.

After he made a call with his, again, “Business Partner” he gave me the address and told me to get there around 18:30 on thursday and he and the “business partner” would give me a formal job interview. The way he said it, especially the intonation on the “Business Partner”-part, sounded like I was invited to do a casting couch audition for some B-grade porno site. Still to this day whenever somebody mentions a business partner I cringe and feel disgusted and violated.

After finishing up my homework at the school canteen that thursday I set off by bike to the computer store. It was located in one of the cheaper neighborhoods of our small city. The store − and all the stores surrounding it for that matter - much needed a new layer of paint and a good cleaning of the tiles and signs. Somewhat reluctantly I opened the door and walked into the store. No turning back now. I am greeted by my future co-worker Jeremy, a 21-year old college dropout. ”How can I help you today, pretty girl” He asked. I ignored the pretty girl part and told him about my job application and was supposed to see Ron Jeremy and his business partner. He walked to the back to talk with them, leaving me in alone in the store. 

Looking around in the store I saw a lot of old damaged displays. Some obscure and mediocre burning software, sold for 49,95 mind you, had a huge cardboard display with a rather  B-grade category model printed on it praising the product. Most of the walls and tables were full of accessories. Mainly cheap Chinese and Koreans knock off brands, sold for Logitech and Microsoft hardware prices. A few PCs and displays with outdated component lined the walls and sold for absurd prices. The current generation computers were even more expensive.

The counter was made entirely of glass and was empty aside from the even older cash register and some USB-gadgets from questionable quality. The space under the counter hold a huge amount of games. This had to be the only shop where you could still buy every Doom game released for PC for the full launch price, years, even decades later. Guess it’s a niche market. We never really sold much of it, anyway. 

Jeremy came back and told me I could walk to the back. I walked around the counter and almost broke my neck over the boxes full of non-branded memory. Stumbling into the back I almost bumped into the business partner. The top half of his shirt unbuttoned showing a rather disgusting orange-like forest of hair and a golden necklace. Like Ron he was severely - even morbidly - obese and was so large he could block your path. Looking up at him I saw a disgusting smile, one that still is burned on my retina today. A smile of lust. I think this is about to mention I was a 16 year old girl that got hit by puberty pretty fast and hard. 

He showed me a seat and and they took their places opposite me. Jeremy shouted from the front of the store he was leaving and I heard the front door slam shut. Looking back at the two obese figures in front of me, I felt somewhat uncomfortable, my boobs seemed to have a gravitational pull as a twin par of suns with the eyeballs of the two obese man  circling around them as planets. They kept their distance knowing going closer would burn them.  

Ron starts talking about how he liked my work at school and thinks I can help Don with the store during nights and weekends. Don, not impressed by my “Mad Skills” yet insists on a series of test he prepared in the days before. Anyone worthy of working in his store would solve these problems in no time. While he says this I start looking at him for the first time. He strikes me as the love child of Donald Trump and Fat Bastard from the Austin Power series.

The first test he gave me was installing Windows XP on one of the “new” machines for a customer and making sure all the hardware drivers were installed. Nothing special in this regard, aside from time consuming installing on a Pentium 3 with 256MB of ram. Don seemed to agree and I had to flash the firmware on one of the actually new Wireless Routers he just got in and wanted to demo in the store. To make it extra challenging I had to find the new firmware myself on a poorly translated website of the Korean manufacturer. To this day I still think I acknowledged Kim II-sung as my dear leader for eternity when accepting the terms of service for downloading the drivers.

The third and final assignment was supposed to get make me go running out of the store pulling my hair. But really at this point no difficult assignment was needed to get me to do this.

I had to configure a Debian linux installation to run a cron task, start the apache web server and delete and move a number of files. Nothing to troubling, but with my limited Linux skills I needed some help from Google. Asking whether it was okay to use the internet to look up some of the commands and configuration details Ron told me it was okay. “It’s not hardcore mode like us pro’s do it, but we will teach you the skills girl” Don quickly added. I felt even more uncomfortable now. After some 25 minutes the third task was completed and they congratulated me with passing the tests.

A standard 3 month contract quickly got grabbed from one of their desks and my details filled in. My pay would by around $5 dollars, which was actually quite good compared to supermarkets and other shops. All I had to do was sign. Overwhelmed by everything and against better judgement I did. They already has a schedule prepared for me as Ron had already taken my class schedule from the school system to see my available times. This gave me the feeling of being stalked, but before this sinked in they slid the paper over the table. I was to begin tomorrow, friday, straight out of school from 17:00 till 21:00. 

* * *

I was to begin my first shift today. Jeremy was to be my mentor for the day. After changing into the way to small  company t-shirt he sat me down and told me what I was supposed to do. It would have been quicker if he told me what I was not supposed to do. I had to help customers, stock shelves, order components and accessories from our Chinese suppliers, clean the shop, work the register, answer the phone and repair the PCs brought in by our customers. Basically everything you can do in a shop.

He showed me how the cash register worked, how the store was (dis)organized and some other tidbits of information. Jeremy was actually very likable and smart. He could have done much better for himself, but suffered from a number of problems causing him to completely shut down when entering a prestigious university.

When we came to the back things became rather interesting. I already seen the back of the store, but did not touch any of the stuff yet. We had a few work benches for the PC repairs including most of the cabling. The power sockets where all ungrounded extensions cords were connected to each other causing the power to fail whenever a computer had a short-circuit. The UPS installed in a corner covered by layers of dust was useless in this setup. Though Ron always insisted that it was there for a reason. I would find out 2 years later.

The binders of cd’s were full of cracked software ranging from all version of Windows and Office to every version of Photoshop and Norton Ghost. The only genuine software was the burning software that stood prominently in the store, and was thrown in for only 24,95 for housewives, failed businessmen and seniors, our usual mix of customers, buying a new overpriced PC.

The network drive had even more illegal software, movies and music on it, not to mention customer data. In a feat of NASA equivalent engineering Ron and Don somehow managed to connect dozens of hard-drives to an Windows XP installation and create a few terabytes of storage with reliable and pretty fast data transfer rates. The Usenet client on the pc always had at least 5 items in queue.  Mostly dvd-rips from new movies and porn.

My shift ended pretty quickly and was nothing special in that regard. My next shifts for over 2 years would be.

**TL:DR** - I got a job at a the local shady computer store with Ron Jeremy and the love child of Donald Trump and Fat Bastard as my bosses. Ron and Don. Sexual harassment is our selling point in the store.

By the end of the day, He would get 10 emails for every email he sent to me.

After a few days the kid figured out that he could do the same thing back to me and set up a few rules of his own and then sent off a single email just before he went home. So basically, we had set up a never-ending loop.

Apparently it took the Admins Hours to fix the mess the never ending loop had made, since by the time they noticed it both mailboxes had well over 1,000,000 Emails in them and the exchange server had crashed.

Guy walks in with a laptop.  I greet him, ask him the problem.  He opens it up, and the problem is *immediately* apparent - right smack in the top middle of the screen is a black circle an inch or two across, with a nice little spiderweb of cracks.

""Oh yeah,"" I say instantly, ""cracked screen.  That sucks.  Do you have a service plan?""

""I dunno"".

I roll my eyes inwardly - they never freaking know.

I find his receipt, and nope! He doesn't.  Further, the damn thing was only about three weeks old.

I brace myself for the inevitable meltdown, and explain that because he has no accidental coverage, he will have to spend about $160-$200 for a new screen and installation.

He cuts me off:

""I bought this up here two weeks ago, I ain't payin' to have it fixed, it's under warranty""

I explain about how manufacturer warranties don't cover physical damage, he rejects my explanation, we go back and forth like this for a bit.  Anyone who's ever worked retail knows the conversation.  He takes the stance that the product was shoddily-constructed and didn't hold up to use.

So I ask how the damage occurred.  He said ""I just picked it up like this...""

And he grabs it by the screen, thumb smack in the middle of the panel, fingers on the back, squeeze and lift.  And this is a 17"" laptop.

I cringe and tell him that you're only supposed to handle laptops by the base.  He yells back:

""Well the manual didn't say you shouldn't!""

After a bit more yelling at me about how we don't stand behind our products (""we DO, but you *broke* that through misuse..."" ""IT WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH"") and he storms out.

I'm now mainly a theatre/AV technician, though I've done various jobs over the last 8 years or so since leaving high school, including retail and IT/VOIP support. 

One such job was working for the (at the time) biggest consumer electronics chain in New Zealand, founded by an Australian guy. We did all the usual, including upgrades and computer bits and pieces.

Store policy was that any upgrades such as RAM was at the discretion of the employee, if we were going to fit them to the customers computer. Basically, if we were competent and could do it, and we weren't busy, then why not, go for it.

One Saturday afternoon, when the store was fairly busy, a customer came in wanting a RAM upgrade for his laptop. I didn't really want to put it in as we were busy, but he insisted, and it shouldn't have taken that long anyway... 

So I popped the cover off on the bottom and identified the correct type, verified there was a free slot, and rang him up for the new RAM (about $NZ80.)

Put the new RAM in and tried to boot the machine. No go. Battery flat. Does the customer have the charger? Of course not, it's at home. I was feeling even more uneasy now, but let it (and him) go.

I had a nice relaxing day off on the Sunday.

Come Monday, I get a phone call from a very irate customer insisting that I must have stolen (not only) his new RAM, but the existing RAM also because his computer wouldn't boot. He had taken the machine to a friend of his who ""did computers"" and the friend had ""taken a look"" (removed the RAM panel underneath) and there was no RAM there.  I pointed out that I had installed the new RAM in front of him, and there was honestly no way I had done any such thing. I suggested that sometimes a dud stick of RAM could prevent the machine from booting, it fell on deaf ears. I invited him to come into the store and we could troubleshoot to find the problem, this time perhaps could he bring his charger so we can verify it works before he leaves the store? Of course not.

So my store manager had me drive into the city (about 15km) with my own car on company time (she did give me a petrol voucher after the fact) with cash to refund him (last resort) and 2 of every type of RAM we carried, just in case...

I opened up the bottom of the laptop and pointed out there were 2 covers, one for the HDD and one for the RAM... of course, ""friend"" had opened up the wrong cover... so I replaced the RAM I had originally installed and the machine booted.

Very frustrating.

This one took place less than a decade ago, (2000's) when web conferencing or remote desktop's popularity was still starting to pick up. Our business was still growing and we hired co-op students/interns back then to fill in the tech support void. Our 2 offices were separated by a road, because leasing another office was the most feasible solution for our booming employee base. As such, we had two server rooms --- one for each building.

We had a task for our intern one day: to take some backup tapes out from the server room across the street. He may have done so begrudgingly, as he trundled along to the other office. I was doing some routine maintenance on the servers back then, and heard our IT manager wondering where our intern was after a little while. I did not mind it much, as we know our intern was a bit on the lazy side.

I was working on the servers across the street, and VNC'ed on one of them when I noticed something strange: one of our servers who had a monitor, keyboard, and mouse hooked up on a KVM switch was displaying porn sites on it. Since I was on VNC, I can see that the session is still being controlled by the user who was there locally. I motioned our manager to come see my screen and asked him what course of action we should take next as I let him drive on my workstation. He chuckled a bit, took control of the session, opened Notepad and typed 'Big Brother is watching you.' We saw the mouse cursor move to close the open windows in a panicked motion.

Nonetheless, when the newbie came back from his task, he was a little red-faced. We also replaced our mouse and keyboard for that KVM switch...

Also, one of my duties is to help students with their accounts. I can only assist the student of the account due to [FERPA](http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html) . It's federal law and we can't get around it. Parents can't get into their kid's accounts.

*Background*: This women has called in *twice* to get the password for her son [Adam]'s account. One, we can't see passwords. Two, we can't reset them for anyone but the student. She's angry and screamed at the first two workers, one who was a supervisor. Now it's my turn.

**Me:** [Standard greeting]. What can I help you with today?

**Her:** I've forgotten my password. I need to pay the tuition on [goAccount].

**Me:** Okay. May I have your [questions for personal info]

**Her:** [Personal info] and [birthday, 1990]

**Me:** Ma'am, we can only reset the password for the student of the account. This account is listed for a male student. Do you need help logging in the parents' goAccount?

**Her:** My son has given me permission to get into his account, it's fine.

**Me:** The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act prevents us from assisting anyone but the student to get into their goAccount. If you son needs a new password or needs help paying the bill, please have him call us. 

**Her:** *yelling* He's in class! How is he suppose to pay this bill that is due tomorrow if he is in class?! College students are there for a reason, you know? 

**Me:** Ma'am, I [am/was] a college student. That's why we are open until 8pm today. He can call us after classes are over. 

**Her:** *yelling* What are you there for? I pay the tuition for your job, I'm allowed in his account, so give me his password!!

**Me:** This is federal law, governing my job. Please have your son call us at [phone number] after class.

*slams phone down and hangs up on me*



Now, we have a group messaging system at our work, and so we've all been informed about this lady. Next, she gets my friend [Bob].

**Bob:** [Standard Greeting]

**Her:** *low male-ish voice* Hi, I forgot my password for my goAccount.

**Bob:** Okay, can I have your [personal information]?

**Her:** Yeah it's [personal info].

**Bob:** Ma'am, like we said, we can't reset the account for anyone but the student.

**Her:** Yo, my moms told me to call this number.

**Bob:** You have already spoken to [Alex] and our supervisor [Joe]. You said Adam was in class.

**Her:** Yeah well, damn it! *slams phone down and hang up*



Lastly, another supervisor, [Chad] about 20 minutes later.

**Chad:** [Standard Greeting]

**Customer:** *boy's voice* Hello, I just got out of class and my mother sent me a text saying that I needed to call you guys right away and that you weren't helping her with my account.

**Chad:** Yes. Unfortunately, due to FERPA, we can only help users with their account. 

**Customer:** That's fine, can I get a password reset? My information is [personal information].

**Chad:** How did you know what we were going to ask you?

**Customer:** Because my mom told me.

**Chad:** Who's your advisor? 

**Customer:** Who? 

**Chad:** Your academic advisor. The one you make you schedule with?

**Customer:** I don't know! 

**Chad:** Every student knows their advisor. Ma'am, we can't help you get into your son's account. It's federal law. 

**Customer:** *now in a female voice* I want to speak to your supervisor right now! This is bullshit! What do I pay you all for?! HE'S GIVEN ME PERMISSION FOR HIS ACCOUNT.  I KNOW YOU HAVE HIS PASSWORD JUST GIVE IT TO ME, AND GIVE ME TO YOUR MANAGER RIGHT NOW!

**Chad:** I am a supervisor. How may I help you with this matter?

**Her:** *screams and hang up.*

Poor Adam.

It was a small operation, and nothing about it had a ""corporate"" feeling. We had three employees, so we were all kinda responsible for everything, but we each had the freedom to play to our strengths. We had two small offices, a front counter, and a room where we kept seeds for propagation, in a small building surrounded by our plant nursery. We used a ""natural ventilation system"" more often than the AC unit, which is to say that we simply left the doors open pretty often. The most technologically advanced things we had were our touch-screened point-of-sale computer, and our 4-camera, infrared, closed-circuit, DVR surveillance system. [You know, like this.](http://www.ebay.com/itm/4-Camera-CCTV-System-Long-Range-Infrared-Cameras-and-8-Channel-DVR-/120980267929#vi-content)

You might wonder why such a small operation employed such seemingly unnecessary methods simply for keeping an eye on things, but I'll not go into the details about the coffers of our operation's benefactors. Suffice it to say that we had had some things stolen, and they saw a way to prevent things like that. So we got a four-camera, infrared, closed-circuit, DVR surveillance system. It got the job done, as overkill often does.

Now, to the meat (or tempeh, if you like) and potatoes of the story:

The DVR and TV monitor for our camera system resided in the ""seed storage"" room. So, while you were cleaning seeds you could keep an eye on the outside world or ""review the tapes,"" as it were, of past nights. One afternoon as we're closing up shop, I look into the room and see that someone has been cleaning Gaillardia seed heads to harvest the seeds. The scene resembles [this fine image that I stole from the internet](http://blackfootnativeplants.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/gaiari-seeds-web.jpg). Apparently they hadn't finished, but that's fine because nobody will be in here overnight to mess with it.

The next morning, where the pile of plant matter had been, the table is clean. *Spotless*, in fact. Not a seed left. I confirm with the other employees that neither of them had come in overnight to work on these seeds.

""Maybe they blew off the table somehow?"" A reasonable enough suggestion, but there are seeds neither on the table nor floor. Other ideas were briefly raised and then shot down with equally convincing counter evidence, and so we were forced to come to the conclusion that, though ridiculously unlikely, someone had entered the office and stolen our really abundant and not-all-that-valuable seeds. Fortunately, we have a four-camera, infrared, closed-circuit, DVR surveillance system! With it being a slow day that day, we all decided to sit around the DVR and watch what (if anything) happened the night before, and perhaps determine who came in and what else they may have left with. We kept a channel on live footage of outside in case we saw a stray customer.

So, we sat and watched (in 16x fast forward) the events of the previous night. Or rather, as it turned out, the non-events of the previous night. No person entered or exited the premises save ourselves at the already established times. We had a genuine mystery of missing seeds, and at that point it was way more about the novelty of the situation than regard for actual loss of property. It was then when I made a breakthrough discovery...

When I reached up to switch the DVR back to displaying live feed on all its channels, I felt that the box was much warmer than usual. When I looked at the side vents to see if the vents were blocked by dust or something, I saw that they were indeed blocked by something. Lots of small somethings, actually.  But those somethings were moving. To my keen eye, these appeared to be the antennae of hundreds of rather large ants that had squeezed themselves into the DVR unit through the vents and perhaps have made a new home inside. And I decided that if they were making a home, they probably needed building materials. It hardly takes a Sherlockian leap of logic to tie the two tales together. Our stolen seeds were stashed away in the very security device design to prevent thefts! I laughed at the irony of it, and the other employees then gave me funny looks. So, in lieu of verbal explanation, I unplugged the DVR from its cameras and TV, grabbed a screwdriver, and gently carried the box outside.

I unscrewed the shell of the unit from its base and peeled off the **Warranty Void If Broken** sticker sealing the gap between the two (shh, don't tell the manufacturer). When I lifted the top and rapidly backed away, thousands of carpenter ants emerged in a confused mass of indignation. The looks on my coworkers' faces bounced from confusion to shock and finally to amused comprehension as they saw that half of the tiny little workers were carting around our Gaillardia seeds.

I left the DVR outside for a couple hours and let the ants extract themselves from our electronics, and then carefully vacuumed out the mess that they'd left behind. After I sealed the box back up (sticker and all), we plugged it in back in the seed room and made a mental note to not leave potential nesting materials behind anymore.

**TL;DR** Mysterious theft in the night called for a debugging of our surveillance system. Literally.

By far, I'm the most computer-literate person in my family.

As you can probably guess from the above description, this makes me the tech support wizard for my family (AKA: I have a magic computer-fixing wand). 

But what they don't realize is that when they have some minor issue like needing a driver install, or changing a setting in MS Office, or troubleshooting a printer, 90% of the time I don't know what the issue is off the top of my head, and I have to google it just like everyone else. Also 90% of the time, the solution that google presents is very simple, and doesn't require my knowledge or experience to implement.

But of course, it's much easier to just ask me to deal with it. Well, last night I got fed up with being asked to deal with computer issues every time I walk into my parents house, and instituted a new policy. Here's the conversation that led to the new policy:


**Sister:** Hey WinterHill (WH), can I ask you about a computer problem?

**WH:** Uh, sure, what is it?

**Sis:** Well, my laptop keeps overheating. I can feel that it gets really hot when I set it down, and then it runs really slowly until I prop it up to let more air in.

**WH:** Hmmm... sounds like you could have dust in the air vents, or the fan is broken. Let's take a look. Hmm, nope, looks like the vents are clear, and the fan is working.

**Sis:** Ok, what else could it be then?

**WH:** I dunno, I've never run into this type of issue with my laptop before.

**Sis** (w/ blank stare): That wasn't helpful. What are you going to do then?

**WH:** Oh yeah, I've got my magic wand in my car, I could go grab it.

**Sis:** Come on, I need help and I'm leaving for a 6 month trip tomorrow. (great time to deal with your computer issues, right?)

**WH:** Have you tried googling the issue?

**Sis:** No, I don't know how.

**WH:** (knowing she's full of crap) Oh! Well let me show you. First, you click up here in your browser, then you type www.google.com. And you see that big rectangular bar in the center? That's where you type your issue, and then press enter!

**Sis:** (being difficult) What do I type?

**WH:** Really? Type: 'laptop model number' + 'overheating'


She does this and... go figure! It's a common issue with her laptop caused by crappy thermal design. HP will fix it if you send it in, and there are several temporary kluges posted by other users. 

And because she waited so long to ask me instead of googling it, she has to deal with an overheating laptop on her 6 month trip! That ought to make the lesson sink in, right?


**Sis:** Oh yeah, also, whenever I open a new tab in Chrome, it goes to this new website instead of my homepage. How do I change it?

**WH** (blank stare): Google.

She had it fixed in under a minute.


So here is the new family tech support policy: ""To receive my help, you MUST google the issue, and you MUST try at least the top 3 links."" If that doesn't work, I'm genuinely happy to help.

So now when they call, I'm going to quiz them on the top 3 google links, and if they can't answer, tough luck! Google or GTFO.

Support's pretty simple - it's a hosted service, so 95% of the requests are password-reset or clarification of instructions. Having worked help desk before, I have some sympathy for a bit of harsh language -- if someone's opening a ticket, they're probably already frustrated.

But some of this stuff is really beyond the pale – and since I actually have some authority in this org, I get a chance to ""fix"" customers that treat our help desk like shit.

**Example 1: I'm not a girl, sir, and fsck you very much**

Our usual help desk person is a female. Some customers know this. After a failed reset (which happens very occasionally), I get this reply from a guy:

&gt; Your reset process never works and I cant take my training! I could lose my job for this you useles b\*tch, now make it f\*cking work or get a man on it.

(I censored the above, but it's otherwise verbatim).

This would be very not okay under the best of circumstances, but to add insult to injury, our tech is actually *very* good at her job, and is helpful and sweet to a fault.

My reply: *Hi, [customer]. You have not been talking with [tech] today, you've been talking to me: [l3gato], Senior Architect. I'm sorry you've had trouble with our password-reset system, but you won't need to worry about that for the next 10 days as your account has been suspended for abuse. I am cc'ing [HR dude] on this thread.*

*Regards,
[Company]*

I'm friends with HR dude - turns out the guy tried to argue that there was *absolutely nothing inappropriate* about his behavior because our tech is ""just some support girl"". He's been put on probation.

**Example 2: here's a free account with a competitor**

A customer opens a ticket requesting a reset, saying he got in fine a few months ago, but his old password doesn't work today. I reset him and close the ticket.

He re-opens claiming the reset doesn't work, so I do it manually and test the new password before sending him the ""please follow these steps *exactly* to log in, let me know if and when you get an error."" (I'm thinking it's a browser settings issue).

What I get back is unprintable in this forum, but basically boils down to a long-winded rant about how this is the worst service ever. I decided to call him and ask if he'd share his screen with me so I could better see what the problem was, and he agreed.

The first thing he does is open our competitor's website. Apparently he'd signed up for a 15-day trial there before deciding he liked us better, then *forgot* who he bought from. At this point, it's just amusing.  But if it stopped here, I wouldn't be sharing, right? :)

He proceeds to yell for a solid 10 minutes about how we should make the competitor's website redirect to ours if he's a customer. I try to explain that there's no acceptable way for us to do that, and that it might even be illegal for us to try, which earns me another 5 minutes of swearing.

Fearful that I might say something that would upset the partners, I just tell him that I'll look into a solution and get back to him.

My e-mail: *I have figured out a way to get our competitor's site to work for you. I've cancelled your account with us and refunded the unused portion of your fee in the form of 3 months of [competitor]'s service.*

Well my mom bought a new home and transferred service to there. Several months later, I lose my life (lost my job, my car, half my possessions from an illegal eviction, and insurmountable medical debt) and had to move in with her. Well, it was during this time that I noticed the internet would go down intermittently. At first it was during high traffic when people got home from work. Then I noticed it happened then, but also during different times through-out the day and night.

Often a call to their tech support resulted in the issue being fixed - but only temporarily. Now, whenever I called I was super polite and nice and before long I could just tell them what the problem was and we'd be back up and running in minutes. However, one call will forever stick out in my mind.

It was a typical call, I was nice and explained the problem. We got back up and running in now time. But at the very end, just before we were about to hang up, the tech support guy broke from his script and told me something that put the fear down my spine. That fear, was the fear that he would be punished for saying what he said.

What did he say? I quote:

* Tech Support Dude: ""Sir, before you hang up, I just want to thank you for being really nice to me."" At this point his voice starts to crack. ""It's been a rough day and everyone just yells at me. You are the first one I helped today that hasn't yelled at me. Thank you, I think I'll make it.""

I was absolutely floored. I told him I worked in customer service before, and while not as bad as his job I told him I have dealt with crap customers and refuse to treat anyone else that way. I told him to hang in there - gave him some quick tips that worked for me and reminded him why his job was actually important and how he will someday make loads of cash by moving up in the tech support world.

Later I was offered to do a customer survey. I rarely do those - but this time I did it and gave the poor man the highest review that I hope he ever got. I really hope he didn't get in trouble for breaking from the script and thanking me.

The pay was excellent, however, and I walked out with zero college debt and a great appreciation for women. I also can spot an escort with little effort, and I know how to find porn on computers.

Bobby had a *lot* of porn on his work computer. I get one look at a big old vagoo and call for the manager. I show her the porn, and she cringes. 

""How bad is it?"" she asks.

I flip through a couple more pictures, ""Pretty bad-- holy crap, is that Derpina?!""

We stare at a photo that is far too familiar. Derpina sits two cubes in front of Bobby, and was rumored to be dating him. I stared at the photo in abject horror as I realized the awful truth. Then it got worse.

""Oh my god, they took that photo *right here in this cube*!""

I jumped out of the chair and ran for the bathroom. Never before had I had such a severe Silkwood moment, and I've had some Mike Rowe level jobs before. This was just vile. I scrubbed my arms and made plans to burn my clothes.

But wait! There's more! He had videotaped them having sex *in the very bathroom I had just used*.

Needless to say they were both fired.

tl;dr The call is coming from inside the house.

*ETA: At the behest of a commenter, I called in the jr. manager today, who reminded me that Bobby was the son of our CTO, who had been on leave for cancer treatment at the time. Yikes! Of course she was spooked!* ಠ_ಠ

*ETA2: The Silkwood bit was for the sake of hyperbole, much like when we say we'll bleach our eyes out. I did wash my hands, and I felt gross for having seen the snatch of an undesirable, unattractive, coworker whom I disliked already. It was a moral grossness. Seriously people, sex at work at a financial company?

Ask the Delivery Guy!,1254,271,159,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/11qo5g/need_tech_support_ask_the_delivery_guy/,"This was quite some time ago but I still remember it. I had bought a new motherboard from a popular online hardware retailer in the UK (let us call them “Derpatech”) and I was having problems. The hard drive kept cutting out and it wouldn't recognise the PCI cards or USB devices at all. After I made sure the BIOS and drivers were up to date I deduced that southbridge was borked. It had a VIA logo stamped on it, so my diagnosis that it was a POS was probably a good one.

So I ring up Derpatech's tech “support.”

**Me:** “Hi! I bought this motherboard off you and I think the southbridge damaged.”

**Derpatech Monkey:** “Southbridge? Wassat?”

**Me:** “The southbridge. The I/O controller. You know, usually under northbridge.”

**Derpatech Monkey:** “I've never heard of a southbridge before!”

Ooookay, I'm clearly talking to the work experience idiot who's training consisted of: “can you say 'turn it off and on again'?” I ask to talk to someone in charge.

**Derpatech Organ Grinder:** “Hello?”

**Me:** “Hi! I was just explaining to your colleague that I think the southbridge on this new motherboard is broken.”

**Derpatech Organ Grinder:** “What's a southbridge?” 

**Me:** “...”

**Me:** “Look, can I please talk to someone who knows what they are doing?”

Time passes.

**Derpatech Organ Grinder:** “I've asked around the office and nobody has heard of a southbridge.”

**Me:** “...”

**Me:** “Motherboard no worky! Me want new one!” (or something along those lines).

Was I going mad? I was questioning if I was right because they can't be all be fucking useless... can they?

Cut to a day later when the delivery guy comes to pick up the crap mobo. We get chatting and he asks what wrong with the board. I explain the symptoms to the guy without getting technical.

**Delivery guy:** “Oh! Sounds like the southbridge is buggered!”

Cue chin hitting floor.

Yep, the delivery guy knew more about computers then Derpatech's tech support. He was trained in IT and was running packages until he could find a tech job. He was stuck in a van while group of trained monkeys were hired to by Derpatech to “help” their customers.

Life is so fair isn't it?

TL;DR If you want tech support, ring UPS!

**EDIT:** I called them up in the hope that I was wrong and the there was an easy solution I was missing, because replacing the board would be a pain in the arse.

Our users were given some cleaning wipes for their laptop. They're intended for the screen but they're alcohol wipes so they get used for cleaning all sorts of other bits.

One user wanted to use it to wipe down his keyboard, which was a bit gross to be fair, so I understood that decision. However, he didn't want to go pressing all the keys whilst he did it, for obvious reasons. This is the kind of user who would accidentally turn his screen upside down with the hotkey and then turn his monitor upside down to resolve the issue. He had spent about ten minutes carefully cleaning each key with a feather-light touch to avoid pressing any down before he plucked up the courage to ask; ""how can I disable keyboard input on my laptop?"".

I turned his laptop off. He finished cleaning his keyboard and then turned it back on again. He was absolutely gushing in his praise for my ""clever solution"" to the point of almost being patronising.

NOW I see the accidental word switch in the title... please ignore, thanks.)


Back when I started in tech support, I began with finding my own place in hell - i.e. graveyard tech support for cable modems.  

I remembered hearing the wild tech support stories going around and thinking that people *had* to be making this wacky stuff up.  No way could any of these crazier tales be real. 

Then came the day when I found out just how wrong I was.

Through the headphones came an angry customer who was bitching and swearing at me that our internet service was too fast.   He was actually demanding that we slow down his new cable internet service.

My brains nearly fell out of my ears. Wait... TOO FAST?  

The guy then launched into a rant that we owed him a new monitor too.

Uhhhhhhhh....  ooooookaaaayyyy....

Somehow I managed to calm him down long enough to actually explain the situation.   He angrily explained to me that 3 days after his new internet connection was installed, his monitor caught on fire.   This was ""OBVIOUSLY"" because the increased speed of his new internet connection made his monitor heat up and burn.  

And dammit, it was our fault. Which meant he wanted a new monitor and a slower internet internet speed to go with it.   That way the replacement monitor would not suffer the same fate as the one he already had.

I spent 20 minutes trying somehow to get through to this guy that the one had nothing to do with the other.   Didn't work.

Finally he told me that his wife had told him that the cable modem had nothing to do with the monitor heating up.   I told him to go talk to his wife, and FINALLY he got off the phone.

That was the day I finally became a tech support believer.

So, to encourage ""margin growth"" he allowed all the techs to set hardware prices in the field, independently, without phoning home. This is a fine idea if you employ competent people. Him, not so much. The techs were paid a commission of 20% off the profit on the hardware sale. So the more money they made for the company, the more money they made themselves.

This is another story from my last job as an outsourced tech support consultant in the U.S. To tl;dr it, I worked for a large cable/internet company on the East Coast. 

This was before I was a supervisor and still taking phone calls. My day consisted of taking about 40 calls a day from varying levels of idiots who don't know how to operate their TV sets, computers, cable boxes, routers, printers, and (on one occasion) treadmill.

This call was from a gentleman in California (yes I helped primarily the East Coast but I also did West Coast) who was having trouble with a wireless printer. I ran through the usual questions regarding the printer and the wireless as a whole. His laptop was having wireless connection issues, we we troubleshot that. After about 5 minutes of configuration we were able to get the laptop connected with the new WPA key that I provided him. However, when he input the new info into the printer, it still failed to work. It was a newer printer, so it wasn't a compatibility problem, so I told him as much and that further support would need to come from the printer manufacturer. 

Obviously, people don't like to hear ""Your shit's broke."" 

This guy blew up. I mean, full blown Hulk-mode. He started swearing and cursing and telling me he spent more on his printer than I paid for rent per month and that I was an idiot and didn't know how to do my job and that he wanted a supervisor. Well I am a bit stubborn on issues where my supervisor would say ""NMFP"", so I told him that we couldn't support 3rd party hardware/software and that everything on our end was fine. I politely reminded him that ""Your router's configuration is outside of our support boundaries to assist with further."" In response, he says ""Suck my dick you asshole"", trying to goad me into making a mistake. 

I reply, without skipping a beat, ""I'm sorry sir, but fellating you is outside my support boundaries, not to mention you are on the other side of the country. Is there anything else I can assist with today?""

He slammed the phone onto the hook so hard I was afraid he might have damaged it. I found out he called back later and got the same thing from one of my friends, and my story became a bit of a legend among my agents when I became a supervisor.

About a week passes, and my mom comes upstairs with a sealed manilla envelope, containing an ipod and a really, really long list.  Just over 250 songs.  So I proceed to take the envelope upstairs and begin my work.  I look at the list......and see the most racist, offensive, hateful songs I have ever seen -- mostly involving extreme hardcore rap.  I'd say about 90% of the songs are not appropriate for 12 year old girls.  

So I bring the list downstairs and show my mom, explaining that I couldn't in good conscience give a 12 year old girl an ipod with that kind of garbage on it.  I had also known Pat (my mom's friend) my entire life and know that there is no chance in hell that the girl in question would have been allowed to listen to that stuff.

As a result, the girl gets grounded for about a month.  I then receive the ipod back and a much more abbreviated list of songs -- of the 250+ songs originally listed, only 42 made it past parental scrutiny.  So I pop her ipod in and get to work.

This may sound a bit odd, as I'm an IT guy, but I had never dealt with an ipod before this.  I never had the need for one, and nobody in my small circle of friends had one.  So I spent a couple of minutes fumbling around, half trying to figure out how it worked, and half out of the usual ""what does this do?"" curiosity that comes with a new device.  That's when I stumbled across her pictures.   And that's when shit went downhill.  Fast.

The very first picture that loaded up was a picture of her, completely topless, with only her hands covering herself.   Shit.  A million thoughts went through my head.  Do I call the cops, or do I call her dad?   Could this girl be being abused, or is she just doing some harmless experimenting?  If I call her dad and she's being abused, I make the problem worse.  If I call the cops and this is just a case of a 12 year old exploring her body, I could throw the entire family into unimaginable hell for nothing.  

I call my wife over and she looks at the picture.  ""Does she own a laptop or a webcam?"".  ""No"", I said.  ""Well, then there's someone else in that room, because she's got both hands on her chest, which means someone else is working that camera.""  Fuck.  She's right.

In a (probably misguided) effort to try to figure out what was going on, I looked to see if there were any other pictures.  And I stumbled upon a complete folder, several of which contained similar pictures, but also contained pictures of herself making out, topless, with a 13 year old boy, taken at the same time.  So at least we knew who the mystery photographer was, along with knowing the reason behind the pictures' existence.

But now here's the situation -- I've got to explain to Pat and her husband that her daughter's ipod contains pictures of their 12 year old daughter naked with (and possibly screwing) a 13 year old boy.   There is really no good way to explain this to anyone, ever.  

So I go downstairs and wake my mom up.  ""Just come upstars, Mom.  I can't really explain it.  You're better off seeing this for yourself.""  So my mom throws on her robe and starts stomping up the stairs, basically mumbling ""....wake me up on a sunday morning this had better be fucking imporOHMYGODWHATTHEFUCKISTHAT!?!?!!?""

My mom almost had a heart attack when she saw the pictures.  She rushes downstairs, calls Pat, and frantically starts trying to explain the situation, but isn't doing a very good job.  Unknown to me, Pat hands the phone to her husband so she can go and confront her daughter.  My mom then hands me the phone.  Here I am thinking I'm talking to Pat, when I'm now stuck trying to explain to her husband what's going on.  Needless to say, this was the most awkward conversation I have ever had in my life.  

I explain exactly what's on the ipod to an increasingly furious John.  Outside of the occasional ""mmm-hmm"", the only words out of his mouth were ""I'm on my way over"".  A few minutes later, here comes John.  Pat's in the car, with an obviously sulking daughter in the back seat.  I explain to John:  ""Are you sure you want to see this?  They're pretty graphic, and what you see you can't unsee"".  He looked at the first picture for about 1/8th of a second before turning away and saying ""Ok, I've seen enough.  Thanks.  I'm on my way to the boy's house next.""  I can only imagine how *that* conversation went.

The songs, by the way, never did make it onto the ipod.

-Hello yes I'm very frustrated right now.  I've been trying to email some photos for an hour and it's not working.  I think there's something wrong with my computer.  I have to get this done NOW.  I have a very important conference in five minutes.


+OK, let me help you with that.  What kind of computer are you using?

+Great.  Hold down the Ctrl key on your keyboard, and left-click on each one you want to attach. [Extended period of silence]  Were you able to select your photos?


-No, that doesn't do anything!


+But you see your photos?  Let go of the Ctrl key and just try selecting one.  Is it highlighted?


-What do you mean highlighted?


+Did you select a photo?


-Yes.


+What happens if you click on ""attach""?


-Nothing!  Is there someone there who knows what they're doing?  This is extremely urgent.


+Ma'am, I do apologize, but if you are clicking on the file name it should appear highlighted, meaning you have selected it.


-It doesn't have a name!  It's a photo!


+...You mean it's an actual photo?  As in a print?


-Of course you moron!


+You told me they were on your computer.


-They're on it right now!  And I'm late for my meeting!  I'm calling back and you better believe I'm going to talk to your supervisor.


+Well Ma'am I do apologize, but you would need to get those photos scanned into a digital format before you could email them.  I've created a ticket for this issue and I'm sending it to my boss right now.  He'll be expecting your call.

I quoted her ~$200 and she paid.  When the LCD arrived, I installed it and upon turning the computer on the power light began to strobe.  After trying a few things, I arrived at the conclusion that the MB was shot. I called her &amp; told her about the issue, and she wanted me to see if I could fix it. 

I called her back with a price on the motherboard replacement and she said she would call me back.  TWO YEARS PASS, then one day she shows up on my doorstep wanting her computer.  By this time, I had taken my screen back off of it, and assuming it had been abandoned (I'd called her several times and always got the answer ""I'll be by there next week"") so I had repurposed the hard drive as well.  I reminded her of the motherboard issue, and she wants to know what I can do about it.  
I told her I would call her back.  I found an exact laptop on ebay for $150, so since she had paid me over $200, I would still be in the clear on it.  I bought the laptop, reloaded it fresh, and gave her a call.  A week or so later, she picks it up and within a week is calling me screaming at me saying that isn't her laptop.  No shit, woman, I told you that.

Nothing else was heard for another two weeks, until one day I was riding by my shop and saw two cars parked there.  I went back and stopped and it was her and another client of mine.  The male client told me that she had called him because his information was on her computer.  They have identical computers.  I offered to remove the information from her computer to placate both of them but she began to rant about that not being her computer (which she knew she was getting another one) so I gave her the remaining pieces of her old one.  The guy was threatening to sue me for putting his information on her computer (which I didn't do) and she was threatening to put his medical and tax records out on the internet if I didn't give her $1,200.00 for a new computer.

I told them both to go f*ck themselves long and hard.

She kept calling me every day, and finally I called the police fraud unit and told them what was going on.  They already knew me because I had helped recover nearly 20 stolen laptops that had been brought in to me from various burglaries in town.

My guess is that the two clients knew each other, and hatched this hairbrained scheme to get a new computer.

I work for the internal help desk for an electronics/computer retailer. We're obviously a tech-based
company so you'd expect our employees to be at least tech-aware, if not competent. However I'm sure you're all 
well aware that this isn't always the case.

The other day I had a call from User 'X', his problem was that he couldn't recieve emails from a paritcular user group 'Y'.
He could receive emails from other users, just not anyone in this group. Whenever they tried to send him an email, it bounced
an email back containing an error message.

Luckily for me, he was currently in the office with this particular user group. So being the lean, mean diagnosing machine 
that I am, I asked him to get a member of this group to forward me a copy of the email that they got whenever they tried to 
e-mail him. A simple request right? Forwarding an e-mail, nothing complicated.

So the user set about doing this; he seemed to be taking a long time so I asked him if everything was ok and he said he was just
sorting it out. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and waited for him to finish.

After a few more minutes he told me he'd sent the email and I saw it pop up in my inbox. I opened it up and I was gobsmacked by
what I found.

He hadn't just forwarded the E-mail like I'd asked. No; that would have been too simple.

Instead he'd printed the original email off. He'd then taken that printed email and scanned it back onto the computer and 
saved it as a PDF. He then attached this PDF to another email and sent it to me.

How does this even process in someones brain? In what world does it make sense to print something OFF the computer and then 
scan it back ON?

This guy works for a technology company. Makes me despair.

**SIR, THE GOOMBAS ARE DANCING AGAIN.**

""And that's why you don't play Evelynn. Ever,"" I said, clicking CONTINUE at the end of the League of Legends game I'd been playing with a coworker and exiting.

""She's more useless than a solar-powered flashlight,"" he chuckled as he left the shared tech room.

Sure enough, the phone on my desk rang, and the office manager shot me an AIM message telling me who it was.

&gt;Hey, Dr. XXXXXXXXX is on the line. They want to start doing some new stuff, MXX wouldn't tell me what. Mind picking up?

I shrug and reply.

&gt;Sure, why not. It's not like she doesn't have my damn cell number SOMEHOW.

So I get on the phone, and sure enough, it's the doctor's wife, who just happened to be the practice manager.

""Hi, Jack! How are you?""

Oh, this was not a good sign. She was cheerful and effusive, and whenever a client is like that around me, I get very, VERY worried very quickly. Sure enough, my suspicions were warranted.

""I could be better, I could be worse, MXX. What's going on down in your neck of the woods?""

""Well, the doctor has decided that we're going to start doing remote clinics next month, and we need to be able to work remotely. We're also worried about his medical study data. When you come down, can you take a look?""

""... MXX, you're aware that it's the end of the month? When is his start date for the remote clinic and who's going with him?""

""Well, we're starting in two weeks at one of the local hospitals. We also have two techs who are going with him, and they need laptops. Can we get them iPads? That would be so neat!""

""MXX, give me a minute.""

I hit mute on the phone and opened up the 4U case under my desk with a pair of old P4 Xeons and a SuperMicro board in it. However, since the PSUs were dead, it was a perfect place to hide a bottle of Glenlivet, and after a swig of the wonderful elixir (which purged by fire the invectives that were pooling up in my mouth), I unmuted her and continued.

""Okay. I'm going to send you a quote. You're going to approve it, call our Derp rep, and get what's on it ordered immediately. Without it, you can't do secure remote desktop.""

""A server? Those are expensive! We were going to do GoToMyPC on their computers and then let our temps use their computers while they're not at the office so we don't have to buy new machines. Can't you do it without buying a server?""

My eye twitched, and I resisted the urge to reach for the 4U case's blessed contents again.

""We have to account for security, remember? You're passing HIPAA-protected info into the medical record software. On top of that, you also have your credit card machine on the network. Finally, GoToMyPC will take up the machine when it's in use. Your temps won't be able to do anything with the machines, and you'll need new ones as is. Seriously, you really need to have a proper server for this. On a not entirely unrelated note, did you read the e-mail I sent you about the echocardiogram storage requirements? Storing a year of ECGs on a single non-RAID'd hard drive is just asking for disaster.""

""Well, Jack, he needs to be able to view them anywhere, and sometimes GoToMyPC just isn't fast enough!""

""MXX, I've said it before, it's been in writing three times now. This firm will NOT be held liable if you keep doing that if - no, WHEN - you suffer data loss. You're disregarding the advice of people who've seen everything, and we've offered to build you a storage server for them for months, but you've turned us down on a cost basis. What's cheaper - a server and maintenance, or a data loss incident under HIPAA?""

After a bit of negotiation, she agreed to order the quote I sent out for the TS server, but not the storage one (they went through a terabyte of data a year of ECGs, and this was a few months after the flood in Thailand, so drives were insanely expensive). I specced out a cheap little TS box - hardware and licensing, plus Office Enterprise licenses, came out to about three grand US.

A few days later, it arrived at my office. Surprisingly, the two small Latitude laptops I'd put into the quote for TS purposes weren't in there. I prepped the box, set up everything, and drove it the hundred miles to their office to set it up at the end of a day.

**END USERS WILL BE ENDED**

- - -

I pulled up to their main clinic around seven or eight,
And I yelled to the cabby - 

Wait, I was driving, and I made it there around four or so. Once I got there, I took the server inside and unlocked the comms closet, then stared in disbelief at the contents.

My previously-pristine comms closet was covered in boxes of crap like old phones, P4 Sony laptops, and even an ultralight Toshiba Satellite P1 laptop.

I made room for the server, punted the old gear to the side on the shelving, and powered it on. After joining it to the domain, I did my normal checks on the already-in-place server, saw that everything was good - the SQL database was backing up properly, nothing foul was in the error logs, the usual.

After that, I beelined it to the practice admin's office and sat down with a cup of coffee in my hands. She was a typical WASP suburban lacrosse mom - blonde, mid-40s, rail-thin, cocksure of herself, refuses to take no for an answer, the kind of soccer mom you just love to hate.

""Look, MXX, I have the remote desktop server up and running. It's tested, and your users can log in remotely from anywhere. They have EMR access, Office, printer access, they can fax out from your giant MFD, the whole nine yards. My question is this - where did the laptops go? I quoted two out on the Premier quote, but they weren't there with the server.""

""Oh, well, we didn't order them, the techs said they'd bring their personal laptops and they could use those! And the doctor's going to use his iPad, too, so we don't need anything for him.""

""... right, okay, here's the reasons that's a bad idea. One: your EMR isn't designed for iPad use, so he would go crazy trying to use the thing over remote desktop. We went over that before when he tried it with LogMeIn to his desktop and the studies. Two: their personal laptops aren't under warranty, I'm not going to drive 100 miles each way to fix them when they break and can't work. That's why we buy Derp, because the hardware can be replaced next business day without me needing to be here. Three: you didn't upgrade your Internet tier like I asked. I'd asked you to get a static IP and to go to 30 down and 10 up, and Speedtest said today that you're at 8 down and 512K up. If you don't make the call, I'll do it, since you put me on as technical contact on the account last week. I'm going to do my regular support checks on the workstations here, and once I'm done, I'll be driving back to Austin.""

The clinic closed down while I was checking each machine, and as I had the alarm code, I could get out after I was done. I winced when I looked over the doctor's computer and saw the single 1TB WD MyBook was still there - the one with the year of ECGs on it.

Everything checked out okay, and I put it in writing, again, along with the results of all my scans and checks, that she needed to get the storage server ASAP. At that point, I buggered off to Austin, and fell asleep with the sleep of the just.

- - -

**OF COURSE, THAT'S WHEN EVERYTHING WENT TO CRAP**

- - -

Two days later, at six AM, my personal cell (!) rang.

Not my office cell, my PERSONAL cell.

Blearily, I answered it, and the practice manager's shrill voice rang through.

""Our entire network is down! Your new server broke the network and we can't see any patients!""

After answering that nothing I did could have caused it, I showered, got ready, and drove the hundred miles to her office, after calling my boss to let him know that I had an emergency there that day.

I was greeted there with the sight of the staff lounging around, waiting for things to come back up, and one even sarcastically greeted me, calling me the ""best tech ever"" and the only hope for the office.

I would have gone Biblical on this - as in Sodom and Gomorrah, pillars of fire, the whole nine yards - but one staffer who I rather liked quietly passed me a venti white mocha she'd gotten for me from Starbucks when she heard I was rushing down there, and the whole thing about finding one good person and sparing everyone came into play. As I gratefully accepted it and took a sip, my anger mellowed, and I plugged my laptop into the network to try to get things working.

&gt;IP Address: 169.254.x.x

&gt;(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

DHCP wasn't handing out addresses, but I was damn sure I didn't enable the DHCP role on the TS box. Grumbling, I turned on my cell's tethering feature to get some connectivity without touching their network. The wireless scan on my laptop showed the network I made called GotRoot... and... wait, why is there a network named NETGEAR...

NETGEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR

I loaded up a spectrum analyzer and started tracing the access point. Sure enough, one of the users had a cheap piece of shit WGR614 router with patch in the switch ports going to both his machine and the wall. The minute I ripped that out, the network came back up.

Confronting the user in front of the practice manager led to more rage - ""well, I wanted to use my iPad, but I couldn't find the wireless network, so I plugged this in, but it didn't work, and nothing seemed wrong, so yeah.""

The practice manager piped up, ""It's okay with me, I told him that he could put in wireless for his iPad! We didn't think we'd need you to do THAT, since all we needed was a wireless router, that's what the guy at Derp Squad said.""

""Don't. Do. This."" I turned to the practice manager. ""If you want wireless, I'll be glad to order and configure you a Cisco access point so that it'll work perfectly, and even give you guest wifi for the people in the front. This isn't the first time I've warned you about ordering and putting gear in without letting me know. If this happens again, my boss finds out about it. He's said that he's fired clients for that before. Meanwhile, I'm calling Slime Warner and upgrading your connection like I said we needed.""

I turned to her on the way out of her office.

""Oh, did you look over that quote for the storage server I sent you? That's better and safer than that LaCie RAID external I see sitting on your desk, the one that I most specifically recommended against buying.""

By the end of the day, I'd put a dent in her available credit card balance by purchasing a Cisco 1142AGN. After configuring it, all was good, and TW had upped their connection to something usable. I drove back to Austin, and crashed hard again.

The company has an excellent reputation and quite a bit of business. (wasn't uncommon to run 6+ dispatches a day)  

You would call the office, and the in house tech would schedule appointments and we would show up within 1 hour of the scheduled time. If it was a DEAR ticket (Drop everything and run) you paid a premium for the immediate service @ 3x standard rate on the first hour. (375$)

So I'm scheduled for 5 dispatches that day.  I get a call from the office wanting to know if I can fit in a sixth. ( I was paid commission so of course!)

So I sync to the dispatch board and find out the last appointment is scheduled for ASAP (something we usually don't do) since he did not want to pay the premium. (red flag #1) 

The dispatch explains that there are 5 more ahead of him and I will call as soon as possible.

So every hour on the hour I'm getting a message from the office wanting to know my status. The guy keeps calling wanting to know if I'm going to show up or not. (Red flag #2)

So I plow through my tickets and call him at 3 in the afternoon and let him know it will take me 45 minutes to drive from Whitewater to Indio in afternoon traffic and I am on my way, I could tell by the sound of his voice he was frazzled and desperate and angry. (red flag #3)  
   
I arrive on site a... convenience store -- we will call them pm/am. 

I brief the guy and its pretty simple, He needs to be able to see his cameras that he had just installed in the store on his phone (some cheap LG) as well as across the internet.  A couple simple port forwards and I should be out of there...  he's sweating like a hooker in church the entire time, and he's really irritated. (Red flag #4) 

 Turns out the guy is what you would call green.  He decided to reset the router he jacked the DVR into thinking it would make everything work... taking out pretty much every payment option except cash... ATM EBT, Credit Cards, Pay at the pump and the registration info between the router and the ISP costing the store a significant amount of business.

I ask him why didn't the In house IT take care of this for him since its a corporate network. (Red flag #5)   He has no documentation or authority to do anything with the network since he is a contractor and there's no manager there and he doesn't want anyone to know what he's done.
So I take pity on the guy and call the ISP and get the router back online, Port forward all of the payment equipment, configure the DVR credentials and make everything work, but the DVR only worked with Iphone then ask him for payment.

 He's telling me I haven't done the work since he can't see it on his phone.  I explain to the guy I'm sorry but LG phones aren't supported for the web access, and even bring it up on my laptop tethered to my phone proving my work. 
 
  After a call to the boss to fill him in with what was going on he tells me no good deed goes unpunished and to do what I feel.

I give him 4 options. Pay me, call the police and file theft of service, call the store manager ask them for my money and fill him in on what's happened (costing them even more money) or I could flash the router, format the DVR back to factory settings and let him explain to the store manager that he's killed the profits for the day as well as the network and take a wash.    

I packed up my laptop and notes,  reset the DVR and told him this is his last chance to pay up before I walk out the door, this part only takes a few minutes to fix and I won't even tack on the extra 30$ for the time.

His reply was ""I called you at 10 this morning and you didn't show up until 4! then you take 4 hours to do it! I can't see it on my phone so you aren't finished and you expect me to pay you almost 450$?""

At this time it's not about the money, I want satisfaction and I'm gonna make this guy sweat even if I have to take a wash and tell him ""if you aren't paying me you damn sure aren't keeping the work.""

 So I reset the router  borking the network again and he's right back where he started in the hot seat. The look on his face was well worth it.

 On the way out of the store the clerks ask if the payments are down again and I politely tell them unfortunately our friend her doesn't want to pay me so I'm leaving everything the way I found it and they will have to deal with telling the customers it's cash only and I'm sorry.

On my way out the door I notice that the store manager's number is on the front of the store and called him on my drive home, I informed him of what's happened and explain to them I have all the notes and could fix everything in an hour the next day as long as they would pay me for the time I was already there for as well as the next days time which was agreed to.

TLDR: Newbie trashes a business network installing something he doesn't fully understand costing a busy store 80% of a days worth of business, tries to lay his burden on my shoulders to cover it up after pressuring me all day wanting to be cheap. I do the professional thing and do the work anyways and then he refuses to pay so... I threw him to the wolves and still got paid twice! The cherry on top was costing him the work for the rest of the store chain.

I work in a small business that supports other small business in our local area.

One day, we have a call about a Terminal Server not working correctly. Being the one who got the call, I connect to the server and notice that there is almost no space left on the drive!

I did the first thing that came to mind : empty the recycle bin! 5gb of space! Check other things (find why the disk was full).

Later that day, I receive another phone call from a women who works for that company telling me she (and her 2 female co-workers) doesn't find her files anymore. I ask her a couple of questions and ask her where they store their files (it didn't seems like they used the shared drives). She then tells me they use the Recycle Bin to share files since it's ""faster"". (remember, it's a Terminal Server) They delete the files and the other person just go in the Recycle Bin and drags it out to her desktop and work on it. She would then delete it again to put it back in the bin. At the end of the week, they would get everything out and place it in the shared folders.

I was shocked. I was trying not to laugh at the phone. She then asked me to get the files from the backup and I tell her that we don't take the Recycle Bin in our backup (they have limited storage). After much arguments, I had to ask her : ""Would you put important paper in your trash can expecting to take em back tomorrow? And would you call the trash collectors to get your papers back?""

I talked to her boss and we finally sent someone to explain to those ladies how to share documents without using the Recycle Bin.

I have a couple bring me their desktop we will call Dick and Jane. I usually do the diagnosis before you leave and have you sign the all the necessary paperwork before I touch anything. 

After taking 10 minutes to do a hardware diagnostic everything tests out fine. XP takes another 15 to get to a desktop. The drive isn't jam packed so its not the page file it's obviously a bad infestation. The honorable thing to do is nuke/reroll for a flat fee since something that dirty will run up an hourly bill pretty quickly.

Dick and Jane sign off and away I go. 

So I roll the machine up patch updated installed drivers and AV and configure for best performance. More or less true barebones. No shovelware no unnecessary programs. 

Call Dick and Jane and tell them to come and get their machine it's ready. They are pleased it was finished in the same day and gladly paid signed off and left happy as clams.

I'm thinking great another satisfied customer who will spread the good word.

Fast forward two weeks later.....I get a phone call from Jane ""This machines doing exactly what it was doing before and I want it fixed again under warranty"" 

Now good children I do not offer any kind of warranty unless it comes from new hardware manufacturer and it even says so in the paperwork since there is no telling what they have installed or picked up off the interwebs but I do believe in standing behind my work.

So I tell her ma'am I'll gladly take a look. Bring it by and if it's something I have overlooked I will be glad to take care of the problem however if it's not my fault you will still have to pay me for the diagnostic and decide if you want me to repair it for you again. 

Here comes Dick and Jane a second time. 

Again the hardware is fine and I'm getting long boot times so obviously it's something they have done, either installed or picked up off the internet.

After explaining that I have to charge the diagnostic fee and it's up to them to decide if they want it fixed again, Dick is furious and Jane is more intrigued to know what is going on seeing as this machine was just repaired.

Dick is obstinate to the fact that he couldn't have done anything to mess up the machine and he shouldn't have to pay since he knows how to use a computer and Jane says go ahead she wants to know what's going on. 

So one of the first things I find is registry mechanic installed on the task bar and programs list. You know the so called Speed up/Optimize your machine software that is really masked malware. But good Reddit I'm obviously preaching to the choir here about the effects of such things. 

I politely explain to Jane that the malware was installed by someone voluntarily more than likely thinking it was a good program and give the ""Free click here are the most dangerous words on the internet"" sermon as I already optimize the config before it leaves the shop as part of my OS reload service. 

However, I must bill them for the diagnostic, and if they like I would keep the virus removal at a flat fee of 1 hour if they would like me to fix everything a second time. (half the cost of the last service they rendered.)

Dick at this point is flushed and Jane flatly says that this should be covered by warranty seeing as my build allowed something to infect her machine and that my antivirus didn't work yaddah yaddah. 

So I pull out the paperwork and show her that there is no implied warranty on the operating system but there is on hardware if any is purchased. And explain that no antivirus is perfect if it were there would be no viruses on the internet.

I launch IE to check windows update just to make sure its completely patched and behold the browsers hijacked to some free meet women stuff you see all over the internet.

This clues me into someone surfing pr0n. So I check the cookie cache and lo and behold its chock full of cookies from pr0n sites and state that the dirtiest places on the internet are these kind of sites. Dick is red faced and Jane's pissed seeing as the timestamps are when she's at work (LOL). 

Dick decides it's time to go and he's NOT PAYING ME FOR ANYTHING and Jane's pissed at Dick for obvious reasons. But he still thinks she shouldn't Have to pay me a dime even for the diagnostic. 

Well I don't touch a machine before the paperwork is signed. EVER. And tell them I will be holding their equipment until the diagnostic is paid. ( I Have paperwork signed agreeing to this)

He say's that my paperwork doesn't mean shit and tells me they are taking his machine and leaving so I simply say if you touch the machine and I don't have my money expect the police to come knocking on your door for theft of service and robbery after calling in the tag on your car. 

He's looking like he's ready to rip my head off. She's looking at him like she's ready to rip his head off and I show them the sign on the wall showing that machines left on open invoice after 30 days will be sold to cover any outstanding balance and they storm off.

An hour later they come back with my money and I send them on their merry way and thank them for their business but I'm not interested in doing anymore work for them.

TL;DR ""A couple brings in a machine to get fixed, and it gets done. Everything is good. Husband infests machine with malware and gets browser hijacked while browsing porn, comes back 2 weeks later trying to con me into a second fix for free, I expose his porn habits as the root of the problem. Husband is mad at me, wife is mad at husband, I stand my ground, get paid, then fire the clients."".

I was the only one at my work that had any understanding of computers, so by default, I was the go-to guy.

~ ~ ~ *Wavy lines to indicate the backward journey in time* ~ ~ ~

Many, many moons ago, I worked at a highway service center, in the fuel bar section.  At the end of each shift, we would tally up the sales and count the cash, and enter all the data into an Excel spreadsheet.  One of the glories of being a 'shift boss' was that it was your responsibility to balance the shift.

I had been a grunt for awhile pumping fuel; then a shift boss.  I then worked my way up to managing the place.  It was a 24-hour business, so there was always work to do.  I would spend a fair bit of time in the office, preparing bank deposits, etc at the end of my shift.

One evening, I finished at 4, and wandered over to the office.  I was deep into my deposit balancing, when I got a call on my cell phone.  No one ever calls me on my cell phone unless its a work emergency.  So I answer the phone, and the guy who was working in the fuel bar starts rattling in my ear. ""The computer's broken ohmygodidon'tknowwhattodocan you heeeellp!""

I turned to the CCTV, and watched the poor chap as he begged for help.

""What's the problem?""  I ask.  I can hear a steady beeping sound in the background.

""I don't know what happened, but the shift end computer is beeping I think it's going to explode or something.  Can you come back and help?  I know you're probably at home relaxing and everything, but IDONTKNOWWHATTODOOOO!""

It dawns on me that he doesn't realise I'm still on site, tucked away in the office.  I can also see, in the CCTV, exactly what's causing the issue.

""You're seriously going to make me come back to work? Is it really that big a deal?""

He was practically in tears. ""Pleeeeeeease, come in!""

""I've already had a few beers, I would be drinking and driving, you know,""  I lied.

""Oh shit, whatamigunna dooooooo!""

""Relax, buddy,""  I say.  ""I'll be there as quick as I can.""  I add as much exasperation in to my voice as I can.

""Thanks buddy, I owe you one!""  he sighed with obvious relief.

I decided I would let him sweat for a few minutes.  I finished off my deposit homework, and closed the safe, and left the office, being careful to lock the door behind me.

I then strolled over to the fuel bar, until I got close, then I started sprinting - running as fast as I could into the fuel bar, panting heavily.

My colleague looked at me in shock - we had spoken only about three minutes ago, and I lived a half hour drive away.  

""I broke the speed limit getting here.  This better be good,"" I growled, as I ran up to the computer.

The computer was still howling away, in what did sound rather distressing.

Without breaking eye contact, I went to the computer, and gently lifted the book he had accidentally placed on the keyboard, which was holding down some buttons, which was making the computer beep because it didn't like the constant input from the keyboard.

The beeping stopped.

""Oh, shit"" he said, in a very small voice.

""It's alright, dude.  I was in the office when you rang and I could see the book in the camera.""

He didn't think it was funny that I made him wait three minutes with the beeping, in utter panic.

At one point, our company had customers call in to set up their dial-up connection manually via Setup Wizard in Windows. For some people, this became a daunting task... so we made setup CDs that automatically created the connection.

""I spilled wine on the keyboard."" (... Okay, you need a new keyboard. In theory you could try and clean it, but that keyboard is old, you've got the money, and a new keyboard is cheap. Not worth the effort.)


""Oh, and when I was trying to clean off the keyboard I hit something, and the monitor turned upside-down.""


That got a chuckle out of me. I used to use that keyboard shortcut (Control-Alt-Up and Control-Alt-Down) to mess with people, so I knew immediately what had happened. I say ""Oh, that's nothing. I'll go take a look at it."" Now I know why my girlfriend and I got a dinner invitation last week, just a couple of days before Thanksgiving.


I head down into the basement, where the computer lives (along with, apparently, half the dust in the Western hemisphere).

I work at my Uni's tech support center, and I think that's the reason I haven't experienced the ""OH GOD WHY"" moments you all talk about. I'm not saying that being in college makes you better at computers (I think you guys prove that false with the Medical Doctor and PHD stories), but we tend to have a younger crowd than the general populace, and that seems to mean less I-know-absolutely-nothing-about-this-magic-box people. But we still do get some, as evidenced here.

It's a normal Monday morning, when I sit down at my desk, pull up reddit, and wait for my shift to start. You're not supposed to start working until the official office hours, to discourage people from calling in too early, but we get quantitative brownie points if we show up early that can be used as a buffer if you fuck up. It's juvenile, I know, but the help desk employs us college kids, so whatever. Anyway, I pull up my support queue, and one of the entries catches my eye: ""My computer won't stop ejaculating"". I reread it a couple of times to makes sure that my brain's not just screwing with me, and open up the details of the ticket. Obviously, there are none. So I call up the number, as we aren't allowed to close tickets for insufficient info, and here's my conversation with the girl who picks up:




Me: Hi this is $UNI tech support, I'm calling in response to the ticket you submitted yesterday.

Her: Oh my god! Thank you for responding! I can't get my computer to stop ejaculating!

Me: [At least she's polite and grateful] I'm sorry, can you please describe what's going on?

Her: It just won't stop ejaculating! I tried turning it off and back on, but it just starts ejaculating as soon as I log in.

Me: [Well, at least she tried rebooting] Err... Can you tell me exactly what it does after rebooting?

Her: I'm really not good with this computer stuff, can you just come down and fix it?




I talk to my supervisor, who laughs, and since it's a slow day, tells me to go down and check it out. I'm pretty sure I know what she means, but if I'm right, I'll have to go there anyway. So I head over to her dorm room, and I can hear it as she opens the door. It's her CD tray, constantly opening and closing. After correcting her on the usage of ejected vs. ejaculated, I take a look at the computer. It's a tower, which surprises me, since she has a macbook on her desk, and she doesn't seem like the type to have use for a tower. Apparently, there are some files and programs on there that she needs, but they're too big to email over. Facepalm/headdesk, but whatever, I'm not saying anything as long as she's happy with it. The problem turns out to be some program that keeps tying to burn a disk, and put itself in startup. I kill it, and the CD tray is exorcised (circumcised?). She doesn't remember installing this program, and I've never heard of it before, so I scan it, but it doesn't seem to be a virus. Since she doesn't need it, I ask her and delete the program anyway. I also run mbam, since she her browsing habits must be awesome if she managed to install whatever that was. Not really an eventful story, but it makes me chuckle.

One of the users came in with some questions regarding his issued RAZR connecting to our exchange servers, as well as a few other questions. I solved the exchange issue, and went on with the questions.

He was demonstrating how he was unable to close open apps with the home button.... His problem? He kept missing the button. But that is because he held the phone in one hand and pointed with his other hand. He would pull his hand back about a foot and stab at the screen with all his might. Enough to cause a tech in the back look around the corner to figure out who was drumming on a cell phone.

After I told him his spear was missing the button, he went on to demonstrate how his technique works, but just didnt right now. He holds the phone where I can see it and opens his web browser. Lo and behold, RedTube. He freaks out and pulls the phone back, while I pretend like I was looking at my computer screen at the time. He stands there flustered, continuing stabbing the screen for LITERALLY 2 minutes trying to close the offending window. He misses terribly and must have hit the play button because the room fills with the sound of an orgasm. I told him he needs to gently tap the home button. He listens, closes the browser and tells me ""thank you, I will be back with more questions later."" And runs.

Just yesterday, I had a customer come in to our store with a generic Presario desktop.  ""I want to upgrade the processor in this.""  A simple request, and we have processors in-store, so I say ""Okay, what kind of power are you looking for?""  I walk him through the different options and prices to give him an idea of what it's likely to cost.  Now it's time to open the rig to verify what socket type he has.

My heart sank as I removed the side panel.  I could see the tell-tale fan-less heatsink of a soldered E-350 processor.  I knew this was about to get ugly, but I had no idea what I was up against.

I looked up at him and said, ""Ah, I see you have a soldered processor.  Unfortunately, that means that if you want to upgrade it, you'll need a new motherboard that has an actual socket, so I can put a new processor in it.""  His response? ""When I called this morning, I was told you could just replace the processor""

""Ah, well, that's true of most computers, but your cpu is physically soldered to the board with advanced equipment.  We're not a manufacturer, so unfortunately, we don't have the gear required to de-solder a processor.  We can get you a new motherboard, a better one even, but that's the only way we'll be able to upgrade your processor.""

""The guy said you could solder it.  I used to solder all the time, why can't you solder it?""

I show him some pictures to explain the problem.  He seems to understand that we aren't going to be able to do this.  I quoted him $200 for a good, solid upgrade (including labor), but told him that he'd likely need an OS re-install afterwards, because switching Mobo's can sometimes cause issues.  He says he needs to make some calls first.  I thought it was to discuss if he could afford it.  Nope!  This is what he tells me when he comes back in:

""I just got off the phone with WorstBuy, where I got this, and they said they can solder this new processor in, no problem.  I'll take this over there and have them do it.""

In case you didn't know, the E-350 processor is less than 2cm on a side.  He wanted an AM3+ processor.  I point this out, but he's convinced that ""NerdSquad"" can pull it off.  I advise him that if he brings the processor back damaged, he can't return it, and that they'll likely quote him more than it would have cost to let us do it.  He goes through with it.  I go back to my desk and imagine his face when NerdSquad tells him they can't do what he wants.  A grin makes its way across my face as I return to work, the schadenfreude keeping me entertained until closing.

tl;dr: That bottom-of-the-range computer is going to end up costing you more than you think.

(I'll update if/when he comes back)

Edit: grammar.   Also, this post has certainly received more love than I was expecting, and I'm thoroughly enjoying the comments.  Thanks guys!

At long last:  THE UPDATE!!!

I just got in touch with one of the techs that was on duty today, and the guy came back in, looking defeated, to return the unopened processor, muttering something about buying a motherboard and processor himself.  I guess the silver lining is that they didn't try to rip him off, or did it so blatantly, even he understood what was going on.

Ladies and gentlemen of /r/techsupport. I present to you: My Mother.

My mother has the rare gift of being computer poison. Somehow she manages to break every computer she even glances at at the speed of light. You know how the X-Men's Kitty Pryde destroys electronics when she phases through them? My mother only needs to glance at something more complex than a toaster and it implodes.

But my mother is not stupid, oh no, she knows all the computer terms. And me being the designated computer-fixing-guy of our family, I get the brunt of it. This includes her knowing such ""programs"" as ""Meekrosoft"". Meekrosoft, that's how she pronounces it, apparently produces everything. So whenever something's broken, I get a phonecall like this:

**X, you need to help me right now. My Meekrosoft doesn't work.""**

Not this time, though. This time around, she had entirely different issues. Naturally, it's some impossible time as I'm about to leave for work and my phone rings. Mother. Her calling at this time can only mean one thing: Her computer is broken yet again. I pick up the phone.

**Her:** X, You have to help me. It doesn't work.

**Me:** What doesn't work? Meekrosoft?

**Her:** No, Meekrosoft is working.

Now, this is the first time her Meekrosoft was working a-okay. So surely this had to be something that couldn't be fixed with a simple reboot or some minor thing that I've told her a million times before. So I sit down on my computer to mimic the steps she has to take as to exactly reproduce her error.

**Me:** Colour me interested. What's the matter?

**Her:** The inter. It doesn't work.

**Me:** The Inter... I see.

**Her:** I think I know what's wrong.

Holy shit, this would be the first time in about fifteen years of her owning a computer and turning to me for tech support that she actually knows what's wrong. I finally might have made some progress and she could have learned something. In retrospect, I should have known better, seeing as her problem was with The Inter and not Meekrosoft. So it was a whole'nother animal altogether.

**Me:** Right. Brilliant. What is it?

**Her:** My Firefox isn't servering with Google anymore.

Yup, there it was. Bomb dropped. She has learned absolutely nothing. Fifteen years and counting of working with computers and the best she can come up with is ""Firefox isn't servering with Google anymore""? Seriously? You'd think she would have picked up at least some lingo in the one and a half decades of slamming fingers onto a keyboard. But no, Firefox isn't servering with Google anymore, but thankfully, her Meekrosoft is still working.

**Me:** ... what?

To spare you the painful details of about twenty minutes of me trying to figure out why ""Firefox isn't servering with Google"" anymore, here's what I - after minutes of painfully horrible talk - have figured out.

It was my birthday on Wednesday. Binge drinking during the week isn't recommended (Hungover tech support = suicide), so we decided to drink far too much beer last night (Saturday). 

Anyway, with this out of the way, I'm halfway through my second beer and my phone rings. Not my own phone, my work phone. This is a less than ideal event on a Saturday afternoon, but against my better judgement I answer the phone anyway. A familiar voice with a South African accent greets me. It's one of our dispatchers from our call center. ""I hope you don't have any plans tonight, you're required for an urgent job in &lt;town 150KM from where I live&gt;"". This is pretty inconvenient, I'm currently in a town 200KM in the other direction from home. I explain this fact, I also explain that where I'm meant to be going is well outside my area. It's OK though, he's agreed to A) the travel charges (We charge $1/KM), the after hours callout fee, and the after hours rates. Eventually I manage to get the job moved to today, at 3pm. I then proceed to drink far too much and make a mess of my new shoes.

Anyway, I wake up this morning incredibly hungover. I have a shower, jump in my car, get some McDonalds and head north to the job. 3.5 hours. 4 once I stopped to vomit a few times.

When I get there, there's a fairly new AIO HP PC with a message on the screen saying he's been lookign at illegal porn and the police have locked the computer yadda yadda yadda, you've all seen that one before. It's a 5 minute job to get rid of it. 

""Thank you for coming at such short notice, I'm waiting for an email from my mail order bride"" It was awkward. He looked like your classic mail order bride person too. 

Now, our rates aren't exactly competitive (however we are the best :P), and when it came time to the bill, I was expecting him to contest the bill. It was a nice $419.50. No worries, he opens his wallet and pulls out 4x crisp $100 notes, and a $20.

I work for a local ISP in Colorado. We use a slightly odd system of point-to-point wireless receivers to deliver internet to largely rural areas. It's a lot like satellite, but without the latency. Basically one of our techs attaches a radio receiver to your roof, points it to a tower within ~10 miles of your home, and runs a cable to whatever router or PC you want.

Our service isn't as reliable as cable or DSL, but is actually pretty stable in severe weather like blizzards and such. However, I'm not sure if our sales team is selling it in correctly or not but people don't seem to realize that this service is largely line of sight based. If it is snowing so bad that you can barely see 4 feet in front of you, your service might have some packet loss.

This particular story takes place in the summer of 2010. A fairly large forest fire was burning in one of the areas we serviced. My co-worker (whom I will refer to as Nate) took a call that happened to be in one of the cities listed in the fire, but didn't think much of it at the time. Surely, if a customer was calling about an internet issue here, they were in an unaffected part of the city, right?

(The following is summarized as it's been a few years but you'll get the idea):

**Nate**: ""Thank you for calling ISP, this is Nate, how can I help you?""

**Customer**: ""Yes, I'm planning on leaving for a trip soon, and I'm having difficulty pulling up any websites to buy tickets.""

(Nate can hear some mumbling in the background but nothing he can make out.)


**Nate**: ""I'm sorry to hear that, miss. Let me pull up our equipment and we can take a look. Have you tried rebooting our-""

**Customer**: ""Yes, I've reboot everything, just as I've done a thousand times before. Your service is never up when I need it to be.""

(**Background voice**: ""......must.......now"")


**Nate**: ""I apologize that you've had repeat issues, let’s see if we can figure out what is going on.""


According to our system, her radio is not responding at all. If she has already reboot the power supply at this point it's looking like we'll have to send a tech to her house to check the equipment.


**Nate**: ""Miss, it appears your equipment isn't responding. If you've already reboot the power supply as you said we'll hav-""


(**Much louder background voice**: ""Whoever is on this line, this is the fire department, hang up, this woman needs to evacuate NOW"")


**Customer**: ""No, I NEED these tickets today, or I'll miss my conference! When can you get a tech out here?""


**Nate**: ""Miss, are you in the fire evacuation zone?!""


**Customer**: ""Yes, but I need to take care of this before I leave, it's very important!""


(**Voice**: ""WE NEED TO LEAVE NOW!"")


At this point, Nate had pulled up the most recent evacuation map from the local news and checked the customer's address. She was in the middle of the emergency evacuation area as the fire was burning towards the direction of her neighborhood.


**Nate**: ""Miss for your own safety I'm going to have to disconnect this call. I'm very sorry.""

**Customer**: ""NO! I need these tickets now!"" -click-


I never would have believed him if I wasn't sitting next to him listening to his half of the conversation at the time. I never did find out if that woman's house burned down, but based on reports it was pretty obvious to us that her service was down because of the dense smoke in the area.

Him: ""You are just being lazy. I want you to tell me what is wrong, and how to fix it. IS THAT SO HARD?!?""    
    
I put him on speaker at this point, and asked my lead to give his two cents.    
    
Lead: ""Sir, you are in possession of a company owned laptop on our domain. You will follow our instructions, or we will need to have it sent back to us. Those are your only choices.""    
    
Him: ""I am going to the VP of Schlucent Technologies! YOU WON'T TOUCH MY COMPUTER!""    
    
At this point I am done. I put on my ""Happy voice"" and say: ""Sir, at this point there is no assistance I can offer you. I will let our Director of IT know of your problem, and let her make the choice of what to do from here. Thank you for your time.""    
    
Director of IT decided he could do his job without a laptop. His Manager had to fly out to get it from him. I don't know what happened there, but we got the laptop back and there was Trans porn all over that drive. Dude was let go the next week.

Yeah, realizing what happened made him calm down a lot towards me.  As he was saying this, I pulled up both ticketing systems (yeah, the company used two different ones, which is even less fun than it sounds like), and then said,

""Okay, he did at least open a ticket, and I have it here.  Hold on.""

Typing happens.

""Okay, I see the problem, this was set up in a ticket earlier this morning, and this system updates at 1 AM Eastern time every day, so it won't be working until tomorrow.""

His voice is now actually pretty amiable.  ""And no one told me that, either.  Thank you very much, sir.  I'm very sorry for being angry, but I wasn't told things, and I expected it to be different.""

""No problem, sir, have a good day.""  I hang up.

I print the ticket.  Then I go find the original set-up ticket and print that too.  I look at the people who opened the ticket - we don't take front-line calls, and TPTB decided that the helpdesk shouldn't have access to the tool for managing the older firewall.  One of them is... not the sharpest tools in the shed - in fact, they're the toothless saw.  The other, the one who cold-transferred to me - is new.

I tell the other guy on shift I'm going down to the helpdesk for a few minutes.  He grins and gives me a thumbs-up.  I head to the elevator, go down to the helpdesk floor, head to the helpdesk, swipe my card, open the door, and walk in, smiling.  As is standard procedure, I go to the manager on duty, who sees me smiling and says:

""Who's getting the second one today?""

I go over the situation, he shakes his head, he calls the guy over.  I inform the guy, smiling the whole time, never raising my voice, and never straying into any kind of language, precisely how badly he screwed up, precisely what kind of bologna-brain does cold-transfers of irate customers in tech calls, and that I am leaving it in his manager's hands as to what happens.

As I walk back towards the door, I hear the guy say, ""Who does he think he is, God?""

And the manager says, ""No.  God *forgives*.""

Dude was sharp, fit, and despite my youth and fitness level he could probably still run circles around me and could easily drink me under the table (as a matter of fact, the reason he refused to retire was because, and I quote ""social security retirement and my retirement account still isn't enough to allow me to go camping with a few packs of beer every week"". I'll shall call him Sir Awesome.

Anyway, Sir Awesome found out I am going to school for IT and that I'm really good with fixing computers. He explains how his computer doesn't connect with wifi. After knocking out whether or not his computer even supports it anyway, I tell him to bring it into the office and I'll have a look see.

Now I'll admit, the guy is 77 years old. I figure the issue was going to be with him being too technologically inept to use his computer correctly to do something as simple as connect to a wifi network. I deal with it all the time - 90% of all issues is due to the user.

So his next shift he brings in the laptop. I look at it and start going through the basics. Turns out the dude knows his stuff - he already did the basics (restarting), then tried different drivers (old and new), tried different networks, tried his old laptop which did connect to his network, reset his home router, etc etc etc.... After looking at it we both concluded that the card itself was dead so I told him what adapter was the best to buy for the money and I offered to set it up for him if needed. His response ""Nah, that's okay - it'll be a piece of cake to set up"".

Later I asked if he got it all working. Yup, he sure did - and like he said, it was a piece of cake. Isn't often I look up to people, but this man is my role model.

In hindsight I probably spent an unhealthy amount of time playing online games, and it quickly got to the point where a second phone line was necessary.  It bugged my mother to no end, but little did she know that online games would eventually pay off and launch my IT career earlier than expected.

I went to college for CE/CS, where I was also accepted into the Honors College.  The honors kids had several perks, one of which was their own computer lab that was open from 7am-5pm, but was available after 5pm for pretty much anything that wasn't against university policy or international law.  This normally meant ""play Starcraft and Quake II until your eyes bled"", after which we would go play in the reflecting pond until the campus police chased us away.  Yeah, honors kids are weird.

The other key event in 1998 was the appearance of [NetBus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBus).  Originally designed to be a malicious backdoor program, it was quite handy for remote access.  I even had it installed on my work PC so I could remote in and download stuff on the fat Internet pipe instead of my poor 28.8k modem connection then copy it off the next day.

One fateful night, in the middle of a tense game of 4v4 Starcraft, something strange happened.  At seemingly random times, computers would alt-tab to the desktop (freezing the game) and random web sites would open up in the browser.  It wasn't just one computer, it was happening to pretty much every computer in the lab.  At first everyone thought it was a virus, but since I had some experience with NetBus a little lightbulb went off in my head.  I pulled up a command prompt on one of the misbehaving computers to run netstat; sure enough there were telltale signs of NetBus running, such as open ports (12345) and connections on odd high ports.  Whoever was controlling NetBus saw what I was doing; they closed the command prompt and opened up ""netstat.net"" in the browser to show that he was watching.  I unplugged the network cable, dumped the netstat output to a text file, and contacted the ISP where the connections originated.

I get a terse ""we took care of the problem"" response from the ISP the next day and shrugged it off, figuring it was some random kid.  The day after that, a guy I know from a couple classes comes up to me and says ""Sooo I work for &lt;ISP&gt; and my boss wants to talk to you about a job.""  Now this is where things get fun ..

Apparently the guy in my classes was the one who installed NetBus on the lab computers as a joke.  He worked at the ISP where the connections originated, and it turns out his friend was in charge of the abuse department.  When I sent in the abuse complaint, it was copied to his friend and to the president of the company.  They both immediately recognized the IP address in the complaint as one of the workstations in the office and knew exactly who was responsible.  Instead of firing the kid they told him to get my contact information so they could offer me a job.

That was 14 years ago.  Due to some seemingly random, minor coincidences and a little bit of knowledge applied at the right time, a college prank launched me into a rather successful IT career at least 3 years earlier than planned.  And my mom always told me that computer games were a waste of time.

Just fix it.",1166,253,293,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ttje5/the_girls_here_are_used_to_windows_98_lets_keep/,"In addition to being a bench tech I also used to go onsite to small businesses and do basic network admin work.  Nothing too complicated, usually less than 25 PCs and a server or two.  In doing this I soon realized that most small business networks were pretty much the same.  A closet somewhere had the modem feeding a blue Linksys router with 8 port switches added on organically as the network grew.  I'd update and clean it up, usually with a Cisco PIX and a big enough unmanaged switch to allow room for growth.  Then I'd go through and neaten up the rest of the network and reformat the worst of the workstations.  Usually less than a week's worth of work and the client was very happy with the result.  It was fun. 
 
My favorite task soon became the initial visit to create the cost estimate.  I had some neat software on my laptop with which I could map out all the devices on the LAN.  I'd then make a physical map of the network layout, combine it with the logical map and present this to the customer as the ""before"" diagram of their network.  I'd sometimes encounter an early adopter who had some really old tech either gathering dust or actively in use.  The following account details one such early adopter that knew too much for his own good. 
 
As I walked into this exceedingly ordinary law office in 2007 I was greeted by a receptionist who might have been pretty some 10,000 cigarettes ago.  Being a tech, the second thing I noticed was the old, discolored CRT monitor sitting atop an old discolored tower.  It was covered with sticky notes with various web sites along with the username / password for each.  [sigh] It was going to be one of those jobs.  I explained who I was to which she replied ""So you're our new tech this month, huh?  OK, let's go meet Mr. (Head Lawyer)""  Not a good start. 
 
As we went down the hallway I glanced into each office seeing people working but not using their PCs.  This struck me as unusual.  Each PC was as old as the one used by the receptionist.  At the end of the hall were 5 or 6 larger offices, each containing a lawyer.  After a minute one came out and introduced himself as Mr. Head Lawyer.  The next thing he said will forever send a chill down my spine.  ""I know all about computers and networks.  I just hired your company to help with some of the heavy lifting.  Keep in mind we don't want to spend a bunch of money if we can help it.""  I briefly considered throwing my laptop and tools over his shoulder hoping it would distract them long enough to make my escape. 
 
Another lawyer read my mind and silently moved to block my exit.  ""I'm glad you're here.  We have lots of computer problems and the last tech was not able to do much to help.""  I was outnumbered and flanked.  Might as well take a look around before I flee.  I said ""I'd like to start in your network closet.  Show me where you keep all the network stuff.""  This question prompted some polite, yet puzzled expressions.  Head Lawyer:  ""I'm not sure about that, do you want to see the server room?""  The server room would be lovely, thanks.  Let's start there. 
 
Calling it a server room was a bit of an overstatement.  I was expecting a closet, but this was a crawspace under a stairwell.  In it was an old desktop PC, a 10 mbit hub (collision indicator blinking frantically), and a power strip.  Attached to that hub were three network cables - one went into the wall on the right, the other to the left.  The third went to the server.  While I'm taking this in, Head Lawyer proudly said:  ""Some years ago I upgraded this office myself from the old coaxial ring to these new ethernet cables.  We were the first business around here to have a network.""  Coaxial rings... I vaguely recall reading about token ring networks.  They were literally arranged in a ring weren't they?  I only started doing this about 1999 so this was all ancient history to me. 
 
I plugged in my laptop and didn't get an IP address.  I asked where the router was, which evoked another puzzled smile.  ""Nevermind"", I said.  ""I'll just walk around and figure it out myself.""  So I went into each office and took a quick look around.  Every room was the same: an ethernet cable came in one wall and went into a hub.  Another cable went out of the hub into the next wall.  A third cable was plugged into the PC.  All PCs were running Windows 98.  One room had a new-ish PC with XP Pro. That room had the DSL modem connected via USB and was sharing the internet connection out to the rest of the network.  No DHCP, everybody had static IPs.  The printers were old, the server didn't work (never even learned what it was for), the internet didn't work, it was a mess.  The last office I visited connected back into the ""server room"" making a complete ring.  Wow. 
 
I decided I didn't really want the job so I was going to tell Head Lawyer the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  I knocked on his office and sat down.  He asked me what I thought.  I said ""to put it bluntly, everything in these offices that runs on electricity whose primary purpose is not to provide lighting needs to be replaced.  No exceptions.""  He frowned and told me the last tech pretty much said the same thing.  ""Listen"" he said, ""the girls here are used to Windows 98, let's keep it like it is.  Just fix it.""  I told him this was not a traditional network layout and I was not willing to support it.  ""I wish you the best of luck in finding somebody who can support this.  I would love to replace all this for you and build you a modern setup, but I can't do it and keep anything you currently have.""  I shook his hand and reiterated my desire to build him a real network, then left.  I went home, washed my hands, and then upon further recollection took a shower.

Although it innocently messes with one person, it definitely helps out a lot of other people, and it ultimately helps him out too!

Our office has That Guy. That Guy who walks around the office, leans on your office/cubicle wall, and tries to start a conversation with you. It's usually about his tween daughter's achievements/follies, or how the gub'mint is squelching his freedom to own guns, or how people these days aren't as wholesome as they were ""before"". I'll call him Bob. Bob, a salesperson, is an aggressive conversationalist who often traps people without escape for up to 2 hours. It's kind of his job, but the rest of us wish he didn't do it to us. While I feel no compunction in brusquely telling him to fuck off, the rest of the office is less confrontational and usually surrenders to his blathering until someone takes pity and pulls the hapless victim into a ""meeting"". The employees all agreed: something had to be done. IT (well, me) threw itself at the project like no other project before, and the extreme rescue dialer was born.


When a victim is trapped by Bob, the victim, or some other good samaritan in the office, can trigger the rescue system by discreetly visiting a webpage. This will cause a phone call to ring Bob's desk phone, and he will drop everything to sprint back to it, giving the victim time to escape to the bathroom or lock their door. Since Bob is a salesperson who often does B2B cold calls and leaves messages, he is always hoping for callbacks - his face just lights up with glee when he ""gets one"". The system spoofs its caller ID to a different number each time, so he doesn't figure it out. To further avoid discovery, the system waits for him to pick up and say hello, then plays one of several severely garbled messages (like a really bad mobile connection) saying ""hello? hello... are you there?"" etc., then hangs up. Bob will excitedly try to call back several times thinking he has a hot lead. However, since the system has hooks in the PBX it will intercept his calls to that fake number and redirect them to a fake message machine, which also varies its prompts to match the number used. This usually keeps him at his desk doing actual work for another hour or two, so his productivity increases.


The rescue dial system has been a rousing success. Cruel? Perhaps. Hilarious? Definitely. Since we have to use it so often, Bob now thinks his cold calling skills are more effective than they actually are, so it's boosted his confidence and has had the unexpected side effect of increasing his sales. It has certainly saved thousands of dollars in wasted time. Even the executives approve and have used it. Nobody has leaked the existence of the system to Bob yet, even though several people in the office were personal friends with him for years before the company even started...


**TL;DR: IT creates rescue dialer to save victims of annoying guy's stories. System calls annoying guy's desk phone with fake caller ID and fake voice before hanging up, intercepts his calls so he doesn't realize it's fake. Ends up indirectly helping him!**

**EDIT:** Sorry dudes, I can't share this code because it's really specific to our PBX. The application runs on a Freeswitch using flite TTS. If you want to do this on your system (illegal to modify caller id when calling numbers you don't own) and you know your way around Freeswitch, it will only take you a few hours to hack together.

There was one girl who lives in America I'd met on a forum and had added on Skype/Twitter/etc. and she knew I was quite good at general PC troubleshooting, seeing as it's my job and all. We'll call her Cassie.

Cassie sends me a message asking if I could look at a problem her friend in Australia was having and linked me to a tweet he had made to a blog post detailing how his PC was no longer booting. Quite a convoluted way to get details of a problem I know. I read through the post which explained the following (in a little bit more detail):

 - Windows crashed the day before and would not boot  
 - When turning on the PC it would get to the Windows flag and then loop  
 - The PC **did** boot into safemode but neither the mouse or keyboard would work at all

Now a few people were giving their tidbits of advice saying that it was clearly a failed hard drive and he needed to re-format the whole thing, that all of his data was as good as lost. Someone else even commented that he had a virus that was locking him out and every time he put it in safemode it was allowed access to his private information. **Read: ¬,¬'** Ignoring all this I decided it couldn't *just* be the hard drive if safemode worked but the mouse and keyboard didn't work.

It was about here that the friend, we'll call him Ozzie, was added to the Skype conversation and we started talking it through. I clarified a couple of points and asked his make/model of the PC or it's parts. I'd been looking at the issue for maybe ten minutes by now and decided that there was either a corrupted USB driver or device causing all of the issues described and asked Ozzie to unplug everything out of the back of the PC and put just the keyboard in the front (as nothing was plugged in the front and if it's the driver for the motherboard that's gone wrong the front panel may work).

True enough he gets into safemode without a hitch and can use the keyboard perfectly. I then ask him to try Windows as normal and then plug in the keyboard to the back panel and try again if that's successful as well. Works both times. He's very excited at this point. I tell him to take it easy as it may mean that one of his devices (two of which were external HDDs filled with videos he had created for his YouTube) was at fault. He needed to plug them in one at a time so we can know which it is.

Thankfully once everything was in it was all working perfectly. I put that down to the driver/device in question having been put back in a different port and resolved whatever driver issue that had afflicted it.

Ozzie was thrilled and spammed his thanks to me. I checked what time his blog post went up and it was about 55 minutes before I produced the solution for him.

We nerds have always been given a stereotype of being betas; second tier citizens. I never really felt this way; like I said, the town was small so we were all pretty close.

Anyways, my highschool at the time was really lacking in IT investment. They had the same computers that were there when I was in grade one. They also had deepfreeze installed on the computer, which reverted all changes made to them every reboot. This meant that editing documents made on newer softwares (EG: MS Word) would not open, and you couldn't install any software to do the job. The computers also ran IE6, so Google Docs and SkyDrive were a no go.

One thing we all had, though, were laptops. Let's be honest; that's pretty standard among students nowadays. The only thing is, there was no Wi-Fi, and being in a small town, reception for tethering was absolute crap.

One of my clients (as I did IT consulting in highschool) was a medium-sized medical clinic. They had an old box full of routers that they were just going to throw out. There were nothing special, but I figured that a box full of dome-shaped Apple AirPort Extremes may come in handy.

Then with a friend, I went around taping these access points under desks and daisy chaining them with the workstations. Next thing you know, my high-school has a secret Wi-Fi network that administration took a while to discover (and never manage to dismantle; yes they tried).

I received many props from teachers, classmates, and kids in lower grades that I had never met, and that was one way my epic nerdiness caused positive ripples throughout the school, while getting around the beaurocrats and their inefficiencies.

For those who are wondering, the network's hidden SSID was called SkyNet. Many jokes and references were made.

I'm a biology student.  But I fiddle with computers a lot and have built a few of my own.  This makes me frontline tech support for my family, and a few friends.  I'm mostly ok with this as nobody has unreasonably taken advantage yet, and it can be kind of fun.

So.  9:10 this morning, I'm bleary eyed and still in bed (no uni at the moment, so I'm the queen of lie-ins).  My phone starts blaring ""Pinky and the Brain"" at me.  It's Uncle Cluless, owner of a 5+ year old WinXP desktop that performs like a tortoise trying to walk through cement.  I have done tech support for Uncle Clueless before, and he's a technologically impaired middle-aged chap, when it comes to computers the phrase ""explain it like I'm five"" could have been invented for him.  He does tend to listen and follow instructions though.  What on earth could he want at this time in the morning?  I cough and blink a bit so I sound a bit less like I've just barely woken up, and answer.

**Me:** Morning!

**UC:** Hiya.  Quick question - do you have any tricks to make a computer turn on?

**Me:**  Um, what?  Well yeah, lots.  Start at the beginning, talk me through what happens.

**UC:**  When I press the button, nothing comes up on the screen, usually there's some writing and the windows logo and so on.  It makes some long beeping noises and then nothing else happens.

**Me:**  Ok, off the top of my head that sounds like hardware failure for some reason (in my head at this point I'm going through the list of things most likely to fail).  It doesn't sound like a typical hard drive failure to me as I'd expect it to get a bit further along before dying (I think to myself ""PCI graphics card?  Maybe not, think his machine has integrated graphics.  Could be the RAM, it's always the RAM...), so on the bright side if it's dead there's a decent chance we can get your data back.

*Pause.  Inspiration hits me.*

**Me:**  Wait, have you ever cleaned the fans?

**UC:**  No, why?

**Me:**  That machine is over five years old, you have two dogs, you keep it in a tiny room wedged under the desk and the weather is really warm at the moment.  If you've never cleaned out the fans or had someone else do it, they'll be full of layers of ancient congealed dust.  It's probably overheating.  If you think you can manage it, turn it off completely, go grab a screwdriver, take the side panel off the tower and have a look, it should be pretty obvious if that's the problem.  Be really careful not to touch any of the circuitboards as you can kill them really easily.

**UC:**  Ah, I can probably manage that, I've seen someone else do it before.  You really think that's the problem?

**Me:**  If you're careful, there's no harm in having a look.

**UC:**  All right, I'll have a look and ring you back and tell you what I've found.


*An hour and a half later, my phone rings again*


**UC:**  Yeah, ok.  It was completely choked with dust.  There's a fan over the bit in the middle of the motherboard - is it called a heatsink? (at this moment, I'm beaming with pride that he's used a vaguely accurate term to describe something)  That was the worst one, it looked like it could barely move.

**Me:**  Well, that explains it.

**UC:**  Yeah.  I went and found a little soft brush and got the worst of it out (at this point I winced a bit), then spent about half an hour trying to hoover all the gunk out of the carpet.  Turned it on with the side off and it didn't beep at me, so I turned it off again, put the side back on and connected everything up.

**Me:**  Is it all working properly then?

**UC:**  Yeah, it's actually so much faster than it was before, and it's not making a noise like a dying vacuum cleaner anymore.

**Me:**  That doesn't really surprise me


I'm absolutely floored.  This is the man who damn near had a heart attack when Internet Explorer stopped working properly, and I teamviewered him, couldn't fix it, installed Chrome instead and showed him how to use it.  When I was a kid I changed the colour of the boxes around windows on his Win95 computer and he thought I'd hacked it.  He thought the printer info box that came up when you booted was a virus, and was scared of msconfig.  He thought he could use a power cable from a desk lamp to extend the length of his ethernet cable.  And suddenly he's perfectly ok with delving into his computer innards to diagnose, and then fix the problem on his own initiative.  And he's absolutely thrilled that he was able to make it work, and then says that he's about to try and back up his stuff onto an external drive in case it fails for real next time.  I'm overcome with joy and pride.  Then he ruins it.

I was working for an ISP in Australia doing level 1 support, fresh out of training and taking calls. I had a senior listening in on the call too. 

Joe User calls and the first thing he utters is ""my torrents are going slow"". Alright, sounds like an interesting one so far! Obtained all his details, and again: ""my axxo torrents are running slowly and I need you to fix them NOW! This is urgent"".

In the back of my mind, I'm thinking that this guy must be crazy to call his provider and tell them he's downloading illegal content. Then he said it, a sentence which still makes me giggle slightly at the thought of it. 

""Listen, this is unbearable. My torrents are only going 3 kilopascals per second. FIX IT!""

I let out a little giggle but managed to  keep my composure. I looked over to the senior listening in, and he's unable to do anything but laugh. Being the smart ass that I am, I said something like ""there seems to be a bit of pressure to get this fixed, let's start with the basics"". 

The senior was beyond recovery now. For the rest of that call, he sat with his head in his hands, not doing much aside from laughing. 

And I still think of that call all these years later.

# **A Bad Start**

So a few years back, shortly after graduating college, I caved to my parents and gave up doing freelance work in lieu of getting an actual full-time job. Thing is, this was right after the economy imploded, so things were scarce (the massive global financial company where I'd interned in IT was still in a hiring freeze, but that's a different story). Adding to the issue, was the fact that I wanted to do get more into the programming side of things as opposed to support, but almost all of my previous experience was in support. So finding jobs was, shall we say, difficult.

In my desperation, I turned to Craigslist, and found a promising job. My first red flag was when I arrived for the interview. Looking for the building where the company was, I'd come to a narrow doorway in between two Chinatown knockoff shops, with a rickety elevator. Wary, but undeterred, I gave it a shot, hoping to avoid getting mugged on the way there. Getting off at the floor I was directed to, I was surprised to find it completely renovated, with wood floors, glass doors, Roman style columns, the works. The effect was jarring, doubly so as I looked out the window to find a very obvious sweatshop across the alley. But nonetheless, I walked on.

During the interview, performed by the two business partners (the CEO and the CTO), they made noises of uncertainty regarding my experience in the field, so we struck a deal: I'd work for $5k less than the advertised salary, and I'd get bumped up to it if they were happy with my work upon my review 3 months in. In retrospect, I should've got that in writing. But they signed me up and I began coming in.

*****
# **The Job**

The job itself was going to be building landing pages for ad campaigns and doing some light IT support around the office. When I started, however, I found that there was already a part time IT guy who was still in college, and who they obviously intended to replace with me doing occasional support work and part time programming. I felt this was *not cool*, but I needed the job.

I was disappointed to find that, contrary to their claims of working with ""big name companies"" they were actually a middle-man for online campaigns. The types of pages that you get either when you click on an ad, or that come up in a popup, with a form asking for your personal information that they **promise** will be kept confidential (hint: they resell it).

The job was made difficult due to the fact that everyone was running old eMachines running single core Celerons with about 1 gig of RAM (this was 2 years ago, and I'd already had a quad core at home for a while). I'd sometimes spend dozens of minutes waiting for it to complete operations, like the painful process of opening Photoshop files (on their poorly pirated copies of Photoshop). I should also mention that their Verizon line would die about once every 2 days, resulting in hours on the phone with Verizon and having the boss yell at all of us as if it were our fault they were too cheap to upgrade to a proper business class connection.

There were also rumblings. You see, there were only a total of about 8 employees, including me and the CEO and CTO. But not one other than them had been at the job for over a year, despite the company being 3 years old. Legend had it that the entire former staff and up and walked out one day. Hard to believe, as the economy would've already been bad by then, but management's paranoia seemed to reinforce these things. At one point, while they were at a convention, my coworkers insisted that they had listening devices around the office and were eavesdropping on us, because one of them made a comment about something someone said to themselves while alone in the office late one night. They gave me this warning written on a piece of paper, which they immediately threw out once I'd read it. Internet was monitored, mail was monitored, you had exactly 45 minutes to take a lunch, no exceptions, etc. All of this can be yours, plus a low salary and a grand total of 8 days off a year! Did I mention that we were sometimes required to work from remotely from home... on weekends?

*****
# **A Not So Secret Code**

Anyway, I put up with it, because a job's a job. I slowly worked out all of the IT issues to the point where things began running smoothly, and in my off time I began helping out a coworker whose sole job was to run reports. Massive reports he'd spend hours on, pulling in data for a dozen sources to try to figure out how much money we should be making compared to what we got paid, and how much we should pay out. It was incredibly tedious and frustrating, and I figured hell, what are programmers for other than to turn the tedious and frustrating into something quick and easy? 

So I automated some data calls for him, and wound up getting stuck at the major bottleneck: decrypting data that's manually done through a 3rd party system that provided no API. As it is I was screen scraping for some data already, and the site was painfully slow at times, with no batch decryption available. I stared at it frustrated... and noticed a pattern. Sitting down with a pen and paper on my lunch break, I figured out that the encryption was actually 3 sets of encryption algorithms that substituted numbers for sets of letters, with a delimiter in between number sets, and a key appended at the end representing the encryption scheme. Made a bulk decoder for it, and was proud to realize it worked, and that I'd actually just decrypted something off the top of my head with some guess work, because this 3rd party was too incompetent to use an actual encryption scheme. My coworker's morning reports went from taking 7 hours, to taking about half an hour. 

My only concern was that to do all of this I needed to use a user's credentials. For testing I used my own before asking my boss for an account for tools I built. She shrugged it off, remarking that it was unnecessary, and to leave it as is. I told her I'd really be wary of that and that it really SHOULD be its own account. 
&gt;""No and that's final, we can't afford to go around making tons of user accounts on this system.""

Of course, there were half a dozen already there under our company for employees who didn't even work for us anymore, so I knew this was BS immediately. Oh well, I'd warned her. Other tools followed piggy backing on this which would literally cut out work by days every week, freeing us to do more useful work, and productivity soared.

# **The Lithuanian Word for Hell**

I did similar automation for our newsletters, all of which while churning out landing page HTML templates on a daily basis, and eventually my boss let me work on our custom CRM and CMS systems. I've, to this day, never seen such a nightmare. They were written by a Lithuanian programmer who learned to program as he went along. The first 3 sections had no functions. All the code was copy-pasted and duplicated for reuse. There were also no comments, no proper indentation, no includes to break up the code into chunks, nothing. Also, the variables were Lithuanian words abbreviated, to things like *kzh* or *vzb* or *skazd*.  Also, some of the 3 or 4 letter abbreviated variables differed by a single letter or swapped letters, such as *kreas* and *kraes*. I began wondering what sort of war criminal I'd been in a past life to deserve this.

You could clearly trace the path where he learned about things. Like one page stored the date in the db as a Date object in SQL, while another stored a date as ""MM-DD-YY""; which lead to problems like sorting by month across several years when you sorted columns by date (ie, 01-10-09, 01-10-10, 01-11-09, etc). I figured if I could decrypt something offhand, I can figure this out... and I mostly did, albeit painfully, tracing every single variable manually, fixing plenty of bugs along the way. I even managed to update it visually (Had to add a proper menu since I more than doubled the amount of tools available), and added a proper per user permissions system for the tools that was granular and easy to use. And of course, I integrated a lot of disparate systems together to give my coworkers more data to work with, and again, had to user my user account, after double checking with the CTO again that we weren't making a separate account for it.

*****
# **The Hammer Drops**

Eventually, it was time for my review... 2 months later than scheduled. My bosses praised my work and the results. They said they couldn't be happier, and that I was WAY better than those amateurs they'd hired before me (their own words). They saw a lot of great and promising work we could do together. Then they began getting up to leave. 

&gt;""Hey, before we forget, you mentioned a salary bump if you were happy with my work by my review?"" They slowly sat down, and the mood changed. 

&gt;""Oh, you see, you misunderstood. We meant that when we reviewed you, you'd get health benefits. Those are worth about three thousand per person.""

&gt;""But you said the job had an $x salary and benefits. Even assume you're including benefits, which is not the case according to how you wrote this, that's still $2k short of the stated salary.""

&gt;""No, you don't understand. I know you're new to the business world (I wasn't), but this is how things are run.""

Needless to say that I was not happy, so I immediately began job hunting. Unfortunately, I couldn't quit as I had a mortgage to pay, and worked so late that I barely had enough time or energy to do actively look. It was around this time that a lot of template work began really coming in. It was mostly for those for-profit online ""universities,"" some of which can be rather shady, and they had massive forms (University of Phoenix alone had thousands of interdependent items in dropdown menus) and short deadlines. Additionally, a bunch of the tools I'd built pointed to fraudulent data being passed, which my boss made my number one priority to weed out daily. 

At this point my job became largely mind numbing data entry. I offered to try to automate removing fraudulent data with an algorithm, but wasn't allowed time to do so on top of daily filtering by hand and template building. Additionally, that'd require access to our data management system that all of the forms submit too, and which builds the form processor. It had some serious bugs in it, and I'd offered to help fix it countless times, but was never given access, and informed that it was strictly maintained by a contractor, who works off-site, and who I wasn't allowed to speak to. When I dug up his info from a carelessly forwarded email from my boss to me, in order to contact him about a massive failure he'd caused by checking in a typo, I got yelled at by management. 

&gt;""You don't seem to understand, in the real world, all of this stuff is segregated. You have to get used to not being allowed to talk to other programmers about problems.""

Of course, being my first programming job was not the same thing as my first job. I knew plenty of coders and had done IT work for them before, so knew she was full of shit, but said nothing. The job had just become mind numbingly depressing, by then, and I was too drained and demoralized to find a better job.

We'd had a turnover rate of one person a month since I'd been hired, and were down to a total of 5 employees, including myself and the 2 ""executives"", by this point. And every single one of my coworkers hated working there, myself included.

*****
# **The Other Shoe**

There's always a breaking point. For me, it started when my mom got cancer, and I'd requested 2 days off of work, 3 weeks in advance, to take her to the hospital for thyroid surgery. It was approved, we went, and she made it through ok and is now much better. But it set into motion the end of my employment there.

You see, 2 months later, I'd finally scored an interview for an interesting company, that I'd be excited to work for, and asked for a day off under the guise of a doctor's checkup, to go to the interview. I was called into the management office, and proceeded to get chewed out for, I'm not making this up, 3 hours (the CEO was one of those people who legitimately enjoyed yelling at people at the top of her lungs). They complained that my attitude had become negative (no shit), that I'd been taking an hour at lunch instead of 45 minutes, that I'd been consistently 10 minutes late to work for the past 3 months (starting right after my review), that I complained too often about not getting access to fix broken system, etc. Then, they proceeded to deny me that day off, citing that I'd ""... already taken plenty of days off recently."" Now, I've been working there for 9 months, and had taken a grand total of 4 days off: 2 for being sick myself and 2 for my mother. That's right; they were chewing me out for taking days off, which I'd earned, planned in advance, with their consent, to take my mother for cancer surgery. 

It was at that moment that I decided that I was done.

*****
# **Fallout, or, ""I told you so""**

The day I'd asked off for finally rolled around, and I sent an email pleading sickness. My email was dripping with sarcasm and melodrama. I didn't care. 

I went to the interview, and proceeded to bomb it. Months without talking shop about relevant coding practices left me knowing most of what I needed, but unable to describe anything or remember fundamental terms. I walked home as depressed as ever.

It was at this point that my phone alerted me that my email account was offline. Figuring that they'd decided to ""punish"" me by firing me with no one to replace me, I suddenly found myself slightly relieved, to my surprise. I was free. A terribly depressing weight had been lifted from my shoulders. I went home for a nap.

I woke up 2 hours later, to about a dozen missed emails. By this point, they'd disabled and deleted all of my account credentials from all of their systems... which brought half the CRM and all of the reporting systems to their knees, since, like I told them months earlier, they were all using my account credentials for their hooks. Truth be told, even I'd forgotten all about it till that point. Authentications for automated processes failed across the board, destroying their ability to monitor their income based on traffic reports, which was problematic, as they'd previously fired the company accountant, who was the only one other than me who knew how to assemble those up by hand. The entire company came screeching to a halt. And since no one else knew how to code, or access the code, or where in the code the credentials were, they had a hell of a time changing it.

My coworker called to inform me that the bosses had been screaming at one another in their office for over 2 hours, and that this was the best day he'd ever had since he started working there. 

The company survived, after being down for several days, somehow, though I don't know the details of it. My coworker found a new job shortly afterward and that was my last contact at the company. With the looming specter of my mortgage looming over me, I lived off of my savings, and I'd managed to find a new job about 3 weeks after leaving, for better pay, salary, environment, people, and benefits, and am still working there to this day, having just received a raise and a promotion to boot just a few days ago. And where I work now, they actually listen to me when I tell them we need exclusive system credentials. Because when they don't, I have a story that I tell them...

Super busy with people buying new PCs and tablets left and right.  About halfway through the day, I noticed a woman standing at the ""Returns"" till with an HP box that looked like it had just saved this woman's life in a drive-by shooting.

I submit as evidence: [Exhibit A](http://i.imgur.com/ynPY3.jpg?1)

and [Exhibit B](http://i.imgur.com/v4wUp.jpg?1)

Now I want to inform you that these are not just scratches to the box, but full out punctures.  

She proceeds to pull out the laptop stating only that her machine ""has a problem"".  No shit, lady.  As she sets it on the counter, I can tell immediately by the number of scratches on the top of the LCD panel that the machine was *still in the box* when those punctures were made.  She opens it up to show me that the LCD itself is shattered and the fan is making a lovely grinding noise in the tune of D flat.  

[Exhibit C](http://i.imgur.com/WU6OG.jpg?1)

I'm trying to bite my lip at this point from blurting out ""Well there's your problem"" and simply ask to see her receipt.  Purchased exactly 1 month ago from my store.  Great, this is going to be a fight.  I see that she had purchased the accident forgiveness plan and call the claim center to get a case number.  Everything ok so far.

Next I have her accompany me to my tech bench so I can create a ticket to have her machine repaired.  I place the damaged box on the counter behind me and turn around to the computer to create the ticket.  This is where it gets good.

""It came like that""

Wat?

I look up from the computer I'm typing on and look at her for a second, then look over my shoulder at the mangled box, then back at her.  

""It didn't leave our store looking like that.  If we tried to sell you a box that looked like that, you would never have bought it or at least asked to see the machine before buying it.""

""Well my son never used it.  It was a Christmas gift.  Maybe it got dropped moving from house to house.""

At this point I excuse myself and take the machine in the back, turn it on (yes, amazingly it turned on) and hooked it up to an external monitor.  On the monitor is the log in screen showing a first and last name and a password.  

""So who is John Doe?"" (Names changed to protect the not-so-innocent)

""My son.""

&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

""Well it must have been used by someone, or there wouldn't be a name on it.""

At this point, she gets salty that I wouldn't just give her a new machine since this one was ""only a month old"".  I ask if she would like to speak to the manager (I really just wanted someone else to see how crazy this lady was being) and she says yes.  

The manager comes over and I explain the situation, point out the tattered box and keep typing away while he diffuses the crazy.  He tries to equate it to her wrecking her car and then going back to the car lot for a replacement. Shit don't work that way.

She rambles something about going to a different store for better ""customer service"" which the manager and I both just shrug off and we finish our business.  If she thinks anyone is going to return a month old laptop that has obviously been deliberately destroyed, she is in for a big surprise.

Thank god for beer and whisky.

Ended up thinking about it yesterday and decided to share.

So I'm writing some software to control a motorised stage and lock-in amplifier.  Simple task, GPIB on the amp and ActiveX controls on the stage so nothing technically challenging.  Spent a few hours writing the code and another testing it and wringing out any potential bugs (including different OS etc), everything went better than expected and I delivered the job to spec and on time.  Great I thought.

Two days go by.


*Phone rings*.

**Me:** Hello?

**User:** Yeah this program you made doesn't work.  I'm really not happy.

**Me:** Ok can you explain a bit more?

**User:** DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME??? IT. DOESNT. WORK.

**Me:** Ok but if you....

**User:** EVERY FUCKING TIME I DEAL WITH YOU SHIT JUST DOESN'T WORK 

(nb: this is the first and probably last time I have ever worked for this person)

A bit more back and forth before I have to capitulate

**Me:** (sigh) No problem sir I'll be right down to check it out. *click*


Turns out that when the code executes, the motor goes full speed in one direction and doesn't stop when it reaches the end of the stage making a horrible grinding noise.  Something that I've never seen before.  At least I know it's getting instructions from the program so I can rule out bad cables. His OS is the same as mine so it's not a compatibility issue there.  To work with the stage the program calls up a lookuptable and searches for the serial number of the device it's controlling.  This serial number is down as a user input but I made it difficult to change and fixed it to the device the user told me they were needing it for.  The serial number *hasn't* been changed, so another suspicion eradicated.
I check the code, it's absolutely identical to the one I know works on my computer so he hasn't messed with that.  To double check I even use my laptop with the program and lo and behold the equipment works as requested.  Well this is odd.

Then the user, who has been making snide remarks the entire time, tells me how the supplier of his motorised stage had tried to screw him.

**User:** Those pricks sent me the stage I wanted but had deliberately underclocked it (his words not mine) so that I would have to pay extra to make it work better.  They sent me one that could only move 100mm but it's like they didn't know I could read and saw that the config file contained drivers for the 200mm stage.  Those idiots just thought they could screw me and I wouldn't figure it out.  Saved over the file with the new one like a pro.

**Me:** O_o



Recap. The user had bought a 100mm stage.  It was *physically incapable* of 200mm movement, you'd think the rule on the side that read from 0mm to 100mm would've been a clue.  But no.  This user had discovered the lookuptable I was talking about earlier and learned that it mapped serial numbers to drivers.  He was smart enough to read the serial number on his device and saw that it mapped to the 100mm stage drivers *like it was fucking supposed to*.  But no.  He decided this meant he was being screwed and **edited** the file so that his serial # now pointed to the drivers for a super expensive 200 mm stage.

So my program worked perfectly and loaded the drivers it was told to, which in this case meant the *wrong* drivers and so the stage did not behave as it was supposed to.

Fixed by simply copying over my config file (since the idiot had overwritten his).  No thanks, no apologies, just a grunt and a dismissive hand gesture.

I get a call from one of my long time clients that they've hired three new employees, they're set to start Monday, and I need to get everything setup for them to start work after lunch/orientation. I config the PCs take everything out get it all setup and just hang out for a couple hours while these guys finish up their ""training"". 



I head out to grab some lunch and when I get back I'm just walking around checking in with everybody and I come across ""Mr. Awesome"". Mr. Awesome is sitting in his cube grumbling at his computer. I poke my head in and ask him whats up, he responds with ""F*cking IT didn't set my computer up right.""  I just kind of smile thinking hes just trolling me or something.  I offer to take a look at it since I'm ""pretty good with this computer stuff."" I spend about 30 minutes showing him how to get around on the network, how to use email, word/excel shortcuts, all pretty basic shit. Every third word out of the mouth of Mr. Awesome is, you guessed it, ""Awesome."" I think he even said ""Rad"" a few times but I refuse to believe anyone still says that. 



Anywho, after all that he seems happy and tells me how I should really just take care of the computers for them instead of whatever else I do because ""The f*cktard IT guy never even showed up."" He spends about 10 minutes making sure I know I'm awesome and the IT guy ""Sucks donkey nuts."" I finally pick up on the fact that he just doesn't know I'm the IT guy. At this point I don't want to mention it to him so I just shake hands and walk away from Mr. Awesome. I check in with management get signatures on the paperwork and head out after letting Mr. Awesome's supervisor know his new employee should get a placard on his cube entrance with his title of Mr. Awesome. I didn't tell him why, I didn't want to get the guy in trouble.


So about three hours later I'm just finishing up something when I get a call from Mr. Awesome's supervisor. Hes stuck between coughing and laughing as relates to me how Mr. Awesome came in with a tale of this awesome guy who should fix our computers instead of the ""IT Douche No Show"".  After figuring out who he was talking about he started laughing and told him that I was the IT consultant. Mr. Awesome freaked out and projectile vomited on his boss.  Needless to say everyone knows why Mr. Awesome got the nick name. Mr. Awesome actually showed up for work the next day and still continues to work there.

NOPE^NOPE^NOPE,1222,327,214,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1aiyvc/crazy_riflewielding_drunken_war_veteran_vs_onsite/,"It's been a while, TFTS. I've been pulling 60-hour weeks laying out electronic medical record systems for my employer (which is a novella in and of itself, including climbing over mountains of monitor stands, wheelchair races in hospital parking garages, and accidentally setting fire to a coffee machine, all with the added bonus of being hourly with OT), but as I'm stuck watching doctors train Dragon Medical 10 today, I figured I might as well throw this up.

The year was 2008. I was driving a black-and-white VW for the poor bastards who got ruined by the blueshirts. My day was 11 AM to 7 PM, which was a fairly relaxing schedule, and I serviced mostly rich, comfortable areas of town, basically places where I blended in easily thanks to my upbringing (private schools, Boy Scouts, et cetera). These places had clients who were mostly pretty good - intelligent, very good conversationalists, quick learners, and those who were willing to pay what was necessary to get the job done properly (e.g. not skimping on parts).

Mind you, this was AFTER the [crackhouse call](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/155217/computer_care_in_crackhouses_calls_for/), before the [gropey molesting old lady](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/16avvy/the_gropey_molesting_old_lady_sfw_has_euphemisms/), and WELL after the [vodka-barf keyboard](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/158prt/sloshed_simpleton_spews_sickening_slush_on_system/).

BUT I DIGRESS.

It was near the end of my day that day. I'd set up a few wireless networks for users in their houses, and cleaned a few nasty CWS variants off one machine (without CWShredder, too). I had one last repair on my schedule for the day, for a client who I would have sworn I'd seen before. It turned out I had, which I found out when I pulled the logs for him in our scheduling system, but I didn't recognize him offhand.

I did, however, recognize his house when I pulled up to it, and I thought *Oh no, not this guy again.* Seeing the house, which was in the Memorial section of town (a rich old-money part of Houston, or, as Tycho and Gabe say, ""Rich Mofo Street""), reminded me of the crazy that lay therein, and I shuddered and went to work.

I knocked on the door, and a semi-elderly man (mid to late 50s) opened the door and let me in after confirming he was who we thought he was. He showed me to his computer (a 2004-era P4 beast with 256MB of RAM and XP Home SP0), and after perfunctory software diagnostics, I figured out the BSODs he'd been having weren't software based (as much as I'd have liked to blame AOL dial-up for it - and yes, it was on his system - I couldn't). Virus scans came up negative, too.

Meanwhile, Senor Crazy was downing tumbler of whiskey after tumbler of whiskey. It wasn't good stuff, either - from the smell, it was some execrable *blend* (so sue me, I'm a whiskey purist, and my premier stock is older than my fiancee, which means that either like Tuxedo Mask, I like the young stuff, or I have *excellent* taste in whiskey. It's the latter. I went for the cheap pedo shot to get a laugh. LAUGH DAMN YOU).

I ran hardware diagnostics, and after Memtest tripped a few times, I started checking the BSOD logs. It was verified shortly that it was bad memory, and before I had a chance to explain it to him, he started ranting about me taking too long to repair the machine. One of the lines he used was ""you better hurry up, or I'll start calling in my friends named Mickey and Vinny and they'll do to your legs what happened to this machine!""

Again, I raised an eyebrow, and kept working.

After more diagnostics finished, just for verification purposes, I had my personal laptop there (a D600 running XP), and I'd confirmed that his machine was out of warranty AND out of his service plan, so he would have to pay for parts on his own.

I explained what was going on to him, and he was FURIOUS. He started ranting and raving, telling me that I was full of it, and that I shouldn't ""tell that shit to an Airborne Ranger who had 179 kills in 1972"" while still downing whiskey. He even pulled a Bob Dole and ranted about a war wound while rapping on his skull (it actually rang, meaning he had a metal plate in it - pretty cool with the sound, but the crazy was offputting).

At this point, I went up on the company forums and started begging for a bailout.

SEE ATTACHED.

http://imgur.com/OCRUj

After I did that, about ten minutes later, I started getting calls. However, before I could get out of there, I heard something that chilled the blood in my veins.

""Don't look on this as a weapon of war, look at it as a piece of art.""

NOPE^NOPE^NOPE^NOPE^NOPE

Sure enough, the crazy bastard had pulled out a locked case, and when he opened it, he pulled out a bolt-action sniper rifle. 

Again.

NOPE^NOPE^NOPE^NOPE^NOPE

He picked it up and started waving it around, pointing it at me a few times, and when my phone rang again, I took the opportunity to get into his backyard (I have NEVER been so grateful for Sprint having crappy signal in so many areas) and instructed the Agent on the other end of the line to impersonate my store's manager. I told her to say that the police were at the store in regards to a previous client and some ""misplaced"" equipment (didn't exist at all, of course, but any port in a storm), and they needed to talk to me ASAP.

I passed him the phone when I went back in, told him that he may want to go to the backyard, as the reception wasn't that good, and once he was out of sight (in his kitchen, then in his backyard), I threw my laptop into my embroidered laptop case (a gift from an ex who modeled for Suicide Girls), grabbed all my other gear (excepting my phone), and tiptoed out to the VW quietly. Once I got there (I'd unlocked the doors from the front porch via the keyfob), I threw my laptop case into the car, started it up, and dropped the transmission going into reverse, then peeling out of the driveway and onto the main road.

As luck would have it, this guy's house was a mile and a half from my grandmother's, so I drove over there, and with her permission, I downed a few shots of whiskey to steady my nerves before calling centralized IS to wipe my phone (he'd started calling previous callers - coworkers - after I'd left), then the police over Skype. Once I was done with them, I called corporate and had him blacklisted from in-home service forever, dashed off an e-mail to my managers and basically table-flipped the whole thing at them, and sat back with a cranberry ginger ale while waiting for callbacks and responded to the thread on the forums to let people know I was okay.

The Memorial Villages (a subcity inside Houston, which has its own police force and such) police pulled up at her house shortly thereafter with my phone (PPC-6800 - not a bad little phone for the time), all his documentation for them, in the original folder (which is still on my trophy wall today), and the statement that they'd talk to their bosses and to the Harris County Psychiatric Center about a temporary involuntary commit. It turned out that he was on meds normally and had gone off them by choice.

They also, in a remarkable stroke of brilliance, TEMPORARILY CONFISCATED HIS FIREARMS!

When he called the 1-800 number to rant and rave at them (and he used racial slurs at the rep, who was a rep for them since the day they got the call center account), they calmly suggested that he would need to go in-store to resolve any issues he had, then blacklisted his number in the PBX so that he would get redirected to corporate for any inbound calls.

The next day, he stormed into the store at Bunker Hill and I-10 (not my home store, but the one where I started), and ranted at the senior there for about half an hour, including the phrase ""NERD HERD TOOK MY GUNS!"" It was HILARIOUS. The senior, who was a friend of mine, went back and looked up his logs, then cheerfully informed the man that he was banned from not merely all in-home services, he was banned from even going into a Buy More under ANY circumstances!

I didn't get anything special from corporate for dealing with him, but the fellow line-level techs were all supportive.

I became the go-to-guy for certain professors to fix basic computer issues in return for free wine (good wine!) because the IT people were so bad.

Skip ahead to a day where Professor XX calls me with the offer of a Rochioli Pinot Noir (go look it up) -- I walk in and she is looking at her computer frustrated because she keeps losing connectivity.  Of course she had already called the moron IT guy who couldn't figure it out and just gave up.  This is a Mac, so it wasn't going to be something complicated on the configuration end.  Cable plugged in, network settings apparently good, internet working anddddd its gone.  Web stops working, email doesn't check -- I go to the network settings and its showing the network is down (but connected).  I'm frankly a bit stumped, and figure its probably a hardware issue (bad cable, ethernet going dead, something like that).

I tell her to give me a day or so (she had another computer that was working), and went googling (yahooing?  whatever we used in 1999).  Of course, all the sites said: check your network settings, check your hardware.  Not much help.

So, I was about to go downstairs and tell her she'd probably need to take it into a repair shop so they could run some diagnostics, when I overhear a different professor, Professor XY, complaining about the internet not working to the IT guy.  Professor XY wasn't one of my normal ""clients"", but I did stand around listening to them for a bit.  IT guy goes and tries to fix it, reboots the computer, it starts working, and leaves.  I drop in on Professor XY a bit later and ask if the problem was fixed.  ""Nope, it lost connectivity again.""  I ask him if I can check his computer -- maybe there is some hint to the problem.  So, check the cables, check the network settings, looks all -- wait a minute...  I scribble the network settings down, and run downstairs to Professor XX's office and pull up her ""broken"" computer's network settings.

Both of the static IPs were set to the same number.

Rolling my eyes, I walk up to the IT guy's office and knock on the door.  ""Um, did you know that you set both Professor XX and XY's IP to be the same number?""  ""Yeah, we ran out of IP addresses.""  ""Uh, you know that means that those two computers were booting each other off the network every time.""

**The Legend:**  
I was working at a well known games publisher where we made a series of popular sporting games that were enjoyed all around the world. While the *Great Console Wars of 2005* were being fought, these games had such a following and reputation that our next title in the series was selected to be displayed as part of an international tour that a certain console manufacturer was running for the lead up to their product launch.  
Our game was still in its early stages and there were several issues that had yet to be ironed out.  
  
**The Feature:**  
You could choose the location for international matches when setting up a match in the game. On the same screen, there was a map that displayed the country of the stadium/pitch/court where you would be playing. One of these countries was India.  
  
**The Calm:**  
The tour was going well and the game was being publicised. It was becoming as popular as the console it was being demonstrated on. The tour moved on from region to country, to continent until it reached South Asia. Delegates from India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka were all invited to the same event on Indian soil. Even I still have difficulty coming to terms with what happened next...  
  
**The Storm:**  
It was a normal day in the office. People were working at their usual pace, unaware of the impending chaos that was raging overseas.  
*A wild email appears!* The leader for the QA team on the project reads it carefully and precisely, jaw dropping lower with every new line. Upon reaching the end of the email, he bursts out in shocked laughter and informs the team of the current situation.  
In a moment of brilliant thinking, the individual performing the demo of our game selected a match location in India. After a few seconds, outrage came from the delegates of India, followed by anger from the delegates of Pakistan. The map was incorrect. Kashmir had been drawn as part of Pakistan.  
  
**The Fallout:**  
The email explained in no uncertain terms that this game was not going to be released on their console unless the mistake was corrected *immediately*. They also demanded a fresh build of the game was sent to them before close of business. The situation had apparently become so heated that threats of war were being sent around the room and the delegates were also accusing the country of the console manufacturer of 'blatant political bias'.  
The QA team had to work late to get them a new build.

I worked student IT support for a university. We handled phone calls for pretty much any technical problem a student has from internet not working to computer problems to their passwords expiring(this happens every 6 months if you didn't change it).

And finally we used to sell students computers. They were setup under our domain so that the login would be their school username and password and sync everything. By the time I started working, this was getting phased out because they finally realized it was a terrible idea.

Anyways our manager had left for the day and I was left in charge for being senior tech. This was also my last month working here.

Ten minutes before closing on Friday an alumni calls. My coworker initially answered the call. The alumni had let their password expire and could no longer login to her computer. A simple password reset would fix the problem. The thing was, we needed a special code off her student ID card to reset the password.

Of course the alumni had already thrown it away. This is a common occurrence so we have the ability to manually reset her password through active directory. However, we require 2 forms of ID to prove that it is the actual user and not someone else. At hearing this the alumni started yelling and made my coworker start crying.

At this point we're 5 minutes from closing. I tell my coworker to transfer the alumni to me and say she's transferring to her manager.

me: how may i help you?

alumni: i need my password reset so i can get into my computer. hopefully you can be more helpful than the b*tch i was just talking to.

now i'm pissed. no one gets to yell at my newbies like that and call them names just for sticking to our policy.

me: i see. we either need a code from your student ID or you need to fax or email in 2 forms of ID so we can verify that you're who you say you are.

alumni:i need you to make an exception for me.

me: no

alumni: I DEMAND YOU FIX THIS IMMEDIATELY OR ELSE I'LL SPEAK TO THE PRESIDENT AND GET YOU FIRED.

(president of the university)

me: Be my guest. My name is pcx226. Tell him I said hi.

The alumni keeps on ranting about how we suck and should all be fired and that the school never seems to hire competent help.

During all this I take a look at her account. It turns out this alumni's account was supposed to have been deleted last year. we phase out old accounts a year after graduation. I'm not sure why her account was still active so I go ahead and flag it for deletion. This process is automatic so her account would be deleted at the end of the month.

At this point we're 5 min past closing and everyone is listening to me on this call.

Me: Well I just took a look at your account. Turns out it should have been deleted last year. Since you have been such a joy to work with I've taken the liberty of deleting your account for you. You will no longer be able to login to anything associated with our university including your university email. Have a nice day. If you have any additional problems call us during our office hours Monday through Friday 9-7.

And then I hung up.

I texted my boss who told me that was hilarious but if she makes a big fuss I'll have to let you go. I told him I know, I'm leaving at the end of the month anyways.

Fast forward to Monday. In our fax machine was 2 copies of the alumni's IDs. Along with a letter apologizing for her behavior and asking me oh so politely to undelete her account.

I reset the password and call the alumni back. I tell the alumni that we have reactivated her account and she has until the end of the month to set up forwarding on her email and retrieve any important emails. Also I sent instructions on how to remove her university login from her computer so this problem wouldn't happen again.

TLDR: alumni yelled at my cowoker, i told alumni i deleted their account, alumni freaks out and apologizes profusely.


edit: my boss wouldn't have actually fired me. 
to be fair i'm pretty sure my boss would have only ""let me go"" because i was already leaving. it would give the department a small ""PR"" boost at no cost to any of the involved parties.

had i been staying i have faith that he would not have fired me. he's pretty much the best boss i've ever had.

Me: ""Thank you for calling ABC123 help desk, this is Odin'sLeftEye, how can I help you?""

Customer: ""Cars crash, son. Not computers. It's not like I dropped it.""

Me: ""...""

Me: ""What software are you using?""

Customer: ""-but I can't find the software. It's all hard.""

Me: ""I'm sorry, but... What?""

Customer/Idiot: ""I opened it up, but can't find anything 'soft,' you know?""

Me: ""You opened up your computer to look for the 'soft' ware?""

Customer/Idiot: ""Yeah. I guess that's what that guy meant when I had a problem with software. I don't think I have any.""

Me: ""Please tell me you shut your computer down first.""

Idiot: ""Uh... should I have?""

Me: ""Yes, you really should have.""

Idiot: ""Don't worry, I'm not stupid. I know there's electricity in there. I didn't use my bare hands.""

Me: (regretting this question even as I'm asking it) ""Then how do you know nothing is 'soft?'""

Idiot: (vaguely proudly) ""I used a screwdriver. Rubber grip. Insulated.""

Me: ""You poked around the insides of a running computer, with a *metal screwdriver.*""

The herd laughed louder.

Idiot: ""Yup."" A pause, then a half-mumbled, ""The, uh, computer did some stuff when I did that, and it, um, ain't doing much now.""

Now read on...
   
  
   
All good things must come to an end, and the replacement office manager was an enormous dick who had been exiled from the State office in order to live out his remaining career in charge of a region which was (a) large and prestigious enough so he couldn't complain or start pointing out the skeletons in their closet, but (b) so far away from HQ that it was obvious he'd been put out in the cold.

He did not like the situation at all, and pretty much handed the day-to-day running of the office over to a triumvirate of section managers, while he concentrated on being a dick to people. We clashed many times over many things, and eventually he exploited a loophole which enabled him to oust me from the tech support position into a bottom-rung gofer job.
   
  
   
This is not the story of how he forgot to line up a replacement first.
   
  
   
This is the story of the first couple of days afterwards, when I was happily acting as though I'd been dropped on my head and couldn't possibly give *unofficial* technical assistance or, indeed, remember how to do anything I hadn't been officially trained on. After all, the job level I'd been transferred to was supposed to only exist for trainees, not staff, so I couldn't be officially expected to actually know anything.

Heh heh heh.

On of the triumvirate was a manager I'd bumped heads with before over various things. Mainly her wanting special treatment and me telling her to get back in her box. I got assigned to her for the training that the employer red tape said had to be done for everyone entering the bottom-rung level.

She saw it as an opportunity to exercise power over me. I saw it as an opportunity to play so exceedingly dumb that she would have to waste hours and hours going over basic procedure while I grinned at her and fielded queries from people who would interrupt us to ask me extremely complex questions.

One of my favorite memories from this time was making her show me, over and over, how to record a corporate-TV transmission off the satellite onto a VCR tape. Considering that I'd set up the entire AV system during my time as the tech there, and written the complete instructions for doing everything on it (which had mysteriously gone missing the day before), it was so very sweet to make her have to keep getting up from her Desk Of Supervision and trot over to the other side of the building to push VCR buttons in front of me.

After a couple of weeks of this, she was on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and I got transferred to the audit division I'd helped out before, under the manager who'd overseen the IT position. I was about ten feet away from the Office Manager's new office, and it's amazing the things you can do which stop just short of outright harassment, or which never get reported because someone's on too much of a power trip to ever let it be known that a bottom-rung employee was getting to them.
   
  
   
However, the story of the failed replacement for me, and the advent of the Guy in the Tie, are a story for another time.

Basically, I was in charge of the yearly refresh project. We deployed about 50 desktops and ran into only a few issues. About a week after the last deployment, I get a call from one of the faculty members,    


*""Hello, this is p0rt at the helpdesk, what can I do for you today?""*  
**""Hey, I don't know what you guys did, but my computer doesn't recognize who I am anymore.""**

I walk across campus to this user's office and they are extremely frustrated with me. I can't even get a word in.    
**You guys need to figure your stuff out and get us working machines**  
I finally get her to replicate the problem and she goes to *schoolname*.gmail.com and it prompts a credential screen. Then it finally hits me, *I should have known from the beginning what was going on.*

*""Do you know your password?""*  

**""No, and I've never had to either. My old computer always knew it was me sitting here and just logged in for me. This one doesn't know it's me. Fix it.""**  

I try to explain that is not how things work. But she was DEAD SET that it was. The facebook login page coupled with her ebay login page only reinforced her strange thinking. 

**""See, these sites don't work either. It just doesn't know it's me. That's the problem.""**

I finally reason with her to try and remember her password and she types something in for her email and it throws the wrong password exception. Then she throws out this little gem after she initially insisted she didn't remember her password.  

**""I know that is my password, that's not the problem. It thinks i'm someone else and isn't letting me in. Why in the world would someone put this kind of security on a school email.""**    

I told her that I will go and talk to our IT staff and get back to her later in the day. I ended up resetting her email password and had my supervisor deal with her. Anti-climactic ending, I know.

It was the Gnomes' fault!,1040,168,174,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/vr9db/a_year_long_nightmare_it_was_the_gnomes_fault/,"So, I know around here there are a lot of big name companies we all love to hate on this board, but this a story about one of them, and our year long battle with them, and how it ended up getting resolved.

Our ISP is the only one that services our area with high speed internet. We literally have no other options, which is why we even ended up fighting this for a whole year rather than switching to another provider.

We had been having an issue where our internet would go out randomly, for about 5-10 minutes, and then it would come back up and be all hunky-dory. At first we were like, well that's certainly annoying. After it started happening EVERY HOUR we began to get really upset.

Unfortunately, due to the large customer-service-hell automated phone system, we were NEVER able to actually get a service rep on the phone while the issue was actually occurring.

**Them:** Well, I can ping your modem and I don't see any sort of problems connecting...

**Us:** We know! It comes back after 5-10 minutes! We can't get you on the phone before it comes back!

**Them:** Well, we're not seeing a problem so there is nothing we can do.

So this exact conversation goes on for months. Which is REALLY frustrating. Especially when we got flagged as a repeat-caller. Ever call began with, *""are you STILL calling about that connection dropping issue?""* with a weary sigh from the unfortunate tech we got on the phone.

After one night of attempting to stream a movie on netflix and restarting the modem/waiting 10 minutes/restarting the modem about 6 times, I lost it. I had been dealing with this nightmare for about 10 months at this point, and I just couldn't take it any more.

I called the ISP, and I cried. I just let it all out on the poor support guy. As someone who works in the support area, I knew what I was doing was wrong, and this poor support guy not only had nothing to do with causing my issue, and that this poor guy simply did not have any tools at his disposal to help me. But it didn't matter. I cried for like 30 minutes on the phone with this guy about how frustrating this whole thing had been.

Then he told me the loophole. I could upgrade to the ""business class"" of service (which is about 3.50$ extra a month for the level we were at already) and they would send a service tech to our house for free for any issue, and if I was ""unsatisfied"" with the solution (or no solution had been found), they would keep sending someone out until I was ""satisfied."" 

Up to this point, we had someone out to check our cables about 4 times already, but we were charged each time, and there had been no real work done. The first time I think they just walked in and replaced the modem, the second time the ran some tests, couldn't confirm the issue in the 15 mins they were there so they left, etc.

So I tell this poor guy that I have been completely losing my cool on for like 30 minutes that I don't honestly see how that could help. 

He then tells me that those service calls cost the ISP a lot, and if a business customer is racking up a lot of them, they GET THE PROBLEM SOLVED so they can stop sending people out. Apparently, he used to work for the dispatch part of the ISP who calls those guys out, and he knew that after 3-4 call outs on a business client who is not paying for each one, it gets escalated up the pipeline fast.

So I say, sure, sign me up for the business class and send someone out.

After the 8th service guy was sent out, THEY GOT SERIOUS. 

At this point they had:

* Replaced our modem 4 times 

* Added 3 different line-filters to weed out other signals disrupting the line

* Spent hours sitting in their van waiting for the signal to go out and then ""running tests""

* Rewired our house to the pole

* Rewired the entire neighborhood's pole system

After all this, they decided it was time to send out the big guns. We were told that ""Scott"" would be coming next time. 

What we didn't realize until he got to our house was that Scott was not an ""on-site"" tech. He was the type of guy that didn't have to deal with this shit. He was a big kahuna, and all the other techs lived in fear of him.

What was the problem Scott diagnosed within about 20 minutes? Our neighbor (Who had never complained about their service) is a retired guy, and a big fan of tinkering. He had created a bunch of things for his wife's garden (which IS a very lovely garden, and VERY designed and meticulously maintained) that she could turn off and on remotely, or change settings about how they moved/ran or actually program things to do a certain ""dance"" every set period of time. Think windmills and faeries and other yard art, and fountains with different settings. What no one had realized in all their visits, is that all the tinkering stuff he set up completely fucks most wireless signals, and throws crazy interference over the cable line back to all the other people within range... which is only us, because we are the only two houses on our pole.

Once he figures it out, Scott goes over to the neighbors house, and spends the next 4 hours drinking our neighbor's beer and talking about all the cool stuff my neighbor has made for his wife, and how he can fix it so it stops fucking over our internet.

This is one of my favorite that might give you a good jumping off point to understand what I am dealing with in this environment.

We deal with a lot of users (tens of thousands) and therefore have very rigorous SLA numbers.  Well recently we migrated to Outlook and the call center numbers have been in the shitter - but that is to be expected and the parent company knew this well in advance.  However they still want to keep some normalcy to the process so they still go over SLA numbers on a call once a month.

One of our SLAs is time to answer calls - which with how busy its been has obviously been very very low (much lower than it is supposed to be).  We plug these numbers in to the parent company provided spreadsheet and then discuss it on the call.  For this particular month we noticed a problem with how their spreadsheet is set up - if we meet the number it turns green, if we are below it is red.  The number this month was SO LOW (think call volume 10x more than what we are used to - which was expected) and so close to 0% that the spreadsheet kind of freaked out and showed it as green - no big deal, right?

Well during the meeting they congratulate us on meeting the number - we inform them that ""we are sorry, and hopefully things will get better as the dust settles, but actually our numbers this month were so low that the spreadsheet just THOUGHT we passed - in reality this is one of our worst months"".

They come back with ""well - they put a lot of work in to this spreadsheet - I think as long as it comes up green it should be fine - we will mark it here on our end as a pass for the month"".

Well SHIT guys - if you just want it to be green, I can make it green.

A Colleague needed to borrow a flash drive off me. No worries, I grab the dual Flash Drive / MicroSD Reader off my desk and give it to her. 
Now, the thing about this drive is, for whatever reason, it takes longer than normal to get recognized by the PC, especially on a slow machine, which hers is.
So she takes it away and plugs it in, and returns a minute later saying the stick isn't recognised. she turns it round to face me, and as she does so I see the explorer window pop up as the laptop finally recognises the stick. 
SO, I stare really hard at the laptop, and do some ""magic hand waving"", and tell her it should work now. She turns it round and looks, then gives me a little ""wtf"" look. I turn round and resume my previous activities.

I had a client who was doing rather well and opening new locations for his business and was giving me quite a few billable hours.  As he got bigger, he passed his invoicing off to some third party and suddenly I wasn't getting paid as quickly.  He was a big client and getting bigger so I didn't want to complain too quickly so I was patient.  

A few weeks go by and I've built, delivered, and installed several new computers for his new office and the bill was getting to be several thousand dollars.  So I ask him about the bill.  He gets extremely angry at me for no discernible reason... 

He goes on about how his ""guy"" will cut me a check every Wednesday... I tell him several Wednesdays have gone by and no check... This infuriates him and he picks up a monitor I just installed and tried to throw it across the room at me!  

The monitor was on one of those long 10 ft VGA cables so it got some distance before the VGA cable came taut (the power cable popped out).  This sent the monitor to the floor very hard and destroyed it!  Stunned... I walked out of his office and called the police (they were no help, he told them I threatened to kill him, they didn't want to get involved in he said/she said bullshit and left...) 

I left, sent the invoice to his billing address, they paid all my previous invoices including that one **and including the now destroyed monitor**.  He called later to try to get some more assistance (he forgot his windows login password which I had reset for him about 5 times...) I refused to help him and refused to give him any information.

I wouldn't leave this organization because I was super concerned that they couldn't thrive without me. And I defended that mindset while several of you in the comments encouraged me to see the light. Thank you...thank you so much for encouraging me to look elsewhere.

I come from a smaller city and didn't think I could ever find another IT place around. It just so happened that after you guys said look elsewhere, I did actually look. And dang it, the local Hospital needed a Network Technician. So dang it, I got myself a new job, and it was because you guys encouraged me to. So now, instead of having to awkwardly handle a midlife crisis woman, I handle two hospital locations and have also received an increase in salary.

Now read on...
   
  
   
So there we were, in this big government department, having just had all our Wang terminals replaced with Windows 3.11 PCs running mainframe emulators. And being a government department dealing with very sensitive personal information, our security was locked down tighter than an eel's ass. We had to lock our screens every time we stood up from our desks, and the keyboard shortcut for doing so on the Wang terminals had been ingrained into the employees' reflexes, sometimes for decades.  
   
  
   
When we got these newfangled things, I had a poke around them and noticed a couple of points.  

* Firstly, the mainframe emulator was an off-the-shelf model with no special security built in. That was all handled on the mainframe end.  

* Secondly, Windows 3.11 vanilla installs included this little applet called Windows Recorder. For those who weren't around at the time, this was basically a keystroke macro recorder. A keylogger, in other words.  

* Thirdly, the management being unfamiliar with the new systems meant that many people were still reflexively using the mainframe screenlock key instead of the Windows screenlock when they walked away from their computer. And given that most of them were running the mainframe emulator fullscreen, the result looked enough like what they'd been trained to expect that they would indeed walk off leaving their PC (if not the mainframe session) wide open.  

* Fourthly, Windows Recorder would save its macros in files which were unencrypted, and thus (if you looked at every other byte) human-readable with a little practice.  

I think you see where this is going.
   
  
   
So I wander down to the office manager, who is something of a blustery bloke and not really technical material, and tell him there might be a security issue with mainframe passwords, and could he give me his opinion on it? He's willing to give me ten minutes, so I ask him to log onto the mainframe - just to the main menu screen is fine. I then ask him to lock his screen and step away as he would normally do. ""OK,"" I tell him, ""imagine you've left the room for a couple of minutes. Someone comes along and does this."" - and I step around to his keyboard, notice he hasn't locked Windows, and fire up Recorder and hide it - ""Then you return to your computer, log back on to the mainframe"" - he does - ""and continue on your merry way. OK, lock your screen again. At some point, whether it be that same day, or your lunch break, or even a week later, you're not in front of your computer for five minutes once more, and the person who was there before does this."" I call up the background Recorder, stop it running, pull up the macro file in Notepad, and scan for his userID, then the string of bytes immediately following it. ""And hey presto.""

I hand him a piece of paper with his userID and password written on it.
   
  
   
Now at this point I am a cocky kid who has just *apparently* cracked national security in thirty seconds flat for a multibilliondollar organisation whose privacy controls are matters of national politics. Oh, and as far as this manager knows, I can access any level of security in the mainframe at will, including everything logged under his userID. In retrospect, I probably shouldn't have stood there grinning and looking entirely too pleased with myself, or let the manager decide which channels to escalate this information to.

As a result, that afternoon I am hauled into his office in front of a number of very unsympathetic, unsmiling people in suits who have never graced our office before, and dragged over the coals. There ensues something of a verbal brawl - they're trying to determine if I have already compromised the mainframe which controls billions of government dollars, or leaked the information to anyone else. I'm annoyed at the way I'm being treated because I was the first person to actually bother to tell them about the very easily identifiable giant-ass security hole THEY shipped out to every office in the nation. I should have been getting a goddamn commendation, as far as I was concerned. Maybe a medal for, as I may have put it in a heated moment, ""Doing all your lazy-ass jobs FOR you, and apparently doing it better!""
   
  
   
So, eventually all the shouting dies down and the suits realise they have to actually do something about this because we're a civilian, not a military department, and there is nothing stopping me from walking up the road to the local Member of Parliament's office and regaling him with enough juicy material to win him headlines well into the next electoral period. They can't even fire me - the union for that place was a six-hundred-pound gorilla and its hobby was jumping up and down on managers. The intimidators have nothing to work with. All they've accomplished is irritating me.  

Oh, and a last point. This was the mid-90s, well before flat-panels became common. As the security detail is shuffling out, I toss at them ""Of course, you realise that even if you fix this, we still don't have [TEMPEST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TEMPEST) shielding.""

They go bananas. They want to know where I heard that term, what I've been doing, everything. But fuck 'em, they already blew their chance. I tweak them a little further by telling them that most computer people have known about it for years - didn't they keep up with the industry? - and that it was frankly none of their goddamn business what I'd been doing in my personal time. Finally, as they'd made *perfectly* clear over the last hour, IT security wasn't my problem. It was theirs. *I* was going to have a really good night's sleep that night.  
   
  
   
Then there was the time I made a manager I disliked spend her time personally training me to press three buttons on a VCR...  
   
  
   
...but that's another story.

Clicking it open, it's from a manager that is well known in the IT Department here for being technologically illiterate. And even more so, most of the folks he manages are as bad, if not worse than he is. The ticket text is completely blank, so I figure it's not hugely urgent. Brew my morning cup of coffee, and then swing over to the lab area where he and his employees work.

I find him pacing out in front of one of our smaller labs. He explains that this is a critical issue, as one of his employees can't work at all. I nod, ask him who, and he points over to the corner of the room. Gerald (not his real name, of course), he says. 

As we begin to walk over, he begins to elaborate. Apparently this month, they are doing cross-training between receiving, technical support, booking, shipping, and ordering. So all of these employees will be jumping from workstation to workstation. Something slowly begins to tick away in the back of my head. That something is very wrong in paradise.

Now, this warrants a little backstory. At my place of employment, we use Dell Laptops exclusively. Each laptop has a monitor, keyboard, and mouse (on occasion a USB Hub or set of Speakers as well) hooked up to a docking station. We primarily use Latitude E6400's and up, so for the most part all of our laptops use the same docking station. However, there are a few cases where they do not. For example, the folks in shipping use Latitude D630's. One of our older employees in Booking uses a Vostro.

As I walk over to the machine, around the corner and up the slight incline, I can already see the issue. But, hearing it from this manager's mouth just really put the icing on the cake.

""When Gerald came in today to work in Booking, his laptop wouldn't fit on the docking station. I figured it was just weird, like there was a piece of plastic in the way or something.""

Continuing to walk forward with this explanation, the laptop is indeed on the docking station. A Vostro. On a D630 Docking Station.

""So, I figured a little elbow grease would do the trick, right? Got over there, and pushed. It was a tough little sucker, but it finally went on! But now the monitor won't light up. I have no idea what's wrong.""

I pick up the entire unit, laptop and docking station, removing the wires from the dock. The laptop is skewed from the back of the dock at about a 10 degree angle. There is a faint rattling sound as I lift the machine into the air. And the machine really, really is not coming off of the dock.

Then it turns uglier as she asks me all kinds of questions and repeats the same questions for every laptop we carry. After 40 minutes of hell, she settles down on the cheapest clearance open box TOSHIBA SATELLITE laptop. Because she was so annoying, i just didnt ask her if she needed anything else and grabbed the unit from the locker and took her to the cash register.

BUT, once at the cash register she then asks me the same questions again and by that time a few people had lined up behind her waiting to be cashed out as i was the only one around the cash register. Somebody sigh'd and the old woman turned around and said sternly:

""EXCUSE ME BUT I AM BUYING MY NEW COMPUTER. WOULD YOU PLEASE BE PATIENT?""

A manager heard that and he ran to the next cash register next to mine and started cashing out the furious customers in line.
At this time everyone is pissed and she then asks me the dumbest question I have ever been asked:

""This TOSHIBA SATELLITE computer, to which satellite does it connect to?""

At this time, i am half mortified and holding my breath to not laugh. My manager and the customers chuckled silently. Then i told her:

""It connects to a satellite called Ourouboros and orbits the earth at an altitude of 600 miles""

Old lady: ""Oh thats nice to know. Would you please write it down on the back of my receipt so i can show my son?""

Me: ""Sure"" and i write it down while some of the other customers were struggling to holding back laughing at the whole situation. Then she went.

My manager facepalm'd then called me to the office to give me a lecture to not do this again but he then patted me on the back.

I worked tech support for a small ISP back in the days that dial-up was king. One day the higher-ups decided to change our POPs and Authentication mode. An email was sent out to all of the users well before hand, though some obviously fell through the cracks. All that they needed to do was to change the dial-in number and add ""@myisp.net"" to their username.

One such caller happened to call while I was on shift. The gentleman in question was of the older persuasion and only had very rudimentary knowledge of English. He called because dial up networking was telling him that his password was invalid.

Over the course of the next hour, I managed to talk him through changing the POP number. It took another half an hour to explain what the @ symbol was. Here is a snippet of the conversation:

**poor guy**: What to do?

**me**: On your keyboard, at the bottom left, there is a button that has ""CTRL"" written on it. Do you see it?

**poor guy**: It say ""Connect"" e ""Cancel"".

**me**: Yes, that is on the screen. I want you to look at the keyboard. It's the thing in front of the screen with all the letters on it.

**poor guy**: ""Connect""?

*Fade to later in the call*

**me**: Right, now just above the CTRL key that we found, there is a key with an arrow on it pointing up. That's called the ""Shift"" key. I want you to put your finger on it and hold it down.

*I hear the computer trying to dial*

**me**: Okay. Click on Cancel on the screen. We need to find the CTRL key on the keyboard again. That's right, the keyboard. In front of the screen.

*continue in this vein until we get to the fullstop in "".net""*

After a further 15 minutes trying to explain what a fullstop, dot, small black circle, point etc. is, he puts his wife on the phone **who speaks English**

Two hours after the call started, I had them successfully dialing in.

During my very next shift, I got another call and recognised poorguy's voice instantly.

I came out of it with some great friends and several good stories, but one in particular stands out.

A couple, let's call them WASP Douche Dad and Soccer MILF, come into the store looking for ""the Internet our son can use to play games."" A little bit of digging revealed that they wanted to get their son an XBox Live package (this was in '04, so we're talking original Xbox). Their son's birthday party was that night, and they wanted to surprise him by having the account set up when his friends got there. WDD obviously thought this was a waste of time and money, so I dealt mostly with Soccer MILF.

At that time, Live packages were actual cardboard boxes that contained the subscription card and a headset. After chatting for a bit, I also determined that they would need to pick up an ethernet cable, and a rather long one at that, given SM's description of where the modem was in relation to the XBox. 

I eventually get them squared away, and as they're checking out, WDD says something about ""home installation."" I inform him that this isn't the sort of thing our install guys do, and even if it was, he'd be paying a ridiculous amount just to have them plug in a cable. He then demands my cellphone number in case things don't go smoothly; I tell him he can call the store and ask for me. This entire time he's been talking about how he won't hesitate to ""return all this crap"" if he can't get it set up properly.

Jump ahead 20 minutes, and I hear my name over the PA saying I've got a call from a customer. I pick up, and sure enough it's SM trying to get this hooked up. Apparently her husband had tried and failed, but she managed to get him to agree to let her call me before he drove up demanding a refund. I ask where she is in the process, and she's done well: The cable is plugged into the modem, in the right port even, but she can't find the jack in the back of the XBox.

XB: There should be a hole in the back of the XBox that looks just like the ones in the back of your modem.

SM: I'm looking at the Game Box, but I don't see that hole.

XB: Make sure it's facing the right way. The front should have four slots for controllers, and the back is where the power cable plugs in.

SM: I see the four joystick holes; one of them is plugged in. And I see the power cord and the TV cord. But I just don't see that hole.

At this point, WDD takes the phone from her and starts railing at me, accusing me of ripping them off, demanding to speak to my manager, etc. He no longer is talking about a refund, but rather has moved on to how this will ""ruin his son's entire birthday"" if it doesn't get sorted out.

SM eventually gets the phone back, and asks if she can bring the ""Game Box"" up to the store, since she still has to pick up some more things for the party later. I say sure, though I can hear WDD in the background ranting about what he'll do to me if they ""come all the way up here"" and I can't fix it.

I don't know if they had a fight on the way, or what, but when they finally show up WDD is fuming. I'm with another customer when he barges up, drops the console on the counter with the cable, and says ""Ok, smartness, let's see how smug you are now.""

I look at the console, look at him, and excuse myself from my current customer. I walk over to our main desk where my lead and manager are, set the console down.

XB: Can one of you please go tell this jackass how to plug his ethernet cord into this XBox.

Supervisor: *In tones as serious as can be* XB... that's a GameCube.

XB: I know it's a fucking GameCube. But the only way I'm telling him that is if I get to beat him to death with it.

Turns out their son had multiple consoles, and WDD was convinced the GameCube was the XBox because ""it's the only one shaped like a box."" Apparently SM had been wary from the start, and had even pointed out that the actual XBox had a giant green ""X"" across it's top, but WDD would have none of it. She had actually managed to bring the XBox along, but he had made her leave it in the car at first; that's why he was so pissed when he got there.

TL;DR I sold some dick and his sweet, hot wife an original XBox Live kit, and he tried to hook the cable up to a GameCube instead. His wife tried to call him on it, but he stubborned his way right into getting laughed at by an entire sales staff.

This happened about a decade ago, when I was young, low-ranking, and ambitious.  IT customers had yet to whittle away at my motivation back then.

At the time, I worked in a network security position at a base in the Pacific.  Managing firewalls, anti-virus, etc.  One day, while manually pushing anti-virus updates to stubborn PC's on the network, I noticed a potential flaw in our security.  Instead of downloading the latest anti-virus updates directly from the company's website as soon as they were released, a higher level of the Air Force would download them and test them before releasing them for the individual bases to download.  It was the military's little bit of added security - make sure the anti-virus company hadn't been hacked and were releasing viruses instead of updates.

The problem with this process was that the Air Force testers were slow.  Really slow.  It would be anywhere from 2 days to 3 weeks before the latest updates were ready for us to implement.  I trusted our AV company, so I figured I'd help speed up the process.  I wrote a little batch script that would check the AV website daily and compare their update with our servers. If it matched, the script ended.  If there was an update, it would download and automatically push to all servers and PC's.  This also saved me the trouble of burning the Air Force's copy to a disc and moving it to our servers (this was before flash drives were popular).  This saved me about 30 minutes of my morning and ensured our network was always updated and secured.

Fast-forward a few months.  There's a huge malicious outbreak in the world (a trojan, if memory serves) and people without top-end protection are finding themselves quickly falling prey to it.  All our bases in the Pacific seemed to catch some form of the virus and are losing network capabilities.  All bases, that is, except mine.  Other bases are working long hours, days on end, trying to purge the virus from the entire network.  My base network never so much as hiccuped.  Because I alone had downloaded the latest updates.

Naturally, when the dust settles, the higher-level Air Force sends in a team of techies to investigate.  They want to know what we did to stay operationable.  Suffice to say, they found my batch file and they weren't pleased.

According to them, I had violated a direct order and circumvented an official process, running my own personal unauthorized scripts on their network.  I was threatened with a court martial with guaranteed jail time for ""using hacking tools"" on a gov't network. (Seriously?) They even suggested that the virus outbreak might've been my fault.

Eventually, someone with some technical knowledge actually looked at the script and realized what it was doing.  Cooler heads prevailed and the Air Force got a chance to really evaluate their system.  They realized that I wasn't a criminal, but a hero.  I had single-handedly kept a base operational while all the others were losing valuable time, money, and manpower trying to get back up and running.

In the end, I was given a slap on the wrist, told not to implement my own personal scripts on gov't networks anymore, and sent back to work.  No court martial paperwork ever came down for me.

A few months later, I find out that I was hand-picked out of all my peers across the entire base for an early promotion in rank.  When I asked my supervisor about it, she said she submitted a recommendation that basically stated that I had ""single-handedly saved the base from complete and utter destruction"".  For once, an IT guy was given greater recognition than the pilots who are actually flying missions all day long.

This is by far the most disturbing thing I've ever seen in my life and makes all other ""annoying users"" since then not seem too bad anymore.  

Some context first, I work for a company with locations in many countries.  I had been sent to one of these overseas locations to get the Help Desk in order (I am a technician myself, the techs there were not following procedure/doing tickets on time, etc..), they were also having a raised floor/new AC installed in the server room and since I had nothing else to do in this country (in a remote small town area) I stuck around to watch it with the IT staff there.

It was on a Sunday night around 8pm, and there were 4 contractors we had hired to do the work in the server room.  They were being checked in on every 15 minutes or so to see their progress and things were going a little slow, but the work was good.  We had just left the server room and went to the IT section right next door when it happened.

There were loud cries for help (in another language) and screaming, we ran to the server room to see the three contractors surrounding the other.  He was laying in the floor motionless with blood around his mouth and on his head, he looked dead.  I've seen this sort of thing in movies, but I was not prepared for it in real life.  The IT manager with me was in shock as was I, but I snapped myself out of it and got him to contact Security immediately (they had medics on site).  The medics came and then eventually an ambulance showed up, which took him to the hospital.  By this point he was conscious and moving, but irrational and trying to fight anyone who came near him, he had to be sedated.

What the hell actually happened?

As soon as Health and Safety cleared us (took about 2 hours), we left for the hospital.  The three contractors were outside and were furious at us (misdirected rage because of their hurt friend), I had to calm them down as they were about to literally kill the IT manager (one took him by the arm behind a van and screamed in his face).  To make a very very long story short that I've had to answer and explain to about two dozen managers/directors/VPs and health/safety staff over and over, the injured contractor had opened the door on a large rack size UPS, removed the bottom security panel, stuck his head in the bottom of the UPS while reaching for something.  His head came into contact with the 220 Volt rails, and he was electrocuted.  At no point were they supposed to be near the UPS (they were well aware of this), and the next morning when we went to check on him again (bringing the whole IT dept this time, as backup) he refused to answer why he went near the UPS.  Thankfully last I heard, aside from a big burn on his head and hands, he is going to be alright which was a massive relief.

There are other details we have found out since then, but I can't say them publicly, this whole thing was a stressful compounding mess and I didn't sleep for days after it.  What a nightmare, but the contractor is alive and well, and since then other contractors were sourced to finish the work.

One of the infected computers were the one in the principals office so I was sitting there fixing his computer. The principal had left due to not being able to use his computer so I was alone in the office. Then walks in my old teacher.

The look on her face was priceless, seeing me sitting in her bosses chair, she was at a loss of words. So I pulled this one:

Me: ""Hi, can't you see I'm busy? Please talk with my secretary.""

Her: ""I... What?""

After he retired from the force, he worked in an HR dept at a regional trucking company. I remember going to his office once - they didn't have computers, just paper and typewriters. He worked there until the company shut down, which was about his retirement age.

Since then, he and my grandma have only ever had a desktop (it's changed a few times, but always bottom of the line). He never used it, unless one of the grandkids were helping him look for a new car.

Anyways, a few years ago I was visiting and he came up to me with a sale add from Best Buy or Circuit City or some store like that and asked me what I thought of a particular laptop.

I looked through the various laptops at the time, and the one he picked out was easily the best one available. I asked him and he was like ""Well it's got suchandsuch CPU, XXgb ram, a big hard drive, and the screen is big""  of course this stunned me. Someone that's never really used a computer, and he knows what the hell all of this is? Totally unheard of!

A few months pass by and I never hear anything more of it.  It's about 6 months later and I'm visiting again. He comes to me with his new laptop, that I didn't even know he had purchased btw; asking me to help him fix his antivirus software.  It had the factory installed Symantec/Norton trial which had just expired.  I look at the system, and he's installed Office, uninstalled some of the vendor apps, and been using it wonderfully for a while.

Then I also realize that when he bought the laptop, he also bought a wireless router (previously they only had a wired router b/c only had a desktop).  So not only did he figure out **on his own** how to install and uninstall stuff on his new laptop, but he also was able to read &amp; follow instructions enough to setup his damn Wifi and have it functioning correctly.

My grandpa is in his 70's now, and is a better PC user than some of the people in their 30's and 40's at my office.  I guess it goes to show that some people really can comprehend how to read instructions, read messages on the screen and follow a logical path to figure things out.

Oh, he's had that system for about 3 years now and I've not once been called to fix anything on it (I've checked with the rest of the family as well - he hasn't called any of them either).

Again, it's not IT but it's tech support all the same. A fair warning: This story is a bit gruesome.

I work for a company that produces medical devices. One of the functions of my department is defective device returns: When one of our products fails in the field, they send it back to us and we get the pleasant task of reproducing the problem. Once upon a time two of my coworkers were tasked with just such a return. They suit up and get into the lab to find a horrendous sight.

Normal protocol for packaging a return that has been used on a person is to drain it of blood, rinse it thoroughly, seal all ports, encapsulate the device in an airtight container and then put it into the box. It is immediately apparent that whoever processed this return had done absolutely none of that. The box before them is soaked in human blood.

Upon opening it up, the cause is immediately apparent. When the device, a plastic container the size of a pineapple, was identified as a problem it was pulled from the system while filled with the patient's blood. Instead of draining the device, or trying to recover any of the patient's precious bodily fluids, the guy responsible for any of this merely clamped off the incoming and outgoing tubes, looked at his work and proclaimed, ""close enough"". Please note that this is a catastrophic failure to obey not just universal protocol (which is to treat all blood as if it has Wizard AIDS) but common sense itself. Well, surprisingly, the clamps had not held in transportation and here we are with the mess that is sitting on the lab bench before our heroes.

In their paper gowns and nitrile gloves, they open the loathsome package and get right down to work. The actual issue is long since shrouded in mystery but the work proceeds normally. They arrive the next morning to find a few very serious-looking men in suits and their manager asking them to sit down for a meeting. It turns out the package they worked on yesterday came from a patient with Hepatitis C.

Hepatitis C, if you didn't know, is a nasty old illness. Not only is it incredibly lethal and easily transmissible, the virus itself can live outside of the body for up to ten days. There is a very good chance my coworkers have been exposed. So they are subjected to a hefty dose of antivirals, the facility is scrubbed down with bleach, and the company comes under investigation.

Now I wouldn't tell this story if it didn't have a happy ending. Both of my coworkers came through with clean bills of health. The Department of Transportation investigated the matter and did not penalize my company. The hospital that sent us the package is now blacklisted from using their preferred mail carrier. So, it all worked out in the end.

Not too long ago I was approached by someone I know who had problem with iPhoto her 2007 MacBook with ancient OSX (she thinks I'm a wizard since I got Office 2011 installed on the same machine before).

The problem: iPhoto would instantly going into ""spinning beach ball of death"" mode whenever it was launched and cause a tremendous slowdown to the the entire system. To the point that Force Quitting the application was useless, nothing would respond and you had to hold the power button to do a manual reboot.

I took a quick peek at Finder and found the probable cause: some 90,000 photos (NINETY THOUSAND, not even an exaggeration) in the default Photos folder, including a few obvious thumbnails of nude photos of herself and/or her boyfriend towards the top of the folder (I also may have accidentally clicked and viewed several of them in larger size on the preview area when she wasn't looking, just to confirm what I was seeing). Anyway I couldn't fix her problem - and that her system was so old and clogged, she probably needed a reinstall or new computer - and advised her to take it to the Apple Store.

At the Apple Store, one of the geniuses confirmed my guess and said they couldn't fix iPhoto and her MacBook would need a reinstall. He tried selling her a 500 GB hard disk for $100+ for backing up her data, which she gladly bought despite my advice that she could get double the space for less elsewhere, 'because it's her money'.

The Genius said she could leave the machine with them overnight and that he could do the backing up for her before doing a reinstall. Knowing better than to leave a computer loaded with personal data (especially with what I saw earlier in the thumbnails) with any technician, I asked her if she was sure that she wanted to do that and subtly hinted to her backup her data onto the disk now and erase everything on the local drive before she handed it to Apple.

Now, this young lady isn't exactly known for her intelligence but reassuringly said ""it's fine"", even after I asked her ""are you SURE you don't anything important or confidential on there that you don't want anyone to see?""... to which she replied ""no of course not, I have nothing important there (in my Macbook)!""

Me:  I'm not sure who it is that set the policy, but I'll be happy to help you if you're having trouble with your password.

User:  No, I'm not having trouble, I think it's funny watching the Attending across the hall struggle to invent a new password that the network will take.  Since I'm having so much fun I thought I'd send the person in charge of the policy a bottle of scotch.

User:  Derp, I take it from that tone you guys use when you're trying to be polite to idiot callers that you think you're pretty good with computers.  So I want to see if you can tell me how to log into a computer when I don't have the password for the account on it.

Me:  (Suspicious) Is this your computer?

User:  Of course, and now that I've been recorded saying that, you have no reason to worry about it coming back on you.

Me:  Is it a hospital owned computer?

User:  Maybe, which would make you happier?

Me:  If it's a hospital owned computer, you enter your credentials and then log in normally, so long as it's on the network it should verify who you are and let you in.  If it's not a hospital owned computer, then I'm not allowed to help you with it since we don't want to risk damaging a PC we're not responsible for.

User:  Oh don't be such a wuss.  Fine, I found a laptop in the park, I just want to log into it to see whose it is so I can give it to them.

Me:  I think you'll be better off taking it to the police.

User:  I can tell, there's no point in denying it, I've talked to almost everyone at the help desk, I think there's only one person there who'd pass a drug screen.  I have a patient refusing chemo because she can't stand the sickness, so I need to make her some of my special brownies.

I own a local IT Shop in a small town of about 11-12K people.  I am the only established shop in town with a storefront.  We service both residential and businesses for IT issues with PC's, Networks, Smart Devices, ETC.  If you want to utilize a competitor, you have to call someone in a neighboring town which is about 25-30 miles away and most likely will charge you an additional fee for travel time.  My company charges only the hourly rate with a minimum of one hour starting at the time we arrive on-site.

My tale begins today with a business customer's office manager who I'll call Phyllis Lou (PL) who is trying to cut the cost of our services as she see's fit.  (IE: On December 22nd, you came out and did work and it only took forty-five minutes.  Why do we have to pay for an entire hour?)  Two things to note:

1.  This customer has a special discounted rate of $45.00 an hour since they have been a customer since we started the company.  Our regular business rate is about $30 more per hour.

2.  My personal home is about 1/2 a mile away from the client-site, my office is about half an hour across town.

I receive a call from Phyllis Lou at about 12:30 p.m. today because her computer won't start up.  She wants to know if we can come take a look at it.  I remind her of the minimum one hour charge and she agrees to come have me look at it.

I travel the half-hour trip to her office and find her PC running with no video.  I check the monitor and the power indicator light is not showing.  I press the power button and presto the monitor comes to life and her desktop appears.  The following conversation ensues:

PL: ""We're not paying you for that, you didn't fix anything.  You just pressed a button.  I could have done that!""


ME: ""Phyllis, you called me.  You could not figure out what was wrong with your computer.  I am running a business, just like you are.  You requested my services, I provided the service.""


PL: ""Well, I don't think I should have to pay an entire hour.  I will pay you for the one minute you were here today and that it took to fix my problem.  If you want my business, you'll treat us fairly.  If not, I'll call Max Freelance.  He will only charge us $40.00 per hour!""


(Max Freelance is a guy that does PC Repair out of his home in his spare time.  He also works day shift at a factory from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m. Monday through Friday in a neighboring town about 45 minutes away.  This is not a viable threat, because their offices close at 5:00 p.m. and she would have to wait around for him.)


Me: ""Do you think that Max Freelance would charge you less than a dollar for his time?  Plus you are going to have to wait for him to get off work.  Is the extra hour and a half of your time actually worth the $5.00 you would be saving?  Now if you have anything else that you need me to look at, I'll be happy to look at it for you.""


PL: ""Well, you were on your way home anyway.  I don't know why it should be counted as service call since it was on your way home anyway?


Me: ""Phyllis, it is 1:00 p.m.  My shop is open until 6:00 p.m., I will be returning to the shop after this service call.  I explained to you on the phone that it would be a one hour minimum charge for me to come out here.  Now if you have anything that needs my attention, I will include it in your one hour rate charge.""


PL: ""You might as well leave.  You can bill whatever you like, that doesn't mean we are going to pay it!""


I leave, and will be billing them an hour as per our agreement on the phone.  If they don't pay it, no more service.  In this case, I would consider a win.

My job involved desktop support, as well as maintaining a file server.  The job was always a bad match... I didn't like them and they didn't like me.  I did a good job though while I was there, but finally jumped at the offer of a job elsewhere.

While working in this department, my most difficult user, Stacy, was the department secretary. She was a big fan of downloading every piece of junkware she could find and slowing her computer to a crawl.  Worse still was that she managed to integrate whatever utility the software enticed her with into her work flow, so removing it meant re-training her on the right way to do things.  I wasn't allowed to lock down her computer, as she might find that demeaning... this was the official policy from our mutual supervisor.  It was bad enough that I kept an identical computer ready to go, and would just transfer her files to it when her computer became unusable, then re-image the ruined one and keep it ready to repeat the process.  Suffice to say, Stacy was not a friend to computers.

This is not my tale, though.  Upon getting a job offer elsewhere,I spent my last weeks ensuring that there was foolproof documentation for everything.  Disks were organized, passwords and serial numbers were listed, processes were detailed... they were left in a state where most small problems could be dealt with until they hired someone to replace me.  I even gave them my phone number at the new job, just in case they needed help finding a piece of info, or a tip on an easy repair.  This was my mistake.

Stacy was designated to fill in for me while I was gone.  As bad as that might have been, she actually stepped up to the challenge fairly well.  I got calls, but they were usually of a nature of looking for a piece of software or needing contact info for someone.  I had no problem giving them a few minutes of time here and there.  It was going well.

After a couple of weeks though, she called with a much more serious issue... the server had crashed and wouldn't restart.  Crap... they have a lot of important stuff saved there.  After a few questions I determined that the drive array was dead. I don't know exactly what was wrong, but it just wasn't detecting a disk.

Stacy asked how to fix it, and I told her right off she probably wouldn't be able to.  I said they would need an IT professional to properly diagnose and repair this.  Not to be dissuaded, she tried framing the question multiple ways.  She tried reminding me how important the data was.  She proposed her ideas for solutions, such as asking how she could restore from the tape to make it work.  I just kept explaining that until there was a working drive array, none of that would be possible.  I'd end calls and get another an hour later.  This went on for days.  She'd call and ask if I could walk her through fixing a drive array over the phone.

This was no longer a simple matter of filling in the blanks with a two minute phone call.  I finally had to tell her that if they hadn't managed to hire a new IT guy, then they would have to bring in a repair service, and there was no way she was going to be able to handle this repair alone.  The calls kept coming, though, from poor Stacy who wanted to be walked through recovery from a catastrophic server failure.  I finally just had to ignore all outside calls until she stopped.

Little back story. I work in a small IT shop. We handle both small/medium businesses and home users. I mainly work on businesses but some days I take care of home users if we get backed up some.

So I get a job working for a family where the husband is clueless about computer and the wife knows enough to read the instruction and install their router. One problem though, it doesn't let them connect to the Internet. So wife (actually a smart user) contacts the ISP. Unfortunately this ISP has no competition in this area so they can get away with anything they want. ISP has kinda a name for themselves for poor support. After a few days of wife working with ISP, she gets to the point of crying. She has been paying for two months for Internet without ever getting on (someone had open WiFi in neighborhood). This is where I come to play.

I get the call and end up going to their house. They live about an hour away from my shop. Not a big problem for me. I get there and find wife setup router correctly. So I start looking at its configuration. Router not getting external IP. So I go through the usual diagnostics and find we are not getting external IP. A call to the ISP later get a scheduled technician out there next day. Note, ISP tried to 'confuse' me with techno babel. I stopped him in mid B.S. and explained what I did. He quickly realized I did this for a living and not a user that he could shift the blame around with. I leave site giving my cell (nice people) telling them to have ISP onsite tech call me when he shows up. Was there past my working hours, decided not to charge extra because they were really cool and offered to feed me dinner.

Next day I get the call. Tech guy says everything is working now, and he doesn't see a problem. My money is on they found a problem with the account and fixed it before tech went out. I have my user double check everything. I then instruct user to connect router. They are now working. He thanks me up and down.

I go on about my business just happy I was able to get them going.

Friday rolls around (last week) and the husband comes in. ""Oh shit"" I thought to myself. Something isn't working. I mentally start going though all the possible problems. He start telling me how happy he was with my work, and how his wife is finally not angry/crying over this, and now everything just ""works.""

*Ha HA. Pull the other one, pal.*

*For lulz, I quickly ask one of my friends who was approached by the scammer, for a screenshot of the convo. She delivers, with a bonus addition of his reply after she denied him -- apparently he threatened to hack her website, get into her personal finances, and ""ruin her"". She also informed me that he sent her the amazon gc anyways, telling her now she was completely obligated to pay him the paypal. A quick call to Amazon confirmed that the GC was funded by a stolen CC, and she was actually in the middle of talking with a CSR right then about what to do.*

To all of you who don't have awesome users, here is a story to bring a ray of hope to your dark IT existence. 

Background: Small two person IT support team that does everything from Tier 1 to Tier N+1, including SysAdmin duties for a SMB. 

One of our remote users calls up and reports that her laptop is running slow and has been getting slower for a few days now, ever since it fell off her desk. 

And now you're thinking ""Wait, your user told you she dropped her laptop? You didn't have to drag it out of her?!?"" Yup! I meant it when I said my users are awesome.

""OK!"" says I, ""odds are the drop damaged your hard drive and the drive has been degrading since, which is why it's been getting slower over time. Is there any other damage that you can see, like a cracked case or screen?"" 

No other damage, so I write up the ticket and promise to overnight a replacement. We change her password to a newly generated PW that we both know (laptop must be joined to AD and have AD user cached before going to remote location.) 

""OK, we're all set. I'll have the replacement laptop to FedEx by the end of the day. There will be a return label in the box. Save the box and use the return label to ship the failed laptop back to HQ, any questions?"" 

As promised, I get the replacement shipped before the end of day, in time to make first AM delivery even. Not bad. The next morning I get a call from the user...

""I logged in and all my files and settings are here!!! You even have the picture of my dog as the wall paper! Thank you so much I thought I would be starting over and would get nothing done today! I'll get the old laptop shipped to you today. You guys are awesome, IT at my last job was awful."" 

Aww yeah, having spare equipment and proper endpoint backup (CrashPlan PROe) rocks. Thank you VP of IT for approving the budget. 

So a couple days pass and I get a delivery. A little soon for the bad laptop since return shipping was the cheapest FedEx Ground option and we're not expecting anything else. 

Waiting for me at the front desk is an Edible Arrangement with a thank you note from the user. I was on PTO when this user started and never met her face to face, but she went out of her way and paid her own $ to send a delicious fruit arrangement. 

A few days later the failed laptop arrives. No visible damage, pop in the Lenovo diagnostic DVD and the laptop promptly fails every hard drive test. 

TL;DR: Awesome user sends Edible Arrangement as thank you for great IT service. My users are awesome!

A little backstory:

I am lucky enough in my job that I have a very loose dress code, so I do not have to wear a button up shirt and tie or even business casual. Most days I wear jeans, a t-shirt, and possibly a hoodie if it is cold. What I am getting at here is that I look like a student or some other random person. I have no id badge or anything identifying me as a staff member unless I show my staff ID in my wallet. My ensemble for today consists of a pair of jeans and a monty python themed killer bunny shirt.

So I arrive at the next dorm that I am to do updates to and find that it is one of the few buildings on campus that does not have a card swipe access. The attendant inside sees me try to open the locked door and proceeds to let me in with just a ""hello"". So I then proceed over to the eight computer stations and begin my work.

One of the stations had been tampered with and was wanting a bios password before it would boot up, so I disconnected the CPU and opened the case (piggy back mini tower Dell 745) to find that the password reset jumper is under the hard drive cradle which has to be removed with a phillips head screwdriver. Since there is typically another department that deals with hardware issues I do not carry a screwdriver with me at all times.

So while I am dismantling this computer, the dorm attendant is walking around doing random things. She sees what I am doing to the computer but says nothing. I then ask her if she has a phillips head screwdriver. She digs around and finally finds one and I proceed to take the plate off as she walks off to do something else.

So I end up finishing the lab update and I decide to say something to this woman who is supposed to be watching over stuff and is obviously not a student worker. First I tell her how the login has changed (moved the units to AD). Then I say:

**Me**: Not trying to get on to you, but you really need to be questioning anyone who is obviously taking computers apart...especially if they ask you for a screwdriver to do so.

**Her**: Oh...yeah I was watching what you were doin'. You probably saw that I was starin' at you (I didn't). But I saw your ID card so I didn't say anything.

**Me**: (looking puzzled) But...I don't have an ID card.

She proceeds to point at a lanyard that I have hanging out of my pocket that I use for my keys. I then have to explain what a lanyard is, that a lot of people use them, and they are not an indication that the person is with the university or the computing center.

**TLDR**: Lanyards are good enough to prove you are with IT. No other ID necessary.",,False,,t5_2sfg5,False,,,True,t3_184z3k,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/184z3k/your_credentials_check_out/,

One of our responsibilities is to lodge faults with contracted technicians for faults such as no sync or PPP failure; whereupon the company contracted will dispatch a technician to the exchange, and then usually to the customers premises.

I spent fourty minutes on the phone with an absolutely unreasonably furious Indian bloke, who was tearing shit out of me purely because I was female and he was 'sure there must be a man who could help him'. I told him that I was equally as qualified, and that I could confirm his issue was a misjumpered port, and that a technician would be dispatched to the exchange and then to the house. I advised him that the technician would most likely attempt to contact him before visiting the premises to give notice.

Finally I got rid of him.

Two days later I get a call back from him, please note his accent was awfully strong which, in the heat of the moment, infuriated me even more so. 

Me: Hi you're speaking with Chloe, how can I help you today?
Him: Hello. It is Mohammed. From 73 Example Avenue.
Me: [OH. DEAR. GOD. NO.] Oh hello Mohammed, how are you? Did your fault get resolved as per my booking on Tuesday?
Him: NO. It did not! The technician arrived at my house. And did not call me! He turned up, and did not call me I tell you!
Me: Oh I am very sorry to hear that sir, I understand that they do sometimes visit the premises whilst in the area and are not always supplied with all contact information if they are doing a dropby; I do apologise for the inconvenience.
Him: He turned up on my property! He did not call me! This is bloody illegal I tell you! (please apply thick Indian accent for effect). 
Me: I do understand how you feel, however you agreed to the technician as he needed to visit the premises to resolve the fault. 
Him: (this is when he started yelling) HE CAME TO MY HOUSE. YOU HAVE BROKEN THE BLOODY LAW. I WILL CALL THE POLICE.
Me: Sir, please kindly lower your voice and I will do my best to assist you.
Him: DO NOT TELL ME TO LOWER MY VOICE YOU INCONSIDERATE GIRL. I AM CALLING THE POLICE RIGHT NOW AND I WILL HAVE YOU ARRESTED. 
Me: Bu-
Him: I KNOW THE ADDRESS!! I WILL COME THERE NOW!

This is about the point where I got really fucking mad. 

Me: No. Sorry sir but you are wrong. I advised you of the technician, and you agreed. They are contracted out so you will have to lodge a complaint through them.
Him: NO IT IS YOUR FAULT-
Me: YOU ARE AN IDIOT. AN ABSOLUTE IMBECILE.
Him: HOW DARE YOU TALK TO-
Me: STOP TALKING. YOU CAN. NOT. ARREST. ME. I DID NOTHING WRONG. YOU ARE THE REASON WE HATE OUR JOBS. YOU DO NOT DESERVE THE INTERNET, AND YOU SHOULD NOT OWN A COMPUTER.

He kept yelling so I hung up. Note I was 5 months pregnant at the time, so I got a pretty stern telling off once he rang up and complained about me, but luckily just escaped being fired; probably the whole 'pregnant crazy lady' thing.

I work at a small company as a programmer, and am often called upon as impromptu tech support. Now, as a little background, the CEO of the company, is an older gentleman who used to be a programmer (punch card era). He is rather tech savvy, and often 'experiments' with his machine, leading to... interesting results.

A few years ago, I set his machine up with voice recognition, because it was faster for him than typing, taught him how to use it and all that. He never used it, to my knowledge. Fast forward a few years and I get called in to his office. Him, the president and the head of IT are there, all looking a tad worried. The CEO informs me that his machine is typing by itself, and that this means someone must have taken over his computer.

I look over, and to my surprise, an excel spreadsheet is open, and various fields are being filled, emails being opened, etc. The president asks if perhaps the CEO's daughter might have logged in remotely somehow to do some work, and as if to confirm the suspicion, I notice her name being filled out in one of the field on the spreadsheet.

I call the daughter in question, and she informs me she is in fact NOT logged in. This is when I notice some of the words being typed. More specifically the fact that they match what I was saying. Turns out voice recognition got turned on somehow, and the computer was happily listening to the whole meeting, writing down what was being said, and interpreting things as commands.

Needless to say, I disabled the feature, and rolled back the changes to the spreadsheet. Strangest issue I have ever had.

Let me just sum it up with this example: *He didn't know how to cut and paste.* I swear to god he didn't know how to cut and paste.   

2. This woman has been with the company for over 20 years. One day she has a question and comes over to my laptop and asks me to look at something for her. I pull it up and she says ""No, pull it up in Notepad++"" (our standard editor). ""This is Notepad++..."" I say confused. ""Pull it up in the one we normally use, the white one."" Oh, now I get it. I was using the Deep Black theme. Because I wasn't using the default (white) theme I wasn't ""programming"". 

3. This one has been with the company around 30 years. Long time project manager, wants to see what programming is like. Shows up the first day with out her laptop. She says she'll follow along and catch up tomorrow. The next day she shows up and wants me to spend the day helping her catch up instead of teaching the class. I have someone else start teaching and sit with her. I say ""Okay, log into [the Unix box]."" ""How do I do that?"" ""You do have an account on the [Unix box], right?"" ""Oh yes, right here."" Long story short, she's trying to use her Windows laptop user name and password to log into Unix. Not something I'd demand a project manager to understand (they should, it's part of the business), but something pretty crucial to an aspiring programmer.  

Okay, so here's the kicker. They all make more money than I do, a significant amount more. Because they are ""so experienced"" they are making anywhere from 10% to 25% more than I am. 

Thank you for giving me a place to rant. 


**Edit**: Some clarification - **A project manager is not a manager of people, they manage projects**. They do things like work with the client and programmer to nail down a time line. I work in a manufacturing industry, so they are also responsible to make sure supplies are ordered and available in the warehouse at the time their project is ready to hit the production floor.

All the equipment tested fine, so I offered to call DISH Tech Support. The representative confirmed that the connection was fine, and everything was normal.

I informed her that it was super slow, to the point where checking email and browsing to Google were *painful*. She asked me to hold while she checked on something. When she came back, she informed me that they are 90% to their bandwidth limit, and so they're being throttled. I was surprised - they don't use Netflix or anything like that - all they do is browse Facebook, and sometimes download music. I asked what their bandwidth limit was, and she (the representative) told me 11 GB. Wow.

I told the rep that I couldn't believe they pay ~$80 a month for an 11 GB download limit that gets throttled that way. She also told me they're on a 30 day rolling cycle, so there's no hard reset day for bandwidth. However much you downloaded yesterday will disappear in 29 days. I asked if there's anything more we can do, and here's what she told me:

**DISH rep:** Hmm... I see you are on the gold plan. What we could do, for only $10 more a month, is upgrade you to the platinum plan.

**Me:** Oh yeah? $10 a month isn't bad - what's the platinum plan?

**DISH Rep:** Well, instead of up to 5 Mb download and 1 Mb upload, you can have up to 12 Mb download and 3 Mb upload. It's a really good increase for only $10.

**Me:** That sounds all right... how much does the bandwidth limit increase?

**DISH Rep:** Hmm... the bandwidth limit will be 11 GB.

**Me:** It doesn't change? Really?

**DISH Rep:** That's right.

**Me:** So what you're saying is... they can pay you $10 more a month to hit their bandwidth limit even faster?!

**DISH Rep:** ...Yes, sir, I suppose that's correct.

Sadly, I was not able to take a picture of this incident, but I will try and explain it as clearly as possible. It's a funny, but also rather 'derp'   user moment.


An employee has been complaining for a while that his laptop has been crashing, every time he uses anything 'heavy'. On elaboration, we determine that even though we can hear the fan spin up,  it's a CPU overheating issue and decided to monitor the laptop in our work area until it crashes. After spritzing out the fan intake/out guards with canned air, we leave it for a day with it in our plain view, while running Prime95 for CPU stress tests. Laptop never crashes. So we give it back to him stating we can't see why it's crashing, but with a note to bring it back as soon as the crash happens, so we can try to glean some dump info off it.


About an hour goes by and he returns saying 'it happened again'. Mind baffling that in one hour he was able to reproduce the overheat/crash that we where not able to in a full day. Anyway, I go to take another look at it, and decide to take the palmrest/base apart in order to clean out the fan, and re-apply some thermal paste. 


 **This is where ~~shit~~ gets nutty.**


After about 45 min of work, I finally get to the fan on this laptop (a model where you have to remove the entire MB to get it). I see little bits of plastic under the fan, and was thinking 'huh, something got broke off into it, maybe it can't spin'. On a closer inspection I notice that all the pieces of plastic are black, and uniform in shape. I take out the fan assembly, and there right beneath it is every single fan blade broken off the central hub.... The fan spins the hub, but **no blades are on it!** I look at the metal guard on the heatsink and see it is bent in nearly the exact width of a small screwdriver diameter. He stuck a screwdriver into the fan guards and broke every single fan blade off of it. As if this was not enough, the reason the CPU didn't overheat during our tests is because we had the laptop in a normal room temp range. Derp employee had his laptop in his office, three inches from a desk heater on high. 


Derp employee literally broke the CPU fan and caused his CPU to continually overheat by running CPU intensive applications while said laptop without a fan, sat next to an electric space heater. *Well... there's your problem.*",,False,,t5_2sfg5,False,,tftsflair,True,t3_1706pc,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1706pc/my_laptop_keeps_crashing/,

I then realise some sharpie marks on the screen. Guess What?

Stumbled across this sub the other day and it made me think back a few years to my tech support days.  I was doing helpdesk support for a GOVT agency in D.C, the end users were ridiculous and had a trigger finger to call the support line.

I had calls for broken coffee machines, AC units, ""Need more Printer Paper"" but I remember one call in particular.  This woman was a VIP, amazing how the VIPs suck more than most with computer skills.

--------------
VIP: I have a huge report due in 10 minutes and my computer just powered off! I didn't save any of my work!

Myself: Well I am sorry to hear that, what exactly happened prior to the computer shutting down.

VIP: IT JUST WENT BLACK, send someone to fix it now.

Myself: Alright one second..
(... sure lets just do no troubleshooting for your time sensitive project that I may be able to fix in 10 seconds.  Lets just send someone....some people.  I look up the users location because VIPs get w.e the fuark they want.  *FACEPALLLLLM* She is in a remote office nearest desktop tech is 40 minutes away. GREAT.)
Myself: Unfortunately the tech wont make it out for 40 minutes.

VIP: NO i need someone to fix it now.

Myself: Well, you are in a remote office, unforunately we don't keep anyone there because that office is generally empty.

VIP: This is unacceptable..

Myself: Look let's just go through some troubleshooting steps real quick.  First, can you turn down your music real quick so we can run through some steps. (she had some soul music in the background made it hard to concentrate.)

VIP: I can't my pandora crashed when my computer turned off.

Myself: (Interesting... pandora still running while computer is off.  Magic pandora.) What color is the monitor showing on the LED in the bottom right corner.

VIP: ORANGE, why does that matter?

Myself: Can you look under the desk real quick and tell me if the computer is on... you should see a green light on the power button..

VIP: yes it is green 

AHHHHHH she must have just unplugged the VGA/dvi or bumped it or something...
I spent 5 minutes trying to convince her the computer wouldn't eat her alive if she just went to the back and plugged the wire behind the monitor.  She finally worked up the courage and of BAM the computer turns on!

VIP: WOW MY COMPUTER REBOOTED SO FAST AND MY WORK IS HERE.

...rebooted fast... whaaaaa okay I will just let her think that... I give up.

Myself: Yeah they are fast... Have a good day.

The worst part was that now the VIP had me on speed dial... every day with her powerpoint questions, my font is too small BLAH BLAH BLAH... ugh at least those days are behind me.

It all ends with this chapter. It’s been heartwarming reading all your comments, and well; I hope to see them here again. 
* * *

I was staring at the screen for what have been minutes. I was looking at an FTP server software package. It was one of the FTP-programs that we sold actually. I opened it and was met with the default screen. I knew how the program worked and re-opened the previous session. It gave me a directory with thousands upon thousands of files. You could not know what the files were from the names. 

There were many pictures, videos and RAR files scattered around, judging from the extensions. I didn’t know what to do. Do I want to know? Can I now? Should I know? What if it is nothing? I did not feel well and my legs had become rather heavy. I grabbed a chair to sit down. I stared at the files once again; I decided that they could not have expected privacy here. When Ron still worked at my school he had always copied my schedule, even adjusted it to suit his purpose and I never felt that my personal folder or school records stored on the school network were safe from his prying eyes. He has said some things in the past that he could only know from reading my school record. 

My throat felt like it was being chocked when I opened the first image on the list. It was a picture of a full nude woman having sex with a man - it looked like it was taken by the couple themselves. Like most of the porn that I’ve seen in this store I wasn’t particularly excited to see it. I looked at another 12 or so pictures, randomly sampled from the first 100 items I could see. It were more pictures like these, but with different people. I wanted to stop before I hit on one featuring Ron or Don. Or both.

He probably ran some back alley porn website for people with rather poor taste. Questionable yes. Illegal? No. I was calmed down by now and felt easier, when I saw a 13th image was still loading. The download seemed stalled because of connection issues but when I tried to cancel it it suddenly loaded and opened. It was a picture of a kid. A cute girl I have to say.

It was strange to see a picture of a kid among all this pornography. I downloaded the next few images that were on the list to see what was going on. As they started opening one by one on the screen my entire body went in shock. I quickly tried to turn off the monitor and by doing that even knocked it over. What was displayed on that screen was gruesome to see. Everything I did not want to see that kid do was there on those pictures.

I went into what I will still call shock. I didn’t really respond to anything for a few minutes. I was just sitting there, watching the screen that had fallen over. I did not want to know how much more was on there. That was the only thing going through my head. How much more was there? Did Ron did this? Did they touch that kid? Was this part of a whole network? How long was this going on? Who knew about this?

I must have tried calming myself down for over 15 minutes before trying to walk over to Jeremy to tell him all about this, whenever I closed my eyes the pictures were still visible to me. I did not get very far, sitting back on the chair again .

It wasn’t until I saw a figure come in that I freaked; The cage was open, the papers were scattered on the ground and the monitor was knocked over. I looked up and was happy it was Jeremy. Jeremy wasn’t so happy seeing me in this state. He kneeled down be me to ask me what was wrong. I didn’t say much. He would be back in a minute, he closed the store door and got me some water.

It took him some time to get me talking and after I told him he was the one that didn’t say anything for a while. He sat with me for a while before he walked over to the computer and put the monitor to its feet again. He didn’t doubt me. He just needed to know if it was just those photo’s or if there was more. Even accusing Ron &amp;amp; Don with something horrible as this was something they didn’t deserve if they didn’t do it. He walked back to me and said “We are going to the police, there are thousands”. He acted strong for me but I knew full well that this was getting to him as well.

We walked to the police station as it was only 10 minutes away. When we stood by the counter an agent started talking with us. Jeremy did the word as he seemed to still be able to make himself sound intelligible. The agent took us seriously and walked us to the back to one of the offices in the building. He gave us something to drink while we waited. Cheap disgusting office coffee, I can still taste it in my mouth. It was my first coffee and my last.

After 15 minutes another agent came in with a woman who introduced herself as a detective. She would be taking our story as the accusation was something they took very seriously. I snapped “It’s not an accusation! I saw it with my own eyes”. She understood my anger and took the time to calm me down and explain everything. We had been at the police station for over 2 hours when my parents were called to pick me and Jeremy up.

The police seized all the computers and hard disks in the store the next morning and Ron &amp;amp; Don were arrested. From what I heard Ron was going mental when he was arrested. Don was going silently. 

* * *

I obviously had quit this job by now, and so had Jeremy. In the days and weeks after we were being interviewed by about six detectives about the store, Ron &amp;amp; Don, and what happened that night. I was still underage at that moment and needed to have one of my parents with me. I had kept so much about the store from them, for better or for worse. I told everything. My father visibly was breaking apart from all of it. He would’ve made me quit before I had even started if I had told him everything.

Frank &amp;amp; Richard were also questioned by the police and from talking with them later were for the first time in their life silent for more than a minute. Even they had not suspected anything and were genuinely concerned about me and Jeremy. The interviews with the police were really heavy on Sarah who only found out when the police came to the front door. She was just starting to get her life together. Johan and Marcel were questioned as well from what I heard, but wether they had anything to tell, I don’t know.

The store was sealed off after Ron &amp;amp; Don were arrested. Weeks had gone by and I hadn’t seen or heard anything from them. They were still in custody. `When I walked with Jeremy past the store it had been boarded up. Last year after being empty for years it was demolished to make place for a new housing project.

It took months before the trial against Ron &amp;amp; Don started and the police stayed quiet about any progress they had been making in the meantime. Jeremy seemed to have recovered quite well from all this, probably because he wasn’t the one that discovered it. He knew what he was going to see and was mentally prepared. Maybe it makes sense, maybe it does not. I don’t know.

For me it was something that kept me up at nights. I went into therapy for this. My view before all this was that therapy is for the crazy people that couldn’t deal with the world. I was hesitant to go and be labeled as a crazy person. Nothing was further from the truth. I was processing everything that happened and was finally letting go.

When I went to the trial it was the first time in months that I saw  Ron and Don. By now I was done with school and  trying to enjoy my summer vacation before starting at my new school. Ron &amp;amp; Don looked different. They had lost a lot of weight and looked tired. They had on suits which was a strange sight. Ron looked at me with an intense hate in his eyes. He blamed everything on me I suppose. Don didn’t look at me. He looked like a broken man, I started to feel that he had nothing to do with it. He wasn’t the noblest of men but this went too far to make a profit, even he had standards.

At the trial I learned that Ron had been hosting the FTP-server with the content since the late 90s. Around that time the store was doing rather bad and he needed money. One of the people he knew had hired him to set up the site that was still being used. He was a facilitator, not a producer.

None of the content of the site was original content according to Ron’s lawyer. Nor had Ron ever created or looked at any of the content. I was happy when the prosecution did not challenge this fact. It meant that it was probably true. According to the lawyer Ron had simply rented the computer out to the third man that was on trial as well. I didn’t know him, I did not want too. 

When it came to the users of the server; there were a few dozen of users. Every user is of course one to many, but there was little to no money to be earned from it. Ron and the 3th man netted about a few thousand a year. Not something you would risk everything for. But they did.

 I must say I was happy they weren’t professional. 

The lawyer had tried to get the judge to dismiss the server evidence as it could have been tampered with by me and Jeremy or anyone else for that matter. I was relieved when the judge didn’t accept it and went on with the proceedings, barely acknowledging the attempt from the lawyer. It should not have mattered much as at Ron’s home 16 more hard drives with the same content were found. Back-ups according to the lawyer. Evidence according to the prosecutor. Ron was sentence to four years for possession and distribution of the material. The third man was sentenced to 3 years for possession, as his contract with Ron for the server could not be proven.

When it came to Don the proceedings became fast. The prosecutor was sure of his guilt and participation in the crime. But the evidence did not reflect it. He never was near the cage and there was no any activity from him logged on the server. His house search had turned up nothing.
The judge did not find him guilty. I still don’t know wether or not he knew. I hope he did not knew.

* * *

As for me and Jeremy, we stayed together after this but broke up later because he stopped going to school again. We still talk, but nothing like we used to do. He has his own life now. As do I.

Sarah recovered completely in the months after. We still speak and hang out on a regular basis. She now works with an IT-Company that provides software services.

As for me. The therapy had helped immensely and  I moved out of the town after the trial was over to go to a new school. Not heaving learned my lesson I took another job about 9 months later that again involved customers and a rather chauvinistic boss.

A few days back, I had my first experience of truly moronic tech support. My responsibilities as an L1 tech in Engineering IT usually only went as far as quota issues, password resets, basic hardware support, software questions, etc.

Then, there was the professor.

This guy is apparently notorious in our department as being verbally abusive and absolutely moronic when it comes to asking for help from us. So, when he walked into the helpdesk with a brand new Retina MacBook Pro 15 inch, I immediately got worried.

My fears were not unfounded.

*Prof*: ""Where the hell is the start menu on this piece of shit?""

*Me*: ""Sir, it's a mac. It doesn't run Windows, you won't get a start menu. But if you'll let me show-""

*Prof*: ""**WHAT DO YOU MEAN THERE'S NO FUCKING START MENU. WHAT DID YOU DO.**""

*Me*: ""Sir, I'm sorry, if you had bought a Windows computer, it would run Windows. There's not a lot we can do-"" (at this point, I'm not going to bother to explain Bootcamp to him)

*Prof*: ""Well you better fucking fix this or I'm going to your fucking manager to get you fired.""

At this point, he drops (yes you read correctly: DROPS his $2200 machine) onto my desk and storms out of the office. I open up the lid, and the screen is quite obviously slightly cracked. Angels descend and let out a single tear, and then I reluctantly pull out a Windows 7 install disc and look up his purchasing ID and charge the cost of a professional license ($30 through the university) to his account.

He comes back the next day, already angry because of something else totally unrelated. I tell him that I had to install Windows through boot camp. He then proceeds to ridicule me.

""How come it can run Windows now when it couldn't run Windows yesterday?""

He then opens up the lid, and all hell breaks loose.

**""WHY IS THE FUCKING SCREEN CRACKED? WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO? THIS IS BECAUSE YOU INSTALLED WINDOWS ISN'T IT!?""**

""No, sir. The crack is because you dropped it on my desk. I am also required to inform you that the license to windows cost $30 and it was charged to your professional account-""

(Now, this was probably an awful time to say this)

""You what? **YOU FUCKING CHARGED ME? WHAT IS THIS SHIT? HOW THE HELL DO THEY LET MORONS LIKE YOU CHARGE ME MONEY? THIS IS BULLSHIT!**""

""Sir, it was $30, I'm required to charge it to your account.""

""**IT'S YOUR FUCKING FAULT THERE'S NO START MENU, WHY DON'T YOU PAY IT YOURSELF?**""

And that's when I killed him officer.

**tl;dr smashed a brand new mac because it didn't have Windows. Blamed my installing of windows, then flipped a shit when informed that Windows actually costs money.**

edit: WHOA People like this story! a few more details:

1) I reported the guy to the dean of engineering.

2) He's tenured which means he can't be easily fired, however his employment contract is up for renewal early next year so that oughta be interesting.

So tonight he starts asking me about viruses.  I guess he's heard viruses mentioned, and we've had brief best practices discussions (you know, he's 8, there only a certain level of deepness you could get).
He was asking questions that most of my users wouldn't begin to understand.  I even told him that he was more computer savvy than most of the users that I support.  Questions like ""Can viruses attack hardware?  Like your motherboard?  Or the hard drive?"", or telling me instances that he comes across on the web, like fake virus alerts and such.

Also, keep in mind that their desktop are suppose to have only 4 icons.

Me: Yes, It's a small red circle called user center.

1362910393.0,811,self.talesfromtechsupport,1a0ojg,Surprisingly it wasn't the monitor...,988,177,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1a0ojg/surprisingly_it_wasnt_the_monitor/,"There are some days where I never understand what is going on in a user's head while they're using a computer. Years ago in an Enterprise support environment for a company I used to work for, I received a message via a page saying a user at so and so extension left an urgent message for me. I was already working on at the time a rather critical project after hours to avoid user impact, so of course, it's also the only time something ""urgent"" shows up. I give the user a call after checking voicemail from a mobile phone to see what the matter is which of course accomplished nothing, and the conversation begins with the user along the lines of:




Me: ""Hello, this is Smith6612 from the IT Department, just returning your message, how many I help?""

User: ""WHERE IS MY DATA?!""

Me: ""Your files? Have you looked in My Documents or on the file server for them?""

User: ""No, and I don't want to look for them! I just want to get my Excel file open!""

Me: ""Where exactly are you trying to open your file up in the first place?""

User: ""From the Recent Files menu in Excel. Every time I click on my file it says File not found!""





From this point, I'm a bit confused as to what is going on with the user. I'm getting screamed at like no tomorrow, and I'm a 15 minute walk from their location. Anyways, to continue onward, the call begins to escalate further. I maintain a calm attitude as I automatically head towards the user's desk since I knew from experience something like this wasn't going to end well, whilst remaining on the phone with them to try to sort this one out. I continue to ask them where they think they last saved the file, if they moved it around and so on. I was eventually able to get out of them ""My Documents"" after a lot of resistance from them, and I had them check the My Documents folder after getting the exact path out of Excel. The user states they see files, but not the one they're looking for. I have them use Windows Search to find the file name elsewhere in the computer, and no results appear.

At this point it's clear to me that they've moved the file, renamed it or have otherwise deleted it and I inform them I'm on the way to sort out the issue. When I asked them to check the Recycling Bin and the Modify dates for their files for safe measure, they got furious. I received an earful of some colorful words, followed by ""NEVER MIND, NEVER MIND, BYE! -click-""

Five minutes later after getting hung up on, I arrive at the user's desk to find the user not present. Their computer was also missing, with the mouse and keyboard scattered around the floor. The keyboard was missing some of the keys as they had scattered on the floor, and the monitor (A CRT) was turned and nearly about to fall off of the desk.

I found the computer moments later around the corner from where their office was in a hallway. It was laying on the ground with the side panel busted open (they are locked shut for obvious reasons), the front panel coming off, a small dent in the side of the case, the PS/2 plug for the mouse connected to the back of the machine with the rest of the cabling missing, and well, you can get the picture. On the inside of the machine, the motherboard tray was damaged, missing some of the plastic risers holding it up, and some of the add-on PCI devices were also coming out of the slots due to the motherboard. Nothing else looked damaged.

In the back of the machine I found of all things, a USB Flash drive. I take this drive along with their newly destroyed computer back to my office/server room/workshop and begin to find out what exactly happened. I was fortunately able to get the hardware out of the case, install it in a ""test bench"" scenario and get the hardware to start up without issue and survive a small stress test so that was definitely a relief to me at the time. For their hard disk, I installed that into a known good machine and began to run some forensic software on the drive to search for previously deleted items. I connected the USB Flash drive to another machine, and upon the device being recognized and mounted I see the missing file, perfectly intact with a modify date from the day prior sitting right in the root, clearly not at the path the user had mentioned on the phone. The forensic software also returned back with that same file, showing identical dates and data to what the flash drive copy had but in a deleted state.

Rather annoyed at this point, I copy the file back to the hard disk and ensure it opens. I rebuild their system into an extra case, deliver it back to their desk with some Kensington locks and then resume the project I was working on prior to the temper tantrum. I also filed a report for intentional destruction of company property as required for such incidents, which was swiftly handled by management the next day.

I've been a long time lurker but a first time poster on this subreddit and now I'm currently commuting to my lovely job as a tech support agent, I thought it would be lovely to share a few of my stories. Obviously over the years I've had your basic problems like ""I've bought a new wireless router and my pc can connect to it but don't have access to the internet."" ""Have you connected a cable from your modem to your new router?"" ""No, why should I? It's wireless isn't it?"" &lt;/insert facepalm&gt; but a few really stick out for different reasons and I'll share them with you

I've been in techsupport for over 7 years now and I've done it all, from Tier 1 to Tier 2 and everything beyond that and right now I'm working with a team of 6 others setting up a entire new customer service desk for a brand new ISP. But I digress.. On to the juicy stories, minion!

**Invoices and inevitable doom**

Let us start at the beginning, this is a story of my first day about 7 years ago in customer and tech support, and as you can imagine I was quite nervous throughout the entire day but I quickly found my groove.

""Hello, this is *BigDutchISP* *KeithSqik* speaking, how may I assist you?""

And a really posh guy answered *""Hi, I've been having some issues with my Digital television as it doesn't appear to work on any of my settop boxes.""* And I thought *Ok, this dude has more then one settopbox and none of them work, so it could be a splitter problem or something to do with the signal* and I collect this guy's customer information. And much to my dismay I saw the problem right away and to be honest I panicked. I seriously started to stutter and to sweat and thought to myself *""Ah, man! This guy is going to freak out on me and it's only my first day.. I don't want to handle this shit"". So I swallowed my fear and said *""Well Sir, I euhm.. I.. I've seem to have located the issue and it seems that you have two unpaid invoices that are due with a total sum of 3500 euro and that's why your television services have been temporarily suspended until the invoices are paid.""* 

Let me just briefly explain that I've been trained to handle your basic household subscriptions and the average people spend on their monthly services is around 60 euros, so I was just gutted to see the sheer amount that this guy still owed us.

And I thought this guy was going to ge berserk and he replied *""Ah, ok then I know who to call, thanks""* *click* and I was stunned, WTF!? just happened? I thought this guy would go mental!


It turns out after I did some digging that the customer in question was the owner of a hotel and in every room there was a settop box for video on demand and such and his accountant neglected to pay us. Pfew, dodged a bullet there.

**Finding out your son is gay, the hard way** (No pun intended)

This is a story of how a tactical error on my part caused severe repercussions for the customer in question. Oi.. here is goes.


""Hello, this is *BigDutchISP* *KeithSqik* speaking, how may I assist you?""

""Yes, well I would like to know why my invoice of this month is so high, normally I pay around 100 euros but this time it's over 300.""

""Well I understand why you would want to know that Miss"" And I collect the customer information and pull up the latest invoice. Immediately I see that a paid *""service""* number has been called quite a few times. (and I mean service in this case in the broadest of terms) and I tell the lady that if she logs into her account she can see the same invoice I'm currently looking at and that she can see that her invoice is so high because of her phone usage."" She told me that she lived in a three person household, just her, her husband and their 17-year old son. And she had spoken to her husband and he claimed not to the made the calls.

She informed that her PC was up for repairs and inquired if I could look in to it. I told her that I couldn't give her the number due to legal reasons and I advised her to log in via another pc to check the invoice herself.
That's when she got smart.
She asked me if I could see the number which I couldn't deny because I told her I have the same invoice in front of me that she received via her account.
She asked me if I had access to google, to which I replied *""well, yeah""* I saw where this was going and I was not amused..
She asked me if I could google the number to see what kind of *""services""* it provided. So I did and I was not disappointed. 
*""I've googled the number but I would like to ask you to confront your son about this phone usage, because if your husband didn't make those calls and you didn't, it might have been your son. Because these calls definately placed with your landline.""*
*""I want to know what kind of services have been dialed, you googled it, you have it in front of you, I wish to know!""*
*""Consider said services, I press you to speak to your son concerning this matter. If you really wish to know. I will provide you with the information but at your own risk.""*
*""Please tell me""*
*""Ok, the number that has been dialed of which the costs are in excess of 200 euro's this month are to a Gay Sex Phone Line""*
*""but I didn't know my son was gay...""*

I really hope it wasn't her husband that called those numbers. If you enjoyed these stories, I'll add more.

**TLDR - Pineapples are the source of all evil, the entice you with their yellow goodness and then strike you with their poisonous core**

[EDIT] - Included a bit of background info about the second call and thinking about it.. If the boy in question was 17 at the time.. that made it actually illegal for him to call those numbers since they were 18+ lines.. Never pondered that and I added a TLDR.

[EDIT2] - Fixed a typo and changed wish to hope. As a non native English speaker I was never taught the difference and I thought the words were interchangable.

[EDIT3] As the ""/u/the_leif"" rightfully pointed out, it appeared I made some accusations towards the son, which most definately didn't happen in the original conversation.

This usually includes my own kids, who generally pick the most inconvenient times to ask me to fix something.

So a couple of nights ago my son (18, knows how to install Windows but as far as I knew not so good with TS issues) appears at the door with a problem.  His PC keeps shutting down after being powered up for a few minutes.  Given that his room is usually hotter than the surface of the Sun I'm pretty sure his PC is overheating so I tell him either I can take a look in the morning or he can have a go at cleaning all the crud out of the CPU heat sink, but if he has problems he'll have to wait till the morning for me to fix it.

I don't see him again so assume he's blown the dust out and everything is ok.  The next morning he wanders downstairs with a bunch of screwdrivers, fans and cable ties from my box of spares and I ask him if everything is working ok.  He replies:

'Yeah, I cleaned the dust out, but it still kept overheating and shutting down, but the big heat sink thing was cold..... I thought that was wrong so I took it off and cleaned it and put some of that thermal paste on it and put it back on again.  It started getting warm then and the PC stayed on, but games kept crashing. I had another look inside and the graphics card fan wasn't spinning so I tried turning it and it was really stiff.  I tried spinning it in my fingers for a bit but it didn't make any difference so I borrowed a fan from your box and cabletied it the card, now everything's working OK. Thanks Dad.'

Not the most elegent of fixes, but he figured it out on his own.  Proudest Dad Ever.

Off the top of my head, this is the first ""tech support tale"" that comes to mind.  Sorry if this is cliche or common.

I worked at Comcast as phone tech support for the internet.  So basically, a lot of resetting modems.  I got a call from a middle-aged woman who said her ""internet was broken"".  I started to go through the common troubleshooting steps and quickly realized she had no idea what I was talking about.  She seemed frustrated from the start and was instantly giving me attitude.  She seemed completely baffled when I asked her how many lights were green on her modem.  She didn't seem to have any idea what a modem was. 

She did, however, say ... ""My TV is black"".  

This confused me, because I was tech support for the internet, but it was possible she intended to call tech support for Comcast's cable television department.  I asked her to clarify if she was having an issue with her cable box....

**HER:** ""Look... it was working fine earlier today... now the internet is broken.  My TV is black""

**ME:**  ""Are you having trouble getting television channels, Miss?""

**HER:** ""NO! ... MY INTERNET IS BROKEN""

**ME:**  ""Sorry... I mean to ask, are you having trouble with your television service as well?  I do not show that there is an outtage in your area, but if you have pr--""

**HER:** ""IT'S MY INTERNET!  It was working earlier today and now it's BROKEN!""

**ME:** ""Ok, I understand... I'm sorry for the inconvenience.  So it's not your cable service.  You are having trouble accessing websites and your e-mail?""

**HER:** ""IT's just black!  My TV is black.  Nothing.  It's just BLACK!!""

*I had to pause for a second and sigh internally.  This woman was clearly not tech savvy.  I had to think like my grandmother or this was going to be long call... and then it suddenly hit me... no... can't be... can it?*

**ME:** ""Miss, everything is going to be fine.  I'm going to take care of you.  Let's try this... look on the back of your TV... can you tell me how many cables are coming out of it?""

**HER:**  ""Two""

**ME:** ""Ok, great.  Make sure they are plugged in nice and tight.  Next... can you do me a favor and just very carefully follow each cable to see where they lead?  We just want to make sure they haven't come loose""

**HER:** *Sigh* ""Fine... but I'm telling you it's broken.  *Pause* Ok, one is going into the wall.  *Pause* ... The other is going into the big box under the desk""

**ME:** ""That's your computer.  There should be several cords going into the back of it, right?

**HER:**  ""Yes"" 

**ME:** Does it appear to be on?  Any noise coming out of it?  Are there any lights on the front?

**HER:**  ""Yes.  There are blinking lights on front""

**ME:** ""Ok Great.  Here's what we are going to do.  Look on the FRONT of that ""TV"" screen that is black.  Towards the bottom there should be buttons.  Sometimes they are a little hidden on the bottom of the screen.  You should be able to feel around for them.  One of them is a power button.  It might have a symbol that looks like a circle with a dash through it.  Go ahead and press that button when you find it.

They had the idea that they could set up something akin to the walled garden of AOL where people had access to a sort of extranet and e-mail. It was really cheap compared to other ISP's, so it was a moderate success, especially amongst older/less tech savvy people.

One of the things people had to do on sign up was register their e-mail address.

Now, one of the things about the accounts was that we couldn't change e-mail addresses.

The call:

**Client:** *I'd like to change my e-mail address please*

**Me:** *I'm sorry sir, that's about the only thing we can't change*

**Client:** *But my son tells me I should change it because it has too much information*

I work in the service industry, and so do all these guys. I should try and make someones day, because frankly I have never had a problem with my internet or cable. I called up Time Warner's customer service line and went for the the support option from the automated menu.  After a while I got connected to a nice young man named Kevin. Kevin had a strain in his voice probably because it was getting to the end of his shift. But he seemed genuinely willing to help. Anyway after his brief this call may be recorded script he asked me for my account info ect. I stopped him there and informed him that there was no issue and that my info wasn't needed.Surprised he managed an ""okay..."" I went on to say that I just wanted to thank him for doing the job he does, and that I to work in the service industry therefore I know he deals with the worst of humanity on a daily basis. It takes a special kind of person to deal with that day in and day out. I ended with a sincere ""Thank you, to you and your co-workers."" The line was quiet for what seemed like ever before he replied with a ""Sir, you have no Idea how much that means to me and my team. Thanks."" His voice had gotten noticeably happier as he asked me if there was anything else I needed help with. I replied no thank you. We ended the call and I could hear his smile through the phone.

She then asks the verizon employee why she couldn't understand the problem and why I could help her in the nastiest way possible.  ""Because you're a bitch""  I said smiling.  A silent hush came over the store again.  ""EXCUSE ME?""  I said ""look, it is one email address you log in to through multiple sources, your phone email client, your home browser, your phone browser, it is all the same thing.  You had an extra number, that is why it wasn't working for you on your phone, it is hard to type on with nails like that.  The verizon employee was doing her job before you were so rude to her for no reason at all"".  She gets pissed and starts to leave.  I then say ""by the way, the text is so you never have to forget your password again, and because I knew all of your personal info and didn't want to be suspect if you had any problems with it later on, so that is why we changed it (person's name)"".

1363369723.0,805,self.talesfromtechsupport,1ad0wm,The Story of the $2000 Patch Cable,954,149,108,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1ad0wm/the_story_of_the_2000_patch_cable/,"Long story, bit of setup:

I sub-contract for a guy (which we'll call Joe) that provides internet services for hotels. The ISP brings a line in, and he gets it from there to their offices, front desk, and to the guests over wireless. He's from a city a couple hours away. Generally, I cover his clients in my city (which we'll call Loudtown), he covers the clients in his (Joetown).

He's on vacation. I'm covering all of his calls.

So I take a call: ""Hey, we're having some issues with internet on all the PCs in the office.""

Basic questions follow.

""Okay. I'll connect in and take a look from my end and give you a call back.""

I can connect into both of their routers. That's a good start. The one that handles their back office is show a fair number of dropped packets. I'm getting a lot of timeouts pinging the load balancer from the router. The other router seems fine. Figure maybe the cable's bad.

I call back.

""Okay, from my end I'm showing a lot of dropped packets between the router and the load balancer. I suspect it might be a bad ethernet cable. Do you have any spare cables around?""

She hunts one down, calls me back.

I start trying to walk her through identify either end of the cable that we're going to try replacing. The load balancer is a little DrayTek device that looks something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/COLqxMe.jpg) minus the antennas.

Given a description and the fact that it says ""DrayTek"" on the front... She can't find it. But she can find the router. I'm logged in. I can see the connection to the load balancer is on port 1.

""Okay, can you see the cable that's plugged into the port that says ""1"" on it?""  
""Yeah.""  
""Okay. I need you to follow that to the other end, that will be plugged into the 'DrayTek' device.""  
""It doesn't go anywhere.""

...

I don't have any diagrams, so there's a possibility that the cable doesn't go directly into the load balancer, but it sure as hell goes somewhere. I can see the packets flowing through it.

A few more rounds of this same question phrased different ways, and she gets frustrated and puts some other guy on the phone. Instead of it ""not going anywhere"" now

""It goes into the big machine.""  
""Sorry?""  
""The big loud machine.""  
""Does this big loud machine have a door and shelves inside?""  
""Yes."" (Oh ffs.)  
""Okay. I need you to open the door and look in there. For the 'DrayTek' device.""

(It's a rack with a door, btw.)

It's about this point I get a ""hold on"" expecting him to start looking. Instead I hear some muffled voices and some other guy picks up.

""We have a support contract. This is ridiculous. Our whole office is down and everyone's standing around unable to work and we have to get our accounting done. You need to come in and do this right now.""  
""I'm sorry, Joe is away on vacation right now, and I'm in Loudtown. If you'll let me try and assist you, I'm sure we can resolve this.""  
""Let me speak to Joe right now.""  
""I'm sorry, as I said he's away on vacation right now and away from any sort of phone service. The only contact I have with him right now is e-mail.""  
""Okay. You need to send him an e-mail right now.""  
""I can certainly do that for you, however he's only able to check it every few days, so we'll have to wait a couple of days for a response.""  
""That's not good enough. Someone needs to come in, this is totally unacceptable.""  
""I understand your concern, however there is no one in Joetown right now to come in. I am the only person available, and I'm in Loudtown.""  
""Why didn't he get someone in Joetown to handle his calls?""  
""I don't know. You would have to ask him that. If I had to venture a guess, it would be because I've worked closely with Joe and I am familiar with his equipment and methods and he has full trust that I can handle any issue that might crop up.""  
""No. Someone is going to come out or we're cancelling our contract. We're cancelling all of our contracts."" (This guy owns and manages about half a dozen large hotels.)  
""If you'd just let me-""  
""Someone better be here by 5 or I'm cancelling my contract.""

Now, this takes place at 2:30. It's a 2.5 hour drive, city limits to city limits, on a good day. I'm still sitting around in sweats, and the weather hasn't been great, so the highways probably aren't pristine. There's no way anyone is getting there by 5 unless they have a secret teleporter or a time machine.

""There's absolutely no way I am able to get there by 5, but I will come this evening.""  
""If someone's not here [blah blah blah hot air].""  
""Yes, I understand. I'll be there this evening.""

Now, if this were one of my clients I'd tell him to take all his hot air and blow it out his ass. But he's not one of my clients, and as understanding as Joe is, he probably won't be pleased if he comes back and I've lost him a half a dozen contracts within the week.

So I pack my gear up, toss some spare parts in my car, check the oil, check the tires, fuel up... And hit the highway.

It's pretty good for the first 60 miles or so, then the highway turns to a skating rink for the remaining 95. I make it there by 6.

They've left no instruction with the front desk. They've left no access to their offices. I can get in the comms room, so I go in and plug away a bit. Everything looks okay. I need into the office to figure out what the hell's going on.

Some phone calls later and they've revealed a hidden key to the front desk girl to get me in with explicit instructions I'm not to be out of her sight while I'm in there.

A little offended, because I know that's not SOP with Joe, but okay.

We head in, and I'm chatting away with front desk girl while working out loud to kind of fill the silence.

I pick a computer. ""This one's fine.""

I pick another. ""This one works.""

I pick another. ""This one works too.""

I pick another... no connection.

I interrupt the conversation with the front desk girl. A little unprofessional, but I was annoyed as all get out. I'd relayed a large part of how I had come to be there by this point. (to a response of ""Yeah. That sounds like &lt;boss&gt;. He's a jerk."")

""Whose desk is this?""  
""That's Carla's. She's the owner's assistant.""  
""Does... Does Carla do the accounting?""  
""Yes... Oh my god.""

I pull the cable from the PC, plug it into my laptop. Line's dead. Like, dead dead. I pick up the VoIP phone it's plugged in to... Still has a connection. I replace the cable from the phone to the PC. No connection. So the PC port on the phone is screwy. I spin the spinny chair. There's a spare port in the wall.

I measure, cut and crimp a new patch cable. I plug it into the empty port. I plug it into the PC. It works.

I ask if they can comp me a room since I've driven all this way. Because the highways were bad coming out. Because the highways will be worse going back. Because it's dark out.

They won't.

I stop by a fast food joint and eat a quite meal by myself. Did I mention this was my birthday? It was my birthday. I spent it alone eating a hamburger hours from home.

I used to commute on the highway. I would drive home when it was blizzarding so badly I couldn't see the hood of my car for 80% of the trip (as long as there's a bit of clear view once in a while to re-align your car with the road, it's okay!). On days when the highway was empty because no one else dared venture out, I'd still keep up ~50mph.

I was doing below 20mph at points, and never broke 40mph. There was so much snow on the highway I couldn't distinguish road from ditch. I resorted to simply eyeing some signs a ways ahead and aiming in between them, hoping they were the signs on my side of the highway. It was a nightmare of a drive.

They wouldn't take the support provided, and demanded a higher level than what was actually required by contract. Joe doesn't eat the cost for their unreasonable demands and passes my bill onto the client.

I generally don't bill time spent driving (just mileage), but reserve the right to. I bill that time.

I generally don't worry about billing callout fees or minimum callouts, but it's part of my standard agreement. I bill both.

By the time the day is over, I've wasted over ten hours and they've paid around $2000 to have someone come and plug an ethernet cable in to connect their PC to the wall.

All because they had to be melodramatic instead of giving me a proper description of the problem in the first place.

But hey, that's the price of being demanding and lying to your IT support.

(I know this reads less as a tale, and more as a rant. Because that's what it is. Hopefully it's still enough in the spirit of the sub.)

**tl;dr** - I spent 8 hours on a skating rink that used to be a highway driving to and from another city because big boss man had to have someone on site RIGHT NOW to deal with THE ENTIRE OFFICE BEING DOWN.

She called in on the line for a financial services company.


**Me:**  Help Desk, this is wonderweirdo.

**Caller:**  Hi, I was calling because we're having problems with our whole system, the computers are all really slow and we think some have viruses on them.

**Me:**  Okay, let me see if I can do a remote connection to them, can you give me the hostname off of one of the computers?

**Caller:**  What's that?

After I talk her through the process of locating the computer name she reads it off to me and I notice right away it's nothing like what the client uses.

**Me:**  Wait, this is a strange hostname, it doesn't even show up on the network.

**Caller:** Can you just come over and look at the computers then, I was told you can come over.""

**Me:**  Let me get some information, what department are you in?

**Caller:**  We're in no department, we're at Apostles Glory Bible Church on Herp road.  

**Me:** What, you called in on the help desk line for a financial services company.  I'm afraid I can't help you.

**Caller:** But John Smith (Not his real name) gave me this number and said you'd provide us with free help.

**Me:**  Sorry, but that's not the case.  I'm going to have to let you go now, but you'll have to call a computer tech for your problems.  Good luck.

I end the call, and write up everything in a detailed email to my boss and send it over to him.  No sooner do I send it than I get an IM from one of my peers that they have a caller on hold asking for me.  I take the call. 

**Me:**  Help Desk, this is wonderweirdo.

**Caller:** This is wonderweirdo?

**Me:**  That's right

**Caller:**  This is John Smith, I was just contacted by my church and told that you refused to help them.  You need to reconsider given that this is supposed to be an act of charity to them.

**Me:**  (Annoyed)  Mister Smith, this act of charity you're talking about comes at the expense of your company and at my time.  If you want to donate to your church, then why don't you pay for a tech to come out there and work on their network?

**Caller:**  Why would I go through all that trouble when we have tech support right here?  You have to consider that this is for a church, can't you understand that this is a moral obligation?

**Me:**  (Now really annoyed)  Mister Smith, I'm in no way morally obligated to help your church.  I'm not even religious, I'm going to end this call and make sure that my manager pulls the recording to go along with my report.  Have a nice day.

I hang up and email my supervisor again, this time I get an IM from one of my peers that the church has called back two more people asking for free tech support, and the story is the same.  

My manager is already on the phone with the client about this issue.  The calls stopped coming in, and towards the end of  the day I find out that John Smith is being dealt with by his managers.  The church did call one more time, and my manager had them transferred over to him where he explained that they should not be calling on that line since Smith had no right to volunteer our services to them.

You'll laugh, you'll cry and hopefully you won’t kill any (more?) end users. 

I will begin my journey through the horrors of tech support with you where it at all began for me....

I was 18 and finally old enough to work anywhere I wanted without restriction, so where did I apply first!?! Best Buy tech bench, of course. Yep, I was an original 'black shirt' as they called us before 'freak' squad came to be. I had my newly obtained A+ cert and was ready to conquer the tech world with my broad knowledge. On my 3rd day behind the bench, a lady brought in her top of the line E-Machine (HA!) in for us to look at because according to her, it was making 'loud grinding noises' and then powered down and never would come back on. In these days, we would take the effected machine to the bench (in plain sight for all to see), run a few tests and diags to determine what may need done. So I told the lady to give us 15-20 minutes and come back and we should have a pretty good idea of what’s going on. So I take the lovely E-Machine back to the desk and the first thing I want to instinctively check was of course the PSU (for any non techys, that's the power supply in the computer). As I attempt to take off the side panel, I realize that something is catching the slots and making it really hard to get the panel off. After some tugging, the panel came off to reveal a makeshift magazine rack. Yes ladies and gentleman, someone had been rolling up and stuffing their Hustlers inside the computer case. So not quite yet knowing the material that the magazines contained, I started pulling the rolled up magazines out of the case, unrolled one and got an eye-full of hoo ha...and so did the people lined up at customer service. Awwwkward. I quickly put the magazine out of site and take the PC into the adjacent office and show my supervisor that immediately lost it. This wasn’t the hard part, the hard part was explaining to the customer what went wrong with her machine. 

After some deliberation, we decided to tell the customer the truth for the shits and gigs that we knew would proceed. So the customer returns and the conversation went something like this:

Customer: So what did you find out!?

Me: Well, there were rolled up magazines stuffed inside the computer case itself that caused the fan on your power supply to fail and in turn burning it out. So you need a new PSU. 

Customer: Magazines?! What kind of magazines!? 

Me: Um...

Customer: It DEFINITELY wasn't me, so it could only be my husband!

Me: Adult material...So would you like us to...

*Before I could finish, the customer informs me she will be right back*

*Within a short period of time, she walks back up to the desk with a mortified looking man*

Customer: Tell HIM what you found...

Me: Um, I, Uh...there were...um...porn. 

Embarrassed guy: Oh...

Customer: You are completely disgusting derpy derp herp derp 

At this point, she is shaking and whacking a rolled up Hustler at who I assumed was her significant other in front of everyone on a busy day. 

This would be the first of a hand full of rather awesome tech stories to come out of Best Buy. 

Stay tuned for many more wonderful stories that took place throughout the last 10 years of my climb to where I am now as a Senior Network Administrator for a large Fortune 500 company.

Thankfully, a couple of friends do owe me favors and can sweet talk me into some jobs, but I rather not tap them until I'm in a bind. Anyway...

A recent client call has made me reconsider the aformentioned career change, at least for the near future.

I had a case where a rather hysterical middle-aged-sounding woman called me up and asked if I could recover deleted pictures. I'm sure you guys with any experience pretty much know the scenario. Aged mother, accidentally deleted kid photos, is hysterical and wants them recovered.

So, seeing that I could not get her to calm down over the phone, I went ahead and paid a house call (which is already seldom for most cases like this for me).

What greeted me was a bit more than expected, but not outside the norms. She looked like a trainwreck, and was obviously trying to hold back the tsunami of grief she was about to burst on me. Being a man who recently lost a mother (2 years, fuck cancer), I had to put my best ""dont worry, I got this"" face on. Her husband was no better, having his hand on the computer like he wanted to will the photos back.

It seemed to calm her down when I did the usual QnA with her, and found she has 2 drives, the second being the one needing help. Husband was a retired civil engineer, and was a nice, if somewhat sullen guy.

Taking out my normal tools for the job (I normally use a liveCD Linux distro for this, reduces HDD handling and thus, to me, increases chance of a 100% recovery, also impresses people when they actually look and see me typing in Terminal), I quickly found the directory she stated and managed a 100% recovery of it all. I double checked and made copies of it all on my external DVD and recovered the actual photos for her hard drive. 

I then told her the photos were safe, and she now has a second copy of them, as I handed her the now filled DVD.

I was expecting waterworks. I wasnt expecting a full-on double hug and the Hoover Dam breaking.

So I was standing there with a crying mother and an apparently grateful father letting it all out for a good 10 minutes before she calmed down enough and she found all her pictures again. I was feeling good about myself and other than my (reduced, not every day you claw someone's day from the jaws of despair to a bright new hope) fee, the rest were free.

So as I was concluding business and was on my way out, I just off-handedly asked where her children in the photos were. She all of a sudden got that sullen look on her face and just said ""They're in a better place now.""

Didnt hit me until the husband saw me out, and thanked me for ""recovering the last bits of their kids."" I manned up and asked where the kids were and he then told me they all died in a car accident years ago.

I was stunned.

Just yesterday I recieved a box of homemade cookies from the client, and a nice card thanking me. Still wasnt as sweet as recovering the memories of two parents who shouldnt have lost their kids.

I hope you guys enjoy it. The first part is a copy/paste of my comment.

Alright then. First off let me say that I am one of two employees at my company. We are a small ISP with about 200 customers. Anything related to our network is my responsibility, including tech support.

**First incident:**

We have our main router set up to redirect users with an outstanding balance to a page that says ""pay your bill if you want your internet to work"". The boss doesn't tell us to turn people off until they are at least 3 months behind on their bill. Anyway, this girl calls in and I remember her from when I installed her service about 4 months ago. She is complaining that her internet is shut off. I look up her information and sure enough, she hasn't paid her bill since we turned her service on. At this point I would normally tell them to pay their bill and I will turn their service back on. However, she gives me a sob story about how she needs her internet turned back on to do her schoolwork (it is the week before finals). I guess I felt sorry for her since I was in the midst of finals madness myself, so I told her I would turn her service back on but that it would be limited to 128 kbps. Enough to pull up webpages for school but not enough to dick around on YouTube or NetFlix. She starts to freak out on me like I did something wrong. She says, ""why would I want that? This is just going to make me not pay my bill ever"" I'm trying to explain to her that what I suggested is against company policy, and is purely out of the goodness of my heart but she isn't having it. ""You shouldn't have turned my service off in the first place!"" She said some other stupid things that I don't really remember but eventually it got to the point that I told her that I was leaving her service off because she didn't seem to understand the concept of paying for services received and that if she wanted to use the internet, she would have to go to the university library or a coffee shop. At this point she asked to speak to my manager. I told her to wait a second and I would put him on. I yelled at my boss, who was in his office, that a woman who hadn't paid her bill was complaining about not having internet access. Seeing as this was the first time I had been mouthy with a customer (I'm pretty sure he could hear everything I said to her), I wasn't sure how my boss would respond. My boss picked up the phone and without missing a beat said, ""If you want internet access, pay your f***ing bill. Now stop harassing my employees."" Then he hung up on her. It was the best outcome I could have hoped for. I think she ended up canceling her service with us a week later. 

**Second incident:**

The end of this incident occurred about a week ago, and it still makes me mad to think about. We have a customer that lives out in the country. He's got a few horses that run around his yard because he is too lazy to build a fence. We are a WISP, so our equipment is generally mounted on the roof with a CAT-5 cable running inside somewhere. Well this guy didn't want anything on his roof because he didn't trust me to seal the holes from the roofing screws properly. Guy lives in a crappy little trailer house but whatever, I'll make him happy. I tell him that I will mount our equipment to a light pole about 25 feet from his house if he promises me that he will bury the cable after I leave. I warned him that we have had problems in the past with cows and horses chewing on the cables. He says, ""No problem, whatever I need to do to keep it off the roof."" Perfect. I do my install and then I go on my merry way. Around a month later I get a call from this guy that his internet isn't working so I head back to his place. Once I get there I find that the cable was never buried and his horses have chewed the cable in half in three different places. He tells me he thinks his friend ran the cable over. I point out the teeth marks on the cable, but for some reason he still doesn't believe that his horses did it. A funny side note about this guy: he's an electrician. When I got there he was confused that his equipment wasn't powered on. When I reminded him that the cable was cut in half, he said ""I thought it was wireless?"". I wanted to tell him that as an electrician, he should know better than anyone that wireless power is not a thing yet, but I held my tongue. Anyway, I ran a new cable for him, reminded him of his promise to bury it, and headed home for the day. A few weeks later I get another call from him. This time he tells me a trailer got pulled over the cable and broke it in half. I begrudgingly go out to his place and run a new cable for him again. This process wouldn't have been so bad if I didn't have to climb the light pole to get to our equipment and run the cable underneath his house to a hole in the floor. Again, I politely remind him that he needs to bury the cable or this will keep happening. A few months later while I was on vacation, my coworker had to go out to his house to replace the cable a third time. This got me pretty pissed off. I mean, how hard is it to bury 25 feet of CAT-5 cable? By the time the fourth call comes around I am livid. I go out to his house and have my coworker talk to him while I run yet another cable for him. This one had been chewed by the horses again. After I finished with the cable I went inside and had this conversation with him.

Me: ""What are we going to do to make sure this doesn't happen again?""

Him:""Well... I guess I'll bury the cable..""

Me:""Why didn't you do it after the last three times we were here?""

Him:""Well I think that since you are providing the service, you should be the one burying the cable.""

As he was saying this I could feel my blood boiling.

Me: ""I put our equipment on that pole under the condition that *you* bury the cable. Do you remember that?""

Him: ""Yeah, but I don't think I should have to.""

At this point, I'm ready to throw something at him.

Me: ""I don't care what you think. I'm telling you how it's going to be. If you want to continue to use our service, you will do what I tell you to do. You are costing us money every time we come out here, all because you can't follow directions.""

Him: ""Well I'm not going to bury it.""


Me: ""You will if you want to keep playing XBox Live.  I know for a fact your only other option for internet service is satellite and that won't cut it. If this happens again, you will no longer be our customer.""

Him: ""We'll see.""

I had to leave after that or else I would have started cursing at him. I told my boss about it when I got back to the office. He laughed and said, ""What a jack*ss.. Sound like it's about time to fire another customer.""

If I ever have to go back to that guy's house, I'm going to set something on fire.

These clients are all working off of business machines and often need help troubleshooting office tools such as Outlook or Internet Explorer.

I get a call from a man, we can call him Oscar, he said he can't print a document that he was opening in Internet Explorer.  My first thought was that the poor sap somehow managed to set the default program to open his files with as Internet Explorer, then it occurs to me, he's probably just accessing a document from online.  Stupid me, okay fine, no big deal.  My coworker, lets call him Tin, had worked with this client a few hours ago and he may have forgotten to check some things before finishing up, no big deal.

""I don't know what Tin did but he installed this google chrome thingy and said to look at the bottom corner for something about an update.  I've been staring at this corner for an hour and I haven't seen anything about updates and I can't find it.  But he didn't fix the issue and I still can't print the document from his* machine!  He* won't want to deal with this shit when he* gets back!""

He*- Oscar is talking about his coworker and is on his coworker's computer.

""Can you tell me what happens when you try to print the document sir?""

""This thing pops up in the window and it says Internet Explorer diagnose the problem!  I need this fixed now!""

""Sir, can you please open up google chrome and try to access the document from that browser?""

""I don't know what this google chrome is but I don't want to have to go through this to access the document every time! Besides it keeps telling me I have to sign in to use it.""

""Don't worry about the sign in page sir, can you just open google chrome and go to the webpage you want to access the data sheet from?""

""I don't know what you're talking about.""

""Can you double click on google chrome from your desktop...okay good... now in the address bar-""

""I don't know what you're talking about, I don't want to deal with this every time!""

""Do you see the bar at the top with the letters in it, kinda looks like giberish?... okay now click there and type in the webpage you -""

""I don't understand!  What's a webpage?""

After about five more minutes of this I finally get him agree to let me remote into his system; most clients are reluctant to have us do remote work because we have to bill them for it.

""Okay I'm now looking at your screen.  Can you show me how you go to access the data sheet?'

He opens up internet explorer and three tabs open up: MSN Homepage and Search bar, the lenovo webpage, and some other site I didn't bother to look at.  He then types into the MSN Search bar the webpage url.....FACEPALM...alright that's fine I guess...clicks the link to the site and navigates to the document he wants to open.  Sure enough, when he clicks the link the page doesn't open, I see in the url that the document is a pdf.  

Fine he just needs to have adobe reader installed, just let me check a few things first.

""I'm going to take control of the computer now okay?""

I copy the URL from IE and open it from google chrome.  It works fine, probably because Chrome has a pdf reader preinstalled.

""No no no no no no no, I don't want to use google chrome.  Internet Explorer is how we do it.  He won't want to use this piece of shit.  He doesn't want to have to deal with this bullshit every time he opens a document!""

""Don't worry sir I'm just checking to see if it opens in here, if it does that's a good thing because it's an easier issue to solve.""

Oscar now begins to mumble things under his breath.

""Tin did something and told me about updates what did he do?""

""He just updated your computer sir, give me three more minutes of your time and I will have the issue resolved.""

I install Adobe Reader and have him reboot the computer.  Once I reconnect everything seems to be working fine.

""Thank you thank you thank you! You're a life saver.  Still one question though, what is the thing with the updates, what was I looking for?""

""Like I said, it was just some updates for the computer.""

""I still don't understand why google chrome was updating my computer...""

""It wasn't sir, it was just another browser option that you can use which has a built in pdf reader.""

""Okay but why do I have to sign up for it?""

""You don't, it's okay you don't need to worry about it anymore.""

I uninstalled google chrome and a single tear was shed as I clicked ""finish.""

I was working in a call center where the majority of my job was helping people with internet connectivity issues at hotels.

One day in the Summer of '08 I took a call from a frantic woman.  She said she was staying in a crappy motel chain in Iowa that we supported.  I gathered that she had no connectivity with the wireless routers they had available and that the motel staff were clueless as to what needed to be done.

I logged into the server remotely and discovered that there were some catastrophic errors that could only be solved by a tech coming to the location and servicing it or replacing it.  It was a complete no go.  She was screwed.

I relay this to her as easily and calmly as I can.  She absolutely loses it.  She starts calling me names and swearing at me in English and what sounded like German.  Normally, I would have informed her that it was our policy to end the call with a customer if they got to this point, however she started crying by the time I was responding.  Not just crying, but an utter **breakdown**.


After a minute or so of this, I asked her if she had tried any other hotels or WiFi hotspots like Starbucks in the area.  Again, more tears; every hotel is booked and all the local businesses are closed because she's in Cedar Rapids, where a massive flood has just occurred.

Not only that, but she is an insurance agent and she has to get her clients claims in by 11PM that night or they won't be accepted (no leniency for the situation, I asked).  She is completely despondent at this point and is fearing not only for these poor people's life savings and possessions, but also her job and her own livelihood.  I can hear it in her voice that she's about to lose it.

At this point, I had been on the call for about 20 minutes.  My call time was something that my supervisors tracked, so I needed to keep it down as much as possible, however for this call I couldn't have given one fuck about my stats.

I pulled up our area support map for Cedar Rapids and looked for nearby hotels in our network.  I managed to find another one of the same chain only 5 miles away.  Then I checked on the internet service there and found that it was up and running perfectly.

These cheap motels are franchises so the internet service you buy at one of them does not work at another one just down the road.  She had purchased a card with an access code on it, but it would not be usable there, so I gave her the free access (for corporate peeps) password and sent her over to the other motel.

In total it was a 45 minute call that really screwed up my stats for the week, but 3 hours later my supervisor came over and had bought me lunch (from Wendy's fuck yeah) because he got a call from her stating that she had filed all the insurance claims and that they were all successful.  She was responsible for around 40-50 people and now they would all be getting their insurance money.

The first words out of her mouth: ""I don't watch porn!"". Uh oh. This should be interesting. 

Mrs. Angerpants: ""Every time I connect to the internet, this happens!""

**Fake FBI warnings pop up**

Me: We see this all the time ma'm, it's called the ""FBI virus"". It's very common.

Mrs. Angerpants: Well, I don't watch porn, so this is clearly not a virus.

So I grab one of my coworkers, who of course tells her exactly the same thing.

Mrs. Angerpants: THAT'S IT, I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER!

$300 later, the customer has a brand new hard drive and windows 8 upgrade, plus install. My manager's reasoning: ""you don't argue with stupid"". The sad thing is, she had already purchased a tech support plan, which meant a virus removal would have been free. 

TL;DR: We can rebuild it. We have the technology. 

Edit: clarity

Edit #2: To be clear, we can't ""just"" do something like a virus removal. We need written or verbal agreement from the customer before we can do anything to their computer.

[Chapter 1 - My first job in IT](http://redd.it/xtlhx) 


* * *

The first few weeks at the store were rather dull. Don mostly assigned me to work the register and help customers finding what they needed. Restocking and cleaning the store was a task that befell me from the moment I started working there. The shelves were high and stocked from the floor to the ceiling. I had to kneel down low to fill the bottom shelves and reach high to fill to upper shelves. While I felt uncomfortable knowing customers and especially Ron, Don and - were watching I decided to ignore it. I hoped the novelty would wear off.

That was until Don called us all in for the monthly store meeting. Everybody was there. Don and Ron stood at the head of the table, with me and Jeremy on the left side. On the right side were Richard and Frank, the store idiots. How they got their jobs I still don’t know. How they lost them, I know.

Don had great news, he said with a cheery voice and a big smile - like a fat man finding another french fry on the bottom of the McDonalds bag. “With Leila joining us me and Ron felt that we are a big enough team to change the store around a little”. My mind was only thinking “Fuck” at this moment. Ron took over - “We got ourselves a new house style for the store, a brand-spanking-new website and matching uniforms. No old T-shirts anymore!”.

Richard and Frank giggled like little girls, knowing something that I did not. Jeremy kept silent, looking away from me almost as if he felt sorry for me. Ron and Don took the new store billboard from the box. The house style was done by Ron’s nephew, who was one of those prodigy children that are good at everything they touch and revered by the entire family. Unfortunately he took up web design, so our website looked like it belonged on Geocities in the 90’s, but then again so did the store. I should give him credit for staying so close to the source.

Don took the word again and opened up another box and pulled out the new uniforms. Polo shirts with our logo stamped on them. They looked reasonably fashionable. It was better than the small shirt I had til now - maybe I could actually breathe in these. My hope was short lived as I saw Ron and Don looking towards me. “Fuck” was the only thing my brain could utter again. They got a white bag from under the table, looking at it my first guess was that it contained clothes. It did. My uniform was in there.

“We ordered both male and female uniforms” said Ron, “but they won’t deliver the female ones until two weeks from now”. I looked at them and their faces told me everything - it was either a planned delay or the box was somewhere hidden in their offices. “So we got Frank and Richard to make sure that til the shirts come you will have some matching clothing”. I don’t even know which of the two said it. I expected the worst, based on Frank and Richards giggles. I got the worst. My new uniform was the Hooters uniform with our logo ironed on it. What creeped me out the most was the fact that the uniform fit perfectly. They apparently knew my sizes.

Feeling like a teenage hooker I went back into the store, selling hard and soft wares for the remainder of the shift to our usual mix of customers. Most of them middle aged men that needed large hard disks to store their “video projects”.

Most of them were regulars that bought all their computer hardware and software from us, including the B-grade burning software and virus scanners. They were always happy with it. It was so easy to use and really did not slow down the PC! However none of them ever bought any of the video editing software we had on shelf from the same company.

They spend hours on end scouring the internet for movies and pictures of their favorite adult actresses. They did not seem to stop until they knew they caught them all. To have the very best. They however also caught viruses and malware that their B-grade virus scanners failed to detect, warranting a trip back to our store to fix the problem - leaving their pictures, videos and browser sessions on the PCs. I learned my sex-ed from their computers.

Jeremy understood my shame in walking around like a teenage hooker for at least two weeks and covered my store-shift so I could work in the back whenever he could. Me and Jeremy usually worked the Thursday and Friday evening shifts from 5pm to 9pm and Saturdays from 9am to 6pm.  Don was usually not around during the evenings so it worked out fine, except when he made a surprise visit to check up on us and sent me back to the store to help our customers with their needs.

* * *
I was working my second shift dressed like a teenage hooker and was cleaning up the store that have been left like it had been ransacked by an angry mob. Ron told it was a busy day and they had no time to clean it all up. I had to clean up the store. Great. 

I checked the register first and looked at the sales we made. Seven sales, all small items. It had been a slow day. Why the store was such a mess I don’t know and could not check the camera system for we had none. It would not be for another year that Ron became paranoid and we got a state-of-the-art extremely expensive security system. Like the UPS, I would find out later what it was for.

To get back to the story; I was cleaning up the store and still dressed like a teenage hooker when a regular customer walked in. I was bent over one of the tables, causing him to ogle and stammer out that he needed a hard disk. Obviously. I helped him get a hard disk and went to the register and he paid. Before he left he had a question - “If I want to put this one in, do I have to take out the 2 other big drives?”. I lost it. I cannot even begin to understand how he even came up with it, but I knew what it meant. Looking at him I saw he was proud of himself for saying it; as if he practiced for weeks. He then saw that I took offense and quickly wiped the smug expression from his face and mumbled “Nevermind, I’ll find out myself” while walking away. I hoped I’d never see him again, however he was nothing compared to the next one a few days later.

It was about 2 hours into my new shift when a new customer walked in. He looked at me, sizing me up and smiled. I braced myself and walked over. “How can I help you today?” I said, keeping my distance. He kept silent for a bit and then told me that his computer had crashed and he needed it restored. Sure, no problem - we offer recovery services. “Where’s the computer?” I asked. “It’s in my car” he said. “Can you help me get it out, girl?”. The way he said it alarmed me enough to not do it. “You get the PC out of the car and I’ll get out gear out of the back so we can see what is going on” I said and immediately walked away to the back, getting Jeremy to help me out with this one.

The customer returned and brought in an ancient PC; it looked ravished and dirty, as if he just picked it up from the street and walked over to us to get it fixed. Jeremy hooked up the PC and tried to boot it. It booted but had trouble in loading the Windows environment - always hanging in booting process and none of the safe boot options helped. We quoted him for data recovery and reinstallation of the OS and applications. The total was about 85 dollars or so. Jeremy walked to the back to print out one of the forms our customers had to fill in to waive any liability for when we were not able to recover the data.

With Jeremy in the back he stepped closer to me and took a 50 dollar bill out of his pocket and took a pen out of his other. He wrote down something and folded the bill twice, making sure I saw the 50 on it. He leaned forward and whispered into my ear, verbatim: “A girl like you should not work in such a store”. He put the 50 dollar bill between my breasts. I was completely shocked and frozen at this moment. He paused briefly and continued - “My number is on that bill, if you want work that suits your qualities more give me a call”. 

Jeremy came back from the back with the waiver and the customer quickly walked away from me turning his attention to Jeremy. He signed and put down an upfront payment of 30 dollars or so; I can’t remember. It took only seconds for all of this to happen. He turned around, winked at me, and walked out. Jeremy now sensed something was wrong with me and asked me what was wrong. I told him everything. He calmed me down and called one of my friends to pick me up, covering the rest of the shift alone. He worked on the computer that night and got it working. 

When I got in the next day my company polo had suddenly arrived. Jeremy probably told Ron or Don and they knew they could not withhold the polo any longer. When Jeremy saw me he walked over and asked me if I wanted to know something about that customer. I said yes. He told me he was the owner of an adult webcam site. He had tried to hire me as a performer. 

**TL:DR** we got a new store uniform. Sexual harassment ensues.

I take a look at it, and download WinDirStat and have it set off on it's duties. Less than 5 seconds later, it shows me the culprit. 1/3rd of the drive was taken up by a windows backup file.

I go in and delete the backup and explain that she should get an external drive for backups in the future. She now had nearly 80G free space to use again.

Sometime last year, someone told me about the convention of having some kind of design on the 'top' or maybe 'outward-facing' side of the USB cable. But this story isn't about me.

This lady is bright. She can manage people WELL. She is well-liked. She does not have ""teknikal difikultees"", or ID-10-T issues.

She calls us one day and tells us she can't access the files on her USB key. A USB key, mind you, that she has had for a few months, and has been working with, as far as we know, daily. This is worrying, because we don't know if she's made backups of the data on the network. She -should- have, she's intelligent enough to follow procedure and knows how important it is, but you never know. It sounds like the files are gone, or the USB drive has gone bad.

As she is working with a laptop, we do not have the setup to remote into her machine, but thankfully she's three doors down (WILL YOU STILL CALL ME SUPERMAN?), so my colleague goes to check it out. He says hi and sees the laptop, and the USB key next to it.

The lady sits down, opens 'My Computer' and says, ""See? I can't access my files, I can't see the USB key.""

My colleague looks again. Then he takes the key and plugs it into the computer.

The lady says ""Oh! It has to be plugged in?""

According to him, the company is losing money, so the CFO hired a consultant to ""trim"" the company of useless parts. After couples of months of investigation and interviewing, it is decided that the IT department is not making any money and out all the problems reported from the company, only 3% is IT related. Now any person who remotely understand how IT department works, will know this IT department is doing an AMAZING job keeping all the servers and equipment working flawlessly, but the consultant is not just any person, he is the anti-Christ of IT. His proposal to the CFO: IT department is bleeding money with useless equipment purchase and not recycling old equipment, and since only so little problems are IT related, it is recommended to trim the IT department.

Fast forward to January, the 3/4 of the IT department is handed the pink slip on the first Friday, ONLY the tier 1 support is left (people who assign reported problems to appropriate personnel). To make things sweeter, they were in the middle of a major network upgrade, only paused from mid-November to end of December due to holidays and people taking vacation, and literally EVERYONE from the department who are working on the transition with Cisco are fired. Under the contract, Cisco only needs to hook up the cables to the switches, and all the tuning and migrating are done internally to save money.

The entire project was ongoing for more than 6 months with minor hiccups to migrate users to the new network. On the very first Monday after the IT department was sacked and left, all the servers went offline, none of the non-migrated users can access the internal network, and all the sites the company hosted for other company are inaccessible. First, the company tried to get the Cisco people to fix the network, but under penalty of fines and imprisonment, they are not allowed to touch anything. Then under frantic management, the CEO and CFO contacted the entire original networking IT crew, tried to rehire them, including my buddy. Already foreseeing this will happen, they ALL refused the offer, and only agreed to return as contractors with 5x the hourly pay + overtime (vs. salary that has no real OT pay). With no other viable choice at hand, the company gave in to the demand, and the consultant was promptly ""let go due to extreme budget constrain and cut"".

I was still working for Ron replacing all the computers in the school, and the execution of my revenge plan on the two boys was still a few weeks away. By now, most classrooms had been installed and I was given a huge stack of DVDs to image all the computers.

A very boring job, but at least he gave me more than one disk so I could image at least one or two classrooms at a time. I used the downtime to snoop around in the classrooms. What else would you expect from a 16 year old girl?

There wasn’t much to find, to be honest — just some random strange stuff in drawers, the answers for a lot of old exams and chewed up chewing gum (a lot of it, and not just on the desks). Then there was a diary. It belonged to a girl from my class that I had not particularly hated or liked. But some high quality intel on this girl would not hurt. I opened it up and read through it, focused on deciphering her sloppy handwriting.

I was startled when somebody walked into the room. It was a school concierge. School was to start in 2 weeks again and needed to be cleaned. The concierge (let’s call him Fred) was a moron. Not just a regular moron; he was designed to be a moron. He always did things wrong and said the most inappropriate things. And now he stood in front of me. I put down the diary; there was nothing interesting in it anyway.

“Leila, was it? Ron told me I should look for you, saying you could help me,” he said. “Help with what?” I replied, a bit dazed. “My computer is broken and I need to order new cleaning supplies,” he said with with urgency in his voice.

I had no choice other than to walk down with him to his office. I then realized why this building was in such a bad state. He was like Ron, breathing hard and irregular when we went down the stairs. Once at his office, he launched himself in his chair and took a sip of his Diet Coke. I looked at him disapprovingly. He responded by chugging the entire can down. Apparently, being civil wasn’t motivating him to just let the Coke can stand.

He pointed at his computer (the oldest one we had in the school), a Windows 98 machine with an ancient monitor attached. He opened Internet Explorer and tried to browse to the website to order his cleaning supplies. The site refused to load and an error popped up. It was just an error number. Great, just as well might not display anything. I decided to open his history folder. It was packed full going back years. “Did you ever clean the PC?” I asked. He answered proudly “I dust it off everyday, if that’s what you mean.” Good God. He was right, though: the computer looked like new.

“You also have to clean the PC every once in a while of files that are not necessary anymore — like cleaning up your desk from old documents and cans of Coke.” His world had changed. “You can do that!?” I showed him how to clean up the files and empty the trash and wrote down the instructions so he would not forget. The error was resolved, and he could get his cleaning supplies now. I am still amazed at how easy he was in all this. He showed the problem, let me do my work, followed my instructions and thanked me. At times like this, I just wish everybody was a moron.

* * *

I was now on the first floor again, just walking around a bit, delaying going upstairs. I wanted to do something other than putting a DVD into a computer and slowly watching the computer being imaged with a new installation. I walked around a bit on the ground floor taking in the emptiness of the school. I stopped and saw the cellar door. Nobody was allowed there and it was always locked. But I had the key now. I could go in.

I did go in.

The cellar was poorly lit. Many of the lights had died long ago. I picked up a torch light that was in a bin next to the stairs. Fred did not come down here often enough to actually fix them, so putting a torch light down the stairs was his way of fixing the problem.

The cellar was huge. It spanned the length and width of the ground floor. Next to me were heaps and heaps of paper: storage, old exams, and files. I took out a few boxes. They went back at least 15 years from what I could see. Nobody even cared to throw them away.

I walked further down to the left, making sure not to break my legs over any stray boxes and pieces of paper. There were a lot of bicycles, chairs, and sporting equipment. I could not walk down anymore without the fear of being crushed by the contents. I walked back and tried the right side next. I quickly stumbled upon a lot of computers — really old ones. There were early 1980s and 1990s computers covered in layers of dust as old as the machines themselves.

I noticed something again. These computers formed a wall. I knew there was more space behind it because when the torch light hit the ceiling it kept on going for quite a bit. There was something behind this great wall of computers and I needed to find out. I scanned the computers and saw there was one pile that was on wheels. I pulled it out. I needed to make a note to go to the hospital to get checked out because my jaw dropped again.

It was a secret hideout. There were couches, a table, notebooks, a refrigerator, and boxes full of food and drinks. The floor wasn’t concrete. It was a lot of carpets all covering each other. What was this place?

I looked around and started one of the notebooks. I could not go past the login screen, but it did not matter. Werner was his name. And I knew who he was. I shut down the notebook again and walked around watching for other things. I saw a safety exit. It was badly damaged, likely from being forced. I pushed the handle and it opened. I was outside. The door slowly closed behind me. I tried to open it again. It opened. Safety doors are not supposed to do that. They had broken it and used it as an entrance to their hangout cave.

I looked around a little more. I was behind the school now, in the forested area. You could come here easily, but there was really no point to it, so nobody ever went here. I spent the rest of my days imaging the PCs and wondering what the cave was for.

* * *

When school started again I went up to Werner, asking him about the cave. He went silent. Whether it was the fact that an actual  girl was talking to him or that I was talking about the underground hideout, I don’t know. He struggled to say something to me, and finally blurted “you are not going to tell anyone right!? You cannot tell anyone!” I assured him I would not — so long as he would tell me what it was all about. He told me go to the forested area and wait there for him after school ended at four. I had to wait another 5 hours. Screw me.

I silently sneaked into the forested area and waited for Werner. I realized this was all stupid and turned to leave when Werner came up, sweaty and nervous. He led me to the door and opened it. The light fell on about a dozen nerds. They were scared that they had been found out. They took a closer look at me and recognized me. “You work at that dump they call a computer store, right?” “Is that the best you can say to a woman entering your nerd cave?” I asked rather viciously. I wasn’t angry at them for calling it a dump, because honestly it was. But the fact that I was associated with it just hit me wrong. Werner quickly jumped in, not taking minutes to say something for a change, and told them I had found our hideout over the summer and he was forced by me to show what it was all about.

They calmed down and reluctantly introduced themselves. They were of all ages and types of nerd. This “gaming cave,” as they called it, had been set up years ago and passed down from generation to generation of misfit gamers. After school they would come here to work on their homework, play with the electronics and most of all play video games.

I liked that and joined them for the afternoon. I was surrounded by geeks and loved it. We had so much to talk about. After an awkward first hour they relaxed and at the end of the day they regarded me as a member. I was in: the first female member of the game cave.",,False,,t5_2sfg5,1345569328.0,,tftsflair,True,t3_ykkeb,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ykkeb/chapter_6_summer_school_pt_2/,

I got him set back up this morning and headed back to my office. When I got here, I had a call waiting from him. 

""I had Adobe Photoshop CS5 on my computer. Now it is only CS4. You need to put the newer version back on"". (we have 'roaming desktops' so he'd see the same icons he had before the crash, even if the software was no longer there).

Oops... no problem. Except I can not find any install disks, product keys or record from either vendor I would have bought it from that I'd ever purchased it and I am usually VERY careful about recording all of this stuff. With our security restrictions, it would have HAD to be me installing it. I know my memory isn't the best, but I really couldn't remember ever upgrading that PC, much less in the past year!

I had our accountant look at her purchasing records. No good. I called him back. ""Did you bring in your personal copy? Did you buy it yourself and get reimbursed? Do YOU have install disks there in your office somewhere?"" This was starting to get very frustrating. I felt like I was losing my mind. 

Finally, I take over his PC by remote to look. Sure enough, there are photoshop and indesign CS5 icons on his desktop. 

Right-click. Properties. Both icons SAY CS5, but actually point to CS4 executables. He'd renamed the **** icons then expected to scam me into putting CS5 'back' on!

I'm not actually from IT, but all internet and social media related problems land at my desk. The majority of shop managers is male. I'm female. 


The other day, an assistent-manager calls in a complete panic. 

""There's porn on  Facebook and I don't know how to get rid of it! ""

Me: ""Alright, calm down. Which FB page are we talking about and I'll take a look at what's wrong.""

Him: ""Store X'""

I look on the page. Nothing. The next ten minutes are spent trying to determine what he sees. Then another 10 in how he can take a screenshot and send it to me. 

Finally I get the screenshot. 

Indeed, there's porn.

A porn ad, to be more specific. 
C
As you might know, FB tracks all the stuff you do on the internet, links it and shows you ads based on that. So to me it was pretty obvious what happened, the user just likes to look at porn in his spare time and that's why he sees the ads. 

No biggie, right? Well: wrong. I see something else that made me dread explaining this. 

Me: who's currently logged into FB?

Him: Our store manager. (His boss). 

Me: [Um....](http://stickerish.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/NothingToDoHereBlackWithTextSS.png)

I ain't explaining to you what your boss does in his spare time. Gave him a story about targeted advertising and forwarded this to the IT guys to explain next time. (Sorry). 

**TLDR: Too chicken to explain to employee his boss watches porn.**

Edit: There's been some suggestions in the comments that it wasn't a porn ad. I am 95% certain it was, so tomorrow I'll upload a copy of the screenshot (edited for personal info) so you can see for yourselves.

Edit2: Here's the ad: http://i43.tinypic.com/10p7mv5.jpg

It's in Dutch. I'll translate:

1. Men Only!
*Only 18+ men may enter here. [Click here]


2. Challenge yourself
*Reach your target distance with smarter training schedules on MY ASICS.
*Use now

3. Beenmode.nl (leg fashion)
*Smart, sexy and fashionable, from socks to stockings, for every man and woman.

Edit3: Went and talked with IT and they assured me that it couldn't be malware. They gave me several reasons that sounded plausible (to me). I hope I can reproduce them correctly.

1. We're on Citrix servers, which are supposed to be a secure environment. All program data that isn't part of the user profile is wiped whenever someone logs out/in. Only user files and settings are saved.
2. Citrix servers get rebooted every weekend, so even if some type of virus/malware lingered, it'll be purged during the reboot.
3. USB-ports from computers are closed.
4. Internet outside of Citrix isn't possible, except on one computer at the service desk. All employees can access internet from there (to look up product info, I guess). This computer has no access to secure information (which is all stored on Citrix).
5. The person who called me was not on that particular computer but on a secure computer in the back-office.

Edit4: Now I'm wondering: is it possible for the user to download malware at home, have it affect his Facebook profile, which is then saved and displayed on other computers? Or is that crazy talk? 

Edit5: I've spent an hour on Reddit now. Going offline and back to work. I'll check in later.

Edit6: Thanks for all the speculation. I had a blast. Our IT guys assure me everything is fine (I showed them this thread and all your explanations) so... I'm going to go ahead and trust what they have to say. They'll keep an eye out for suspicious stuff and we're sending out a memo to never log into another user's Citrix profile.

He'd worked on her system remotely after 5 the night before dealing with an issue unrelated to printers, printing or customer cultivation.

""Nothing... didn't touch your printer or print anything."", he managed smiling while he talked to help it come through the lines and make his tone sound more like a helpful person rather than an overworked troll. ""What is wrong? Are there any error messages?""

""NO"", she shot her words like bullets and her gravely cigarette tortured voice grated against brain and made his head feel like it could split at any second. ""NOTHING... It is -not- printing and it -was- printing before -I- left and -you- went in and -worked- on it.""

As she was speaking he wasn't listening but pulling up her desktop into a remote support session. Her screen was filled with the web browser and she was playing some game on Facebook. He grabbed her cursor and minimized the mess telling her at the same instant, ""I have control.""  In his mind he added ""ma'am"" but he didn't say it aloud.

She tried to open Facebook again and he said, ""I've got it now just hold tight"" as he pulled up her browser and typed in the address of the printer. As the printer control came up in the browser he saw a red flashing error on the status indicator. 

""Do you see the error?"" he circled the red area with the cursor and she said no... ""..right here on your screen... the red error that is flashing?"" Again she said ""No"" and continued saying ""I'm not at my desk now""

""OK... Look at your monitor in the middle of the screen and tell me if you see... ""

""You're in my system, aren't you? I see my thing moving""

""Yes... Yes... thanks.... OK Now..."" and again she interrupted. ""My thing is moving. You are moving my thing""

""Yes... Yes... I am moving your thing... Now..."" He hurried. ""Do you see the red flashing thing there where your thing is moving?""

She stumbled, ""The red error box?""

""Yes there... right there... please watch the screen..."" and he clicked the red error box and it opened a pop up box that said 'TONER EMPTY'.  ""Can you read that part where it says that the toner is empty?""

""This printer was working last night... Now my printer does not work... what did you do to it?""

He held an imaginary gun to his head and blew his imaginary brains into the wall and imagined for a moment the certain cool peace of the inevitable void then continued... ""The printer is out of toner.... it is empty of the black stuff that goes on the paper and makes letters...""

""I am not doing a letter. I am doing mailing labels and I just don't understand why it is that every time you work on my system I have another problem...""

There are people in this world, some in positions of power, that are so dense and brain dead that he wondered how they managed to breath and not suffocate and why...

""Please listen to me for one second and let's work together to resolve this issue"" He used every bit of his mind not to sound like the most sarcastic fellow ever to grace the earth. ""I am on your side. I am here to help and I need your help to help me help you solve the problem.... OK?"" He continued without pause. ""Do you have a new toner cartridge?""

""Yes,"" she said, ""I have plenty of toner""

""Great... I knew you could come through with a solution now please get the toner and change out the new cartridge for the old one... I'll hold""

She finally agreed and the remote experiment in dentistry neared closure.

As he held and listened to her fumble and grumble another line rang. He checked the caller ID and answered quickly. ""Hey man, what's up?"" At least this guy wasn't a complete tool.

""Look man, we have a crisis. I knocked my computer off my desk and it was fine but I rebooted and not it doesn't work"" 

Oh my precious goodness, he thought. 

""..and anyway, it has this document on there and I was working on it when it crashed"" 

It crashed... priceless, he grinned.

""...and if I don't get that document in the mail before 6pm the IRS will eat our firstborn and then send us to the bad place... we have a crisis. Can you fix it?

""Yeah man, I'll do what I can just don't touch it""

""Don't worry"" said the user. ""I won't touch anything. I've already tried rebooting and using the recovery disk and it didn't get anything back""

He held an imaginary gun to his head and blew his imaginary brains into the wall, once more.

""OK....!"" The customer was back. ""I changed the toner but the light is still flashing""

""OK..."" he said, ""Great. You did great we're almost done""

The phone rang again... it was another 800 number... he let it go and continued ""Just hit the clear error button on the top of the printer...""

""I am not -at- my printer. I am -at- my desk"", she hissed. ""Can you make up your mind?""

""Yes... Yes... Yes, I'm sorry, go back to your printer and clear the error and come back to your desk and talk to me."" Wow, this woman was starting the day nicely.

Again the phone rang... unknown number... no time to answer unknown calls. He let it go to voice mail.

She came back to the phone. ""OK -your- error light is off"" 

""Good"", he said, ""Notice on the remote panel on your screen... it says Printer Ready?""

""Yes, I see that..."" Her exasperation dripped from every word and she started moving the cursor but he grabbed it back...""

""Wait... just one second and let me check the process and make sure we are not chasing our tails. OK?"", he said still smiling a fake smile that probably sounded like fake helpfulness over the phone, then he printed a test page to the printer.

""OK, did anything print?""

""It's making a noise but it is -not- printing...""

He could pat her on her precious little head, now. ""Good... We like noise. That means the printer is warming up... just give it a second""

She growled, ""If I don't get these labels printed I guess I'll have to hand write them""

""Is anything printing?"", he asked.

""Something is coming out. I don't know what it is.""

In his mind he imagined her biting off her own smoke stained tongue, choking on it, gasping for air and turning blue but he said, ""Could you check for me?""

He heard her huff and bang her way to the printer. She had the most blank grey eyes that seemed to reflect her thought patterns. He tried to think of a happy place to calm his... the phone rang again... another 800 number. Another call he wouldn't answer 

""It is still not printing... all I have is a page that says 'Windows Test Page'... what did -you- do with my labels? "" 

""OK... great! We'll print your labels now."" He looked at her recently used documents and pulled up the first in the list. It was a label sheet but there were only 8 labels out of 30 that should have been populated, so he asked her, ""are these the right ones? Is this the right document?""

She rattled, ""Yes that's the one that you broke... now they wont print!""

""Oh, I can print them I just wondered if it was complete since there are only 8 addresses"" She broke in, ""Yes and those are our most important donors and board members. I've worked for weeks to put this mailing list together and now -you- can't print it.""

""Just hold on one second and we'll see what we have, now."" He clicked print and asked her, ""Are your labels printing now?""

""Something is printing, I don't know what it is. I guess you want me to go look again?"" She was an amazingly fast learner for a blithering brain damaged idiot. She picked up again. ""OK... my labels printed.""

""Wonderful"", he said. ""Just give me a call if you have another problem""

""I still don't understand how you broke it last night"" Her voice was like fingernails on a chalkboard

He held, again, an imaginary gun to his head and blew his imaginary brains into the wall. ""The printer was out of toner.... it is working now... Talk to you later.... Have a nice day"" and he ended the call.

This guy comes off as a tech savvy individual as hes explaining all the troubleshooting hes done and what the issue might be. He claims faulty power supply as the machine is dead and doesnt boot. Hes checked all the cables (sometimes students kick the power cable out of the machine) and has come to the conclusion that this is the only thing it could be. So I have him wait at the door so I can grab my book and follow him to his classroom. 

These classrooms were all put together on the military dime, and someone decided that all the desks should have built in power strips and kill switches. Immediately upon entering the room, I can tell which desk is his, because whoever designed these desks decided the kill switch should be on the front of the desk at waist level, and his is the only one without a power light on.

This is where tech savvy Lt turns into cocky power hungry Lt around his peers. He goes on to explain that the military isnt training people right and spouts off a few more belittling things about people of low ranks. This is the fun part. So instead of simply showing him that he somehow managed to press the kill switch, I went through all my troubleshooting steps... thoroughly. After Ive exhausted all my normal fixes, I stood up and told him I have one more thing. I leaned against the desk (on the switch) and clapped my hands twice. Like magic the monitor came on and I powered on the machine. 

Puzzled and somewhat stunned the Lt bombarded me with questions of how and why that worked. I let him know that HP has been integrating Clappers into their machines for years. Of course he didnt believe me, but everyone around us chuckled and I left the room.

TLDR: Made a Lt look like an ass in front of his peers.

We have this option if your cellular phone is faulty, we can send you a replacement device in advance which you can keep, and you send us back the original, faulty device.

I get a call from an older customer stating he just got his replacement cellular phone and he still has issues with it. I want to start troubleshooting having in mind that I probably must send the customer another replacement device. The IMEI or serial number he gave me belongs to the faulty device as I can see on my screen, which isn't unusual. I don't remember why, but I ask the customer whether the serial number belongs to the cellular phone he is calling with. He says yes. I ask, have you tried calling with the replacement device you just got? He answers, hmm, should I? I say, yes, maybe you should give it a try....

So, customer thought the mere presence of the replacement device he just got would fix the issues with his original cellular phone.

Hey the network's down."" Unfortunately it wasn't the first time my morning as network manager started that way. I made my way to my office to dump my stuff and see what was going on. Since my office was as far from the front door as you can get without jumping out a window I had to run the ""network's down"" gauntlet through the office.

I barely sat in my chair and turned on my computer monitor before my manager popped her head into my office with a worried look on her face. She wasn't a terribly technical person but managed the jargon okay and did a decent job of running interference (yes, pretty much like the IT Crowd frighteningly enough).

She told me: ""I think I broke the network.""  I nodded and waited for the explanation.  ""I was moving some files around and I think I dragged and dropped the wrong thing.""

You see, the day or so prior she had requested that I give her administrative privileges on our file server since she was ""in charge of IS"" and all. I remember shaking my head as I made the change and thinking no good could come of that.

Sure enough, I looked at the root of drive on the file server to see that she had dragged and dropped the root application folder (the file share everyone in the company used to access shared applications run from the server - and there were a lot of them including all of accounting and payroll) someplace inaccessible to everyone except an administrator.  I quickly moved the folder back and gave the heads up to my helpdesk folk who were just arriving to work what had happened.

I walked around the corner to update my manager that I had fixed the problem. She sighed and asked me to remove her administrative privileges right away too.  I told her ""no problem"" as I went back to my office to do just that.

TL;DR - Since I'm in charge of all the guns I think I need a loaded one in my pocket...BLAM!

Me: Thanks for calling Cow Box Tech Support, this is Katsai, how can I help you?

Random Crazy Caller: Hello? Is this... who is this? Are you a computer?

Me: No sir. I'm not a computer. I'm a technician for CBC. Is there a problem with your computer that I can help you with?

RCC: Why are you on my phone?

Me: You called me, sir. Can I help you with something?

At this point, there are already red alert klaxons sounding in my head, so I signal my team lead to dial into the call and listen.

RCC: Oh! Yeah. My computer isn't... It doesn't work. It's broke.

Me: I'm sorry to hear that. I'll be happy to help you get it up and running. Can you please tell me the serial number of your computer so I can pull up your information in our database?

RCC: Serial number? 

Me: Yes sir. It's on a sticker on the side of your tower.

RCC: Uhhh... hold on.

RCC: Uhhh... Serial number. Serial number. Uhhh... Yeah. It's (string of random numbers)

Me: I'm sorry. You gave me too many digits there. The serial number is a 9 digit number. 

RCC: No, that's it. That's my serial number. I'm looking right at it. (Reads number off again)

After several minutes of back and forth along these lines, I finally find out what he's reading. 

RCC: This box of corn flakes is the only cereal I have, and that's the number under the bar code. That's my cereal number! 

At this point, my team lead literally hits the floor laughing. I gamely decide to continue trying to help the guy.

Me: I'm sorry for the confusion sir. There's a sticker on the side of your tower that has a 9 digit number on it. Could you please find that and read it to me?

RCC: Tower? I don't have a g** d*** tower in my yard! Who has a tower? JUST FIX MY COMPUTER! 

My team lead is now curled into the fetal position, fist stuffed in his mouth trying to contain the laughter as the caller gets more agitated and incoherent. The line clicks, and I hear a new voice on the line. 

New Person: Is someone on the phone? 

RCC: They won't fix my computer! Make them fix it!

NP: You're not supposed to be making calls. Who are you talking to?

RCC: The computer people! Make them fix it!

Me: Ma'am, this is Katsai with CBC Tech support. The gentleman called with apparent computer issues, and I'm just trying to pull up his information so we can get started on fixing it.

I work as an AV Tech (i.e. gain-riding button monkey) at my university's student union. This month the only thing going on is daily New Student Orientations for incoming freshmen. I run sound/lights/projection for these. We also have student orientation leaders who lead the parents around campus to and from tours and presentations and answer general questions. Let me preface this by saying that these people work much harder than I have to and god knows I couldn't stay as upbeat as they do (we start at 6:30 AM and these go on every day for a month).

Every day a few of the student leaders hold a student panel so the parents can ask questions and almost every day they are asked technical questions that they are ill-equipped to answer (though they really do try). Some of my favorites:

* *When asked what kind of computer is recommended for students:*

""Most students have laptops, and we recommend either Apple or Dell. Engineering students especially like Dells."" *Ugh*. I actually think this is probably a prepped response because I rarely see students using Dells on this campus, and virtually none in engineering, but ALL of university-owned desktops are Dells. Smells like a business arrangement.  

* *When asked about WiFi:*

""You can't make your own little wireless internet yourself, but you can plug into the school's with a cord. I'd recommend the good old fashioned cord to avoid slowness"" Failed to mention campus-wide WiFi, both an encrypted network and an unencrypted network with a log in page.

* *When asked about having electronics in the dorms:*

""Communicate with your roommate because if you have 2 TVs, 2 game consoles, 2 DVD players--you're not going to have enough room and the voltage is going to be off the charts. And no, you can't have power strips."" *Facedesk.* They say ""voltage"" a lot, especially when explaining why microwaves are not permitted. It does not mean what they think it means. Also the university actually *recommends* that you bring power strips because the rooms only have 2-3 outlets.

She has a new MacBook Pro which she brought with her. (I asked her why she has a Mac and she said that it looks nice and is shiny. Well...) While I was setting up her network when she arrived it came up that she doesn't know the admin password to her own computer. I asked her to get in contact with the people who setup the computer in the first place, try some solutions from the internet or go to the local Apple dealer to get it fixed, since I don't want to waste my work time on broken private computers than necessary.  
Fast forward a few months to last week. She moved her office and at she needed to set up the printer and network in the room. The people in the room told me she needs to have more power sockets and a network application for a crappy old PC sitting on the desk while the MacBook is just next to it.  
I asked her why she wanted to use the old junk if she has a good MacBook to use. Well, because she still doesn't know the admin password and can't use it fully. I asked her why she didn't get it fixed since it's so much easier to have everything in one place and portable. The answer is quite possibly laziness and ignorance. There was a small argument that Dropbox is so great at syncing your files, so that working with two computers wouldn't be an issue at all. ""And what do you do if you have no network?"" Argument settled.  
So I asked her if she tried all the passwords and she said yes. While I was thinking to come up with potential passwords, since computer illiterates normally have very weak passwords, I asked her if she tried, well, nothing, just pressing enter. And while she was still thinking, I just did it and it went through....  
I actually did hint a facepalm to her face. I told her her password is.. nothing. And she started writing down ""noth.."" when I said ""No, nothing, empty, just enter.. "" when she finally got it.

TLDR: Try the obvious thing first next time.

Now it was during my time slinging bits and bytes for the Feds, and in particular the tax collection parts thereof, that the result of the national leader of the day's weaseling on the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax came to a head. Most famously, he had declared some years back that it would ""never ever"" be a part of his party's policy after it had pretty much been the single cause of their defeat in a previous election. Of course, as it was one of his long-term pet policies, this was so much smoke and mirrors. Coming to power later on, he squeaked into a second term in office (technically actually losing the popular vote) and immediately declared that this was obviously a mandate to implement said pet tax (even though he couldn't get it supported without going to other parties). Thus, political shenanigans and power plays went on behind closed doors so he could force it into existence.  

So far, so national politics.  

Now, if you read the *official* histories, the tax was implemented halfway through the year 2000, presumably after all the glad-handing and subtle machinations. However, my tale comes somewhat earlier in the calendar... as in a good year or two beforehand.  
   
  
You see, I had shown up at work one day, suspecting nothing out of the ordinary, and been asked if I would mind assisting with the installation of a new server. Nothing fancy, just babysitting the hardware, running a couple of tests, and generally being eyes and hands on the ground for the central server team. Nothing strange about that, right?  

Only... the server was being installed in a building my employer had never operated out of before. And indeed, there was much in the way of outfitting and cubicle erecting and furniture schlepping going on, I noticed, as I wandered into the new site. Funny, as I hadn't heard of any new infrastructure expansion, at least through official channels...  

A quick glance through the specialist chapters of the installation procedures, plus a little knowledge of government acronyms, soon lifted the veil from my eyes. I was installing the central server for the ""never ever"", ""couldn't possibly have had all the details worked out yet, no siree"" Goods and Services Tax team. The election was barely over; the money and (most importantly) details I was looking at couldn't possibly have been arranged in the time between then and now. Someone had been planning this for quite some time.  

There were a number of other discrepancies, as well. The team wasn't referred to by any official name other than that on the front of the building. Much of the documentation was, shall we say, whitewashed of any identifying nomenclature. There was even public-information frontage built on the ground floor of the building at the same time, unconnected to the hidden team in the back offices, so that no-one would express any surprise upon hearing that the Tax department was operating out of that address, or raise an eyebrow at the furniture and office kibble being trucked in. In short, it was deliberately designed so that the general public wouldn't get wind of the fact that the GST team was up and running far, far before it was ever supposed to exist even on paper.  
   
  
Our intradepartmental procedures and processes were quietly expanded to include the new server on our list of supported items, but it was always just ""server 20"", its purpose never alluded to in any documentation which might even remotely find its way to the press. And then, one day, many months later... ""Oh gosh, looks like the party in power got support for this GST thing after all, what a surprise!""
   
  
A surprise for some, perhaps.

Incident came in today, needed to be fixed asap, which was tonight.

My Story:
I was doing a Emergency change for work, from home. Limited support available for me.
I found the fix, and it was just simply change a config file and bounce the service
Tonight came, I remote in, all good. Change the config file. Attempt to bounce the service.
Herein started the problem. - The service wont fucking stop! Stuck on ""Stopping"" - Typical windoze.
So I was like, okay, that's fine, I'll just kill the process manually, like I would on *nix.
I go into task manager, kill the proccess manually. Then I try to start the service again,
All I get is ""Windows started the service, but it exited shortly afterward""
That was it - Change failed, job over.
So I go into the log, check what's going on. See THOUSANDS of ""dbload - error loading schema"" errors.
(The database is huge - 5GB, About 5 years of data and sensitive client information)
I was like, shit, the database is rooted, some keys have corrupted or something.

* At this point I am shitting myself, so I decide to go outside and have a smoke for sanity's sake.

Came back stressing a little bit less.
Checked the log again - Turns out the errors were from some stupid long-running database query someone was running. 
The log indicated that half of the app was still running (Kind of the back end part I don't usually touch) - So I went back into taskman, and killed it.

After installing a new laptop and monitor for some lady at our office, she called me back and said that the text was blurry and the monitor wasn't working very well at all.

I was truly concerned that there was something wrong with the monitor, as I've saw this sort of thing before. So I grabbed a replacement of the same model, some new cables, and headed over to her office.

When I got to her office, she said ""look how blurry this screen is!""
There was not a thing wrong with that monitor, it was just fine.

So I went ahead and installed the replacement, and then increased the text DPI size, increased the size of icons, windows, and such - made everything bigger.

The ""new monitor"" was much better and she was glad I got rid of that old broken one. I never said anything about her poor eyesight, these people don't want to be told when they're wrong - and I'm not her optometrist anyway.

TL;DR - lady has poor eyesight, says her monitor is too blurry

**Clarification:** In regard to not telling her that here eyes were bad and not the monitor - it's really best to just let people in that department think whatever they want to think. In the past, when I've corrected them or told them they were wrong, it didn't go well at all.

If I had told her that her eyes were bad - at best she would have told me off in front of some of the VPs of the company, at worst she would have filed a complaint with my manager. People want to think they're right about everything, and sometimes It's just best for me to let them keep thinking that - perhaps it's passive and lazy, but much easier.

",956,187,225,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1177ir/no_i_cannot_completely_rewrite_the_software_to_do/,"We have a new manager who insists on everything being done *her* way.  And only *her* way.

Without going into too much detail.....we use a particular piece of software that is used by over 2000 companies in the country.  Of course, not every company has the same needs, so the software company develops the software that will meet the needs of all 2000 customers as much as possible.

One of our reports is a weekly checkoff sheet, and the report gives five blank boxes....one for each day of the work week.  The thing is....they're not labelled MTWTF.  Some companies use this sheet five times a day, and some companies have a work week other than MTWTF, along with a list of other uses this report could be used for.  

Well our new manager was not happy that this did not automatically label the boxes MTWTF for her, and asked if I was able to generate the report with the boxes pre-labelled.  I told her that that could not be done because the report is meant to be used in a variety of different ways.  

So she asks *me* to reprogram the software and add the MTWTF labels.  I tried to explain to her (a) I am not a programmer, (b) I do not have access to the source code even if I were, and (c) it would be illegal for me to do so anyway.  She did not like this answer.

""You're the computer guy.  Isn't this stuff what they're paying you for?"" she says.  

""No, they pay me to troubleshoot and support the software.  Not rewrite it.  There's a difference."".  I said.  She of course continues to have absolutely no clue what that difference is.  

I was then asked if I had contacted the vendor about this ""major"" issue, and I explained to her that the reports are specifically made that way because other companies use these checkoff sheets in a variety of different ways; pre-labelling the sheets MTWTF would screw up the companies that have a different work week or that use the sheet for a different purpose, and there's no way the vendor could possibly program all the possible ways that 2000 different companies use the sheet.  

""Well find a way to do it.  This is completely unacceptable."", and she stormed out of the room.  

She doesn't quite get the concept that (a) what she's asking for is not possible, and (b) she's not my boss.  

I hate my job sometimes.  /rant

EDIT:  And by the way....we've been using the software across numerous districts now for over a year.  And in every single case but her, the staff figured out how to use the checkoff sheet on their own.   It's not like it's hard........5 boxes.  5 days to the work week.  Not a tough puzzle to figure out....

Most the time they were fairly mundane but I have 2 I dont think I will ever forget.

The first one was of an old all white flat panel iMac that had caught fire. Tier 1 agent comes on the line I ask the standard questions of him ""is the customer safe, and fire put out"" ""kind of, fish arnt"" is the response I get on this one. ""Excuse me? Ok, well go ahead and bring him on I will take it from here."" 

Customer comes on the line, I ask the customer what happened. He told me that he was doing some video editing of a family movie, suddenly his system shuts down, and he sees the death smoke. I explain to him a part burning out can happen and normally is no cause for concern. He tells me hes not finished. He continues. He turns the mac 90 degrees and sees small flames out of the back vents. (at this point I am opening my 120 safety questionnaire). He then explains to me in his panic he, instead of smothering the fire, he picked up the mac, and tossed in his 100 gallon fish tank... Power cord still connected. 

I sit there for a briefe moment, and have to ask, ""are the fish ok?"" ""They are floating, do you reckon they're dead?"" I turned the case over to the engineers and let them take it after I was done with the call.

* multiple failed drives in a RAID array that client wasn't monitoring

C: where do you keep the backups of my server?

M: the same place you do.

C: we don't have backups, we shouldn't need to because we run RAID!

M: I think your current situation disproves that statement.



* site coded 10 years ago gets compromised via SQL injection

C: my site got hacked! Can you fix it?

M: probably not. The site needs to be completely reworked as it is extremely outdated.

C: can you do that for me?

M: ~~sure, let me just press this magic fucking button next to me~~ No ma'am, we're system administrators, not webdev/coders, not to mention you're talking multiple hours of work.

* incredibly outdated OS gets rooted

C: my server is running really slow and acting strange

M: it looks like you are saturating your port with outbound traffic. You're probably part of a DDoS attack to some poor sap's website.

C: what?! How could you let this happen?

M: **WE** didn't let this happen. You are running an OS that was EoL 6 years ago. Even if we manage to clean it up, it will probably be compromised again within a week. You really need to install a current version and restore from backups.

C: Where are my backups?

M: *oh you*

C: are you guys going to call the Cyber Police and have whoever did this arrested and make them fix my server?

M: Sodium Hypobromite, it doesn't work like that. Sadly, the FBI's Cyber Crime division probably doesn't have time to investigate which 13yo script kiddie ""hacked"" your vulnerable, outdated server.

C: what?! I'm going to sue you guys for letting my server get hacked!

M: ~~bwahahaha please do, I would love to be present for the hearing~~ I understand your frustration.

* Web or other random service down

C: my server is down! Are you guys having network issues?

M: ~~yes, all five of our backbone connections just happen to be down at the same time~~ No. I'm able to connect to your server via SSH. Have you logged in and checked Apache/MySQL?

C: What's SSH?

M: You run a Linux server and don't know what SSH is??

C: I manage the server through WordPress.

A little bit of background, I do tech support for medical devices in hospitals, managed by the pharmacy and used by nurses. When pharmacy is unavailable, the nurses do what they can with what they know. If a new nurse comes in, they can generate a temporary user for the nurse, and the system will generate a random string of 6 letters, these are usually gibberish.



I get a call the other day, the nurse is obviously pretty upset, she said one of us MUST be playing tricks on her and started insulting her. Because of course we have time for this! So I asked her if she knew the other agent's name, she didn't, so I went to look at the hospital's tickets and the last ticket was several weeks ago and her name wasn't even in the system so she obviously didn't call before. She starts explaining she's a new nurse and had her boss generate a user for her, and that the system was insulting her. I asked how could a computer possibly be insulting her, she said there was profanity in her user ID, and she wouldn't say it on the phone (calls are recorded, my boss would have loved to hear it).



I eventually managed to get her to take a picture of the screen and send it to me by email, I don't think I ever hit the mute button so quickly. Her user ID, and remember, this is all randomized, it could be ANYTHING... was FUCKEU.



I had her boss recreate the user ID and they were good to go, still I wish she would have kept that user ID, would have made for some interesting transaction reports.

My favorite story involves a particular idiot student that I busted. One of my agents comes up to me and explains he has a departmental deskside guy on the phone that needs to report a stolen laptop. I have him transfer the call to me....

The guy explains that the laptop was stolen a couple days ago from one of the classrooms. Luckily he has the MAC address which saves us a lot of time. I pull up the network logs and search for the mac address to find out if it has been on the network since it was stolen. Well what have we here..... it just got on the network 5 minutes ago! I take the IP and reference it with our application logs (which track the IP of who accesses web materials like blackboard, school email etc for security purposes). Hmmmm, this douche actually was dumb enough to use this STOLEN laptop on OUR network to access his school email. Now I have this idiot's username. I reference the IP address and subnet and now have the exact building and floor of the wireless network he is on, it's a dorm. Now I proceed to find the user's name using his login and check our student directory. His dorm room happens to be in the same building and same floor. At this point I put the deskside guy on hold and call the campus police.

A couple hours later the cop calls me back to get all of the details I collected for their investigation. He tells me that the kid nearly pissed himself when they showed up at his door and asked if he knew anything about a stolen laptop being used in his room. He immediately confessed and was dumbfounded at how quick we caught him.

It's been my first corporate job ever and unfortunately the most shitty thing that I've managed to do my entire life. I work with incompetent idiots that hide behind their degrees and create the shittiest possible solutions for the most simple problems. 

This just happened the past week:

The servers at work are mostly Windows servers running either 2003 R2 or 2008 R2 - but we have about four or five *nix machines - two old outdated boxes running RHEL 4 and one IBM machine running AIX. Something happens (I don't know the specifics since I don't come in until the afternoon) and the root partition (which also happens to contain all the data) seems to be shafted. There are three middle-aged guys sitting in front of a shell sweating, so I just huddle in behind them and look at what's going on. Apparently the partition manages to mount when you pass the force flag to the command, and at this point, they seem content since everything is back up and running (for now). I tell them ""guys, I'd really suggest that you unmount and stop using the partition while it's damaged - run fsck for jfs just to be on the safe side!"". The server does some sort of database job (they don't tell me everything) so being back up it starts writing a ton of shit to and from the disk, using the same partition. 

My boss responds with a ""Kid, go back to installing Windows. We've got this and we don't need some boy butting in."" Alright - that was fine for me, seeing as how I only get paid 10 an hour if you want to voluntarily run off a cliff then you can go right ahead and do it. They applied some updates and made some changes to that machine over the course of a few hours and at one point had to restart. Upon reboot the partition didn't want to mount at all. My superiors were all crowded along side a computer trying their best to get it to mount but the mount command just threw error messages and random shit galore. It was time to call IBM corporate support since the genius minds that work with me apparently find that it was IBM's fault that all of this was happening. 

I try to approach my boss again since I kinda feel bad for those egotistic assholes: ""Hey, you guys need any help?"". I get responded to with ""NO GO SIT DOWN AND GO AWAY NOW I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER AFTER THIS IS DONE"". I'm offended at this point so I just sit down and watch them sweat it out like dogs. IBM support is on speaker for whatever premium rate they pay - and some guy comes on. They tell them the problem and what happened from the morning up to the point where I came and they forcemounted and continued using it. 

The guy said verbatim ""uuuhhhhhh, you should've ran fsck to repair errors in the filesystem before using it again - that's a big no no sir.""

I sit back in my chair with the biggest smug smile on my face while my boss turns incandescent red. He slams the phone in the receiver and has someone else call while he has a fit. Everybody in the IT office remained there that day except me - I just went home and felt fucking awesome.

Had I known that she was having a printer issue, I'd have put her at a much higher priority, even if it meant going out of my way to backtrack to sites 1 and 2.  

""Jill, you didn't tell me that.  You told me that you couldn't get online.  Those are two totally separate issues.  Had I known that your printer was down, I'd have gone to you first.""

""Well you should have known.""  *(apparently I woke up in bizarro land this morning where being unable to print and being unable to get online are the exact same thing.)*

So I get over there and -- as I'm sure you'd expect -- the problem was that she didn't hit the gigantic power button on the front of her printer.   Right in the middle of rolling my eyes, she says ""Now I can't get into my fucking email.  Fix this.""

""How many times have you tried?"" I asked.

""I've been trying for the past 10 minutes.""  *(TIL in bizarro world, 30 seconds = 10 minutes.)*

""If you tried and failed more than 3 times, you're locked out.  You're going to have to call corporate to have them unlock it and reset your password.""

She says ""I don't have time for this shit.  Can't you do it?""

""Jill, they won't even *talk* to me about your account at all.  You know that.""

""I need that email NOW!  Can't you just hack it or something?""

&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; 

Yeah, sure.  Let me get right on that.  Ignoring the fact that I neither have the skills, information, or resources to do that on the fly, I'm just going to spend god knows how much time hacking into the email server just so you don't have to make a 3 minute phone call.  I'm sure my wife would also love the explanation of why I just got fired, too.  

I hate mondays.

We only have about 120 staff, and yes, I receive this many dumb jobs per day, let alone legitimate jobs. (I'm the only tech)

*****

&gt; Subject: **Shifting Software**

&gt; Description: *Could we please have Adobe Acrobat IV moved from my current PC to %New_Computer% in Community Development please. Many thanks.*

Now, I know we are slightly behind on some Adobe updates... but really?

**Job Closed:** Needed Adobe Reader XI *(so close)*. Installed, tested working.

*****

&gt; Subject: **screen**

&gt; Description: *second screen not working*

Thanks, I guess I'll go look?

**Job Closed:** Power cable had magically come out. Replugged, working correctly.

*****

Not tech support, but this one was overheard from the 'pod' next to mine that deal with emails that come to our main box *(council@xxx.gov.xx)*

&gt; Subject: **Puddle**

&gt; Description: *attached picture of water over a road*

The person that got this one nearly lost it trying to work out how to respond. *""Do I send them back a picture of my puddle? Or do I send them a picture of a duck and ask if they would like it in their puddle?""*

*****

&gt; Subject: **unable to download *%Organisation%* Agenda**

&gt; Description: *.*

I-... Apparently they worked out how to get around our mandatory description field...

**Job Reply:** More information please. An error message or something?

*****

&gt; Subject: **Network connection**

&gt; Description: *No network connection on %User% and %User% computers.*

Now, on the surface this seems like a legitimate job. It was submitted 2 hours after work started for everyone.

I went down to the area the ticket came from, and started talking to them. On the way, I had two other users ask *""When are emails coming back up?""* I had no idea what they were talking about, so I told them I'd get to them after I finish the current job.

I get to the desk and indeed, the computer is showing that it is disconnected. People from other sections overheard me talking about the issue, and then I heard a wave of *""Oh yeah, mine says that too""* from at least 20-30 people. I checked each of their computers and it was the same issue all round.

I went back up into the server room and discovered that one of the switches was down. A quick reboot and it was all functioning again.

It then occurred to me that about half a floor of users had been [working](http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/37802895.jpg) without network for 2 hours without saying anything to IT.

**Job Closed:** Switch for F1/50-100 had gone down. Restored with reboot.

*****

&gt; Subject: **Cabinet**

&gt; Description: *I have lost my favourites from the Outlook Cabinet*

Knowing this user normally clicks faster than they think, I logged onto their email account and checked the 'deleted-deleted items' and sure enough, I found all 1,600+ emails in there.

This means that they 'accidentally' deleted them, and then deleted them again from their trash folder. I also checked the deleted date, which was about 15 days ago. Luckily our deleted-deleted backup goes back 20 days.

Unfortunately I was unable to recover her folder structure but thanks were still given!

**Job closed:** Recovered all items from deleted-deleted folder.

Anyway, lunch break nearly over so I should probably get back to it.

1373635722.0,750,self.talesfromtechsupport,1i5ghq,"""You have nothing in writing"" goes both ways.",874,124,119,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1i5ghq/you_have_nothing_in_writing_goes_both_ways/,"This story takes place oh-so-many years ago. I was in the last year of high school and dynamic websites were fairly new. My computer science professor knew I was looking for a job and told me that a friend of his was looking for a student to work for him.

I meet up with the professor's friend who tells me the company promised a website to a *major* ambulance building company but he didn't have anybody with any experience in building a dynamic site from scratch; he only had a designer that created the mockup. He asked me if I could create something like that and I told him that although I knew HTML I never built anything like that, but I was willing to learn and do the job. He said the website was already late and the company only gave them six weeks to deliver the finished product or they'd take their deposit back plus a penalty. I said ""bring it!""

The deal we made was that I'd come to the office every day for a week and, if I'd show him I could get the job done, he'd hire me. Sound fair. So I came to work for the next ten days and studied everything I could about dynamic websites, how to prepare an NT server (he didn't have any linux machines) to run them, and how to use databases through Perl (that's how he wanted it). After the ten days were over I had the first draft of the website up and running. I showed the boss and asked if he'd hire me. He said that was impressive but the end product wasn't like the designer illustrated, I tried to explain ""first draft"" to him, but still said he'd want to see the finished project first. Ok.

Fast forward another week or so, the website's finally done, way ahead of schedule. Sure, the source code wasn't pretty, but the website looked and worked as requested: there was a database with all the products, the customer could choose the base vehicle, add every piece of instrumentation, get a quotation for the finished ambulance and place the order online. I also created a CMS (didn't even know it was called that at the time) so that the customer could update his database online. Doesn't seem like much now, but it was 2000 and I was a damn proud 19yo. So I show this to the boss. His answer was ""ah, good good, now just add the price conversion in euros and fix this border"" to which I reply ""ok, how about that contract we were talking about?""  
""Ah no, I can't... You see you don't even have a high school diploma and no experience in the field, so I can't hire you. But when the website's done I'll pay you and we can keep working like that: I'll pay you for every project you finish.""  
""Ok, so this one's finished, I can fix those two things in 10 minutes tops. So...""  
""Yeah, finish those and then I'll pay you.""

I didn't. Every day I kept coming back to the office and asked for my payment, every day he kept saying he'd ""pay me later"", everyday I capped his bandwidth (I had an ISDN line at home, this was a T1, it was AWESOME!), and every day I went back home. I'd have to take the train both ways and, of course, buy lunch. All this time I did nothing but nag the boss about my dues and talk to the other employees. Excluding the boss six people worked there: the designer, the incompetent hottie at the phone and four high school students that ""would be paid eventually"". These guys were working just as hard as me: one of them was preparing a linux box that would become the mail server, another one was working on some projects on Auto CAD, can't really remember what the other one did. Once, when talking to the girl, she let it slip that we weren't the only highschoolers that worked there, but many stopped showing up after not being paid long enough. She also let it slip that the website I was working on was being paid as much as a supercar.

And so I downloaded stuff from kazaa and bugged my boss until the customer came back asking a progress report. The boss brought them in the employee area, saw me smiling really wide and was smart enough to ask the designer to tell them how the website was coming along. He hadn't seen anything about the website ever since he drew the mockup and only heard hearsay so his progress report was something on the line of ""yeah we only need to add the euro conversion and fix a border and it's gonna look exactly like the pictures you already saw"". They weren't pleased.

Later that day the boss called me in his office to talk  
""So, how's the website?""  
""All nice and ready. I just have to copy it to the server.""  
""So, ehm... You've been coming here every day, right?""  
""Yup. It's been almost a month now. I have to take the train every day.""  
""And how much does it cost you?""  
""I pay X each way.""  
""So, 2X a day, five days a week, here you go: 40X. So can you copy the site on the server?""  

That was the day the bastard learned that ""you have nothing in writing"" goes both ways. I took the money, went back to my computer, erased the whole thing and walked out the door none the richer but all the wiser. The best part was hearing my professor scold me in class: ""he failed his deadline, had nothing at all to show for it, had to pay back the deposit and a penalty for half of the cost of the entire project! He had to file for bankrupcy!""  
I explained exactly how things went down and had another student that worked there confirm what I said.  
""Ok, he was a jerk and deserved it, but goddamit you could have warned me! I'd have avoided his phone calls!""

For a little bit of background, I've been doing a combination of Level 1 and 2 support for various companies for going on 6 years now. I currently for for a defense contractor, but back when I started my exciting career in tech support, I worked for a fairly prominent ISP doing internet and VOIP support. Most of the calls were pretty normal things, rebooting routers and modems and such. But I had a few absolute mind-melters in my 2 years there. Here's one of them.

Me: ""Thanks for calling tech support, my name is Gemini, how can I help you today?""

Confused Girl: ""Oh, hi. I got this message on my screen that says I need to call you guys because there's a problem with my account. Which is weird, because I don't have an account.""

Me: ""That... is indeed weird. Can you read me the message?""

She proceeds to rattle of the screen that shows up when your account gets shut off from not paying a bill.

Me: ""Oh, I see what happened. You didn't pay your bill in time, so we've suspended your service. I can get you over to the billing department to fix this up.""

CG: ""Yeah, but, like I said, I don't have an account with you guys.""

Me: ""Right... well... what's your name?""

She gives me her name, I look it up, she definitely doesn't have an account with us, at least not under that name.

Me: ""Okay... can you find your modem? I can try to pull it up using the serial number.""

CG: ""What's a modem?""

Me: ""It's a little black box with green lights, it's probably got an M on the front for Motorola.""

CG: ""I don't have one of those.""

Me: ""Okay... how exactly do you connect to the internet?""

CG: ""With my laptop.""

Me: ""Are you connecting wirelessly?""

CG: ""Yeah.""

Me: ""Do you have service with another company maybe?""

CG: ""No, can you just fix this please?""

I ponder this in silence a moment, and then break the news to her.

Me: ""Okay, so... here's the deal. You're connecting into your neighbor's unsecured wireless network. Your neighbor failed to pay their bill on time, so their service was cut off. You have two options. I can transfer you over to our sales department and you can get a legal internet connection from us and we'll come out and install it for you as soon as possible. Or you can wander around your apartment building knocking on doors and find out who didn't pay their cable bill, then admit to them that you're leeching off of their wireless and request that they pay their bill.""

CG: ""So... you can't just turn the internet back on for me?""

Me: ""Nope. Not a chance.""

Now Read On...   

----

We all have them. The calls which make us wonder if we've gently drifted from the path of sanity during a momentary lapse of attention, and are now wandering the fractal-mirrored halls of a reality not quite our own. Calls which stay with us, bright and sharp-edged, heedless of the passage of years and alcohol, like glass shards in the mind.  

We all have them.  

This is mine.  
   
  
It started out innocently enough. I had been working a federal government helpdesk for some months, gotten past the initial weirdnesses, and settled in. The calls had become fairly routine, and I had just picked up the phone to be informed that the caller, from the floor above me, was having some difficulty printing.  

Not a problem! Friendly helpdesk tech is on the case and ready to help! We shall walk through the standard troubleshooting and have the user going happily printy-printy in short order, ho ho! The caller themselves is happy to follow my instructions, and off we go. We get to about ten minutes into the call, checking all the usual software settings to no avail, and I start asking more general questions.  

- Do they get an error when they print? No.  
- Is the printer switched off? No.  
- Does the printer make printing noises when a job is sent to it? Yes.  
- Does the paper, in fact, come out of the printer? Yes.  
- With the correct information on? Can't tell.  
- How about the - wait, what?  

Can't... tell?  
   
  
Is the user printing a document without viewing it? (Possible, but rare.) No...  
Does the user have a file with a print format significantly different from the screen presentation? No...  
Um... is the user blind? (Never assume the obvious.) No...  
The printer IS in the same room, yes? Oh yes, it's about ten feet away, against the wall.  
Then... why can the user not determine what's on the printout?  

Well, that would be because the printer **IS ON FUCKING FIRE**.  
   
  
Not ""the printer is a little warm"". Not even ""a sparking short is visible through the ventilation slots"". This was *""three-foot flames are leaping out of the power supply the whole time the user has been on the phone to me.""*  
   
  
I think, at that moment, I honestly felt my brain shut down. I just couldn't reconcile a rational world with the knowledge that a user had walked through ten whole minutes of calm, helpful troubleshooting, while never once considering it worth mentioning that the object of his disapproval was doing its best impression of Thích Quảng Đức.  

A second passed. Another.  

Reality, fully fledged and razor-tipped, fell on me with the weight of empires, all bloody maw and sadistic vengeance. Somehow, in my stunned state, I managed to get the caller to switch the printer off at the wall and go find a fire warden. I still cannot remember writing the ticket to have a tech go up and examine the charred ruin - I'd kicked over into autopilot, and wasn't exactly *compos mentis*. The world had broken, and it would never be quite the same again.

Back to this morning.

Saw that our co hosted smtp relay was taking strain, so I ran:

    exim -bpc

It spat out that there was 304 messages waiting in the queue.

While not a large number, it is unusually high for this particular server.

So:

    exim -bp | less

and scrolling down allowed me to find the culprit.

She sent a 2MB PDF marketing brochure to 1189 recipients, and delivery bounces and whatnot was clogging up our exim queue.

Fine.

Instead of doing the usual and walking over to educate her about our dedicated (paid for) bulk email and newsletter systems, I decided to have some fun. Besides, she has used the bulk mailer for just this purpose before.

    exim -bp | grep -A 1189 offender@abusersdomain &gt; abuserfile

I decided to pipe the output to a text file, because once exim has finished delivering the mails it will be a bit harder to snarf the destination addresses in order to do what I did next.

(Oh yeah, this is going to happen to her a few times this week.)

    cat abuserfile | awk '{print $2}' | while read line; do echo -e ""Bulk Spam Detected For \n \n $line \n \n Please refrain from sending bulk spam from your account. \n Account might be disabled if behaviour continues."" | mail -s ""Bulk Mail Abuse Detected"" offender@abuserdomain ; done

I checked her mailbox, and it is crammed with my abuse warning from root@myserver

I'll give it a few hours and decide if I want to send out another one, or wait till tomorrow. I might update with her response, if there is any before I send out the second wave.



**EDIT/UPDATE**

She downloaded all the emails from root, and slunk out of the office to a meeting. According to our IN/OUT system I can expect her back in the office at 16:00.

I guess about, see... 1189 gentle reminders of her misbehaviour can be sent out at about 15:30....

**EDIT/UPDATE 2**

So I decided to get creative and sent her a custom delivery delay notification for the sixteen or so messages that have not been delivered yet.

I'll send delivery confirmations for the others later :D

**EDIT3**

One of the commenters indicated that I am on a bit of a power trip, that I should not teach her a lesson and that I am a support staffer thinking that I am the law.

Fair enough, I guess you deserve a little clarification:

I am not only a support staffer, but IT management that takes care of our hosting environment as one of my tasks. My team gets a lot of flack and aggravation as it is with support staff.

Because I am senior management, I have an open door to her boss.

Why do I not speak to her boss? Because she has been publicly berated by him recently. If I go to him I could cause her to be fired, for she has pulled crap like this before, and his fuse is very short with her.

Why do I not sit her down and have a chat with her? Because a manager from another department having a sit-down with her would cause questions to be asked, leading to possible negative consequinces for her.

She needs to learn a lesson, and a little scare tactics goes a long way in getting people back in line with best practices.

**EDIT/UPDATE3**

I just went upstairs to enquire about her.

She decided not to come back after her meeting. I let one of her colleagues in on my prank and she told me that the section boss used the bulk mail system yesterday, and that she was supposed to do the same as per his direct instruction.

She remarked that ""... she does as she pleases. He told her to use the bulk mailer. Keep spamming her. She has to learn.""

**Me:** NOC, this is Kendall.

**Customer:** We don't have phone service.

*At this point I've verified that the provisioning is correct and have noted a Ringer Equivalency failure, usually caused by nothing being plugged into the ATA.*

**Me:** Yes ma'am, I do see an issue. It doesn't look like the modem is seeing anything plugged into the correct telephone port. Could you please tell me how many cords are connected to the back of it?

**Customer:** What's a modem?

**Me:** It's a small, black, rectangular box with some green lights on it. It'll probably be close to a computer and will say ""Arris"" on it.

**Customer:** Let me go see.

*A few minutes pass...*

**Customer:** There are three cords connected to the back.

**Me:** Are you able to get on the internet?

**Customer:** Let me see..........Yes.

*This means that only the power, coaxial, and Ethernet were connected and that the phone cord is probably laying on the floor behind whatever piece of furniture the modem is sitting on.*

**Me:** There needs to be four cords connected. Would you mind checking to see if there's a stray phone cord on the floor close to the modem?

**Customer:** I don't understand. There's only ever been three cords plugged in and it was working fine this morning. Nobody's been back there to mess with it.

**Me:** Ma'am, the phone service can't work without a phone cord connected to the modem. Would you please check?

*Insert quite a bit of back and forth about this and she eventually gets frustrated and hangs up. About an hour later her husband calls in and I get the transfer.*

**Me:** Network Operations, this is Kendall. How can I help you?

**Husband:** We ain't gotta dial tone. Can you guys zap it or whatever you do to fix it?

**Me:** From the notes it appears that the issue is with a disconnected phone cord. Would you mind telling me how many cords are connected to the back of the modem.

**Husband:** Three. Why?

**Me:** There needs to be a total of four cords. One for the power, one for the cable, one for the internet, and one for the phone.

**Husband (in a more aggressive tone):** My wife went through this earlier! There's only ever been three on the back!

**Me:** Sir, I believe you may be mistaken. Without that fourth cord the phone service will not be functional.

**Husband (now mad):** I TOLD YOU IT ONLY NEEDS THREE CORDS! NOW ZAP IT AND MAKE IT WORK!

**Me:** Sir, it is quite literally impossible for this to work without that cord also connected to the modem. Please, for the sake of being thorough, check to see if there's a stray phone cord on the floor behind the modem.

**Husband:** AIN'T NOBODY MESSED WITH IT! CORDS DON'T UNPLUG THEMSELVES!

**Me:** I agree with you on that point, however we still need to check for that phone cord.

*I hear him set the phone down and then utter some curses about the quality of our service and that this is a bunch of crap, but I can hear movement so it's obvious he's doing something.*

There had been this computer there for over a year, some crappy HP desktop with a bad motherboard the women didn't want replaced. She called and asked us to burn some things from the hard drive for her, which we did at no charge. She asked if we could dispose of the computer for her, which we did. Upon taking any piece of hardware in we had customers sign a document that forfeit property if left with us for 90 days without any contact.

She calls back a year later and this is how the conversation went.

*Her - Yes, I left my computer there a few weeks ago, and I need to pick it up. I need a computer tomorrow very badly. Is it fixed?*

**I take the information and look it up**

Me - ""Uhm, an HP desktop, wouldn't boot up? Mrs. @#$%!?""

*Her - Yes, that's it.*

Me - Well that computer was dropped off over a year ago.

*Her - Oh has it been that long? Hah, I should have picked it up. It will be fixed when I come get it, right?*

Me - Ma'am it says right here that you asked us to dispose of it for you. Even if you hadn't, after 90 days we would have recycled it just the same!

**Here's about 15 minutes of her yelling at me, calling me names, and threatening me with every legal word she's ever heard on NCIS.**

Finally I interrupt her in the middle of her tirade. 

Me - Ma'am, did you notice a sign on our front door that said ""Dead computer storage?""

*Her - ... Noo.....*

Me - **That's cause I'm not in the BUSINESS of storing dead COMPUTERS**

and I just hung up. Never heard from her again.

Does Netflix have a feature where i could see how much time Ive spent watching shows and movies total? Mostly because I'd be really interested in where I was at.

**Netflix Dino:
We actually don't at this time but that's actually a great idea!**

Recently because of the way part time workers above 30 hours now get health benefits in the United States suddenly everybody who was working as a part timer now gets their hours cut. This hurts especially for the entire department of people they had at 39.

So all the part timers in our department got together and I was chosen to speak with the dean of our local campus to discuss the issue of pay and hours. We discussed that this wasn't a healthy work environment because we were encouraged to do our jobs poorly because of how they do their pay. Our hours had been cut before for doing 'too much work' and so on and we were sick of getting paid less than home depot employes and no benefits we argued that they if they had budgeted a ton of money (roughly six million dollars) to their new admin offices they could budget a little bit of extra cash for fair wages. We said it's silly to pay us to little when we handle equipment that's easily worth several times our monthly wages and we handle all this sensitive data and network administration that goes into keeping a campus running.




 So after what I thought was a good meeting we find out that not only are our hours being cut but we're also being knocked down to below 20 hours a week. Even the people who have worked here five+ years and suddenly the dean who's always made time for talks is suddenly too busy in his office doing paperwork to have meetings.

On a unrelated note, there's been a rash of computer breakdowns and network problems and a lot of techs who are suddenly too tired to get up from their desks.

EDIT: My boss tried to console us saying maybe we'll get our hours back in September, and maybe they'll hire another full time worker. I find it hard to believe and personally I think it's a tactic to make five people in the same boat squabble over table scraps.

We issued IBM Thinkpads with Windows 2000 and Office 2000 to remote employees. This one particular employee, whom we will call Rich, was a problem child who thought computers were ""just a fad"". Real old school type who resented having to use this new technology and ""electronic mail"". He was from the New Jersey area, an avid outdoors man, contempt for anyone born south of the Mason Dixon line, and an arrogant PhD to boot. Me, I'm from TX, overweight, and technology is my passion. As such, he had a less than admirable view of what value I brought to the company, and didn't mind letting my boss know that. To be fair, my boss just wanted me to fix the computers and keep the ship running.
So one day, Rich is in the HQ office for a week before he does another 6 month stretch out on the road. Just as he's about to start a conference call with a new potential client, he storms into my office and wants to know why his computer doesn't work. What he shows me set the bar so low it would not be broken until 2011. His browser had at least 14 toolbars installed. His desktop was littered with document fragments that started with ~'s. A popup kept fighting with another popup to be the one on top. And I could hear that poor Thinkpad's fan just screaming away in a desperate attempt to keep the hardware cool.

Now, in the past Rich had been borderline vulgar and condescending whenever he called me for tech support. As I was only at the job for less than 2 years, I just tried to work around it. My boss didn't care as long as the problem got fixed. So when Rich came with this problem I seriously considered playing dumb and shrug. It would have served him right. So just as I was about to do just that, I made eye contact. And for such a manly man that he purported to be, I saw fear.

The Angels of my better nature took over. Disregarding every condescending thing he ever said to me, I took a look at his computer. It would take too long to clean and could never be sure I got everything. 

I looked at him and said ""This is too far gone. You need a complete wipe and reinstall. With updates and patches to Windows, not to mention the custom and proprietary software we use, that's a two day process at best."" 

I could see his heart sink. The conference call he was supposed to be on in 5 minutes was, we later discovered, the biggest in his career with our company. He needed the files and programs on his computer to close the deal. I turned around and grabbed the only spare laptop I had just prepared the day before for an incoming new hire. After a quick boot to a safe mode, I copied the necessary files and handed him the spare. I looked him in the eye and said ""I will have your computer back to you with your data intact by 8:00 AM tomorrow morning."" With that, I could see the tension drain out of him and he left to conduct his phone conference.

I had to stay late, and even took his computer home so I could run updates overnight. I woke up an hour early and installed/configured the proprietary software. Sure enough at 7:59 AM the next morning, I had a clean and functioning computer. At 8:01 AM Rich walked into my office. I had it booted and showed him quickly all his data files were there. The PC was clean, and running like it was new. Satisfied his data was intact, I closed the lid and handed it to him. As he took possession of the pc, he offered his hand, gave me a ""Thanks"" and a bottle of Vodka.

Things were different after that.

I work in the radio industry in Canada. I pull the IT strings at the station I'm with, and I've never posted anything because frankly, the people in my office are rather computer literate (today's radio industry relies heavily on computers, so everyone who is hired usually knows how to use one fairly well). I've always been a fairly crafty guy - I don't have any formal training in IT, but I've done a lot with Windows and Linux enterprise networking.

This story, however, doesn't come from my years in IT or at the radio station, rather from my days in high school.

Because I was naturally gifted, I was always the go to person to fix issues while I was in high school. Teacher can't get the projector to work? Curtis can fix it. No video from the DVD player? Give Curtis a call. I didn't mind, it made me feel important.

It wasn't just the teachers that knew this either, I had a reputation with the entire student body. Everyone, whether they knew me personally or not, knew that ""Curtis"" was the fix-it guy.

So, one day, we're at an assembly in the gym. The entire population of the school is in the room, and they're trying to show a video. They've got their portable projector and PA system set up, and they're projecting this video on the wall. Problem was, we couldn't hear anything. I can see the people at the front of the gym struggling to get it working, while the students all got antsy in their seats. 30 seconds pass, and still nothing. I hear someone near me suggest that ""Hey Curtis, go up and help them."" I guess some others heard that, and reinforced it, ""Yeh Curtis, you can fix it.""

And before I knew it, the entire school was chanting ""Curtis! Curtis! Curtis! Curtis!"" People were looking at me. All I could think was: Do I stand up to fix it, or do I let them work it out?

After a few more seconds, I decide to go help out. As I stand up from my seat and walk forward, the chanting of my name breaks into a round of applause. I walked towards the front of the room, and the video organizer, we'll call him Geoff, is still working on fixing the sound issue. I decided to make the most of the attention I was getting from the students to fix it, and tried to fix the issue by ""magic"". I took a solid stance on the ground, and stuck both my hands out towards the soundboard, as if I was a wizard casting a spell.

Well, the timing couldn't be more perfect. Geoff happened to fix the issue on his own at the exact moment I stuck my hands out. I was sort of shocked, so I shot my hands straight up into the air and took a bow. The students all gave me a standing ovation as I returned to my seat.

I've since graduated a few years back, but I'm told by my younger brother that my name still gets called when tech issues arise at the old high school.

This was the support queue for their mid-range and large business systems. 

The names in this story are made up to protect the idiotic.  

One day my dad gets a call from a police precinct in a medium sized town where they have an AS/400 that serves 5 different police stations and a few fire stations connect in as well. 

Caller: ""This is Sergeant Murphy.  We've got an AS/400 system here that serves our precinct and we had to fire one of the system administrators by the name of Frank for being lazy and incompetent not to mention repeated issues with him not showing up to work.  You'd think this would be the end of it, but he showed up today at the main police station saying he was a master hacker that we couldn't replace him.  He says that he put a back-door in the system that only he can access.  He's demanded that we rehire him, along with a raise, or he'd destroy our computer systems and there's nothing we could do to stop him.""

Dad: ""Wow.  So what did you do?""

Caller: ""well, first thing we did was arrest him and throw him in a holding cell where he can't get near any computers.  Guy's not too bright.  I need you to look at our system and see if he's telling the truth and make sure there's nothing he can do to the system.  I'm sure I don't need to tell you that if he takes down our whole system that would be very bad for the town and our ability to do our job.""

Dad: ""Understood.  I'll get connected and take a look.""

My dad remotely connects to their system and starts looking around.  First thing he does is runs a query to see all users with remote access privileges.  He can see that Frank's account has been deactivated.  So he's not getting in that way.

All of the users have full names like ""BobSmith"" but two of them stand out.  BD1 and BD2 (Back-door1 and 2).  Looking at a query of those two users, they've never logged in.  Furthermore, they were created by the user ""JohnDoe"" (This name is not made up. The back-door user was created by an account called JohnDoe.) which no longer exists in the system.  Looking in the activity archive, the user JohnDoe was created by Frank's account.  It  was logged in once to create the two users Bd1 and Bd2, than promptly deleted by Frank's account.  

My dad disables those two accounts and starts digging deeper.  Surely this couldn't be his master plan.  A couple of users - that's it?    He once commented that this was the really fun part because he started thinking about if you wanted to put a time bomb in the system, how would you go about doing it?  He starts looking at the various jobs in the system.  Scheduled jobs that might elevate system privileges, jobs that adjust user privileges, scheduled restore jobs, scheduled deletion, so on and so forth.  

My dad got this call because he was considered at that time the foremost security expert on the As/400.  He was left severely disappointed because the guy didn't do anything even remotely sneaky or clever.  Only made a couple of remote access accounts and didn't cover his tracks very well in hiding who made them.  So he calls the Sergeant back and tells him what he's found.

Caller: ""Really that's it?  That's too bad.  I was hoping he'd done a bit more damage so we could charge him with more.  If he had remotely connected, what could he have done?""

Dad: ""Oh, lots of things.  Since the back-door users had full system level privileges he could have shutdown the system.  Deleted users, stuff like that.""

Caller: ""Really?  Could you write up a list of things he potentially could have done to disrupt us?  No matter how small.""

Dad writes up a list of everything you could do with elevated privileges.  From deleting users, to changing criminal records, to rendering the system totally unusable.  He had a lot of fun thinking outside the box and being devious.  Though later dad admitted that given the guys lack of imagination in creating a back-door, he probably never would have thought of half the things on the list.

He faxed the list over to the Sergeant (because faxing is how you rolled in the 90s!) and Sergeant called him back laughing hysterically.

Caller: ""This is great Dan!  I'm sending this to the D.A.'s office right away!  What kind of moron threatens the police and demands a job from them?  The D.A. is going to have a field day with this one.""

On a Friday afternoon, a client in Texas called in to our support line...

&gt;client : I need you to send  someone out here RIGHT NOW!!!

&gt;me : Thank you for calling Derp Systems technical support.  Can i please have your client ID?

&gt;client : I need you to send  someone out here RIGHT NOW!!! Your shit equipment is broken again.

&gt;me : Ma'am, to further assist me in getting your issue resolved i will need to know your client ID.

&gt;client : NO SHIT the power button broke off the DAMN thing!

&gt;me : okay! well we can send a replacement server to your location but i will not arrive until Tuesday next week.  In the mean time, we can restore your last back up from another machine and make that a temporary server.  

I noticed that the ""backup server"" was using software that was atleast 5 years old and was incompatible with the current databases mdb to accdb.  i would have to download and install the new software from our company ftp.  Download of 1GB started... on DSL that was clearly out of the range on the last mile.

the client proceeds to start vomiting curse words into the phone and making colorful comparisons of my company and its products to certain venereal diseases and animal excrement. at a certain boiling point she unplugs the computer that was performing the download.  my screen goes black and i could hear her screeching in the distant background.

suddenly, a calm young boy picks up the phone

With in 5 minutes of the boy picking up the phone, we had re-established connection with the server to one of the other stations.  The backup server did not make it through the phone call.  from what the boy told me, his mother had ripped the system off her counter and threw it outside.

We get to deal with students, professors, faculty, and staff—so a wide range of people with a wide range of technological understanding. Today's a slow day, so I figured I'd share this particular tale with you:*

A few days ago, I had a customer who was absolutely certain he had gotten some sort of monstrous virus on his computer. Nothing at all seemed odd about the computer's performance, but he continued to insist that his anti-virus program was blocking ""hundreds of threats online"" every day (which turned out to be cookies) and he was sure that something was wrong. I ran a scan with two of the scanners we use at work, each giving his computer a clean bill of health.

&gt; What's your best anti-virus?

he asks. I explained to him that we have a contract with one company on campus, and said I could install that on his computer, but that he should be fine with the software he already has installed. After reassuring him about 20 times he had nothing wrong, he left, and told me

&gt; You're my new best friend (gets very close to look at my name tag) laughingwiseman

This customer came back into the store today, having decided that his perfectly-okay HP laptop would no longer cut it, and that he needed to buy a Mac (which we sell in store).

&gt; I'm going to buy a MacBook. So give me one of those, a copy of your best anti-virus, and anything else you recommend. And can I pay by check?

I don't work sales, so I was just in a corner on the other side of the store watching this happen. It was like watching a 65-year-old trapped in a 19-year-old's body buy a computer. The sales guys told him that he probably wouldn't need any anti-virus software (and that if he did want some, we don't sell it, anyway) and that we don't take checks, per store policy. As he's paying by credit card, he asks

&gt; Do I have to install the Internet on this?

The sales guy explains that he's already got all that stuff installed, and that if he has any further questions about his purchase, he's got a 3-year warranty with Apple and that he should call them if he's got any questions.

Not 30 minutes later, he's back, angry that he can't ""right click"" anymore, and insistent that we make sure he doesn't have a virus.

He went on and on about the skills this new computer prodigy had demonstrated during his job interview, but never got into the specifics. 

After the introduction he told me something I was afraid of hearing all along: I had to to train Alex. Don made sure to put strong emphasis on wanting me to train him; I was the chosen one.

This was going to be a long shift.

I reluctantly walked to the back to stow away my coat and bag into my locker; it only took a minute. I wanted to stall going back into the store, so I started rearranging the items I had in my bag, reading the ingredients on the chewing gum, readjusting my clothing, checking my cellphone for new messages...

Alex was still standing behind the counter when I came back. I decided to play the busy game and told him I had a lot of things that needed to be done before I could start training him. I pointed at 12 boxes of all kinds of electronics that needed to added to the shelves. He could do that and get himself familiarised with the store that way.

I checked the inventory system, which was an old DOS program that received its latest update in ’97. The system rarely worked as it should and often randomly updated items to be in stock again. We apparently now stocked hundreds of RAM-Modules and Video cards from the early 1990s. 

It did not matter much anyway as checking inventory was something that rarely needed to be done since Don and Ron just brought in random boxes at all times, but it kept me busy and Alex away from me. Except it didn’t.

Alex seemed desperate for some attention at this moment and kept asking me constantly where each of the electronics needed to be placed. I knew that he wasn’t stupid and could perfectly well find his way around the store. He had been here so many times over the months. 

About an hour in, I had stopped counting how many times he had asked me where items needed to be placed, but it must have been around thirty times. I decided to give him the training that he was supposed to get by decree of the soon to be millionaire Don.

As there were no customers in the store I showed him the back where we keep most of the stock, the cage with camera system and UPS and the tables with computers that needed to be fixed. We walked through the store and I showed him some more things, like how the sliding cabinets under the displays worked in the new part of the store.

I was on my knees at this moment taking out an mp3 player when he started coming a little close for comfort. I back off and stood up quickly, and told him he needs to keep his distance. He half-heartedly apologised and said he did not mean to do it. It all felt very eerie. Against my better judgement, I decided to ignore it and move on as I went on with the rest of the day. I let him loose in the store so he could harass the customers instead of me. 

I started going down the list of customers who needed to be notified that their repaired PCs and orders could be picked up. I was busy calling the customers on the list as another customer walked into the store. Alex took initiative for the first time. Rather awkwardly he walked up to a middle aged woman and started to introduce himself. 

“Hi, my name is Alex and I am an expert at all things technical.” The woman was already taken a bit aback by how he said it, lisping at every syllable. She started telling him that she was looking for a new keyboard as her current one stopped working. Alex immediately dragged her to the 6 or 7 keyboards we had, pulled out a Logitech G15 keyboard and told her she needed this one. No discussion possible. It was a keyboard that we sold for 140 dollars.

I had been listening and watching from the beginning and felt I needed to step in for the sanity of this woman. I quickly took over the conversation and pointed her to a 20 dollar keyboard that would do the job just fine. When she was gone I talked to Alex and made it clear that we don’t work on commission and our preferences don’t count.  I sent him to the back with a list of computers he could fix. He wasn’t any better at that.

The next two or three days were mostly the same story with him receiving negative attention from me because he kept messing up no matter what he did or how I dealt with him. Negative attention, however, is still attention and he seemed to dwell in it, maybe even actively asking for it. He was clingy, always asking the same questions — simple questions he could have easily solved himself.

It wasn’t until a month later that he started to become more than just annoying and moved into the territory of being creepy. It was one Saturday morning that I found a love note in my locker. It was barely intelligible because of the messy handwriting. 

Leila, 

I now have worked with you for a month and have seen you much longer than that. I asked you out once and you said no. Maybe now that you know me better I can ask again and get a yes. I really believe you are the one, I will win your heart someday. 

Alex

I wasn’t happy with this note and felt it had dragged on long enough. He was already in the store and I walked up to him and pushed the note into his chest. “I already have a boyfriend, I have said before that I was not interested and no I don’t want to be friends with you either.” It was harsh, sure, but I really did not want this situation go on any longer. He needed to know that I did not want him or his constant peering on me.

“Just leave me alone,” I said directly into his face.

When I told him, he became angry and started asking who my boyfriend was. I refused to tell him. He started stomping on the floor and muttered under his voice, “I will be your boyfriend one day,” and just left, leaving me to handle the entire store alone. He didn’t return and I called Frank to see if he could fill in for Alex. Afterwards I called Don telling him about what happened. He wasn’t happy with Alex but completely ignored the rest of what I told him.

I did not feel safe that day and when I was to leave around the end of the afternoon, I called a couple of my friends to pick me up and have a girls’ night at my home. I never saw Alex and will never find out if he actually did follow me, but it really felt as if he had.

After that, I told Jeremy and my family what was going on. I had to work with Alex again on Monday and Jeremy went with me to work, just to make sure that nothing would happen. In the end, he was with me for the entire shift as Alex never showed up. He didn’t for his next shifts either. I was happy he was gone but it did not feel right. Something would happen.

At home I started to receive postcards with love notes and even flowers. He somehow found out my private cellphone number and started calling at the most random times, saying nothing when I picked up the first two or three times. Texts with just one or two words in them followed soon after.

This was ongoing for about 2 weeks and I had been in contact with the police several times. They had told me there was very little they could do at the moment and I should keep all the postcards, texts and calls he send me. They had already gone to his house and warned him, but it didn’t help.

In those two weeks I had been surrounded by my friends, family and Jeremy, so nothing would happen. I hadn’t worked in the store during that time either and Jeremy, Frank and Richard were covering my shifts. Frank and Richard were very supportive of me and didn’t like Alex either. If they had their chance they would work their magic.

Around the three week mark we had a store meeting. The store meetings had become a mandatory thing every month since the new year. I went with Jeremy to see if I could start working at the store again. I was not going to back down for Alex.

At the store, the usual suspects were in. Ron and Don were talking about how well the store was doing with the Chinese knock off section and announcing some of their new plans when the suddenly were interrupted by a loud noise. Alex was now in the store.

He started shouting “JEREMY IS YOUR BOYFRIEND, I KNEW IT!” At this stage, the attention wasn’t turned to Alex, but to me and Jeremy. Frank and Richard seemed like they wanted to high five Jeremy, but Ron and Don for some reason gave a disapproving look to the both of us. I still don’t know what that was about. 

“Just leave, Alex. Leave and don’t come back,” I said. I did not want to take any of his bullshit anymore. Alex did not budge. “I am not leaving before you dump him and go with me.” It was at this moment that Jeremy stepped in and said something I never expected. “Listen, you deformed piece of shit, go back to the hole you came from and die.” I was taken aback by the aggression in Jeremy’s voice. I didn’t know who to be afraid of anymore.

Alex started throwing computers on the floor and broke a monitor while doing it. Don and Ron hadn’t really done anything during the fight but only now stepped in because they were going to be hit financially. “You don’t work here anymore and are not welcome here anymore. Now you better pull out your wallet and pay me or I will call the cops,” said Ron.

The cops pulled up fifteen agonising minutes later. They arrested Alex and had proof this time. The cameras installed by Ron had recorded everything. I was free.

I was working on one of our developers laptops, and he was moaning about the screen resolution. It was a Thinkpad T60, a great laptop, but this particular one had a very low screen res, 1024x768 if I remember.

I was to take the laptop back to my desk to sort out something unrelated to the screen, so I had it in under my arm whilst we talked.

I was explaining that you can replace the screen relatively easily in these models, and he could get a higher resolution screen but we don't do it in-house so it would need to go to a specialist.

He then explained that he had asked for that already requested that, but it had been declined by his manager.

I half-jokingly said that if the screen had an ""accident"", it would have to be replaced anyway...

No problem with this, of course, except that when I said ""accident"" I actually made the bunny-ears thing with both hands. And dropped the laptop. Which broke the screen.

The user wasn't best pleased, as it turned out. And he was convinced I had done it deliberately as a favour. I hadn't. I'm just an idiot.

So, I've been working It for my college campus for the past 2 years. We have a lovely professor by the name of *Sandy. She is really a pleasure to work with. Mmmhm, definitely. 

So, Im working from home one evening when I get a call at 8pm. I answer, say my whole spiel, and she says ""How do I start a chat?! I need to chat with one of the employees working for you! I need to find the chat"" ""Well, ma'am its on the IT page at IT.school.edu directly under the phone number"" ""No, its not. Where is it? Do you think im stupid?"" ""No, maa'am. I'm sorry, you can also get to it by clicking the help button directly under the phone number"" ""Fine. You should make the chat button on the main page. How is anyone supposed to know to click help if they need help?!""

Well, that was lovely. I'm the only person working tonight, so I'm about to get her chat. Why didnt we just do this over the phone? Mostly because shes an asshat. 

Her chat comes through, I pick it up. I ask her whats going on, yada yada. Okay, her accounts locked. Well, she calls all the time, and proper protocol demands that I have both the last 4 of SSN and the last 4 of student ID number. So, I ask her for the last 4 of her Student number. she gave it to me, okay. She always does. Now, I ask for the last 4 of her SSN. She refuses. She refuses, she calls me names, then she says ""Excuse me, why would I give you the last 4 of my pin number!? Not to mention, this chat isnt a secure system! Anyone can see it!""   Okay, Im shocked. 

1) I can already see her SSN....she just has to verify it. 

2) LOL. She made that her pin number and shes concerned about me stealing her identity. 

3) LOL. This lady....


Well, after not unlocking her account, she asks why its locked. I explain it locks after 3 failed attempts. She DEMANDS that I change the settings for her, syaing its unacceptable for it to lock like this. That this is not a security setting, that I am messing with her, that i am ruining her life. Not to mention, I have no way of changing that, even if I wanted to. So, after this conversation....she goes on to tell me that I'll unlock her account if I ""know whats good for you"" Excuse me? ""Yeah, you'll unlock my account if you knew how to use common sense, but youre too fucking stupid to do that, of course you are"". Okay lady. 

I recite ""I'm sorry, I need both the SSN and the ID number in order to verify your account. I cannot help you any further if you refuse to verify your information"" maybe 15 times. 

So, She at this point, I've spent 2 hours (yes....you got that...2 hours) being harassed by this woman syaing shes going to get me fired.

Anyway, whenever she calls, I pick up the phone now and she hangs up trying to get one of the new employees, who always forward her to me because I think its funny to refuse to assist her without information according to proper IT protocol.

Normally when a Carrier's Tech Support T1 call, they go to our T1 because honestly, Carrier's T1s are essentially users in their product knowledge, despite being trained to only deal with our product.

Normally, that is. Unfortunately they also have our T2 contact line and will occasionally come to us thinking they are competent enough.

I get a call from a Carrier Rep. T1, we'll call her Susan.

Susan says, ""I have a customer on the other line getting an error when she enables personal hotspot for the first time.""

**Me:** ""What does the error say?""

**Susan:** ""I don't know, didn't ask.""

**Me:** ""What do you know about the issue?""

**Susan:** ""Well we've been working on it for 30 minutes, restored the device, set up as new, etc and we still get the same error. I'm putting the customer onto the line now, what was your name?""

**Me:** ""My name's DirtDiglett, but before you do, why have you spent 30minutes troubleshooting an issue you don't even know?""

**Susan:** ""I know the issue is personal hotspot.""

**Me:** ""But you don't know what the error says.""

*Susan merges the lines mid-sentence*

**Susan:** ""Thanks for holding &lt;Customer&gt;, I've got DirtDiglett... blah blah blah""

**Me:** ""Thanks for your patience here &lt;Janet&gt;, I appreciate it. So I hear you're having some Personal Hotspot issues?""

**&lt;Customer&gt; (Janet from here on):** ""Yes, whenever I enable it, I get an error that says 'To enable Personal Hotspot on this cellular account, please contact *&lt;Carrier&gt;* on *&lt;Carrier Number&gt;*""

I have never facepalmed so hard. I politely apologized for the inconvenience and referred back to the carrier.

30minutes later:

**Susan:** ""Hello, I've got a customer on the line with issues on Personal Hotspot, keeps giving an error.""

*I pull up the customer details, realize it's the same customer and carrier rep*

**Me:** ""Do you know what the error is?""

**Susan:** ""No, but we've done everything.""

**Me:** ""I know what the error is, this is the same customer. You need to enable Personal Hotspot on your side of things for this to work.""

**Susan:** ""How do you know!?""

**Me:** ""I am telepathic. Prove me wrong, have them read the error to you right now.""

*Susan goes back to customer, returns in a minute or two*

**Susan:** ""You were right! You people are amazing! I always love consulting you wizards""

I am not in IT...I just read this subreddit because I love reading these stories (and I occasionally learn something).

I really wish I had the original email to which I am going to refer. It was lost in the transition from Lotus Notes to Outlook last year. I never really thought it would be important, but it would have been nice to copy the words verbatim rather than attempt to recreate the scene from memory. For that, I apologize

We are a mid-sized company owned by a larger parent organization. The structure of the business is somewhat complicated, and not entirely relevant, other than to say that company-wide emails could either be sent internally to our company (~200 users) OR, with the wrong entry in the ""to"" field, could get distributed to thousands of users across the globe. 

We had been having a string of phishing email attempts in the previous months...moreso than I had remembered in the past. Usually, like any smart employee, I would send these straight to the depths of e-hell, but of course you would always have the person or three who decided it would be good to inform everyone (including IT) by forwarding these malicious emails to the entire company.

Global IT got tired of this, and decided, after one nasty attempt that actually worked...someone was dumb enough to click it and it set off alarms or something in the IT department (or whatever happens) to send out a global email to all users in the entire company to NOT click on the link...NOT to forward the emails to everyone...make IT aware of the issue, and delete it straight away. 

That's when the most glorious example of ""throwing someone under the bus"" I have ever seen came to play. One user replied to this general IT email, thinking she was only replying to the IT department. Instead, she replied to all...ALL. Everyone in this global corporation...thousands of users. Her message?

&lt;paraphrasing&gt;

""I sit next to [herpina] and we share a computer. I didn't click the link, but she did. I watched her do it.""

*jawdrop*

Imagine that feeling...sending out what amounts to a live hand grenade aimed straight at the person you have to work with every single day, and having the entire world watch you do it!

After that, the phishing emails went away (I think a lot of it went with the transition to Outlook), but I still remember that one instance where ""reply all"" most likely meant a ticket straight to sensitivity training for one poor user somewhere.",,False,,t5_2sfg5,False,,,True,t3_147xjm,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/147xjm/throwing_coworker_under_bus_in_front_of_everyone/,

Here's half a dozen stories from my best-of.,907,163,136,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/13a6b8/3_years_of_kinkos_heres_half_a_dozen_stories_from/,"I worked at Kinko's for several years.  My particular branch was open 24/7 and near a college neighborhood where   I primarily worked behind the scenes in ""production"" positions, making the product and correcting new-hire mistakes.  When I became known to my colleagues as being a ""computer guy"" I was called in to assist with customers using the PC-rental stations and I was also expected to answer the phone if everyone at the counter was busy.  While my job was not tech-support, I had to provide assistance to people using the computer, sometimes for the first time in their life, so I think these should fit in here.  Here are my best stories.

**Wynne #1 What's the difference between cheetah and leopard?**  The customer, I discovered through protracted inquisition, was not referencing OSX versions.  The caller actually called a copy store at 9:30PM to ask for assistance with taxonomy.  The call came in from a middle aged woman named Wynne who would later prove to be either the most incompetent person alive or a lifetime-achievement-award level troll.  

**How do I open the fucking internet?!**One man, mid-40s, walked into the store with a handwritten letter and said to me “I need to email this.” He had a slightly oversized piece of paper, so it wouldn’t fit the standard little scanner we had at the time.  I directed him to the self-serve computers, which had a larger scanner.  To this day, I do not know why the full-service production area had only an 8.5X11 scanner, but the self serve had one large enough to do architectural drawings.  Nor do I understand why we could not own at least one scanner somewhere in the middle for size.  He sat at the rental computer, which was visually obscured from my workspace in the back of the store, and after about 20 minutes of evident frustration he surprised everyone in the store, especially the mother with a small child, when he shouted across the entire store “How do I open the fucking internet?!”  I went to him and calmly assisted 

“click on the internet explorer icon”

“The what?”

“The button that looks like a blue e with a yellow halo”

“How do I click it?”

“…with the mouse.”

He then picked up the mouse off of the counter, held it in his hand a moment - just long enough to raise my concern but not long enough for me to intervene, then touched the mouse to the monitor in the vicinity of the internet explorer icon.  He stared with his mouth gaped waiting for the wizard that lived inside of this tiny TV to respond.  I decided to cut my losses, I couldn’t spend my whole night helping one person email a piece of paper.   I convinced him to leave his task with us behind the counter as a full-service job.  I went and did it on the big scanner in self-service when the store was empty.

**Bernoulli disk**One gentleman brought in the file for his business cards on a Bernoulli disk.  This was in 2009.  If you don't know what a Bernoulli disk is, that alone should tell you how antiquated and esoteric the Bernoulli drive is today.  I get that his business card information may not have changed for some time, but surely someone, somewhere, at some point asked  “What is that?  Is that a hard drive? A CD case?  Baking chocolate?”  That’s where the story ends, when we couldn’t use his disk he left, confused, and never came back.  I assume he got into his DeLorean, cranked up his Buddy Holly 8-track, and went home to enjoy some surge and get caught up on Leave It To Beaver.

**Wynne #2 -  Eric opens a Factbook account** She later called for helping setting up a “Factbook” account but when the new person didn’t understand they asked her to come into the store for us to help her.  The new guy Eric was friendly and helpful.  He was not yet broken and also not yet experienced in making Wynne go away, which should have been a prerequisite skill at that job.   By the time I knew, it was too late.  I only learned what had become of him when I asked where Eric had been for over an hour, as I was supposed to be training him.  Wynne and Eric were still finding Wynne’s extended family, in-laws, and removed cousins when I called him on the P.A. saying he had a call holding for him.

“There’s no lines on hold, did they want me to call back?”

“There is no call Eric, I’m just giving you a break.  Go back to Wynne and tell her you are needed back here and to talk to someone else for help.”

“Oh.  Good idea.  Wait, how did you know her name was Wynne?”

**Fake ID’s**  Three kids from a fraternity came in around 10:00PM.  I didn’t know their exact ages, but it was evident later they were likely 18.  They also didn’t tell me outright they were from a frat, but it wasn’t hard to tell.  The store was only 4 blocks from greek row and these three were much like others of their kind we had seen before.  However, unlike the usual frat boys, these three were amazing quiet.  Suspiciously quiet, much like when seven year olds are playing and you hear a loud bang, followed by silence, followed by hurried whispering.  I tried to sneak up on them, but it was difficult in my work shoes.  I got close enough to see they had scanned in one of their drivers licenses and were attempting to Photoshop in pictures of the other two guys into it and change the birthdates.  One of them had a copy already printed… on regular weight paper…  cut out with scissors….  and the font was different on the birth date than the rest of the ID.  The real kicker though – In Washington state, to help identify age, under 21 years old gets a portrait layout on their driver’s license while over 21 get a landscape layout, and your portrait layout license always expires on your 21st birthday.  Not only were they using a portrait layout ID for their source, they didn’t correct the expiration date.  I did enough office and apartment keycards to know what it takes to fake an ID and while I won’t list the rules of how to fake an ID, they broke all of them.  They probably have no idea that I saved them a night in jail (or maybe juvie?) by telling them to leave and shred their copies.

If you want more of these let me know, I’ve got lots.  Wynne had plenty more including trying to laminate some pretty leaves she liked and breaking our laminater in the process.  A drunk who came in, sat at a computer chugged a four loko, pissed his pants while sitting in the chair and then just walked out laughing like he’d bested us somehow.  Lots of amateur porn, including a gay trio who had me help design an entire 12-month calendar of their own S&amp;M pictures.  I don't want to know why the three of them ordered 5 copies.  Also a woman who was banned from the store for threatening another patron by picking up her miniature poodle and lunging it at them like a weapon.  I’ll stop here for now because these just keep coming back like ‘nam.

1362956059.0,741,self.talesfromtechsupport,1a1pm9,The brightest CIO alive,923,182,166,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1a1pm9/the_brightest_cio_alive/,"I'm sure I'll post more stories of this guy's incompetence, but I figured I'd go ahead and share a few with you, since it's Sunday, I have some time, and I was reminded of this crap, so here we go.

I work at a highschool ""district"" (idk if district is the right word, but we have several campuses) and recently they hired a new CIO.  He frustrates me so much, I can't even form a decent story here.  I'll just give you examples.

1.  While giving a presentation going through documents in his Google Drive (in IE, opening each in a new window, not a tab), he couldn't figure out how to get from one document back to the drive view.  We told him to just close the foreground window.  He moves his mouse in circles looking around.  ""Just click the red x"" *moves mouse in more circles* ""In the top right corner of the screen"" *keeps moving mouse in circles in complete confusion*.  Finally I stand up and walk up to the screen and point to the elusive red x in the top right corner of the screen and he clicks it.  The presentation continues.

2.  Someone was giving us a formal overview of our Citrix environment (as basic as you can get), and at one point, he said ""and these published apps you see here are determined by the permissions we give the user"" to which our CIO asks, ""What is an 'app?'  Could you give me an example of what an 'app' is?""  After we realized he was serious, we told him that Microsoft Word would be an example of an 'app'.

3.  Back to Google Drive, in another presentation, we're going over a spreadsheet.  He decides he wants to center a column's text.  He clicks in the top cell, clicks the alignment down-arrow and selects center.  Then he clicks in the 2nd cell and clicks the alignment down-arrow, and selects center again.  He does this on a touchpad for about 20 rows with an entire audience watching and waiting.  Because god knows, you can't apply formatting to more than one cell at once.

4.  We have a very high end network with segregated ports and wifi (with repeaters) so we can control who can have internet access and who can access network devices and such.  Like you do.  We had a misconfigured WAP in one room at a campus and we we couldn't access it remotely, so we sent the guy on staff who handles that out there later in the week (he was busy) and our CIO asked ""why didn't you just send someone out and fix it?  I can go to Best Buy and buy a $30 Linksys Access Point and have wireless up and working wherever I want.""

5.  His trademark phrase is ""explain it to me like I'm a 5th grader.""

6.  During a presentation with the whole school, he tries to ask the speaker a question by walking up to the projector and talking into it.  When he couldn't figure out how to talk into the microphone next to it, he just started typing his question into the computer the guy was presenting on, hooked up to the projector.

7.  In our monitoring software, we had all the devices named as their device name as seen in DNS.  All very descriptive so anyone with a brain knew what they were looking at.  This doesn't apply to him.  He had us change the name of every device in the system to an English type description.  Now we have to drill into every device to find its IP / name so we can do something if anything goes down.  He also had us change the way it displayed how much RAM / disk space / CPU is being used into gauges (like a speedometer) from 1% - 100% instead of giving us actual numbers like 3.1GB / 64GB RAM used because ""it's easier for him to understand when it's pictures.""

8.  Someone just got promoted to Help Desk Supervisor and he sent out an email to everyone in the address book informing them that this had happened.  Except he misspelled the guy's name.  Then replied to all and said ""his name is actually spelled &lt;correct spelling.  my bad.""  He's foreign.  ""my bad"" isn't in his vocabulary (at least we've never heard him say it).  We know this came from him though.  It's crazy.

We all just expect this behavior now and nobody corrects it. Okay, this is getting too long.  Turns out I could go on forever, but whenever I tell someone a story about him and they are like ""you're exaggerating, nobody could do that.  My grandparents are smarter than that,"" I revert to these examples.

I told her it was spam and possibly a virus, and to delete it immediately. She didn't believe me and didn't want to ignore the email.

A woman came up to me and asked if I'd please come help her, then beckoned me back to her computer. I followed her to where she was logged in and had only Word open. She pointed at the screen and said, ""What I wanted to copy disappeared."" 

The Word document was completely blank. Obviously *something* had disappeared.

""Can you show me?"" I asked. After sitting back down at the computer, she right-clicked to bring up the little menu and pointed at where ""Paste Options"" was, grayed out.

""See? It disappeared,"" she said. This is a technical college (our largest program is auto repair), so many of our students aren't technologically savvy, so I wasn't really annoyed--this kind of thing happens all the time.

""Oh, when that happens, it means whatever you were trying to copy didn't get copied for some reason. You'll need to go back to where you were copying from and try again.""

She stared at me. I stared at her. She said, ""I was just trying to copy."" She stared some more.

""Yes, I understand, but when you hit copy before, it didn't register for some reason, so you'll need to do it again."" She stared at me.

""Oh,"" she said, continuing with the staring.

""So you'll need to go back to whatever you were trying to copy and try to copy it again."" I stood (and she sat) in silence while we both pondered the endless complexities of life. At least I was; she could have been pondering the price of tea in China for all I know.

""Oh, so I need to find that webpage again,"" she said finally. I nodded. She opened up Internet Explorer and went to town. I went back to my desk wondering if I was speaking Swahili.

""You got a phone that gets wi-fi?""

Now, I know this dude is far from illiterate, but he really blew me away with how in-depth he explained the issue.

He said something like this:

""Yeah, this thing doesn't start up. It gets to the login screen, and I get an error message saying 'C:\Windows\System32\suck\it\trebek\cantrememberfilename.dll Bad Image'. I googled the issue, and it comes up as a driver problem. I can boot into safe mode just fine, but regular startup doesn't work.""

Two: He actually took the time to google the problem! My brain exploded at this point.

All geared up to help this saint of a user, I step into action. I figure that a simple sfc /scannow should work. I ask to boot into safe mode with command prompt.

Error on startup.

At this point, I realize this thing might be dead. I ask him to put in a recovery disc.
One problem: There is no disc drive.

No recovery disc option like that? Forget it. I will just install Ubuntu through USB for him. I am not going to break my back over a decade-old OS. I just want to check the BIOS first to see if there is USB boot capability in the boot priority menu.

I guide him through the steps, and he says that there is only a vague ""primary boot device"" listing in the boot priorities.

I explain my plans, show him the OS, give him plenty of info in order for him to OK my suggestion, and he accepts. I tell him that I will go over to his place to set it up the next day.

-The next day-
I call him:

**ME:** ""Hey. I am heading over to your place right now to help install the OS.""

**HIM:** ""Oh, I already did that. I figured that i could try to do the booting from USB thing like you said, and it worked.""

**ME:** ""Well done. Do you want me to give you a quick tour of the OS? I am positive that you're lost.""

**HIM:** ""I am totally lost on this thing. Please do.""

This man showed some serious initiative. As much as I don't condone diving headfirst into something like an OS install, there was nothing to lose, and he learned something from it.

On inspection, I found the connection to be up and running. I could telnet to their router, and could even see traffic passing through it. After talking to their IT manager, he told me they seemed to be unable to browse to anything for 10 mins, then it'd work for 5 mins, then off again.

Should I mention that their LAN IP addressing is using public IP addresses that don't belong to them and are NAT'd? Yeah. Red flag there.

Our network engineers could find nothing wrong, and I received a lovely missive from a California University telling me that The Customer's real public IP was trying to hack into remote desktop servers. Lovely.

I tell The IT Manager. First he demands I tell him how to find the virus (wut?). I suggest he uses his antivirus, then things like netstat from a DOS prompt etc. He calls back an hour later, absolutely furious. He insists there's no virus on their network. He insists everything is perfect. He is absolutely adamant that it's the broadband line.

We send out a field engineer. What does he find? 

* Two Windows 2003 servers riddled with viruses (running DHCP, DNS and basic file sharing - no domain or permissions).
* Two Linux servers for which noone has passwords and noone even knows what they're doing.
* About 40 workstations, all running pirated copies of XP, also jammed with nastiness. Everyone is full admin on their local machines AND all the network shares.
* A hodge-podge of network gear by different vendors, none of which they have passwords for.
* No backups of any of their data (not that they didn't have an online backup account provided by us or anything... The IT Manager just never bothered to set it up).
* No antivirus installed on any machine. We found The IT Manager wandering around with a USB stick with a portable copy of AVG Free Personal edition on it, plugging it into each machine one at a time and making a fantastic effort of spreading around the viruses even more while fixing nothing.

Unplugging their shithole of a network from the router results in a perfect, constant 40Mbps.

It's now Wednesday. We've had an engineer on site for two days straight trying to fix their broken computers and network. Our poor field engineer had no idea where to start, and contemplated telling them to set fire to the place and take the insurance money, as literally every single thing he looks at to do with the computers or network is either somehow broken, misconfigured, or pirated. Their IT manager has gone AWOL (didn't show up for work today), and we're quoting them for a full service contract.

I had printed roughly 100 pages, and posted them all around town and some neighboring towns.

About a week went by before I received my first call for a job. It was from a guy who wanted to have his sons computer repaired. And I knew that address very well as it was right by my old highschool, the rich side of town.

Gorgeous house, nice family, awfully spoiled 12 year old brat. The usual, right?

I get to his room, and see the Alienware. It booted windows xp, so there were no major issues, it ended up being malware, no biggie. I let his parents know that I charged $20 for the virus removal and $20 for the visit. They gave me $80, awesome. I go back in to take care of business.

I was done within 10 minutes, the kids internet was back up, all was fine. I really felt like giving his dad a little bonus for the awesome tip, so I offered to install some free virusprotection, clean the hdd/registery, etc..  He happily agreed, and decided to sit on the bed next to me as I did this.

At this point, his son was pretty much demanding that I leave, his dad kept asking why, and all he kept repeating was that I fixed it and it's done. His dad insisted that I stay to install the antivirus so it doesn't happen again. As awkward as a spot this put me in, It wasn't the kid who was paying me.

I grabbed a free firewall + antivirus, and it defaulted to the download directory: ""DL"" on his C: drive. 

As I am about to open this drive, the kid spontaneously stomps out of his room.

I open it up,and I knew exactly what to expect, but it was *oh so much more*.

In this coveted ""DL"" folder. This kid had more porn in there than my friends and I combined. Keep in mind, he is 12 years old. Pictures, Videos, gang bangs, softcore, you name it, he had it.

How did I know all of this? Because his thumbnails were set to large display, and penises, vaginas and facials were all over the screen. his dad had the palest look on his face. I'm pretty sure they were a conservative family, with conservative values. I'm also pretty sure he didn't know wth was going on in his childs private life.

Now im sitting here feeling awkward as all hell, and it isn't even the half of it. There was another folder inside ""DL"" that was named Stepmom. I guess this kid wasn't worried about protecting his private stash, at all.

His dad tried to gather his composure, and asks me to ""look at stepmom"". I ask him that maybe It would be best if I were to leave, but he pleaded with me to stay because he didn't know how to use a computer at all.

TBH, my curiosity level was at around +11, because his stepmom, the woman in yoga pants down stairs.. Holy jebus.

I open it up and it was riddled with pictures and videos of her in the garden, pool, was a video of her changing clothes, etc.

He steps away for a minute. I am getting ready to leave cause I know this ain't going to be pretty. But I guess it was the fatehrs intention to ridicule his son for punishment, because I heard a bunch of yelling followed by the father dragging the boy into the room and his step mom following behind.

They had me go through all of his porn (Like open it up and play some of it) and then go through some of her pics, which the look of awkward on her face surpassed mine by maybe.. 10fold?

At this point I realized that the father was probably a little crazy, extremely persistent, and very pissed off. I almost felt like a hostage at this point, it was actually pretty wild.

I offered to delete everything and finish the installation, he agreed, and I got the hell outof there within about 5 minutes.

One of the most awkward situations I'd ever been in, but pretty damn funny as I look back.

Now read on...
   
  
   
So there I was in my job with much free time on my hands, and I'd used it to compile, amongst other things, a database of various user and system issues and errors, along with their associated fixes. Because I am a neat and industrious little bunny like that, and also a little picky when it comes to quality documentation.

Now, I had access to certain records by the nature of my position, and I thought it might be an interesting venture to make a list of all the tech people at all the offices in my state, along with their email addresses. You never know when you might need such a thing, after all. So this I do. These techs, being much like myself, were generally the only person in their respective offices who knew which end of a computer was up. None of us were in an office team; we were all singletons.
   
  
   
And as things go, and by and by, I find myself sending the occasional email to some of the techs at the nearby offices, usually on the occasion that a user transferred over and wanted a copy of their profile to go with them. Fairly straightforward. And as things would have it, we would sometimes chat about various problems we'd run into and swap or brainstorm solutions.

Given that I was overseeing one of the larger offices, and given that I had more than my fair share of free time to devote to tracking down fascinating little bugs and weirdnesses, it so turned out that out of those of us who bothered to keep records on such things, I had compiled the largest and most comprehensive database in only a few months. Not terribly surprising, perhaps.

Only once I innocently revealed the existence of said database during an email exchange, one of the other techs wanted a look at it. And being as how I didn't have any reason not to, I sent it to him. And in the course of things, he told one of the other techs, who also wanted a copy. And so on.

Eventually, a large proportion of the office techs in the state emailed me, and asked for this database, and also for any updates. And I was happy to share. Only I thought, as one tends to do, ""What if someone at one of the other sites has knowledge that isn't in the database? Wouldn't it be more useful being shared too?"" So I set up a little mailing list with all these techs in it, and mailed them updates, and asked for their input. And lo and behold, most of them hit Reply-All, and we had ourselves the beginnings of a forum.
   
  
   
Now, this wasn't a problem in and of itself. Although given that we'd mostly never actually physically met each other, and in general we'd had no other techs to talk to since we'd started the job, the floodgates kinda opened. There was a lot of back-and-forth, and, well, some techs were waxing loquacious and others were kinda getting lost in the background. Complaints were made. And then I got An Email.

This particular Email (with the capital letter) came from the state helpdesk, a bunch of techs in the state HQ we occasionally passed jobs to if they affected multiple offices. It said, in no uncertain terms, that they considered themselves the only source of information allowed to techs in less exalted offices, and that what I was doing was Propogating Potentially Dangerous Information to Largely Untrained Personnel.
   
  
   
I... may have made the mistake, being high on youth and bravado at the time, of welcoming them to OUR discussion which, by the way, had provided more training and solutions to the office techs than the initial single day of training at state HQ and subsequent deafening silence ever had. Oh, and I'd also based it off a similar setup which was being run very successfully in the next state over to great acclaim. Oh, and our FPOC issue resolution statewide was significantly up, meaning that we really didn't actually NEED the state helpdesk for anything any more.
   
  
   
Yeah.
   
  
   
Things... did not go well after that. Management became involved, and I was banned from emailing any of the other technicians (over their protests) for anything other than my actual duties. Some of us set up mailing lists using external email addresses to keep in touch, but it petered out after a while.

It wasn't until I was transferred out of that position entirely that I later found out the resolution and training improvements had not gone unnoticed, the State helpdesk had been severely reduced in both capacity and number of stuck-up snobs, and that office techs now got to have one day every six months where they could physically all get together, and shoot the breeze in the same place: the now-empty section at the State HQ.
   
  
   
Then there was the time I broke national security in thirty seconds flat...
   
  
   
...but that's another story.

He had been writing a book on the topic of history using a word processing program on a computer (or a *magic-think-box* to use the technical term) but for YEARS was phoning me to ask how to put something in italics. He started writing it in about 1999. 
Anyway, he finished his book in around 2006 and was preparing it for submission to publishers.    
This lead to an epic journey of technophobic wrangling to cope with the submission procedures for the various publishing houses.    
1) He posted his final draft to several places on floppy disc. In 2007. When he received replies from a few requesting that he submit via email, he responded with ""But you asked for electronic format?""    
2) Posting the entire thing into (several) emails and sending it that way.    
3) This one is my favorite.    
*Slight aside for a back story. After a few years, I stopped giving tech support. In the best tradition of tech support, any assistance I gave was met with suspicion and a lack of any ability or will to follow instructions. After which comes ""But you did something / told me to do something 12 months ago and now it's broken and this is your fault!"" So I was no longer having anything to do with it. Any issues he has had since 2002, he's worked through on his own using books or the help function on the computer or trial and error.*    
       
And back to 3)    
He was asked to submit his book in pdf format via email. After a long time, he:    
- worked out what a pdf was...    
- found one online he could edit...    
- downloaded it...     
- deleted its content and then...    
- copy/pasted his book into the pdf file.        
    
After all this, he was happily browsing the pdf of his book when he noticed that another person's name, email address and other details were in the footer of the pdf.    
Instant freakout. He's been hacked. *Someone is trying to steal his book!*    
He called me, I referred him to the ""Calm down and Google it"" clause of our father/daughter relationship.    
Instead, he called the cybercrime division of the police. According to the law here, all cybercrime has to be investigated. Hacking, it's srs bisness, y'know.    
So out comes a cybercrime police person, takes down all the information and investigates my father's pc.    
Because he downloaded a pdf and edited it, the 'hackers' information was actually the copyright information of the person who owned the original pdf.    
So, technically, kinda, sorta, it was my Dad who was committing the 'cybercrime'.    
My mother says that the policeman came out of the office, went to his car, laughed for about 10 minutes and then came back in and explained things to my father. Then showed him how to save things as pdf in Word.    
My father says that he had a lucky escape and that the hackers are everywhere and won't hesitate to steal someone's book, right off their pc. He's still editing that pdf instead of saving as pdf from Word.

tl;dr - Hackers steal magic beans, use them to create super-collider.

I brushed off most things, people are stupid, that's what kept me going, but today, today sucked. The day started normally, browsed reddit for a while, read some manga, had breakfast at the office, but a call would end my patience. Anyways, got a call because the wifi wasn't working in their office, before I went there, my boss called me in his office to explain the situation, even though I had gone there multiple times.

He screamed at me for not being able to fix it, I took it like a man, and said nothing. When I got there, the customer screamed at me for not fixing it, even though it was working fine yesterday, and the people there were stupid as fuck, because they have 2 connections, 1 router that's not connected to anything and is used as a lan/network utility, and a router that has internet and wifi on it. Turns out, the fuckwits were connecting to the router without connection to the internet.

Just as I finished explaining that to them, my boss came, for god knows what, and yelled at me because I didn't explain to them which router they should use wifi from. Again, I said nothing, but the last drop was when, for some reason, the lan cable going to a computer was not working well and had to be cut and replaced; my boss proceded to check and said it wasn't the problem but the computer itself, I said fuck it, and cut the cable. It worked, he screamed at me, in front of the customers about how I should follow his orders since he's my boss and he knows more than me.

When we got to the office, I lost my shit and told him I quit, he said I was too good of an employee to let go and offered me a raise, told him to fuck off, and am starting a new job selling buttons, making almost triple the money.

1370998650.0,722,self.talesfromtechsupport,1g5wny,Security and Hubris: Or what drove me to perform my first firing,861,139,385,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1g5wny/security_and_hubris_or_what_drove_me_to_perform/,"**Background:** I am a very high-level IT person at a major defense company, about a month ago I performed my first firing.

**The Story:** About a year ago we finished our shiny new datacenter and with it, we got some shiny new employees.  One of the new ones, who we will call 'Steve' was a recent college graduate, with a bachelors in Computer Science and specialized in security.  I put him on tier-1 help-desk for a few months while he proved himself, but 3 months ago I decided he was ready for the major league and promoted him to level-1 server administration (Deploying new servers, basic troubleshooting, etc).   I supervise his work for a month and only experiences a few missteps, but nothing major.

Now in our datacenter we run everything on Virtual Machines and we have a couple templates for the virtual hardware ranging from our small (1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM, 4 GB for OS and a 40 GB iSCSI disk)for web servers all the way up to our SQL-XL template (16 vCPU, 32 GB RAM, 128 GB disk for OS and 4 TB of iSCSI).  The servers are usually set up in groups of 8 and put behind the load balancer.

For the operating systems, we have a short list of ones that we will support: OpenBSD (Latest stable), Windows Server 2008 R2 or a very-customized linux kernel.

But I digress, back to the story.

Steve gets a couple tickets for Web servers, an application server or two, just basic stuff.  He ended up taking about twice as long on each than I expected it to take so I sit down with him and ask what's up with that, he replies that he is working as fast as Linux is allowing him (what with reboots, etc), turns out he was installing some weird -buntu distribution in the datacenter as opposed to any of our supported OSes.  I immediately tell him to stop and that now he has to go and migrate all the machines to one of our supported OSes.

He gets it all migrated back over the next week and I think all is good, he got an appropriate punishment and now he will follow the rules, or so I thought.

But I was wrong.

The following week I get a report that a server that Steve set up was running slow.  I log into to check on the cluster to see its usage; CPU, Mem and disk are at 100%.  Something isn't right.  I expand the server node and rather than see 8 small servers I see one large one.  I try to log on, but its rejecting my smart card and manually entering my credentials doesn't seem to work either, weird.  I get Steve into my office he sits down, pulls out his laptop and sets it down on my desk.

Once logged in he fires up PuTTY and what he types next made me go white and then dark red in the face:
 &lt;Servername&gt;.&lt;ourdomain&gt;.com and enter.  A login banner pops up, he then proceeds to log into using **root** and a password that looked to be about 5 characters long.

I am pissed at this point (It is very hard to get me to be angry, in fact I am normally accused of being high all the time because I am so calm).

**Me:** Why are you able to log into that machine, you should never be able to SSH into a machine from the internet.  Tell me that you at least used a white list for the IPs allowed to connect to this machine.

**Steve:** Don't worry, its Linux, no one can hack into it!

I pull his laptop over to me and look at the server he just logged into.  Yep, its that stupid distribution he was using earlier, not connected to LDAP, no firewall enabled...  Looking at the output of ps and see a single process using as many resources it can.  The process was a Java applet, odd since we don't use Java here...  No logs on the system (all were cleared and syslog turned off).  Dumping the list of active connections on the machine and I see a whole mess of connections to single machine over port 80 and a single connection to an odd IP over an odd port.  I called up the end user of the server and they have no idea what any of this was so I turned off the machine and submitted it to our Anti-Malware team to look at it.

I kept Steve in my office while the anti-malware team looked at the machine.  A few minutes later I get a call from them saying that apparently a foreign nation's cyber warfare group managed to SSH into the machine and install some sort of DDoS tool (root password was apparently set to 'access').   At this point I get on the phone with Security and have a guard come up to my office.  Then called HR to start some paperwork.

From what he did, Steve ended up becoming guilty of nearly a dozen violations of FIPS and other security standards and requirements.  And because of these violations he is facing jail time.  Even more if it determined that he colluded with the foreign aggressor.

**TLDR;**  self pro-claimed security believes that Linux is invincible even when you set a crappy password and disable every bit of security afforded to them and gets arrested for his disregard for policy.

A few days ago, the HR department requests to borrow a laptop. Fairly standard as they regularly attend job fairs or other HR related symposiums.

When the laptop is ready, they also request a printer. We're thinking: here we go again with the personal printer crap. Anyway, we dust an old laserprinter off and deliver it to HR.

Printer returns. ""It's too big!"".
We happen to have a smaller one in stock (don't even ask, it's ridiculous here). We send it, or actually bring it, out.

HR: ""No, it won't work with that one.""
We're stumped and talk to our manager about the issue. He's puzzled too.
He then calls the HR director and asks what the problem is.
HR: ""We need a mobile printer.""
IT: ""Well, uh, why?""
HR: ""We're going on a trip to *insert southern Europe country* to recruit workers. We need to print there.""
IT: ""Can't you just buy a printer once you're there. In fact, I have a holiday home there and the tech stores are better/cheaper than here.""
HR: ""No, not an option. We will be travelling to other countries too.""

Long story short: my colleague is sent to the nearest mall to buy the smallest inkjet printer he can find. Because ""it has to fit in the overhead compartment of the plane"".

I won't even bother trying to explain why this is a bad idea.

*Pete was an older gentleman I worked with. He talked his way into a management position by hypnotizing the company owner with jargon and buzzwords. ""Java"", ""Drupal"", and ""automagically"" were the core of his vocabulary. Pete wasn't with us for very long, but he will always be infamous.    
These are The Adventures of Pete, and I assure you they are mostly true.*

##\#003 What Budget?

It was an average Monday morning at the office: production was behind schedule, I was being interrupted every five minutes with technical support calls, and the office manager was running around trying to figure out who spent $20,000 from the company account over the weekend. Nobody knew anything about it.

The FedEx truck arrived right on schedule with the deliveries that had accumulated over the weekend, and the ladies in production sat down to sort the packages. Most were supplies for their shelves, anyway. Of course, the ladies did what they always do when they were confused — they called me.    
""Know what these are?"" one asked as I entered the room. Both were staring intently at their computer monitors, eyes fixed on whatever block-shattering game they played all day.

All it took was a brief glance for me to see what they were asking about. Five enormous boxes marked ""DELL"" sat in the corner, nearly piled up to the ceiling. I shook my head.    
""Nope,"" I replied. ""I haven't ordered anything."" I returned to my desk; I had work to do.

Pete started to get anxious after lunch, pacing laps around the office and muttering ""Supposed to be here by now."" under his breath. Several people asked what he was going on about, but he paid no attention. It wasn't until his fourth or fifth lap that he stopped by production and found what he was looking for.

It was impossible for Pete to sneak the packages past the office manager's door, and it was equally impossible for the office manager to not put the pieces together. Thousands of dollars were missing and Pete was cheerfully wheeling giant boxes of computer equipment through the office.    
""What are those?"" he asked as Pete pushed his cart past for the third time.    
""My development servers,"" Pete replied.    
""Where did they come from?""    
""I ordered them Friday evening.""    
The office manager was clearly becoming agitated. ""How much did you spend on them?""    
""Just $20,000, but it's from my budget account."" Pete answered.    
""What budget?""    
Pete ignored him and continued to push his little cart.

It took the rest of the day to piece the story together. Faced with the reality that such powerful computers existed in the server room, behind a door to which Pete didn't have a key, he took it upon himself to spend more than two-thirds of my annual salary to ensure his office was the most well-equipped in the building. He assured the owner that it was absolutely necessary for him to have full control over his development environment, and for his development server to dwarf every piece of hardware in the server room combined.

This is actually a story from my Dad, as I am too young to have a job, let alone one in tech support. I will refer to my dad as B. This happened years ago.

B was working normally as a sysadmin at $company, when his boss walks to his office and tells him that a potentially crippling backdoor has been found in the server software that their company uses. He gives B a CD from a stack that he's carrying, and says to start fixing the servers by running the CD in each one (This was happening all around the world at different $company locations). He decides to put the CD in his computer and see what was on it.

At the end of that day, everyone gathers around, his coworkers talking about the servers, ""Yeah I fixed 264 servers today"" ""Really? I only got about 200"". Stuff like that. They say, ""So B, how many did you fix?"" He replies that he didn't fix any, and they get kind of mad, saying that he wasn't helping.

The next day, B goes back into his office, and starts work on his computer, like yesterday. At the end of the day, he still hasn't fixed any servers. This continues for a few more days, people getting more and more mad at him. Finally, his boss enters his office, and says something along the lines of, ""Hey B, you need to help fix these servers, or we'll need to do something about you not helping."" He says ok, and keeps doing what he's doing. He finishes his project that day, and at the end of the day, people are still talking about how much they did. ""I got 368 servers done, how about you B?"" B replies, ""I did over 127,000, and they're all done, even the ones in India and around the world. Everyone looks at him crazily, and he explains that he used the backdoor to fix the backdoor. He gets a raise, his boss says sorry, etc.

The last two weeks have been IT hell. Why? Because a lot of stores do not use all their registers all the time, until holiday weekends. So they've been wanting everything repaired for their deadhead registers (the one they swap faulty equipment for when they cannot afford replacing it), wanted every nuisance on every register fixed, and that's on top of the weekly report, password, and derp issues.

Our phone and online queues have been maxed every day the last two weeks. We pretty much have been multitasking as we work on multiple stores, do maintenance on systems, monitor updates, and take calls. As such we've been a little short on patience.

So I get one of our little poor grocery stores. She is not able to log in to the store's Electronic Payments system.

User: I'm getting the account is inactive message. We've been getting it for two days.

Me: *Check history* Are you sure no one else changed the password?

User: No.

Me: I'm going to need you to call your Store Manager and verify the password.

User: I don't need to. We keep it on a piece of paper taped to the back of the keyboard. We both were here yesterday trying to put it in. But we keep getting this message

Me: *look up account in system* You've locked yourself out. It will take another ten minutes before it unlocks. I will call you back and we'll look at changing the password.

User: Okay.

I hang up and get stuck on my next call for almost 20 minutes. I call store back and again log in to the Electronic Payment password reset site.

User: Hello?

Me: Hi, it's IT. I'm ready to reset that password for you.

User: I already tried, it didn't work.

Me: That's okay, I just need you to close all browsers on your computer.

User: So just restart it?

Me: No, just close the IE browsers. It should bring you back to just a plain &lt;Logo&gt; screen.

User: Okay.

*Open store's account and reset password* As I try to save it gives me an error ""something was recently changed on this account."" Refresh and what do I find... it's locked again.

Me: Did you close the browsers?

User: I tried the password again, it's saying I'm locked out.

Me: All you needed to do was close the browsers. You've locked the account again. I cannot reset the password until it unlocks again. **The next tier can override a locked account, but I can't and if I send it to them I'd get chewed out for not doing everything in my ability before escalating it - especially if I just need to wait 10-15 minutes**

User: Should I just restart the computer?

Me: Yes, when it comes back up just leave it. I will call you back and then we will see about fixing this.

*Angry, but too busy to do anything about it, I hang up and take the next two calls - approximately 15 minutes*

User: Hello?

Me: IT again, is the computer up?

User: I tried the password again, it still didn't work.

Me: Stop. I reset the password. Please close all programs on the computer. 

User: Do you want me to restart it?

Me: No just close the one with the log in page. Press the ""x"" in the top right corner.

User: Okay, I see the &lt;logo&gt; screen.

Me: Good, open up IE.

User: It's at &lt;logo&gt; page.

Me: Go to Electronic Payments page.

User: It wants my user name and password.

Me: Put in your username.

User: Do I put in the old password?

Me: No put in &lt;new password&gt;.

User: It didn't work. It says password expired.

Me: Does it say old password, new password, confirm password?

User: Yes.

Me: Put &lt;new password&gt; in the first box. The put &lt;newer password&gt; in the next and the last boxes.

User: Oh, it let me in. So the password is &lt;new password&gt;?

Me: No, it's &lt;newer password&gt;. Please write it down.

User: Oh I will.

Me: Ma'am I cannot let you off the phone until you write it down and put it on the back of the keyboard to replace the old password that you have attached there.

User: What should I do with the old one?

Me: Put it in the trash.

User: okay. And just tape this new one on.

Me: Yes exactly where the old one was.

User: There it's taped on the back of the keyboard.

Now huge alarm bells are going off in my head when I get this machine, but it boots up fine and everything's hunky dory. I mean... the keyboard's crazy sticky, but the gentleman claims that he uses a usb keyboard anyway. Confusing. So I flip the machine over to take a look at this ""melted memory.""

I pop the cover off of the memory ports and take a look. I IMMEDIATELY spot a massive problem, reel away from the computer, and try very, very hard not to burst out laughing. I walk the gentleman's laptop over to him and ask a few questions about what exactly he wants done. I try to be vague and open ended, but it turns out that he just wants a few of the stains on the inside of the case case to be cleaned up (likely from whatever it was that made the keyboard sticky). Whatever, fine, mystery gunk doesn't gross me out like it does most people. I'll slap on a pair of gloves and put some elbow grease into it momentarily.

First though... I'm going to have to charge him for an internal component install. I had to crack the case, it's company policy, no way around it my manager was standing right there. Of course, now that he's agreed to pay the internal component install...

""Since I'm in here already, would you like me to go ahead and install this RAM correctly? It's in backwards. No, yes, really. Backwards. Even you can tell, if you look at it closely. That little gold part is supposed to be in that little black part.""

He thanks me very much for pointing that out, and yes he would like me to do that. I pull out the antistatic pad and wristband, flip the memory around, and seat it properly. Then, because I'm slightly prescient and know exactly what's going to happen, I boot the computer back up.

Nothing. Black screen.

Of course.

The tech that was monkeying around in the machine last time got a bad memory stick. Rather than calling it in, filling out the paperwork, and taking a new working stick out to my client, the lazy asshole FLIPPED THAT SHIT AROUND AND LEFT IT IN THERE.

I ended it with ""You can either take a partial refund, minus your nonrefundable deposit...or just be patient and understand that the weather is uncontrollable.

$me1 = Middle Eastern Country 1 - We here in the US have an off and on relationship with them, not everyone likes them and we probably wouldn't have them over for a 4th of July picnic.


$me2 = Middle Eastern Country 2 - We here in the US are pretty cool with them.


This story also involves the UK but it's easier just to write UK, and I'm lazy.


You also need to know that my boss and owner was from $me1 and his family was/is very well connected in the $me1 govt.  He also was (by nature of his culture) very very secretive.


So here we go...



The company I was working for at the time had a lot of dealings with overseas companies, especially in the Middle East.  It ranged from everything from general support, email, websites, custom apps, and hosted desktops.  We also did work for various gov't entities in the middle east as well, enough things that I would always be ""randomly selected"" for enhanced screenings at the airport.



One thing you have to keep in mind while reading this is that alot of these companies and even some of the gov't bodies do not have alot of money or they are unable to run mainstream software.  So as such we used ALOT of Linux and open source solutions for them.



We were asked by $me1 to migrate their email from a software called scalix to Zimbra.  So go I go about to determine the scope of the project and everything seemed pretty normal except for the fact that ALL of the email existed on the scalix website.  No pst files and nothing to import, all they used was POP and IMAP.  I decided that I would use a tool on a small linux box to basically read and write using IMAP the mail from scalix to zimbra.



Here is where I made my first mistake....for some reason (and to this day I don't know why) I created a dummy account on the zimbra system with MY NAME not a generic user like ""import"".  



Here was my second mistake...I didn't know enough about the program or IMAP on scalix/zimbra to know that it would migrate the emails over as unread and then if they were indeed read would then mark them unread.  (so in essence it would ""read"" the emails)



So the first user I start with is the CEO since he has the largest mailbox and needs his emails first.  I start my program and watch as the emails fly by hundreds at a time.  I think all is well and goto lunch.



I come back from lunch and my boss runs in my office pale as a ghost (and he's from the Middle East) and says something I will never forget as long as I live....



**""The office of the finance minister for the country of $me2 is on the phone and wants to talk to you""**



I found out then that the company we were contracted with was basically the central bank of $me1, and the CEO of course had dealings with gov't offices all over the region.



Here is what happened....When the emails were imported into the import account (my FULL NAME) they were marked read, this caused the system to send read receipts out, hundreds if not thousands of them...to the entire Middle East.  Basically anyone that had ever sent him an email that needed a read receipt got one with my VERY western name on it.  It literally set off alarms all over the region because everyone assumed the CEO's email had been compromised and all that information was out there.  Including not only financials of the country, but what countries gave them money and travel plans for visiting dignitaries.  That's when Tony Blair's office called, because he was scheduled to visit the region and they were concerned that someone had seen the schedule (for security reasons)



It took at least 5 hours to get everyone that contacted us settled down, my boss had a good laugh after we learned no real dmg was done.  He told me that I was probably never going to be able to fly again and to watch out on my way home for black ford expeditions following me.



Just so happens on my way home that night as I turned into my neighborhood I hit a checkpoint where they were verifying insurance, the odd part is that I lived at that time on a cul-de-sac.  By this time I was so wrecked from the day that I went straight home and went directly to bed.



**TLDR; I think I just caused an international incident.**

Most of the time, these were the customer's first computers.  Nearly all of them ran Windows ME (ugh).

I received a call from a woman who had just rented one such computer.  She was calling because her CD drive refused to eject the disk she had put in.

Me: *redacted* support, Thndrchld speaking, how can I help?

C:  My computer won't spit out the disk I put in.

Me:  What steps have you taken?

C:  I haven't done anything.

Me:  Ok, to the bottom right of where you put in the cd, there should be a button.  Push it.

C: ...  Nothing happened.

Me:  You pushed the button?

C: yes.

Me: Ok, on your screen, double-click on 'My Computer'

C:  what's that mean?

Me:  Use your mouse.  Point at the little picture that says 'My computer', then press the left button twice in quick succession.

C:  A box popped up.

Me:  Ok, now find the picture of a CD, and click on it with the right button.

C:  Another box popped up.

Me:  Click 'Eject'

C:  HOLY CRAP, IT OPENS! (Me (thinking):  Red flag)   There's no CD in it.

Me: Ok, now, I need you to turn off your computer.  Now, unplug all of the wires and cables in the back of it.

C: All of them?

Me: Yes. All of them.

C:  (Some clattering and grunting)  Ok.  Done.

Me:  Now, pick up your computer, point the front of the computer towards the ground, and shake it.

C:  Ok!  CD came out.

She had slid the CD into a crack between the CD drive and the bezel.  Luckily, as I hoped, the CD didn't fall down into the case, but was still dangling there between the system components.

One day my ""aunt"" calls me up asking if I could help her because her internet just stopped working out of no where and was wondering if she had a virus. So I tell her I would be over some time in that week.

I make the 45 minute drive to East Bumfuck and was greeted at the door. She shows me to her computer area and I take a seat.

Troubleshooting time. I open up firefox and as expected no connection. Ok. Next step. I pull up a command prompt and check IPconfig. No DHCP address. Fine. I run a /renew but DHCP isn't responding. Hmm. I ask her where she keeps her modem/router... 

Her: ""I don't know..."" 

I explain: ""Little boxy thing usually black, maybe has antennae...""

Me: ""What's your phone service/tv service?""

Her: ""Oh, [Communications Company]""

Me: ""And do you have an internet subscription?""

Her: ""Ah, this is how we get internet...""

She points out a grey USB cord coming out of the laptop and I proceed to follow it...

It was at least 50 ft. (15 m) long, no joking, I have no idea how I didn't see it before.

Her: ""We get internet from our neighbors I think.""

Me: ""Well it looks like they either put a password, hid their SSID, or moved their router elsewhere in the house where you cant reach it""

Her: ""Oh can you fix that?""

Me: ""Well if you want you can call them and tell them that they need to move their router closer to your house so that you can steal their service... Im not going to do that for you though""

1339248541.0,714,self.talesfromtechsupport,ut4q9,Not allowed to quit.,895,181,123,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ut4q9/not_allowed_to_quit/,"This didn't happen to me, thankfully, but I got a little involved in it.  Started a week ago, we got a new lady working in our department, I'll call her Maria.  Maria had this look on her face when she came in, the kind you see on a dog when it's taken from an abusive home.  

After a day she was smiling like she'd won the lottery, which I thought wasn't possible in my company.  So a day or two after she starts, I get a call from another lady asking to speak to Maria.  Maria was no where in sight, so I just asked if I could help her out.  She very bluntly told me to have her call Jane ASAP, then hung up.  Being use to rude user, I didn't think much of it, so I just emailed Maria and didn't think of it after that.  A short time later, Maria came back and asked me questions about Jane, she had that abused dog look again.  I told her about the call I took, and didn't have any information beyond that.  She thanked me, and went back to her desk.  I found out yesterday that all of this came to a head.  

Turns out Jane was calling into our office demanding to speak to Maria, and on one occasion got through, where Maria told her she was going to call the police.  Maria explained that Jane was her former supervisor in her previous job, who had made their environment so hostile that people were quitting left and right.  Seems the last company Maria worked at was family owned, and Jane was part of the Family.  Jane apparently needed a job and they put her in charge of the help desk, where she was going to ""Motivate"" the techs into shape.  

She imposed crazy rules, like no talking in the break room, and a demerit system for accumulated infractions.  People decided they would be better off and just started quitting.  Those professional enough to turn in a two week notice were worked like dogs with all kinds of projects.  Maria was one of their more senior people, and found that her work load multiplied every time someone quit.  When Jane started to demand she put in long days to resolve issues, but denied all raises in their department, Maria had enough and just quit.  Then Maria came to work for us, and the less hostile environment was like a breath of fresh air.  

Apparently the loss was affecting Janes department, and she kept calling into our office trying to get Maria to take on some projects even though she'd quit.  One of my co-workers took a call from Jane, and he told me that Jane was pretty nasty, to the point of threatening to come down and find Maria herself.  She said that Marias resignation wasn't acceptable, and that our company wasn't going to be allowed to steel her employees without catching hell.  

I was told that the matter was taken up by the police, and some lawyers who apparently know about Janes ""Family"" and were happy to take care of the problem.  I've had some bad employers before, but I can't even imagine what Jane put Maria through.  I find that Maria knows her stuff, and is capable of running her own team if she wanted to, she can handle most any issue without any expense in energy.  I've seen her handle network issues like they were nothing and juggle tickets like a circus clown juggles balls.  She's confident and skilled better than most people I know.  So I wonder what Jane put her through to make her so scared every time she called.

**TL;DR** Boss from Hell drives off employees with abuse, calls new jobs telling them they're not allowed to quit.

Yes, I refer to them semi-formally in conversation. It's how we roll. They do have PhDs, after all.

Him: Excellent! merci, mademoiselle. Now is fine, in fact.

Me: Perfect. I'll bring the cart around. (I'm on the petite side, so I generally use a small rolling cart for desktops and such) Could you write down what files you'll need transferred?

Him: Of course.

Me: That's all of the files you'll ever need again. I'll be wiping the old disk before I put it back in inventory (policy around here) so if there's anything at all you need from your current computer, please make sure you write it down.

Anyway, after a decent amount of rewiring I've gotten the redundant cords and such out and tied up the rest so at least it's not a hazard.

Me: You don't mean... right on the top drive, with the system documents?

Him: There was a folder called Users, I put them there so I can reach them from anywhere... Oh. That doesn't transfer automatically, does it?

*Hey, at least he knows he messed up. Score one for the old man.*

Me: Nope. But it's an easy fix, I'll do it later today.

Him: No, I'll do it. It's my fault - I didn't listen to directions and made a stupid assumption.

Me: *jaw hits floor* Well, I wouldn't put it like that, tons of people make the same mistake. It's really not a problem.

I've been doing customer support IT for about 3 years now. Over that time I've seen some things. 

Background: I work for a medium-large sized university help desk. I've been there a while so I get to deal with the faculty and staff. Anyone who has done university IT realizes that it is probably a miracle any of us who deal with faculty are able to function without a constant drip of alcohol feeding into our systems.

On campus, you are provided an email account while you are actively affiliated with the university, and 210 days after you are done with the university, *Poof*, no more email for you (which is an incredibly difficult concept for so very many recent graduates to understand.

Help desk on a Saturday is usually slow. A ""my password just decided not to work today"" here, and a ""My God, what did you do to my email client, I can't use it at all today and you need to fix it now"" there. But every so often you get the most dreaded of calls: a nemesis. Now, I know what you are thinking. You're thinking, ""But Azar, isn't that a bit dramatic? Can your help desk really have a nemesis?"" To which I respond, ""Of course not. A help desk does not have just one nemesis!""

Today I have done battle with the ""Uneducated Elaborator"". 

Story Time: I walk into work today and a soon-to-be-tormented colleague begins to tell me what he is dumping onto my day, as he is walking about the door.

STBTC: Azar, this guy is going to be calling in soon. Hes just trying to migrate his email off our server, we need to connect to his computer and help him with it. I tried, but he had to hang up and put more time on his calling card.

Me: ...Alright...what was the trouble?

STBTC: We couldn't figure out how to setup his other email account to move the email.

Me: Should be easy enough.

Lo and behold, but right as he is walking out the door I receive the call. Within seconds, a cold, piercing chagrin set into my bones. The Uneducated Elaborator has found my line.

Me: Thank you for calling the help desk, how may I help you.

UE: Ah yes, hello. I was speaking with your colleague, but and we were trying to setup some email to move it from one account to another but I guess my phone has blocked your number as he was supposed to call me back to work on this issue. I suppose hes just gotten so fed up with it that he can't handle it any more. You see I was...

*Five minutes later*

UE:...so can you help me get this email migrated?

Me: Sure. I actually wrote the instructions you were sent so lets see if we can get these worked out.

We have a remote connection tool that gives us control over their computer and I walk him through getting connected. I see he already has Windows Live Mail installed and running and his school email address is already added. All we need to do is add his gmail account, and move the email from one to the other.

Me: Alright sir, if you can just fill in your gmail account information we should be able to get this taken care of quickly. *Showing him where to type with his cursor*

UE: Alright where do I type now?

Me: Right here. First we need your username.

He types his username.

Me: And here we will need your password.

UE: My What?

Me: The password for your Gmail account.

UE: I never was prompted for a password. You see I've never had a gmail account before and your colleague helped set one up. He said...

*Another 5 minutes later*

UE: ...And so I've never set up a password on this account.

I assure him he must have set one up before in order to use the account, but we pull up a web browser just to see if it was automatically saved and if so we could just get his password. Easy.

The web browser was open and there was his Gmail account already logged in.

Me: Alright sir, the password we are looking for is the one you used to login here.

UE: I never logged in here. 

...I logged him out of Gmail, hoping the login screen would jar his memory.

Me: Alright sir, if you can just login to your Gmail account here, we should be able to determine what password you should use.

UE: Alright, what is my username?

Me: ...Its the name of the account we were just in. The one you said you setup just a few minutes ago.

UE: I never setup a username. I never have used Gmail before. Your colleague helped me out over the phone and I have this old email address I used before Y2K...

*An epoch passes. I see the full life cycle of entire species crawl before my deadened gaze*

UE: ...So I really just have no idea what this password could be.

I take him to the area where he can retrieve his password. To save time I start filling in some of the information for him. Then he drops the big one.

UE: ...and so I just have no idea how to get this all working. Oh, wait a minute. That says Google there. Is this a Google website?""

The entirety of Gmail is covered in Google logo's but I hold back my desire to flip the nearest table I can find.

Me:...uh...yes sir. Gmail is a Google product. The G stands for Google. 

UE: OHHH! I've got me one of those. You see I have a YouTube account...

As you know from [Chapter 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/rl80w/my_first_job_it_all_comes_down_to_the_wire/), I had defeated the final boss, scored a massive promotion and 40,000XP, and was last seen on a red-eye flight headed straight for the national capital.  

NOW READ ON...  

---  

**CHAPTER 2**  
*""Declare the pennies on your eyes...""*  
   
It was with some trepidation that I touched down in the new city. Particularly as it was about the size of what Australians tend to call a large country town, and stuck out in a sheep paddock at the arse-end of nowhere. It was also fucking *arctic.* The place I'd spent nearly my whole life in before this was famous for things like an entire month of temperatures over 100F. If any part of it actually got below freezing, ever, it made the news. This place had a summer like I remembered winter, and a winter like nothing on earth.  

Welcome to the frozen heart of the federal public service.  

So I got a taxi, and told it to take me to the rental agent for the address I'd been given - a temporary apartment used for visiting businesspeople. (Paid for, fortunately, by my new employer, as rents in that town would have made even Sir Edmund Hilary think twice about tackling them.) Signing paperwork and retrieving keys, I made it back to my new home base at around 10am - unslept, unshaven, unwashed, wearing that wonderfully formal Australian leisurewear referred to as tracky-dacks, and with about five remaining IQ points.  

I decided, after some contemplation, that before I sacked out for the remainder of the day I would make absolutely sure that I knew where the hell my new workplace actually was, given that I only had a street address. Fortunately, some perusal of a map, and ignoring the hammering in my head, I figured it was not all that far away at all - just on the other side of the park across the street. In fact, it was so close that I could probably go and have a quick peek at it to find out where the front door was, given that I was supposed to be starting work there, y'know, *the very next morning.*  

 

This in mind, I wanted to be prepared. So wild of eye, and in sweaty tracksuit, flip-flops, and stubble, I stumbled through the park doing an impromptu impression of either a one-man zombie uprising or the local inebriate three sheets to the wind. The paths twisted and turned (probably a little more than normal, given my lack of sleep), but I eventually found my way to the far end and was faced with a giant set of buildings, all apparently blithely unencumbered with any such thing as street numbering.  

Much lurching up and down the street later, I became moderately sure that the lot I wanted was the one nestled into a city block corner (the park making up the other three sides). However, it had several actual buildings rising from it, connected in various ways at their upper levels. Which one would I need to enter upon the morrow?  

It was thus that a weaving, red-eyed shambling wreck of a technician, clad in the finest Walmartwear, could be seen staggering suspiciously around the base of several federal buildings, peering blearily into each doorway, when all of a sudden I rounded a corner and came face to face with someone in standard office clothing, obviously taking a smoke break outside one of the emergency fire doors, away from the keen wind. The bloke in question was grimacing, puffing, and balding, in approximately that order, and he'd seen me - it was too late to avoid conversation, and I just hoped I could muster something more intellectual than ""BLARG!""  

I introduced myself, if only to avoid being seized and charged with impersonating a hobo, and for want of two brain cells to bang together and a topic of conversation, admitted that I was starting work in that very building tomorrow morning, and would be most obliged to have the front doors pointed out to me. This earned me a slow, evaluating look up and down, and the smoker pointed towards the base of the next building over.

I work in my school's Technology center, as part of the on-campus job program. Each student on campus is issued an HP Elitebook 2740p, complete with rotating screen that supports 'pen' input. If anyone has ever seen one of these things, the screen is mounted to the laptop with a *single* hinge, which rotates 180 degrees. A student came in a few days ago, holding the mutilated remains of what looked like the base of one of these HPs. 


Axis_0: ""Hello, welcome to the Tech Center. What exactly are you holding?""


Student: ""Oh, yeah, hi, this is my HP.""
*silence*

Axis_0: ""So... what exactly.. happened?

(There is no evidence that a screen ever *existed* on this laptop)

Student: ""Oh, well, it uh, fell off my bunk bed""

Axis_0: ""It *fell*?

Student: ""Yeah, it did""

Axis_0: ""So, where is the **other** half of the computer?""

Student: ""Oh, I, Uh, threw it out.""

Axis_0: ""Well, it would be helpful to have the screen. Is there a chance you can get it?""

Student: ""Uh, yeah I'll go look""



After the student leaves to go look for his discarded screen, another technician comes over to the counter and explains that they saw Student pick up his computer by the base and smash the screen over a stone wall the previous night. After several minutes of trying to comprehend his reasoning, I sent the technician to go gather the parts that remained at the wall. He returned before Student, bringing with him a plastic bag of shattered plastic and wires. At that moment, Student walked back in.


Student: ""So, I, uh, couldn't find it.""

Axis_0: ""Someone took the trash out?""

Student: ""Yeah, that must have been it""

(He notices the remnants of his laptop screen spread across the counter)

Axis_0: ""So, I have a technician who claims to have seen you smashing your laptop over a stone wall""

Student: (*nervously*) ""That, uh, wasn't me.""
...
""Well, maybe it was.""

Axis_0 ""Well, that aside, because the damage to your machine was *not* accidental, you will need to pay for the screen replacement yourself""

Student: ""What? Why?""

Axis_0: ""Because you smashed your screen, and the laptop isn't *technically* yours, you have to pay for the repair.""

Student: ""**WHAT?** I'm not payin' for this!""

(Picks up half laptop, walks away)



A few days later, Student's half-laptop showed up again, this time because he needed some Word docs from its HD. We took it, replaced the screen, and happily billed him. We later heard that he badmouthed us for not fixing his machine for free. 

**TL**;**DR**, Student decides to be an idiot, ends up with word docs and a bill, complains about the consequences of his acts.

I work helpdesk in a hospital and I have 2 stories from tonight:

Number 1:
A nurse called asking me to unlock her account in the Active Directory. Easy problem/Easy solution right? Well I go to look her up and there's no one with her name listed. So I ask if she's a new employee, and she says no and that she's never had a problem logging in before. So we go back and forth for about 20 minutes while I try to figure out where her account went. 

After I have exhausted every possible idea she says ""oh wait, maybe its under my other last name""

I said ""you have 2 last names?""

She responded with, ""Well technically no, but I use my boyfriend's last name and I've never had a problem before""

I didn't know what to say to that, but once I had her actual last name unlocking the account was easy.


Number 2:
A different nurse called asking why her account for our core system was locked, because it wasn't locked on Tuesday(She's an agency nurse, which means she doesn't work here a lot). I ask for her user name, and she responds with a generic name for agency workers that I can do nothing with so I tell her it will just be a minute while I look her up. She says ok. Now, I always have my calls on speaker phone because I'm the only one in the office and that way I have both hands free to do things, but I swear to God I never expected to hear what she said next while on a call.

She said to someone else, ""I'll be right back, I have to use the bathroom.""

At first I thought I misheard her, but then I heard the bathroom door swing open and shut, the stall door shut and lock and then a loud grunting sound as she sat down. All while I'm on the other end of the phone, trying to fix a problem for her.

She proceeded to take one of the loudest, most ungodly shits I have ever heard.

I tried to stay professional during this, but once she started grunting her replies at me trying to force the devilchild that was her dinner out of her, I just didn't know what to say.

She finished, I got her the right username, and ended the call.

This usually means plugging them in, watching them boot to the OS, the usual song and dance.   
For anyone who supports laptops, you know that a very common issue is a power on problem related to some sort of power safe mode. This usually happens if the computer experiences a minor power variation, or is unplugged or plugged in improperly.  You pop the battery out, hold the power button down for a few seconds to evacuate any residual charge, then the machine boots up just fine.   
So a customer comes in with his laptop, says that it gets no power at all.  It's a Lenovo, something like a T400 or similar model. So I *know* it's not a power jack issue, and his power cord looks new.  So I am pretty much sure that his computer's just in power safe mode.  I pop the battery, cycle the power, muck with it a little bit, all the while looking concerned.  
Then I set his laptop on the counter, (remember that as far as he is concerned, his computer is as dead as Jimmy Hoffa) raise one hand in the air, place the other one on the keyboard, and yell in (I would like to think) an excellent impersonation of a southern baptist televangelist faith healer: ""AH CA*MAND* YEW TO BE *HEEALED*""

At the time of this **tale** I was just a scrub, a lowly IT trainee working under my boss.
I work for a local council, first proper job, absolutely great environment, but of course that means that people lacking in skill seem to be able to stick around much longer than they ever should.
She was a great and powerful ICT Professional of 8 years in the industry! Or so I thought...

**The first of many head-desk moments**
It was just another day working in a local council office, network falling to pieces around our heads, me trying to make sure the users don't notice it too much.
My boss of course, caught up in whatever land she lives in (*really must be a magical place*) decided that I should learn how to make installation documentation.
Giving up hope of ever being able to fight back the every expanding queue of servicedesk tickets, I push off from my desk and wheelie my way over to her side.

 

Her: ""Ok, so we need some documentation on how to setup xxxxx software"" she says slowly as if waking up from her dream state

Me: ""Sure, do you want screenshots throughout the process or just a list of all the settings that you need to apply?"" I reply, thinking up things to be helpful

Her: ""Well we can't do screenshots for all of the installation, which I would really like, because it takes us into a 'full screen' mode that you can't click out of. So we'll just have to do dotpoints on my pad until we can type in on the computer after""


*This statement completely confuses me, I can't imagine any sort of install that you can't switch out of mid-way through. But of course, I am a lowly IT pleb, so I just assume she has greater knowledge of this.*

Her: ""Let's start then"" She says, double clicking on the exe

*The wizard fires up and we're taken into quite a standard full screen installation window*

Me: ""Ok, so if we take a screenshot of this and then paste it into word, can't we just then just resume and repeat?"" I respond, still dazed and confused about where the issue lies.

Her: ""But how are you going to get out of this program? There is no minimize button and you can't see the taskbar!"" Boss retorts with a smug look

*reaches over to the keyboard and presses 'Alt+Tab'*

Her:""How did you do that? What did you press??"" Utter amazement in her voice as she stares once again at the desktop

Me: ""Umm, alt-tab"" I mumble shyly, as she quickly pastes the image into a fresh word document, of course making special care to click 'File &gt; Save' before clicking back to the install

Her: ""Hmm, ok, let me try that"" She says focusing hard after taking the next screenshot to make sure that she presses exactly the right key combo

Her: ""Wow! Thankyou so much! That will make things so much easier for me! I think I'd heard about people doing this before, but I'd never been bothered to learn what they were pressing!""

My younger sister is starting university next week and my mum wants to get her a laptop for university. So I get a text about an hour ago asking how much memory and hard memory a laptop should have.

My blood turns cold as I realise my mum is attempting to purchase a laptop, and the poor women has very little if any technical knowledge.
Immediately I pick up the phone and ring her, asking what she's trying to buy. She quotes me some ridiculous machine with 8GB of RAM, 4.4ghz of CPU, 1TB HDD, etc etc (I teased this out by asking what numbers were next to each section on the specs)  I explain slowly that she needs far less than this, and to just find something with 2GB of RAM and about 250gb of harddrive space.

About 15 minutes later I get a text with a laptop model spec, a quick look online shows a gaming laptop - 6GB of RAM, modernish Radeon gfx card, etc etc.

I ring again asking where she got this from, she tells me the man at the shop says students need something like this if it's just for typing word documents and using skype. I curse under my breath realising that instead of looking online she's in PC World getting royally shafted by some greedy sales assistant.

I've since told her to quit the store and I'll come over tonight to help her buy one online. I can only hope she takes my advice on this.l

Whatever happened to honest salesmen? I work in telesales at the moment and never try and con a customer into something they don't need, but time and time again my experience through family members at tech centres steer towards retailers selling people products they don't need or make full use of.

She comes to me before a meeting and says ""I can't print to XYZ printer, fix it please!""

So, I go over to her desk, press some buttons, and print to the printer she was talking about.
Test page prints, and I write on it ""Printer works! :-)""
I slant her monitor slightly up, and put the paper on her monitor so she doesn't wonder if it is fixed or not.

An hour later, she comes to my desk and says ""Hey.. There is a window on my screen and I can't close it. Help me!!""
So again, I walk over to her desk and take the paper off her monitor. 
I smile at her and she says ""Oh.. well... hahaha Thank you!""

**Me**: What is your password, I will log into WebMail and see if these emails are there.

**Joe**: *password*

**Me**: One moment Joe...

I proceed to log into WebMail and see that, indeed there are quite a few emails from today. Hmmm... odd, I then proceed to check the Exchange server for some reason and everything is good there.

**Me**: Okay Joe, I can see emails from today and I even sent one and it popped up. This means it is likely a problem with your computer, have you restarted it?

Voicemails are sent to user's e-mails, so just about any issue with e-mail crops up as ""My voicemail isn't working."" Which is fun because our team has no direct control over the exchange servers.

A few months prior to this incident, we had a couple of incidents where a person had acciendtally included the ""send this to everybody"" address in their e-mail. And of course, there would be the bevvy of people who'd hit reply all back, which, considering that these e-mails were going to 40,000 people, is something to be expected.

Of course, after two incidents occurred within about two weeks of another, the ""send this to everybody"" address was removed from common usage. End of problem, right? Oh how wrong we were.

Shortly after arriving in work one morning, I notice an E-mail show up in both my personal inbox, and my support inbox. Opening it up, I see the sender has sent it on behalf of another employee, who had a legitimate opportunity at a million dollar prize, and an appearance on a TV show. Then, I noticed the ""To"" line. The sender had sent it to everyone. Everyone. [Everyone.](http://youtu.be/MrTsuvykUZk?t=7s)

All 40,000+ e-mails, all group inboxes, all public mailing lists, ALL of them were in the ""To"" line, bringing the size of the e-mail up to a whopping 10 megs. She had gone and inserted ever. single. one.

And then people started hitting ""reply all...""

From ""I don't think I was supposed to get this,"" to ""Please remove me from this list,"" To long winded rants about appropriate use of the e-mail system, to ""For the love of god, everyone stop hitting 'reply all'!""

I'm not sure about the long term consequences. Short term, the exchange servers shat themselves. The struggled valiantly from about 9:30, when the first ""reply alls"" started going out, until mid-afternoon, when finally, they gave up. As a result, e-mails voicemails were showing up hours after they had been left, if at all, causing a deluge of calls to our helpdesk, which we could do squat about. The exchange team got drunk and cried, and the perpetrator lost their network access, which they didn't need to do their job anyway.

And that's the day I learned that if you try to make an idiot proof system, someone will make a better idiot.

I also demanded that she quit it with the ""emergencies"" because her failure to plan should not constitute me giving up my weekend events.  I'm not usually that unprofessional with my users, but I'm done.  Her training on Monday is ""ruined,"" and exactly 0 fucks have been given.

A person walked in to the shop today, and announced to everyone inside ""MY C'MPUTER IS SLOW!"" I walked out from the back room and asked him if I could take a look inside. He replied ""Sure, as long as you d'n't (yes, he just abbreviated an abbreviation) f*ck anythin' up."" He then proceeded to drop his XP machine on the front counter. I flinched.

I open the case, and what do I find? The biggest dust farm I've ever seen. We do a trade in service where you sell us your old PC and we do a free data transfer, and I've seen some dirty cases, but none as awful as this. I am not kidding when I say it looked like that dust bunnies became a commodity, and they wanted to cash in. That really says a lot about how slow it is. I personally doubt it was touched in the past 10 years.

I grab a can of compressed air (since the air compressor we have was being used for quarterly maintenance at a local medical office) and sprayed down the memory sticks. If I had allergies to dust, I would be dead by now. The air became clogged with dust that had not been disturbed for god knows how long.

After the dust settled (and I could breath without being 15 ft away from it), I looked at the memory, and guess what I found? Inside the case, there was a grand total of 64 MB of RAM, the absolute minimum for Windows XP to run. I'm surprised the machine was even usable with that kind of power.

He must have left while I was spraying down the case with compressed air, as I do not remember seeing him leave. When he returned, I informed him that the reason his machine was so slow was because it had only 64 MB of RAM. He then proceeded to ask me how much it was. He said that he could indeed pay for it.

He then asked how long it would take to arrive. When I told him it could be up to a week, he yelled ""I NEED MORE MEM'RY AND I NEED IT NOW!"" I told him it could get it to him faster if he wanted to pay more money for shipping, but he said again ""I NEED MORE MEM'RY AND I NEED IT NOW!"" I asked him why he was in such a rush, and he said ""THIS IS THE COMPUTER I USE FOR WORK! IT NEEDS TO BE READY TODAY!"" Meanwhile, the other techs were trying their hardest not to laugh their asses off at the stupidity of it all and anger him further.

I asked him what this computer was running that was so important. He replied ""Photoshop."" I wanted to facepalm so bad. I asked him how he even got it to run on the machine, to which he replied ""I didn't-it w'n't load!"" (More abbreviating of abbreviations.) I informed him that his Pentium II wouldn't cut the mustard for Photoshop, regardless of how much RAM he threw in there (I later found out it could only support 128 MB anyway).

He then said ""IF U AIN'T GONNA FIX IT, I'LL FIND S'MEONE WHO WILL!"", took his computer, and stormed out of the shop. He should have at least paid for the compressed air I used.

Well, we're getting towards the end of my time at this job - but this isn't the last post about it. That comes later.

**This** post is about a stunt I pulled to achieve multiple things simultaneously for minimum effort.  

---

See, I'd gotten pretty much my fill of metaphorically kicking the office manager in the neck, and had figured it was time I should be moving on. But first, there were a couple of things yet to do on my list. These included:

* Scoring some credentials for my CV and to wave around, to make the inevitable transition to another job easier and more fun; and  
* Having a chat to the CEO in person, because I like doing that when I'm on the bottom of the ladder; and  
* Monumentally pissing off the office manager one last time, in such a way that he couldn't do a damn thing about it.  

   
  
   
So I used my free hours to sit back and consider how to achieve all of this together. And after a while, the answer came to me. I went to my section manager (the nice one), noted that I had a lot of vacation time coming to me, and asked for a week off. Given that this would decrease the amount of drama occurring when the office manager (her boss) was in my vicinity, she readily agreed. And I went back to my desk and made a couple of long-distance calls, then booked a flight.

On the day before my vacation, I called up the list of all the innovations and ideas that staff had submitted to HQ over the preceding months. Then I spent some time with an office printer and some thin cardboard, and walked the results out to my car during the lunch break. I was ready.

   
  
   
The weekend saw me on a red-eye flight out of the city, and headed for the nation's capital. There was a friend there who was willing to cover accommodation, and I didn't need more than a sleeping bag in a spare room - apart from a standard business suit, all my props fit into a single clipboard, and everything else was in my head.  

Monday, I started. You see, the names of the controlling Board - the CxO people - were available on the office intranet. As were those of their secretaries. And there was a corporate phone book where you could look up extensions all across the country. And it seemed that an awful lot of the CxOs's secretaries had received phone calls a week or two ago, asking politely for ten minutes on the relevant Board member's schedule, if they would be so kind.  

This included the CEO.  

So I spent Monday through Wednesday happily chatting with the Ultra-Bosses about this and that, having prepared some conversational topics relevant to their area and using it as an excuse to bring them up to speed on my home state, which was the furthest away from HQ and pretty much never ever got visited. I was the courier from the far frontier, and happy to play up the angle that people at home would love to hear all about anything coming down the pipeline. Thusly, I gave myself a crash course in talking to CxOs and picking up relevant HQ-specific jargon, phrases, and mindsets.  

Then came Thursday.

   
  
   
Thursday, I met the head of the Innovation and Ideas program. As I suspected, she'd never actually talked to any of the staff who had submitted anything. After all, they were out in the public-contact offices and state offices, not in the National office.  

Well, I told her, I have an Innovative Idea. Why not make a little award, like a certificate, for the person who submitted the most ideas in a year? It'd give the program a little publicity, a little boost, a little legitimacy. It might even encourage more submissions, which had been tailing off.  

Why yes, she thought, this would be an excellent idea!  

Great, I said. Because according to the data of the first year of the program, the person who submitted the most ideas in the entire country is... me. And as fate (and an office printer which took thin cardboard) would have it, I coincidentally have here with me a fully designed and printed certificate stating so, needing only your signature. Of course, I'd be more than happy to provide details and assist the I&amp;I program with any writeups it wanted!  

She signed it. Stage One: Complete.

   
  
   
Friday was the big one. Friday, I met with the CEO. I'd managed to get onto her calendar purely because she was new, she had been appointed from outside the Service, she was interested in shaking things up, and she'd never before had a bottom-rung employee ask to talk to her directly about something other than a complaint. This made me oddly intriguing, and I got my ten minutes.  

I spent the time rabbiting about a half-assed idea for rewarding employees who generated cost savings with either a percentage in cash or access to things like spare executive furniture and better coffee makers for the office. I didn't expect it to go anywhere (although if it had, I would have milked that sucker like a dairy cow), and was fine with having her shoot it so full of holes it could have auditioned for the Miss Swiss Cheese swimsuit competition. It was all smokescreen, anyway. My real reason for being there was to be seen as a really nice guy. A solid, reliable, dependable employee who really liked the organisation, and was enthusiastic about the direction the CEO was taking it in. Because as we finished up, she walked me out past her secretary, and at that moment I asked if I could get a photo of us together. With this camera I just happened to have brought along with me.  

There was a loooooong pause. I grinned brainlessly at the secretary, who gave her boss a look which said *Aw, give the kid a break and something to show his friends.* And ten seconds later, I had a photo of me and the CEO, standing in the CEO's chambers in the heart of central HQ. Stage Two: Complete.

I flew home, with my certificate (which I'd laminated, after photocopying it and its signature a couple dozen times onto other thin pieces of cardboard) and my photo. I spent the weekend having the photo blown up to A4 size and framed. Monday, I took it to work.

   
  
   
Now, what I hadn't mentioned to this point was that the desk I had been given was about fifteen feet away from the office manager's little glassed-in mini-office. He could see me and everything on my desk every time he walked out his door.  

I put that photo of me and the CEO up exactly where his eye would fall whenever he looked my way. And I made sure that everyone in my section (and thus via gossip, everyone in the office) saw both that photo and the ""official certificate of excellence signed by the I.I. board member"" where it was pinned up in pride of place. EVERYONE knew where I'd been, and who I'd talked to, and it looked a lot like the Very Top Brass had taken something of a personal shine to me. Stage Three: COMPLETE.

Soon after, the office manager took his first vacation in over a decade. And I launched my final and most Machiavellian plan of my time working in that place.  

...and *that* is going to be my very last story - at this office, anyway. It would be eight years before I returned to the city.

   
  
   
But that, and everything that came after, is a story for another time.

I'd done my server checkups and monthly assessments on all of my clients (remotely, too - gotta love RDP. It's saved me from driving from Austin to Dallas and Houston a few times). I'd fired up the office's Keurig and brewed a cup of Jet Fuel, and with a grunt, I settled into my comfortable chair in the back room that the six field techs for my employer shared (small company, but REALLY elite - and in a lot of cases, pretty damn awesome - clientele, and the techs sometimes made me look like an idiot by comparison).

I kicked off my usual morning things - Firefox, AIM via Pidgin (we used it for interoffice communication), Outlook - and settled in for a long day of fielding tickets from my clients, planning for server upgrades for others, and cursing and swearing at the absolute ass who decided to get infected with a rather nasty rootkit at a client in Houston (I could fix it remotely with the Windows PE flash drive I left there, but STILL!).

About an hour into my arduous labors (browsing Facebook, playing turret defense), I got an IM from the chief network administrator / chief engineer of the company, who sat a few chairs down from me normally, but was in San Antonio that day.

Chief Admin 
&gt;Hey, are you free this afternoon?

Me
&gt;Sure, what's up?

Chief Admin
&gt;I need you to go to HERPDERP Surgery Center and block Java updates from running by any means necessary. Their EMR depends on the specific version that's installed and if the updater runs, they're screwed.

Me
&gt;Got it. Anything else you want?

Chief Admin
&gt;A six pack of Shiner needs to be in the fridge on Friday afternoon. Get on that.

I called the practice manager (who, funny enough, I work with in my current job, since she heads up about 100 non-hospital clinics for my employer), and she told me to come over after lunch that day and she'd make sure everyone was available. The CNA had given me a list of asset tags for the laptops there, but I couldn't do it remotely because I didn't know if the laptops were on and in use at the time, and who trusts users to get it right?

After a filling lunch at Whataburger, I arrived at the surgery center, parked, and found the PM. She gave me her master key to let me into everywhere, and off I went. It took about two hours or so to do the laptops and desktops in the non-sterile areas (recovery, pre-surgery prep, intake, et cetera). I'd ended up both setting the update frequency to never and deleting jucheck.exe to make COMPLETELY certain that it could never update. Better safe than sorry.

Eventually, the only machines that were left were in the sterile areas (operating rooms). They had a spare bunny suit for me, along with a cap and booties, so I scrubbed up (and sinks that are operated with foot pedals are AWESOME, by the way) and stepped over the red tape into the sterile area.

I started working my way down the line of operating rooms, updating their machines, as well as the ones in the doctors' dictation area and at the nurse's station, and eventually there was only one room left. This one was a live operating room, and they were performing surgery in it while I was working. I knew I had to wait until I was done, but curiosity compelled me to look through the window on the door just to see if I could get an idea of where they were in the procedure.

In retrospect, I REALLY wish I'd looked at the daily schedule on the door BEFORE looking through the door's window. Alternatively, I wish the room's designers had put the blood-gas and anesthetic equipment on the side of the room near the door, because that would have meant the table would have been facing the other way, and I would have been spared.

There's NOTHING quite like - on a full stomach, mind you - seeing a morbidly obese man's legs spread on the operating table as a doctor has his scrotum (which resembled something like a blood-covered pair of walnuts) CUT OPEN FOR A VASECTOMY.

NOPE^NOPE^NOPE^NOPE^NOPE

Fortunately, I gulped down the nausea and waited until they were done, then got my work done and got the hell out of there. When I got back to the office, I got back on AIM and loaded up eye bleach.

Chief Admin
&gt;So, how'd it go?

Me
&gt;You owe me that six pack of Shiner, except replace Shiner with single-malt whiskey and replace six-pack with one bottle.

##\#004 Now With 50% More Fiber

It was the middle of a busy week, and things had been quiet for a while. I was working with the companies sole iMac, which was so crucial to the final step before production that it bypassed most of the physical network for the most direct route to the Internet. It came as a great surprise when coworkers started coming to me and asking if the network was down.

I turned back to my Windows workstation and ran a few quick tests. Sure enough, the network was down and, since the iMac still had connectivity, I knew it was on our end. I took a closer look at the network to find a source of the problem, but I already had my suspicions. Pete fucked something up. As far as I could tell, his $20,000 rack-mounted workstation was trying to rout traffic.    
I made my way to Pete's office hoping to figure out why he was, once again, bringing the business to a screeching halt.

As soon as I stepped through the doorway, Pete greeted me with a smile and said ""I was just about to come looking for you, I can't get on the network.""    
I quickly explained my troubleshooting, how I knew the issue was internal, that his computer was producing unusual traffic, and that the iMac could still access the Internet.

""It must be that damned iMac,"" Pete concluded. ""They always cause problems. Have you called ABC Communications?"" (ABC is a small service provider a few towns over.)    
""Why would I call ABC?"" I asked.    
""That's where we get our fiber from.""    
""ABC doesn't have fiber lines here; Verizon is our only option.""    
Pete gave me a half-witted grin. ""They ran it just for us. I asked them to do it.""

The nearest ABC Communications infrastructure was more than fifty miles away, Verizon had exclusive rights to fiber in our town, and Pete wanted me to believe ABC strung out more than fifty miles of fiber-optic cable — just for us. To this day I can't decide if he was truly that stupid or if he is the world's most amazing troll.    
I went to the server room and unplugged the network drops to his office from the switch. With the rest of the office back in action, it took me the rest of the day to get Pete to admit he had been monkeying about with settings he didn't understand and to figure out how to fix the problem on an operating system I wasn't familiar with.",,False,,t5_2sfg5,1349978785.0,,tftsflair,True,t3_11aygs,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/11aygs/the_adventures_of_pete_004_now_with_50_more_fiber/,

We were small enough that when users had problems that the first line of support (one dedicated support guy with help from the CEO) couldn't solve, they'd pass the customer on to whatever programmer best knew the problem area and we'd try to work it out from there.

We sold an app that streamed music over a LAN from your computer to a set of remote speakers. I had done a lot of work on the networking for this app, so when a user came in with a bizarre problem the support guys couldn't handle, he got passed to me.

The problem was that the user's stream would disconnect after a few minutes. But, and here was the kicker, only when playing rock and roll. Classical music would stream consistently with no trouble. Yes, seriously.

I'll omit the roughly one month of highly confused e-mail conversation that ensued between the user and me. The user was extremely nice and helpful, everything you'd want from somebody while doing tech support, he just had a *really weird* problem.

After getting lots of diagnostics and even adding some more to the app just for this guy, I *finally* figured it out. First, some background on how the app worked. This gets technical and I'm not sure just what level of audience we have here, so I'll try to explain things, and my apologies if I'm being too obvious:

The app streamed music by breaking it up into small (fractions of a second) chunks, compressing those chunks with a lossless audio codec, then sending them to the remote speakers over UDP. For those who don't know, UDP is a kind of ""fire and forget"" protocol where you send one packet of data at a time and then it may eventually be received by the other end. There's no attempt to verify delivery or throttle the rate at which data is sent or anything like that. You, the programmer, are responsible for checking for packet loss, retransmitting as necessary, etc.

The app worked with both IPv4 and IPv6. In our experience, LAN communications were generally more reliable with IPv6, so the app preferred that whenever possible. Yes, this is relevant.

All network interfaces have an MTU, a maximum transmissible unit. This is the size of the largest packet that can be sent over that network segment. To send data larger than this, it has to be broken up into sufficiently small pieces. TCP connections (the common kind, the ones that web sites use) send a stream of data, so when they hit the MTU limit they can just break their data into smaller chunks and retry. UDP has no such facilities, but the lowest-level IP layer will automatically fragment UDP packets that are too large, and reassemble them on the other end.

Finally, Mac OS X (this was a Mac app) refused to perform fragmentation on network interfaces with an MTU set to less than 1280 bytes. The IPv6 spec sets a cutoff there, although I'm not sure if OS X interpreted it correctly. In any case, that's how it worked.

I finally discovered that this user had somehow set an MTU of 1200 bytes on his network interface. Neither of us knew how or why, but that's how it was set. (1500 bytes is typical.) This is under the 1280-byte cutoff, and thus the problem. Most of our audio packets were under 1200 bytes and passed fine. But since lossless compression results in variable sized packets depending on how a particular chunk of audio compresses, there were occasionally packets that exceeded 1200 bytes. Instead of fragmenting them, the OS returned an error to the app. Upon seeing the error, the app terminated the stream.

So why did classical work while rock and roll triggered the error? Well, it turns out that classical music compresses better. I guess rock is noisier or something like that, and is harder to compress. So while classical (at least this user's classical) always produced packets under the 1200-byte limit, rock music had occasional bits that didn't compress well enough to fit, and it disconnected.

The user didn't need his 1200-byte MTU, so I had him put it back to the standard 1500 and the problem was solved. Craziest problem I ever had to debug, though.

The current student email system uses first initial, last initial and mmdd of the user's birthday.  It never fails, the beginning of every semester there are students lined up at the door because 1) they forgot their password between semester or 2) the new students don't read the first time login instructions that are written in huge red letters at the email login screen.  *that's another story for another time*

One day a student walks into the IT office stating she can't log into her email account.  I told her that I'd be glad to help her and asked if she forgot her password or is it another issue.  

""I don't know"" she said.  I paused and waited for some other words to be said but there were none.

""Ok.  Well, why don't you walk with me to the kiosk and let's see if we can narrow down the problem"" I said and she was in agreement.

At the kiosk, she typed in her username and attempted a password.  Of course, ""Incorrect Password"" appeared after the failed login.  

""I can fix that for ya.  Just follow me back to the office and I'll give you a temp password and you should be good to go""  I told her.

I looked up her username and reset her password to 123456.  I informed her of the password and told her if she had any more problems to feel free to come back.  

About 3 minutes later she comes back to the door and says ""Sir, it's still not letting me in.  The password you gave me is wrong.""  I apologized and and just assumed I mistyped the password.  So this time I was careful in my typing and again assigned 123456 and sent her on her way.  It wasn't 2 minutes and she came back saying the password was incorrect.  I though that maybe my keyboard was acting up so I opened notepad and typed 123456 and it worked fine.  So I asked her what was she typing in for her password and she said 123456.  Out of curiosity I asked what she was using for the username.  She said ""nothing"".  

""So you're leaving the username blank?"" I asked She nodded yes.  So I informed her that she needed to type in a username every time she logs in or else the system wouldn't know who she is.  

""You mean your system is so dumb that I have to tell it every time that I'm me?!  If that's the case, every time I call my family, I should tell them who I am because the sound of my voice isn't enough""

Between the curse words that floated around in my head was the long lecture about identification and authentication methods used in technology but yet somehow I was able to say ""Yes ma'am.  This system was all we could get on state funding""

I am a software developer and a linux sysadmin, he is an IT department head (and the only employee) for an educational institution with roughly 150 windows workstations to manage.]*

One day I was walking together with this IT head down a hallway and we went past a small, closed closet next to the door leading to the server room (actually just another closet with a single rack and the biggest collection of ADSL modems you have ever seen). The IT boss suddenly shouts:

*""Oh no! Why is that plugged in there!""*

And I see him reach down to the floor level, where out of the wall comes out a single network cable, going into a single socket embedded right in the wall next to the closed closet. And he pulls the cable right out.

**He:** ""Now that was close!""  
**Me:** ""Why, where does that socket lead to?""  
**He:** ""There... * knocks the door * ... is our only linux server""  
**Me:** ""Uh-huh""  
**He:** ""It is important that that server *never* touches our network!""  
**Me:** ""Why? What server is it anyway?""  
**He:** ""Nobody knows.. "" (continuing somewhat proudly) ""...but a while back it was causing serious trouble in the network, so I made the janitor change out the locks to this door and not to give the key out to anyone. Not even to me! I couldn't go there even if I wanted to!""  
**Me:** ""...so the server is still running?""  
**He:** ""Yes. So it is very important that this cable (pointing at the cable) never gets plugged in! Good thing that I got in time this time, before the server could screw up our network again.""  

He rolls up the bit of cable coming out of the server room wall and leaves it hanging there, against the wall, proclaiming ""There!"" and we leave.

I couldn't give up on this mysterious, malicious (if not pure evil) Linux box sealed behind closed doors, so I went looking for clues to what its real purpose might have been, before it turned against its creators. I had almost given up, when a few weeks later I stumbled upon a short documentation (on paper) lying in a storage room, titled *""How to Operate The Linux Server""*, written by the previous IT head about 8 years ago. I thought this must be it; the described location on the handbook matched the sealed closet. So I turned to the page two (of two) which consisted of the following four lines of text:

&gt; If the HTTP proxy service jams up, log on as root and run  
&gt; ~# /etc/init.d/squid restart
&gt; 
&gt; Sometimes this does not help, so reboot by running:  
&gt; ~# reboot

So the secret was revealed! The evil network-destroying Linux Server was an HTTP proxy.

I hated him even more because he was using an iPhone and made a huge commotion to also get out his iPad AND Macbook Air and shove them into the seat pocket in front of him.

Well, he finally turns off the phone and his screen is black. For those who don't fly JetBlue - you can press the ""decrease brightness"" button and it will eventually turn off your television. Everything is controlled via buttons on the armrest.

Well this guy starts slamming his fingers into the TV trying to get it to turn on. Pushing and poking and swiping - and obviously nothing is happening. This goes on for a good two or three minutes. He starts looking all around for a flight attendant so I subtly cross my arms and press the brightness controls for him. His TV slowly turns on.

So now he thinks it was just a slow reaction and he spent the next two or three minutes swiping the screen to try and change the channel.

When we moved to a brand new facility the decision was made to replace all the old desktops and laptops with brand new laptops with i5 processors, plenty of RAM, a desktop dock and a new 21"" monitor. There were maybe 7 or 8 computers in the whole facility where this wasn't going to be a clear upgrade, this story is not about any of those computers.

I got to this gentleman's desk and began the short interview to ensure we captured all the programs that needed to be installed, the user date was backed up and any custom configurations were noted. Everything looked pretty standard for this guy so I finished the interview and proceeded to break down his old PC and get the new one set up. I got everything set up nicely and had him log on to the new machine and make sure everything was working and that his programs and files were there.

An hour or so later he calls down to our desk and asks that my supervisor and myself come up to discuss issues with the new PC. He starts to tell us about how his work is very intensive on the computer and his last PC had to have a new graphics card installed to handle it. So I check out the old PC and wouldn't you know it, it has a fairly nice ATI card installed, a little better than the discrete graphics on the new laptop. I was confused, because nothing I installed on the new PC would need that. So I begin to ask questions, like are all your programs and files on the new PC, and do they run properly? He answers yes.

My supervisor takes over and starts asking completely unrelated questions. At this point I start to realize he is in over his head and buying into this guy's story. It turns out someone couldn't figure out this guy's issue in the past so they just threw parts at his computer and told him he was some sort of power user that needed high end computer parts.

I asked him to walk me through what he was doing on his old PC. Turns out he was opening an Access database that was over 8Gb in size. His crappy old p4 PC had integrated Intel graphics and 2Gb of RAM stock. That is when I figured out that all he needed was discrete graphics so the RAM wasn't fighting with the display for memory.

For anyone who missed the first installment of this amazing blunder - [Infinite Backups Part 1](http://redd.it/uvu0r)

Now, the news you are probably all wanting to hear. 

**E has been fired.** He will be leaving the company at the end of this month and is now coming in only to pass things on to his replacement. 
He has been working here for quite some time, and is the ""face"" of our company to a number of our customers, so it was a tough decision for management to make. Luckily, sense prevailed and he is going to be gone!! Woohoo!

The boss who gave E the login info to begin with has been reprimanded (not sure on the details) and he will no longer have access to this information. He put the company at a huge risk (beyond E's stupidity), so I guess they are handling it pretty seriously.

Now, on to the juicy details. 

According to E: Apparently, E never realized what he was backing up. He never even checked. He was under the assumption that he was just backing up his normal daily backup set. When only a few in a row filled the backup folder, he was ""shocked"" at how little space was available. He saw it as a ticking time bomb of sorts - if only a few backups of his stuff filled the folder, what was going to happen in a couple months when larger pieces of data ran out of space? This was clearly a design flaw on the part of the IT guy. The IT guy clearly couldn't handle such a simple task, and was surely just going to blow E off if he tried to tell him about it (as he had been blown off in the past when giving suggestions - surely this is a sign of his incompetence), so it was just easier to take things into his own hands. 

Staying logged in as root was a mistake. He had planned to log out and use his own log in, but forgot. Oops!  He hadn't intended to delete anything other than his oldest personal backups, but again, oops! He thought it was just dealing with the size limit on his personal folder, not the entire server. That wouldn't have happened if the IT guy used UNIX instead of dumbed-down Linux. Linux makes these kinds of mistakes easy, which is why he keeps telling the IT guy to use UNIX... but the IT guy just keeps blowing him off. What kind of IT guy blows off suggestions from his seniors? Not a good one, for certain. 

So, it boiled down to ""If the IT guy had done it right in the first place, I would never have needed to do anything at all."" and ""I use UNIX, this dumbed-down Linux tripped me up on a few things."" All with the charm turned on full blast.

Now, the boss vaguely remembered that he was only supposed to give that login out when 1) The IT guy could not be reached by any means and 2) a new IT leader has been hired.
His mind converted these to ""When the IT guy isn't around"" and ""When someone new needs to do something IT related."" - both applied to the E situation. E had been part of the original starting team, so he was trusted. It wasn't like the boss handed out the information to just some random faceless employee.

I have to actually put a good word in for our management. They apparently listened to the IT guy explain what had actually happened, how E managed to screw things up, the poor security chain that allowed E to do this, etc. They apparently weren't deliberating over who was at fault, but more about the best way to discipline the boss and E. The IT guy was kind of scared that they would flop the blame over on him as he has been working here for about half the time as E and the boss... but they were actually sensible about the whole thing. After reading through some of the insane stories on here, I have to give them some credit. They even praised the IT guy for getting it completely sorted out and back to normal over the weekend with no visible down time other than the hiccup on the first day.

I have been reading this reddit for a while and decided to make an account to share with you a frustrating event I had yesterday.

I work as a librarian in a public library. At our library, we have public computers for anyone to use and I've come to realize 50% of my job is helping people learn how2internet, how2word, and other fun stuff I never thought I'd be doing. I'm not super savvy, but I am smarter than your average user.

Yesterday, I had a fun time when a lady looked at me from her PC and waved at me. To be honest, I saw it from my peripheral vision, so I thought she was waving at someone else. Nope, she was too lazy to get up and ask me, which became clear when she practically yelled ""Hey you!"" I got up from my seat and went over to help her. 

I could see she was trying to access her e-mail, but her e-mail locked her out after too many unsuccessful tries. I asked her, ""What seems to be the issue?"" 

Irate patron, ""I tried to log into my e-mail, and it told me I was logging in from an unknown device and asked for my security answer.""

Me, ""I see. Have you logged in at our computers before?"" I was thinking perhaps if she was suddenly logging in a place 'far from home' it could trigger a message like that.

I.P., ""No, I've been in here everyday since I got a card last week! I haven't had any issues logging on from all these other computers!""

Me, ""Okay, what happened when you entered your security answer?""

I.P., ""It told me I entered it wrong. I tried it about 7 times before asking you to come over just to be sure. I think there is something wrong with your computer. Fix it.""

I'm just a humble librarian. We aren't allowed to mess with the computers, but I also know its not our computers. This is pretty much completely the user's fault. I think she probably forgot her security answer or something like that happened. Nonetheless, people always seem to think that I can control the websites they visit.

Me, ""I'm sorry, the library is not in control of that website. You might have to get in contact with that website and see if you can reset your password another way.""

I.P. rolls her eyes and says, ""Oh sure, how am I supposed to do that!?""

Me, ""Well, I am sure if we looked we can find a number-""

I.P., ""Look, I don't have time for that. I thought I could come into this stupid library to check my e-mail, but if this is going to be a problem every time, then this will be a waste of my time!""

Me, ""I understand, but I really can't help you other than see if I can help you find a reset option somewhere-""

I.P., ""Can I log onto another computer? Would that help?"" Because logging onto another computer to possibly just run into the same issue takes less time than trying to reset a password... sure.

Me, ""You can try that, but I can't guarantee it will work. I will put in a ticket to our tech team and see if they can come up with an answer, but we might not get an answer today."" I feel bad having to ask tech support about things like this, but I am pretty much at a loss for what I can tell this lady.

I.P., ""Make sure that you do! I wouldn't want to waste anymore of my time trying to get into an e-mail, because your computers suck!""

She pretty much left in a huff and it took a lot of effort on my part not to tell her that if she could remember her security answers, maybe she wouldn't run into this issue!

Needless to say, I have a plethora of stupid user stories and even stupid agent stories when dealing with agents I transfer other customers to. I can honestly say that today was the first time I had a jaw-dropping response when I asked a customer to describe what they saw on a screen.

The customer was having trouble getting computer to access the internet. The customer was elderly and admitted she was not very good with computers. I'm normally fine with this; I don't care how little you know about computers so long as you remain calm and don't act like a dick.

During the call process I had the customer check the network status in Network and Sharing Center in Windows 7 for connectivity and describe the three icons in the network map section that you would normally see at the top of the window. This is where my jaw-dropped.

Me: ""Can you describe what you see?""

Nana: ""There are three pictures connected by a big line.""

Me: ""And what do the three pictures look like?""

Nana: ""There is one on the left, one in the middle and one on the right""

Me: ""Okay, what do the individual pictures look like?""

Nana: ""There is a computer on the left, a globe on the right and a picture in the middle. It looks like a bitch""

Me: O___O ""I'm sorry?""

Nana: ""It looks like a bitch.""

At this point I am just completely stumped and being a big Tarantino fan I assumed shit was about to hit the fan. I had no idea what she was describing and what in Windows could possibly be interpreted as ""looking like a bitch"". I decide to ask one more time for more of a description for what she is describing.

Me: ""Sorry, could you just describe that again?""

Nana: ""It looks like a bitch, like something you would sit on.""

It then clicks in my mind that she is actually saying *BENCH* and it is being mangled by her southern accent. The bench she is describing is the icon for a network classified as public in Windows 7. I finally manage to compose myself and get back to fixing the problem.

Ok, so bear with me, I had to cut out some of the details, to keep within limit. I'm also reposting this from TalesFromRetail, at the request of a poster.

So our story begins years ago, when I was contracted to design a custom template for a guy's website. $750 total, to cover the design I made, and the guy the client hired on to code. (Yes, I was a moron about pricing back then.) 

The Client, we'll call him TJ, threw a fit about the price, but eventually agreed to it. The project ended up taking three weeks of solid work to finish, but ended up turning out really nice. The site's monthly profit actually **went up by 650%** after the new design was launched. No, I'm not kidding, that's how much of an improvement I did. 

TJ, however, throws a massive fit, demanding extra free work done, and that we WILL do it because he's paying us so much. As I'm in the middle of trying to calm him down, and to explain that he got a VERY good deal on the project, he suddenly does a 180 personality change. He's suddenly extremely polite and nice, and says he completely understands. I'm a bit weirded out, but didn't think much of it. 

Well, that evening, the guy who I paid to code, calls me up, freaking out. His PayPal card was declined as he was trying to pay for his dinner that night. Considering we'd just gotten paid by TJ, to our Paypal accounts....this was odd. Both of us checked Paypal, and found out TJ had reversed the payments. 

Coder, in a fit of rage, promptly logs in to TJ's website, and strips down all the files, and leaves up a note on the website of “TJ tried to scam his designer and the coder, and this is what he got”. Not a  classy move, but within two minutes, TJ was calling me up, screaming with rage. He made all sorts of insane rants, that we overcharged him, that we scammed him, now we have to give him the entire design for free, and that if we didn't, we'd suffer. 

I explain, politely, that the terms of the project that TJ agreed to clearly explain that in the case of a payment reversal/non-payment, the files will be removed, until receipt of the payment. He rants a bit more about how this is “illegal extortion”, but finally gives back the money. Coder puts back the files, problem solved.

Right. 

I guess coder felt like this wasn't good enough. I had no idea, but apparently TJ had done this sort of thing multiple times to some of Coder's buddies, and Coder had enough of TJ's shenanigans. He went onto a extremely popular forum for TJ's industry, and posted the entire story of how TJ had just attempted to screw us over. Being as one of the main hubs that EVERYONE visited, word got out. Fast. I heard about the post within half an hour, and by the time I went to go check, TJ and coder were having it out on the forums, screaming at each other. 

I promptly got a call from someone purporting to be TJ's lawyer (later found out it was his friend), telling me they're going to be suing me for slander, extortion, etc. I tell Coder to cut it out, and I get the forum thread locked down.

TJ Ims me and throw a huge amount of threats my way....he's gonna track me down and beat me up, he's gonna cut me, he'll find my family....I end up blocking him because I'm not gonna listen to that. After blocking him....radio silence. I thought perhaps, magically, this would all blow over.  

A few weeks later, I get a message from TJ on an alt IM account. He's apologizing, and asks how I'm doing. I said fine, and he asked if my kids were nearby, as they typically are. Hm, weird, but I said yeah, of course, one's even sitting in my lap. TJ is all “kids are wonderful like that. So, I need to know if you'll make a design for my new site...” and gives me a link. At this point my kid was squirming, so I got up, put her down so she could leave, and went back to see what he was talking about. I click on the link, and immediately, hardcore porn floods the screen. I'm horrified, and look at TJ's im, where he's laughing and saying how he bets that’s gonna be one traumatic thing for my kids to try and forget. I'm furious, and block him. At this point, I had the feeling he was gonna be causing problems.

This occurred a few more times over the next few months. I'd get messages from fake people, wanting to know quotes, asking me to look at their site and see what I can do...and it'd be some sort of hardcore or illegal porn. 

The final straw came when he went onto that same forum that Coder posted about him on. TJ went  and made a post about me, with all sorts of insane claims. Apparently I was a foreign Communist spy sent to infiltrate their industry, and that with every project, I stole my client's bank account numbers, SSNs, and their CC numbers. 

I'd had it, and I unblocked TJ long enough to tell him that if he made ONE more move to harass me, I would contact the police. I was done with it, and I'd drag him through courts if I had to. TJ flipped out, claimed this is all MY fault. I cut him off, say I'm serious, and I'm done. I'm blocking TJ again, and if I hear ONE WORD, I'm going to the police.

That was the last I heard of him for a while, a year in fact. 

I later ran into his ex-partner, from the website we did for them. He was furious, asking if I'd heard from TJ. Turns out, he and TJ had sold the website after it became hugely popular, and the partner realized afterwards that something seemed a bit funny. He contacted the buyer, and asked to see the records TJ had sent them after the sale. He was shocked to discover TJ had falsified their financial records after the profits skyrocketed. He's siphoned off something like $10,000 of his partner's money, and kept it for himself.

That wasn't all though, as he was discussing this with the buyer, he noticed in the site's activity feed, someone withdrawing small amounts. (this website is where you earn money by doing small tasks)  He made an offhand comment on how that person must be doing very well, and the new owner was like “yeah, come to think of it....they're been withdrawing every day...”. New owner checks the account, and HOLY MACKEREL, they have a $5,000 pending balance! That's literally impossible to pull off....especially considering that the account was created **the day before the site sold**. Upon further digging, new owner discovers a few accounts, all created the day before the sale, with thousands in their balance. 

And all with payment details that belong to TJ.

Yep, he'd made fake accounts so that he could steal money from the buyer, slowly over time. He would've ended up making off with something like $27,000, if he'd not been caught. So yeah, ex-partner and new owner were furious, and trying to find TJ. I just said I'm sorry, can't help you there, and went back about my business. 

Tthe next week, I woke up to a huge amount of emails and messages. Upon checking, every single one of them was from a client/friend of mine in the industry, ranting about the same thing.

TJ.

He'd had a second business whose business model was paying people to run advertisements he was being paid for. But, he'd closed everything down, and told everyone  they're not being paid. This is something now to the tune of $60k. Several of my clients had already contacted lawyers, and were in the process of setting up lawsuits.

Another year passes, and I meet a new client, and we end up becoming friends. We chatted a few times about some of the crazier people we've dealt with, and he suddenly blurts “Well, nothing tops this one guy, TJ.”

TJ apparently tried to scam a couple of people with the payment reversal trick. One of which was my new client. Neither would have any of it, got their money back, and told him to scram.  So TJ tracked down their addresses, and called the police in BOTH towns at about 2-3 am. 

He informed the police that the person he was calling about was waving about a shotgun, and holding their family hostage, threatening to shoot them if they moved.

You can imagine the response that happened to that.

First guy was woken up at 3 am by the police bashing down his door and dragging him outside and laying him on the pavement. He was surrounded by about five cars, all full of screaming policemen with guns trained on him.

Second guy wasn't actually home, he was on a trip, but his family WAS, so they were woken up in the middle of the night by policemen bashing down the door and getting them out.

Everything got straightened out of course, and then both guys pressed charges against TJ for what he had done.

The icing on the cake was that TJ contacted my client afterwards and ranted at him, and mentioned how this was his favorite way to teach people a lesson....but that “the only one who couldn't have that done to her was that &amp;*@$ narelie”. Because I'd been smart and it was difficult to track down my address.

New client then proceeded to show me some interesting links in an online arrest record.

In the year since I last told TJ that if he didn't cut it out, I'd call the police on him, his life had hit the downhill slope and gone to heck. 

The first incident started out with him calling the police and claiming he'd been robbed of his TV and Xbox...only to have been found out that he was lying, he traded them for drugs. 

Afterwards, he quickly got in trouble multiple times for drugs, assault, and then domestic violence. 

His businesses all folded, and with the lawsuits looming, he moved to try and escape having to pay back the money he owed. Didn't work, from what I hear, they still managed to track him down.

However, he isn't done yet. He's shown back up recently, attempting to schmooze some of the industry vets into backing him with a new startup....saying he's changed.

Probably gonna be really difficult for him to do that, considering I just discovered that the arrest database now has a new entry for him as of last month: Child Abduction. (Kid's safe, as far as I can gather)

And it somehow may, or may not, have gotten out as a nice email, with a list of all the arrests and his mugshots. To all of the major industry players.

Passing the class allowed you to take the A+ cert exam for free (though somehow my paperwork got fuddled and so I never took the test). Anyway, the professor took those of us that knew computers well and teamed us up with those that didn't. Not that any of that is relevant...

Anyway, in the class was a blond woman in her late 30s. Nice enough girl, though completely clueless about computers. We were discussing the horrible things people do to computer and she starts to get red in the face and buries it in her arms. Then she begins to slightly sob. The discussion stops and, being a pretty small class, ask her whats wrong. She got upset because she was one of those people we were talking about - here is her story.

She bought a graphics card - an AGP graphics card. However, her computer was new enough that it only had PCI and a PCI-E slot. Seeing that the PCI slot was the closest looking to what the card had, she tried to make it fit. Now at this point those of us that are more techy are asking her questions. For one, AGP slot is further back on the motherboard so the back of the card wouldn't even fit in the case even if she got the slot lined up.

First, she cut away the back metal panel around the slot so the card would just stick out, allowing her to line the card up with the PCI slot.

Second, she took a hammer and forced the card into the slot.

She paid $2,000 for the computer.... and it was only a few months old when she did this. It was this event that led her to take college classes a year later.

Guess what? It was NOT easy for her - the class confused her a great deal but we all took turns helping her out and taking more time with the hardware swaps and repairs (on the lab computers).

I am a junior analyst and because we are a smaller company I take care of day-to-day tech support as well. We dabble in marketing and data sales, so naturally there are A LOT of reports that have to be done each month. They are mostly done in either excel and/or powerpoint. I know my way around MS Office and especially Excel and it didn't take long for some of my coworkers to figure this out. Most of them had no idea how to link data from different excel files and they relied mostly on copy-paste for every report they made. I offered one day to help out and make the whole thing automated and waaaaay easier than what they were used to. So I took their reports, pimped them up a bit and basically cut their work from a few hours to just a few minutes.


Now for the story:
One day another junior analyst Derpina asked me if I could show her how to link her Excel charts and graphs into Powerpoint, because she has a report with 200+ slides and it takes forever to do with copy-pasting (Let's call this Report X). I said sure, no problem. So I basically do her whole report with every chart and every text linked to the data in excel, so all she had to do was refresh all the links and voila, the whole PPT was done. I show her EXACTLY how to do it, step by step and she was extremely grateful.


Fast forward 2 months: Due to vacations we were a bit short-staffed and I had to do almost twice the work for 1 week during which time the I was pulling 10-11 hours each day to get it all done. We have a shared schedule in the office which basically prioritizes my work and Friday morning I only had 3 things left on it, that would take roughly 2 hours each. I was very excited, because it had been a tough week and I wanted some rest.


At 11am a new task pops up: ""Derpina needs Report X by the end of today."" At this point, I was still calm and collected and I got up and walked over to her desk.


Me: *Hey Derpina, I noticed the task, is there a problem with Report X?*

Derpina: *Well no, but I forgot how to do it*

Me: *Heh, that's fine, just open the Powerpoint and refresh all the links and it's done.*

Derpina: *I tried that, but it says it can't find the source for the data.*

Me: *That's wierd. Did you rename the excel file perhaps? But even if you did, it's not a problem, we'll just correct the source file path.*

Derpina: *Which excel file?*

Me: *The one that has the graphs for the report.*

Derpina: *Oh, I deleted that one. Since you fixed the powerpoint I didn't think I'd need it.*

Me: *The powerpoint has links to the graphs in excel Derpina... You need the excel with the graphs for the Powerpoint to work.*

Derpina: *Well that's stupid! Why did you bother in the first place then?*

Me: *So you wouldn't have to copy-paste it everytime! I'm sorry but now you have to re-do all the graphs.*

Derpina: *No way, I don't have the time. You do it! You broke it in the first place, so you should fix it!*


Thankfully our boss knows how linking works and Derpina had to redo every graph and link them to Powerpoint herself. 
Last time I offer to help someone unwilling to learn things on his/her own. Pfffff...

During that time, he had some rather...interesting customers. Since the place he lived was home to a large retirement community, he often had a lot of older customers.

One of these customers was a lady that seemed to be relatively fresh into retirement, but not young enough to be the most tech-savvy of individuals. She calls in one day saying, ""My computer's shutting off and I don't know why."" After a drawn-out conversation, my friend says, ""Ma'am, your computer is overheating. Bring it in tomorrow, and I'll take a look."" 

This woman fails to show up the next day, or the day after that, or any day for the next month. My friend decides she must have somehow solved the problem, and doesn't think anything more of it, until he gets *the call.*

""My computer won't turn on! I demand you fix it right now!""

""Alright, Ma'am, bring it in and I'll see what I can do,"" my friend was already rather pissed that she hadn't brought it in already if it was such a problem. When she arrives, he opens up her computer, only to find everything inside is rusted.


""So, uh, what exactly did you *do* to this thing? There's no reason for it to be rusted like this.""

""Well, you said it was overheating, so I poured water on it to cool it down!""

We'll see how it goes.

Whenever I needed our office address, I would pull up the corporate homepage to find the address and zipcode of our office. I make heavy use of tabs in my browser, and since I use a vertical tab plugin, I rarely close any.

I had noticed that my browser would sometimes slow down to a crawl, and I knew it was probably some shitty plugin in one of my many open tabs, it was usually less work to just close the browser and re-open it, discarding all open tabs and starting anew.

One day, I had pulled up the homepage again to copy the address, and after that went to lunch. An hour later, I was doing some work that didn't involve my browser. The door to our room opened.

""That's him, over there,"" a coworker told some guy I hadn't seen before, giving me somewhat of a stink eye.

It turns out that the corporate homepage was experiencing a DOS attack that originated from within the company, more specifically my laptop. Meanwhile, some bottlenecks in our corporate network also got swamped with my laptop's calls, setting off all kinds of alarms and crashing stuff. This is not a small company by the way, it employs 1000s of people.

I pulled up my browser and it was slower and less responsive than I'd ever seen it. So, putting the puzzle pieces together, I said: ""ah, so that's what's been slowing my browser down."" Guy said: ""yeah that's really interesting, would you mind closing it like right now??"" ""sure."" So I closed the browser, instantly alleviating a corporate-wide IT crisis.

I wanted to know what exactly had happened though, so a couple of days later I had some free time and pulled up the corporate homepage again, and used the firebug net monitor. It seemed fine at first, but I started noticing a pattern pretty quickly.

One minute after I opened it, it made an ajax call to the server. I looked into it, and it was to update the stock price in real-time that was displayed in a tiny area on the homepage.

One minute later, it made two calls to the same service. Another minute later, it made four calls, next, eight calls, sixteen calls, and so forth. e: after writing this, I've calculated that after an hour, it would attempt to send 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 simultaneous calls. I believe that's called a Quintillion.

In Javascript, a common way to repeatedly trigger a delayed execution is to use setTimeout at the end of the function you want to repeatedly trigger. The problem was, for some reason, there were two setTimeouts at the end of the function, so, after a minute delay, it would execute the function twice, and both executions would hit two setTimeouts, resulting in four executions a minute later.

What makes this interesting to me is that anyone on the internet could pull up the homepage, and cause huge problems by just doing nothing. I wrote an e-mail to the people responsible. Didn't get an answer, but it did get fixed.

I handle all technology for our facilities group - servers, devices, software, and support in my group only. I try to make simple handouts for things to save me time and irritation, but it is always the things you cannot predict.


So in our office, we have 2 MFP/Copiers, a standalone fax machine, a large format printer/scanner, and a high volume scanner. All of these are in the hallway that all of the cubes are off of. I've made how-to guides for most of them, but still have people come to me with issues.


Today while I was troubleshooting a configuration issue in our timekeeping system, one of the admin-assistants (been here for years) comes in to complain that the fax machine isn't working. I'm in the middle of reading logs, so I tell her I will look at it in a few minutes. I check the MFPs and the stand-alone fax, none have errors. I tell her it looks fine, and to come get me if she has an issue.


An hour later, she comes back and complains that the contractor says he didn't receive the (large and time sensitive) change order she faxed. I ask which fax she used and she said the one that is just a fax.  I go check it and there is no log of any faxes sent today. I go ask her about this, and lead her to the fax machine. She tells me she didn't use this one, she used the one closer to her desk so she didn't walk as far.

........ This is the closest fax to her. She leads me into the kitchen, and points to 'the other fax' - our high volume shredder, in between the trash bins and the paper recycling bins. I ask just how many 'faxes' she sent today - 'Oh only 5 or 6. Plus that thing the president wanted from the VP.' I proceed to tell her that it's a shredder, not a fax and she proceeds to demand I get the documents back for her since there was no way for her to know it wasn't a fax machine (except for the lack of a dial pad and the word 'Shredder' in big letters).

When I told her it wasn't happening, she started complaining that we must waste our tech budget since we could just buy an un-shredder and should have for situations like this.

tl;dr: A high volume shredder makes for quick faxing, IT hides un-shredding technology from users, and there now are labels on all shredders stating 'THIS IS NOT A FAX MACHINE'

We are a small company and we all share offices with at least one other person. In addition, the office is a converted residential home, and office supplies are stored in random closets throughout the house. (My closet has all the printer paper and envelopes and stuff in case you were wondering).

When we first moved into the building (from being entirely remote offices) we started noticing problems with things disappearing, or getting moved constantly. Innocuous things like a power strip, all your highlighters, etc. 

Often they would turn up later, after you had already had the office manager purchase replacements.

Many a memo went out about the proper location of all the office supplies and to please stop taking things from people's desks.

Since my manager and I handle all the IT requests, this became increasingly problematic for us. The monitor for the email server disappeared! Who is messing with the fucking email server!? It takes a key to get into that room!

So, we did what anyone would do. We set up a few cameras in the office.

The first few days, nothing happened, and we were beginning to question which of us might be protecting the ""borrower"".

Then, it happened. The president of the company (who also has keys to everything because she owns the building) came in after hours and was working at one of the conference tables.

After an hour of working, she gets up and goes into the nearest office (not one we were recording) and comes out with a power strip. She plugs her laptop in to charge and continues working. Then after a few hours she packs up and leaves... TAKING THE POWER STRIP WITH HER.

Turns out she likes working late because it's quiet and there are no distractions, and she likes working at a conference table because her desk is cluttered and if she is working on just one project it's nice to work on a ""clean slate"".

Every month or so, she cleans out her home office, realizes she has a bunch of stuff, so she brings it all back to return it - not realizing that she is the borrower that has been driving all of us mad.

Now, every time something is missing off someone's desk, the first person we go to? The president of the company.

The best way to keep your things safe? Put them in a drawer. She doesn't like to rifle through people's drawers, but she has no problem borrowing from the top of people's desks.

When we hired someone in another department form mine, I warned her to always clear anything she needed into her drawers and leave her desk clean at the end of the night or things might walk away.

Poor shy girl waited three months before asking us if we knew where her THREE phone chargers had gone. She had been using her car charger exclusively for weeks to avoid confrontation. Apparently she has the same charger as the company president - and since no one was asking for it back the president thought it must be hers and she had forgotten to take it home last time.

TL;DR: We aren't joking, if you want to keep it, put it in your desk drawers.

Knowing the system, and hearing the alarm, I deduce that it is the RAID alarm, and the alarm code is catastrophic failure.

fuck.

I have her restart the server and walk her through getting the RAID card to display. The config is gibberish. Total corruption. No data, no idea what the array was. The server has 4 external arrays plugged in to this card. We are talking 4 filled 15 drive arrays. unknown config. 1 array? 4 arrays? some disturbed hybrid of every third drive split between arrays???

oh yay.

Fast forward, by a miracle she can access our FTP and download a config utility ISO. She boots to it and I have it flash the RAID controller firmware, RAID enclosure firmware. (Very risky. Had this backfired, i do not doubt the shit would hit the fan. I was about 70% sure the data was a total loss already. A Hail Mary play)

I take an educated guess on the array based on how I would set all that up for a single job. This is not just a SWAG, but I drew the array out as if I had just gotten this equipment and needed to set it up for this. RAID level, number of hot spares, stripe depth, nested redundancy...

I walked her through applying the config without initializing the arrays (Yikes!! oh god, please make sure that box is unchecked!!).

We reboot... POST...NO ALARM... and the OS loads, all data intact. All those variables and I guessed right on the first try.

Thought I'd share some of them.  First, my favorite.  A customer called in because he needed to run a report and send it out to the networked printer.  For whatever reason, the report was failing to generate and the guy on the phone was freaking out because some corporate big-wig demand that this report be printed and on his desk by 3pm.  
Just another day at work.  

About 10 minutes into the call he starts to hear this strange high pitched noise in the background.

Dad, ""Uhh, if you don't mind my asking, what's that noise it the background?""

Caller, ""Oh, that's the fire alarm.""

""Fire alarm?""

""Yeah, the building is on fire.""

""Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but shouldn't you get out of there?""

""Dan... you don't understand.  I HAVE to get this report printed, now are you going to help me or not?""

So they continue to troubleshoot the issue. A few minutes after that my dad hears shouting in the background.

Dad, ""Umm, there seems to be a lot of yelling in the background, is everything OK?""

Caller, ""Yeah, it's fine.  It's just the firefighters evacuating the building.""

""Shouldn't you get out of there too?""

""Dan I absolutely HAVE to get this report printed are you going to help me?""

""I'm not sure that I should.""

""We pay our support contract.  I have to get this printed and you have to help me!  It's almost 3pm!""

""It's just a report I don't think it's worth risking your life.""

The caller starts to get furious when the shouting in the background gets much louder.  A firefighter has come over to the guy on the phone and starts barking orders at him to get out of the building.  The caller tells the firefighter ""Look, I have to print this report before 3p and I can't leave until it's printed.""
Over the phone dad hears the firefighter scream, ""I don't give a damn about your goddamned report the building is on fire! Now MOVE!"" 

There's a scuffling noise and the phone handset on the other end drops to the ground as the firefighter physically drags the caller away. After that, all dad could hear was the sound of the fire alarm and various crackling noises.  

Needless to say, the report did not get printed by 3pm.

If the prototype suits the task, a GUI is developed for it.
 
The story: research department asks for a prototype, so I wrote it according to specs. Using Python, so it should run on Linux, Windows and Mac.  Only caveat is, in order to be able to use it, you need to install Python and a special graphics lib, PIL. 
Also you need to invoke it with some arguments, such as input and output file.
 
After thorough testing I am convinced it does what it needs to do, so I write up a  little document with instructions and screenshots how to install Python and PIL, and how to invoke it.
 
It is protocol that fellow researchers test prototypes for a fair amount of time, before we have codemonkeys convert it to a GUI.
 
So I pick a collegue, let's call her Lady With Fancy Degree, LWFD.

Me: please test it and come back to me if you don't get it running.

LWFD: Mkay, will do...

Half an hour later...

LWFD: Your prototype sucks, it does not work, getting weird error messages.

Me: Please show me. And indeed, it does not work.

Puzzled, I ask her if she followed the instructions in the document. 

LWFD: Well, I think I did.

Me: Please show me step by step.

LWFD shows me, and turns out she skipped a few steps.

Me: Why did you not follow the instructions?

LWFD: I don't need to do that, I know what I am doing. 

Me: But, but....

I'd do more, but, well, ammonium triiodide is SUCH a volatile compound.

About two weeks after the doctor went live with his remote desktop scheme for EMR access and remote clinic visits - which actually went off pretty smoothly, much easier than I expected, but that was because I dropped RDP shortcuts on every user's desktop, and at which time, against my better judgment, I'd migrated their ECGs from the failing 1TB MyBook to the 1TB RAID1'd LaCie device, but they'd still had another 1TB MyBook containing archived studies from the previous year - I got another call from the practice manager, this time at 11 PM.

Before I picked up the cell, I rolled over in bed, away from my lady-friend, and double-clicked on a script on my machine, which kicked off remote diagnostics on her servers (ping, RAID check, uptime, et cetera). I picked up her call, and before I finished my greeting, I got a report that everything on the servers were good.

""Hello, MXX. I haven't gotten any pages from the autonomous monitoring systems from your office, so the UPS and switches and servers are okay, and my diagnostics just confirmed that. What's up?""

""Well, there are two things. The doctor can't get into his computer from home -""

""Is he using the shortcut I put on his laptop, or is he using his big desktop in the office?""

As an aside, I should mention that in a rare moment of altruism, I'd set up their home network on the condition that I would never be asked to support it (and yes, my documentation for it was SUPERB).

""It's his desktop, but I can't get into my computer at the office either!""

""Well, the office connection is up, if it wasn't, I'd have a page from my monitoring systems at my office. Out of curiosity, what does it say when you try to go to a web page on your computer?""

""It has an AT&amp;T logo and it says that the broadband link is not available! Did the connection at the office die? It's Time warner! Why would Time Warner have an AT&amp;T page on it?""

My eyebrow started twitching at that point.

""Remind me, MXX, what ISP do you have at home? And remember, I set you up, I KNOW what ISP you have.""

""Uh... we have AT&amp;T DSL?""

""And when multiple machines in your home are offline, doesn't that generally mean your connection at home is down?""

""Not necessarily, it could be the rest of the - ""

*If you finish that sentence with 'it's the rest of the Internet that's down' I swear to god I will hook a 240-volt Etherkiller into your shitty unmanaged 24-port 10/100 switch and blow out every damn device on your network, you vapid pennypinching bleached-blonde harpy,* I thought to myself, but apparently, the god of tits and wine looks out for children and stupid people, and she corrected herself.

""Oh, you're right! The DSL modem has a flashing red light on it. I guess I'll wait for it to come back up. The other reason I called you was that before this started, the doctor was working on a study and Windows said the drive was... inaccessible, and that the file or folder was corrupt and unreadable.""

FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU - 

What I'd been warning her for ages had finally happened! The LaCie was apparently as far gone as my patience, and it, like a drunk who'd had too much spicy food, shat the bed.

""I will be down there in the morning, MXX. Do NOT let the doctor do ANYTHING with studies until I'm there. Period. If he does, I'm not responsible for what happens. Hell, I'm not responsible for what happens anyways, since I put it in writing to you that that needs to be fixed.""

**NORMALLY, WE'D USE A CARD FROM SPONGEBOB TO SHOW THE TIME LAPSE HERE. INSTEAD, ENJOY THE MENTAL IMAGE OF BEA ARTHUR SMOKING CRACK WHILE LISTENING TO ""I WILL SURVIVE.""**

Once I arrived at the clinic, I walked over to the doctor's machine, and took a look at the LaCie. Sure enough, it resembled HAL 9000 - the light on the front was flashing red, and everything pointed to a faulty drive or RAID failure. Cursing my bad luck, I called LaCie, since it was still under warranty, and got another sent out next-business-morning as a replacement.

Since there was nothing else I could do, I went back to Austin, then came back the next day, and sure enough, the device had arrived.

""MXX, look. Seriously. You've had the MyBook fail, one of these has died. I am NOT going to deal with these things constantly. Either we get a storage server, or I will not warranty any of my work and I will put that in writing to both my boss and our insurance company.""

""Fine! I'll run it by our accountant and see if we can afford it.""

*If you can afford it? Your house is worth four million dollars! Your kids go to private schools and play bloody lacrosse with the best gear available! YOU HAVE A BLOODY ESCALADE WITH SPINNING RIMS AND YOU SOMEHOW GOT AN iPAD MOUNTED TO THE DAMN DASHBOARD! You can afford to drop four thousand on a storage server, don't tell me you can't!*

I told her that recovery from this would take all night if we're lucky, and that I wouldn't be out before midnight.

As soon as everyone left, I hooked up the good drive from the RAID array to a spare computer via an internal SATA port, and booted the box to Ubuntu. LaCie uses some arcane, obscure file system for its arrays, but Ubuntu reads it fine. 

Copying the terabyte of data to the new LaCie box took about nine hours (even SATA2 to eSATA will take a while to copy 1TB of data), and I didn't walk out of their office before 4 AM. Again, I left a note on the practice manager's desk saying that she needed to order a storage server ASAP and that the next failure would invariably be worse than that.

About a month later, I was sitting at my desk, enjoying a sandwich from Jimmy John's and browsing Engadget, and I get a call on my cell.

""Hi, Jack, it's MXX. Do you have a minute?""

""Sure, MXX, what's up? Actually, call me back on the office phone, PXXX will send you back to my desk.""

She calls back on that, and the other techs in the room crowd around me as I put her on speaker.

""So, MXX, what've you got?"" I took a bite of my Hunter's Club (sans tomato and with dijon mustard).

""Well... you remember the drive holding the studies from last year?""

I mumbled assent through a mouthful of sandwich. ""You mean the one I said we should migrate to a storage server? Yeah, why?""

""It's clicking. Is that bad?""

I barely had time to hit mute on the phone before my monitor was covered in partially masticated sandwich bits and saliva.

Sure enough, another tech had loaded up [a ten-minute loop of Zelda and King Harkinian laughing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciP4YRIMR5s) and that aptly summed up my sentiments towards her plight.

As stated in a previous thread, I worked in the Blackberry phone department for a company we'll call ""Spring together with Lextel"" right after they merged six or seven years ago.  During my tenure for the company , I worked the ""jabber chatroom"" for the department. Basically I would sit in a chatroom where all the other people in the call center were also sitting in.  If they had a question, instead of finding a supervisor or SME they could ask in Jabber. As one of the moderators (and someone who could type 100+wpm even back then) of the chatroom, I would respond with the answer.

Because of this we couldn't take calls, since we were too busy.  But my supervisor gave me a headset and told me ""log in to the phone so we can call you if we need. Don't worry, you shouldn't get any calls.""

Out of nowhere in my second month, the phone rang. It wasn't a supervisor, but some random outside line. I had been gated (put in the call center queue) for a department I didn't know anything about!

Not going to let myself get thrown for a loop, I put on my headset (brushing away the cobwebs) and gave as generic an intro as I could:

Me: ""Tech support, this is ScootersBricks, how may I assist you?""

Customer: ""Yeah. My card isn't working.""

Me: ""I am very sorry that you are having trouble.  Could you give me the model number for your device so I can pull up the tools I need to fix the problem for you?""

Customer: ""Yeah...it's the IM241 card."" 

At this point I am googling the number and find out that this is apparently some extremely archaic, super slow PCMCIA card that connects the user to the Internet using their Lextel SIM card at something near the speed of dial-up.  The problem is that 1: I had no idea that this card existed, and 2: I had no idea that our building even supported this card.

Me: ""Okay, can you give me a little bit more information about what the card is doing?""

Customer: ""Well I keep connecting but the red light won't come on.""

Me: ""And the red light is supposed to come on?""

Customer: ""OF COURSE!  You act like you've never heard of my device before or something!""

Me: (laughing) ""No worries there, sir.  We are extremely well-trained here and I think we can get some help for your issue today.  Now before I can get things working again would you mind if I put you on a brief two minute hold so I can bring up a few tools I'll need?""

I put the customer on hold, and frantically ran across the building to my supervisor.  I'll still never know why they sequestered all of us Jabber folks in the far corner.

I told my supervisor I'd just gotten a call for some project I'd never heard of.

Supervisor: ""Oh yeah, that's the PC card.  We get about five calls a year for them.""  

Turns out apparently my building volunteered to take over calls for this extremely outdated card that almost nobody still owned, but that they still somewhat supported.  Nobody in my building had, as far as I know, ever successfully helped a customer with their PC card--we would basically just take the calls and send them to wherever we thought was best.  Eventually the customer would either give up and cancel their card, or figure it out on their own.  I kinda think this was the goal--it isn't cost effective to have people take calls for a device that only a few dozen people in the US probably still used.

Me: ""Okay, so tell me what the hell to do?  I have a customer on hold right now. I need to know where to send him.""

Supervisor: ""Oh yeah, I forgot...I was supposed to give you this a few weeks ago.""  He opens up a drawer in his desk and pulls out a HUGE, spiral-bound training book. It is at least 2-3 inches thick.  He hands it to me. ""Here you go.""

Stunned, I walked back to my desk.  In my hand I had a 1000+ page training manual that apparently I was supposed to have read and been competent with.  

The next half hour was hell, mainly because I was determined to make this customer think that I actually knew what I was doing.  Finally I was able to get all of his information, we tried some basic troubleshooting (restarting the PC, re-inserting the card and SIM card...basically anything I could think of that may go wrong to a PCMCIA card in a laptop).

In the end, I decided that there was no way I could help him any further.  I called our Tier 3 department and explained the situation.  The response from the guy on the other line was essentially, ""Well, I have no idea how to help him either...but honestly nobody does.  Send him over and I'll see what we can do.""

I'll still never know what happened to the poor guy with the dinosaur PC card.  But the next time someone tells me ""Here, put on this headset. Don't worry, nobody should actually call it,"" I'm calling BS.

It only lasted one year before we were replaced by the Information Kiosk, which is telling of the type of problems I dealt with.

There were literally only two things I did:

1) Re-enact the step by step instructional posters located beside the coin operated photo copier. 

2) Read out the bright red message located beside the email login form (and emailed to the old accounts) telling students their password had been reset to their student number for the new mail server over the summer.

This story though has to do with a graduate student who showed up a month or two before the end of the fall semester to occasionally work in a quasi office space located behind me.  Sheila, as she was called, was a budding sociologist grad student employed by the school to quantify and interpret the opinions of the student masses regarding this new mail server.  And before you ask yes one of the questions was indeed ""Were you, as a returning student, notified of the change to your password.""

Now our school, with its fancy brand new mail server, was not one to use pen and paper when taking surveys.  No sir.  This survey was sent out in a mass email to the entire student body, and responses were typed directly into the body of a reply email to be sent on their merry way......  Now I'm not sure who came up with that clever plan, but whichever poor soul's inbox that load of garbage got dumped into somehow managed to parse and extract the relevant data and pass it onto Sheila.  Enter Sheila.

Now Sheila was one of those girls who thought she knew everything.  Strike that - she knew she knew everything.  Not only about current events and politics which no red blooded American would be caught dead not having the correct opinion on, but pretty much the driving force behind all individuals, societal groups, and the history of humankind as a whole...also computers.  Needless to say I was happiest when she was hunched over her keyboard one handed typing away than anything else.

A few weeks passed, Chanukah break was almost upon us, and apparently Sheila's report was soon to be presented to the powers that be.  It was around this time that I saw more and more of Sheila, and she began talking less and less.  One day while sitting at the desk with my phone on vibrate, I answered a call from my friend with an innocent ""How's it going?""  Cue Sheila sitting behind me.

Sheila: ""Humph! This is so stupid is how it's going!""

Me: Silently mouth ""sorry"" to her while gesturing to my phone.

Sheila: *Grumble Grumble*

-phone call eventually must end-

Sheila: ""*How*...Am *I*...Supposed to get *this*... *done*!""

Me (with much reservation): ""Is there anything I can help you with?""

Sheila: ""NO!""

Me: slowly turning away as not to attract any atten...

Sheila: ""Just look at this! They didn't give me enough time to enter all this info!""

I pause for a moment and take time to digest what has been said.  enter the info..enter the info..enter the info.  Just what is going on here.  She was always talking about 'implementation achievements', 'notification method efficiency', 'perception of professionalism' etc. I always thought she was working on fancy 3d graphs and colorful charts.

Me: ""Are you having trouble generating fancy 3d graphs and colorful charts?""

Sheila (whining): ""I haven't even gotten to that yet.  I'm still placing all the info in.""

Me (suspicious): ""I thought you said someone sent you all the info and you were analyzing it?""

Sheila (haughtily): ""Yes but to do that I have to put it all in don't I!""

Me: ""Well what format is it in?""

Sheila: *blankface*

Me: ""What type of file did it come in?""

Sheila: *blankface*

Me: ""What did the file extension say?""

Sheila: *blankface*

Me: ""What are the letters after the period in the file name you received?""

Sheila: *blankface*

Me: ""Ummm...what program are you putting it into?""

Sheila: ""Excel obviously!""

*The color drains from my face as I slowly rise from my seat and walk over to her computer.*

Open on her monitor are two windows.  One, a csv file opened in notepad.  Two, a spreadsheet in Excel - the cursor blinking ominously in a cell where she had paused in her work. Y-E-_.

Me: turning to look at her ""Are you typing in every singl...""

Sheila: ""I know!  I'm not stupid.  I tried to copy paste it in but it kept on going in wrong.""

Reaching over I silently commandeer the mouse from her right hand (the same hand she one hand types with), close both the windows, right-click on the csv document, ""open with...Excel""

I ask her if any other keys are not working.  She says she doesn't think so.  I hit the windows key to open the start menu so I can test out the shift key.  Nothing happens.

I'm 18 years old and working my first ""real"" job as general computer tech at an office full of mostly ancient machines: 386 Compaq Presarios running Windows 3.1. Yes, I said 1999.

Two of those computers were used by people doing actual work, while the rest of the office was mostly useless. So it became necessary to put them on a network so they could share data, and to have a copy of all the important files in both machines in case one of them died. So, I put a request for two network cards, and a crossover network cable (a router would never have been allowed as an expense). In order to make sure they understood I needed a crossover cable, I wrote in the paper, ""for direct connection between two computers"".

A couple of weeks later, I get the two network cards. Awesome! And I get.... this cable: http://i.imgur.com/Mocga.jpg

That, my friends, is ""Direct Cable Connection"" cable. It was a feature of Windows 95 where you could connect two computers by their parallel ports, and Windows would transfer data between both. Most certainly not a network cable.

Now, by my description so far, you can probably guess that asking for a proper cable would have just led to delays and frustration. And because it was my first job, I had a lot of pressure on me to make things work with whatever I had, or they'd find someone else to do it.

So... soldering iron in hand, I proceeded to add a parallel port to an Ethernet card, making it pin-compatible with the DCC cable. Once I was done, I took a picture to forever remind me of that moment. I still have it, and I will share it with you: http://i.imgur.com/LPb0u.jpg

I still feel extremely conflicted about this. In one hand, it worked. I am extremely proud that the two computers were networked on the same day, and productivity increased, while risk of data loss lowered a lot.

She was on an old desktop, and messaged me that she was having trouble setting up video chat on Facebook.  The best I could get is ""It's just not working.  We can't connect.""

I figured that she was either having some trouble with an external webcam, or just didn't have some random setting right.  She insists she's got it right.  So I figure I'll walk through things step by step with her.  I log into Facebook.  Check.  Hit the ""Start Video Call"" button.  Check.  Download the plug-in as prompted.  Check.  Installed the plug-in.  Check.  Blah blah blah.  By now, she's just going through the motions and blindly clicking away at the buttons, and she manages to successfully start a video chat with me.

Sitting in her bedroom.  On the edge of her bed.  Completely topless.

Her desktop was in the living room, and I fully expected to see her there, probably with kids running around in the background.  What I did *not* know is that they had recently bought a laptop and planned on sharing a little christmas eve online sexy time.  She had simply clicked one button too many, started the video chat, and basically gave me the christmas present she was planning on giving her husband.  

'Twas an awkward four seconds until she jumped in front of the camera, covered it with her hand, and frantically hit random buttons until she turned the thing back off.

Within a month, the level 2 tech was fired for showing up drunk to work. My boss decided that, instead of filling the role, we'd go without a level 2 tech. This worked for a while and the levels were removed from the tech titles.

After about 6 months, the contract for our guy that worked in the mailroom was expiring. The board of directors liked the guy, and asked us to take him on in our still vacant role. We did, but his main job was destruction of old data as we were preparing to move buildings. Things went fine for another 4 or 5 months, until we got a phone call one day. A woman was having trouble with her laptop and called us to get help. However, she did not work for us and never had. Confused, we asked how she got our number. Her response: ""From the sticker on the bottom of the laptop.""

It turns out the guy from the mailroom had been putting laptops in the bottom of bins, taking the bins out filled with trash, and then selling the laptops on downtown street corners, without removing the asset stickers that included our phone number. We estimated he did this with about 20 laptops, and we didn't notice because my boss had him perform the previous inventory. Needless to say, he was fired and I had to perform a full company inventory of all equipment to see if anything else was missing.

The part that pissed me off though, was after the CIO found out, he came to me and said ""Have you ever stolen anything from this company?"" I was the only one he asked.

I'm standing in front of the microwave, heating up my wonderful frozen breakfast sandwiches when a mid level manager with an inflated self worth comes in.

MLM: ""Hey! Good morning!""

Shit, I recognize this tone.

Me: ""What's up?""

MLM: ""I went to install iTunes on my laptop this weekend and it wouldn't let me.""

Me: ""You're right it wouldn't, I stripped your admin privileges when you showed me you couldn't handle them. On top of that, iTunes is not company software and is a big no no. If I find it on company machines, I remove it without any questions.""

You might be wondering about the admin privileges part. Because we don't have anything like Team Viewer or GoToAssist, my solution was to give the laptop users local admin rights on their machines. The caveat is that if they abuse it, they get it stripped. This particular manager had it stripped about a month back when he handed the laptop to me covered in spyware and junkware that his kids had installed.

MLM: ""Is this a new policy? Why me?""

Me: ""Because I had to re-image your machine since you were irresponsible with it. It's not a new policy, I'm just enforcing the old one.""

MLM: ""Is this personal?""

Me: ""Nope, just policy. You're not the first nor the last.""

He huffed and walked off with a scowl on his face. Wonderful way to start the week, right?

The microwave dings and I sit down at my desk, opening up Facebook and Reddit to check out what happened in the 8 hours I was sleeping. A different MLM appears at my doorway, this guy is fairly bright but has fallen prey to a series of unfortunate events in the past. I know its never good.

**Previous Chapters:**

[Chapter 1 - My first job in IT](http://redd.it/xtlhx) 

[Chapter 2 - Store uniforms](http://redd.it/xyazr)

* * *

I was happy to finally have a decent uniform to wear. I had been walking around in questionable clothing for far too long. My new shirt was light pink and had the store logo across it. The only downside was the new name badge that came with it: I don’t like the idea of strangers calling me by my name and pretending they are on a first name basis with me. 

The name badge was part of the second wave of the plans from Ron and Don to revamp the store. In a second store meeting, they had told us that they wanted to change the store even more. It needed to be spacious and full of light with demos of our products on the tables for customers to try out. They clearly had been to an Apple Store and thought, “we can do this”; they could not.

After about six weeks of planning, arguing, and having an even messier store, they were done with the  makeover.The result was what looked like an counterfeit back-alley Apple Store. The store windows now were completely free of the promotional posters that had been up there for too long. The glass was  tainted with adhesives for weeks afterwards. The tables were put in the center of the store and had refurbished notebooks on them. The desktops were banished to the right side of the store with the software and accessories on the left. New was the table full of iPod knock-offs that would be the new, “can I interest you in…” item. 

The store still kept many of its old features. The walls were still brownish (they used to be white a long time ago) and the floor was old grey carpeting that had had its time. The bins containing all kinds of USB-gadgets and promotional displays still were scattered around the store. 

On the outside they did nothing; the paint was still chipping off and the street was still dirty. The store sign had changed by now, but it was poorly secured and looked like it was leaning towards the left. I am honestly still surprised it never fell off. In the street we now had a poster board that detailed our special offers - special in the sense we didn’t actually have any offers. Just full prices disguised as discounts.

With the store now having a full fledged identity crisis, the attention fell on the back of the store. Ron wanted it to be cleaned and to throw away anything that we did not need -- the hoarding was over. With my Saturday shift coming up, he decided I could clean up the back. I don’t know why he picked me, but I was happy, since it beat working in the store.

The back was messy and looked old. The walls were hidden behind rows and rows of metal bookcases storing inventory, old computers, and boxes full of parts. On the right was Ron’s office a small kitchen and the toilet. I never really went into Ron’s office unless there was a good reason; I was afraid of what I would find there. 

The part of the walls that were free of the bookcases were used for storing boxes. The only thing that looked remotely new in this place was the light above the safety exit hanging next to the door. They had it replaced before I came to work here under pressure from the fire department. Otherwise it would have have been an archaeologically perfectly preserved 80’s IT-workspace.

In the middle of the room we had the work benches. 2 big grey tables with another on top. On top bench we had all the PCs and notebooks we had to work on with their information sheet taped on the front. Aside from the ungrounded extension cords it was actually a decent workplace. 

Not knowing where to start with cleaning the mess up, I looked around and decided to start with one of the blue plastic containers in the metal bookcases. It contained all kinds different cables that appeared to be in the middle of an orgy. I was not going to untangle that mess, so I put it back and slapped a sticker saying “Cables” on it.

I then took out the next box and started looking through it: mostly old video and sound cards. I was ready to put it back and slap an “Audio/Video” label on it when something caught my eye. I took it out and I could not for the life of me identify it at first. It was an tennis ball covered with screws, all of which were pointing outward. You could have really hurt somebody with it. I asked myself what it was for, and moreover, why we even had it. Asking Richard a couple days later, he told me they had played a match of “pain ball.” Pain ball was a game they had played to see who could handle more pain. He showed me all the damage they had done to the store with it; broken LCD screens - carefully hidden behind boxes - and damaged walls.

It is about now that I should tell you more about Frank and Richard. They were - to put it kindly - practical jokers. They had a spirit of having fun around them and whenever an opportunity arose, they took it, no matter the consequences, costs, or ethics involved. They treated everybody equally. Them buying me an outfit was an opportunity to play a joke on me, made possible by Don and Ron.

Their other hobby was doing imitations of _Jackass_ and building things. Strange things. When I had put the pain ball away and went on with cleaning up the store, I found many more of their treasures. They later showed me how all their devices worked.

Hidden between the CD and DVD drives, I found the Stabber: a repurposed slimline DVD-drive that, instead of ejecting a DVD, would eject a knife. The Shooter was a collection of high RPM fans that been taped together.With part of their casing removed, it worked like a waterwheel, shooting away pieces of cereal. What took the cake for me was the walking video card. They had taken an old card and put 4 fans on it, their casings removed. Being hooked up to a small battery it would sort of walk. It was surreal to see, if totally pointless.

Having cleaned out most of the back, I turned my eye to a pile of magazines wedged between two of the shelves. They were old PC magazines - editions from 1995 to the early 2000s. I decided to throw them all away and grabbed a container to bring them to the paper bin just around the corner. While I was picking them up to put in the container, my curiosity got the better of me. I wanted to skim the magazines, just to look at what was the “must buy” hardware at the time. Computers were expensive back then. I had gone through about three quarters of the pile when something came up that was not a PC-magazine. It was a porn magazine, vintage 1997. 

It was unexpected, but I wasn’t fazed by it. I had never actually browsed a porn magazine before, and opened it up to quickly find out that the theme was barely legal. It was really questionable. What made me throw it in the trash right away was that - how cliche it may sound - the pages were sticky. I did not want to touch it anymore. I went to the kitchen to scrub my hands with soap and a brush over and over again till they were red from irritation. It wasn’t super effective, and I still felt dirty. I decided it was better to just leave it. It was either from Ron or Don, and I did not want to know which.

Later that week, I started working on about 5 orphaned PCs I found during the cleanup. I had connected the first PC, hit the power button and a well known beep was heard followed by a rattling hard disk busy with loading whatever ancient version of Windows would be on the PC.

What was missing, however, was the screen. No input whatsoever - just a vague reflection of me in the glass CRT monitor. I checked the VGA cable: it correctly attached to the monitor, and, reaching under the desk, I determined that it was attached as it should be. There was a lot of dust, though. Already on the verge of sneezing my eyeballs out from all the dust, I managed to open the side of the computer up. It seemed to be working on dust: everything was grey aside from the video card, which was, rather... Cheetos orange. Upon closer inspection, I found that it was indeed Cheetos dust and smudges covering the entire card. The heat sink had been removed and replaced by Cheetos. Unsurprisingly, Cheetos don’t transfer heat well. After cleaning the computer of dust and Cheetos, I replaced the video card and tried to boot again. The computer started.

Two or three computers without advanced Cheetos cooling down the road, I encountered another computer that did not work. I opened the computer up and quickly my jaw dropped. There was mold growing around the CPU. It was disgusting to look at. Baffled at how it was possible I took off the cooling. They had replaced the thermal paste with cheese, probably in an attempt to make CPU grilled cheese. Idiots.

This guy called me at Derp pro support saying that he had 2 systems with ""issues""- the first one was ""holding him hostage"" on his favorite games site with some popup that wouldn't let him close the browser. From the start he was snippy, demanding, &amp; standoffish- not the best way to start a call &amp; certainly not the best way to get any more than the bare minimum of service from me. If you're nice to me, I'll bend the rules like nobody's business to make you happy. If you treat me like crap &amp; act like a petulant child, you will get the absolute bare minimum of effort that it takes for me to keep my job. He starts off bitching about having to talk to an Indian person last time he called in, which pissed me off because I hate racists with a passion. Then, my attempt to confirm his service tag &amp; system type was met with ""I don't know, you should already know that!"", and every instruction I gave him was met with ""I'm not a techy person, what are you talking about?!"". 


By some miracle, I managed to talk him through opening the task manager &amp; closing out IE, and then he started talking about his other system which was ""locking him out"". I was already prepping my ""sorry, we don't crack passwords"" speech, assuming he had just forgotten his password, when he began describing the FBI virus. To begin with, viruses are best-effort only for us, and I rarely bother with them because they're annoying &amp; a waste of my time because the cust usually ends up reinstalling windows in the end anyway. But whatever, I'll pretend to take a shot at it just to shut him up. I had him boot into safe mode(which took 3 tries due to him ignoring my instructions), but FBI was still locking him out in safe mode. He was hosed. I began to explain that if he can't even get into the system in safe mode, there was no hope of me fixing the system &amp; that he'd have to OSRI. This was met with ""NO NO NO! I am NOT reinstalling windows! The last time I had this problem that Indian guy remoted in and fixed everything for me!"" The last time...? You mean you've had this problem before &amp; didn't take precautions to keep it from happening again? Oh what, you DO have virus protection? You mean that stagnant copy of Norton- the least effective virus scanner available- that's not even running in the background &amp; hasn't been updated in 2 years? No no, I'm sure you're fine. Totes not your fault that you keep getting viruses!


I told him I'd love to remote in &amp; have a go at it if I *could*, but since he could not even log on to the system, we would be unable to get connected at all due to our remote access SW being web-based &amp; requiring hand-input token codes for each connection. He just kept repeating that the last guy had just fixed it for him &amp; that I should too. I was beginning to get really pissed off at this point. I have little patience for idiots, and even less patience for belligerent, rude idiots who won't listen to what I'm telling them. 


I hadn't yet pulled up the tag for this second system, he had just launched right into the spiel without even giving it to me. I got the tag from him(after again explaining what a service tag was &amp; where to find it, and listening to him bitch about how much trouble it was to read off seven digits to me), pulled up the account, &amp; saw that he didn't even have a support contract on this system. **Score**. I was not obligated to help this douchabeefy at all anymore :D I informed him of his lack of coverage &amp; explained that I could not actually provide *any* sort of support for this system at all. It had been out of warranty for an entire year, and the last 2 times he called in he had been charged for support. The notes even said ""fee based support"". I pointed this out to him &amp; he yelled ""NONONONONO! I paid to extend my warranty on October 1st of last year! You guys charged me $109.95, and that was for a warranty extension! I'm looking at the sheet in my hand right now"" 


""Ok sir, since you have the order sheet right there, can you read me off the order number so I can check to see if maybe there's been a mistake on our end?""


""There IS no order number! It's just a charge! You guys charged me so you have to help me cause I'm the customer!""


Ohhh, he's pulling the ""customer is always right"" card. I'm gonna have fun shooting this one down &gt;:D


""I'm sorry sir but there are no active support contracts showing up on this system, and unless you can give me an order number for this warranty extension there's really nothing else I can do for you today."" I replied, my voice sweeter than Jewish wine.


""WHY WOULD I MAKE THIS UP?! I PAID YOU GUYS!!!"" (Uhh, you would make it up in order to get free service on a machine that's out of warranty! Durr.)


""I'm not accusing you of making anything up sir, I'm just letting you know our policy and that I am not able to help you unless you have a valid support contract with us.""


He began literally WHINING like a 3 year old having a tantrum over forbidden candy. ""Come OOOOooonnnn-uh! You HAVE to help me! The last guy helped me, so I MUST have a warranty! I'm the customer and I'm always right!""


""I'm sorry sir, but it says in the notes that the last 2 times we helped you, it was fee-based support and you were charged for our services. If we help you again today, there will be another charge.""


""THERE WAS NO CHARGE! THEY NEVER CHARGED ME LAST TIME! YOU'RE LYING!""


I'm having to mute him to laugh at this point, and I'm giving my greatly amused supervisor a play by play via IM. ""That's what the $109.95 charge was for, sir. That was not a warranty extension, that was a service charge because your system was out of warranty the last 2 times you called in. If it had been a warranty extension, there would be an order number on the paper."" 


""This is ridiculous, you should just help me!!!"" (And I probably would have at least tried to if you hadn't been a total assmunch from the moment I answered the phone!)

""Yeah, well... rules can have exceptions...""


At this point I could tell he knew he was defeated. His once booming voice had become small &amp; weak. He then asked how much it would cost to extend his warranty. I told him I'd have to transfer him to another department for that, and that even if he did extend his contract it wouldn't cover existing issues. I think he may have actually been weeping at this point, because he just quietly asked, without arguing, how much it would cost to have us clean up the virus. I transferred him to our fee-based support department, but I'm not sure what they could do about it since he couldn't even get into his system to initiate a remote session. But meh, not my problem.


What a mook. I don't know if he was trying to pull one over on me or was just genuinely too stupid to recognize over $200 worth of support charges on his credit card, but he can have fun paying another $110 dollars to remove a virus that could easily be taken care of for FREE with a simple OS reinstall. 


I will never understand what makes a grown adult think that throwing tantrums like a 2 year old is ever even remotely OK ಠ_ಠ

**EDIT:** OK, forget I said ANYTHING AT ALL about the racism thing, jesus. I guess you had to actually be there and hear the way the guy was talking about the Indian rep he last worked with to understand why I feel he was being racist. Trust me, it was NOT along the lines of ""Gee, I sure don't enjoy talking to people whom I have trouble understanding &amp; who have no power to actually help me!"", it was more like ""God I hate talking to those stupid freakin' Indians!"". The rep had fixed his issue without any problems &amp; the customer did not mention any communication issues at all. His only issue with the rep was that he was Indian &amp; had a foreign-sounding name, hence why I made the accusation of racism.

This happened a couple of months back. I'm sitting at my desk when I get a phone call from one of the users. It goes like this:

Me: What do you mean it just disappeared.  

Her: I was typing an email, pressed some key and it all just vanished and came back to the homepage. 

Me: Ok, let me go take a look at it.

I hang up and come over to her office. She says to me ""it just disappeared"". I look over to the browser and find that another tab is open on the home page. I then hover over the IE icon to find that she is indeed opening everything in a new window instead of a new tab. I proceed to close the tab and then go back to my desk.

We were 1 of 4 helpdesks setup to support this group of hospitals, with each helpdesk assigned specific hospitals to support.  

In addition to our level 1 support, our particular helpdesk also did basic operations support, such as monitoring application interfaces.  We did this for all of the hospitals, regardless of if they were assigned to us for level 1 support or not.

One day, an interface went down for a HospitalX.  The error it was receiving was ""Fatal: Client Died"", which was a fairly common error - it usually means there's not enough room for the log to continue growing.  If left unattended it could cause larger issues, so these are treated as priority issues.

At this point in the story it's important to note that HospitalX was not assigned to our helpdesk.  In fact, the helpdesk (we'll call them HelpdeskX) that did support HospitalX was located *at* HospitalX and it was the only Hospital they were assigned to support.  This actually was cause for a lot of resentment for the other helpdesks as the call volume was not evenly distributed... but I digress.

So, back to the story.... we issued a high priority ticket to the appropriate team at HospitalX, they address and resolve the issue, and that's that.   Or so I thought.  

Each helpdesk had their own team lead, and I was the lead for mine.  One of the duties of the lead was to review priority tickets for your assigned hospitals to ensure everything was going smoothly and address any issues.  I get an email from HelpdeskX's lead with the subject ""*URGENT* HIPAA Reminder!"" and the only thing in the body being ""Please remind your staff that it is a hipaa violation to put any patient information, including status of the patient, in a ticket"".  That was it, there wasn't anything else for me to go off of as to what prompted this email.

So, I call up HelpdeskX's team lead and ask what this was about.  She said she had been reviewing priority tickets and came across one where we had put that a patient had died!  Of course, this was a serious accusation, so I asked for the ticket number.  Pulling up the ticket, I had to supress the urge to laugh and spent the next 15 minutes trying to explain to her that the ""Client"" in ""Fatal: Client Died"" was an application, not a patient.",,False,,t5_2sfg5,False,,,True,t3_xrmqw,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/xrmqw/if_your_patient_has_died_please_submit_a_priority/,

This one technically isn't a tech support story, or a helpdesk story, but that's okay!

So, some backstory: in my department, all the student workers (me included) have to work at least 4 hours a week of lab sitting shifts. So today I'm monitoring the computer science building's main Linux lab this morning, and I get up from my (insanely comfortable, holy mother of God) chair to do my rounds.

I walk past a lab station that seems to have eraser shavings all over it. Upon closer inspection, it's not eraser shavings. It's hair.

Yes, *hair*. Little bits of it. Covering this desk.

After puking in my mouth a little, I run back to my supply closet, pick up some 409 and paper towels, and very carefully clean up the desk.

Glad that's over, right?

NOPE.

Doing rounds an hour later, I see the same desk, covered in little bits of hair again, this time with a user sitting at it. This guy, I kid you not, pulls out a Braun electric trimmer and starts shaving his rather extensive Movember 'stache, right there at his desk.

I ask him what he's doing. He says that I have no right to tell him to stop, and begins rambling before I can get another word in. And I quote, $TheStatementInTheTitle. (Yes I'm lazy, deal with it.)

So, I go back to my desk, log into our userdir server using my fancy L2 Helpdesk sudo powers, and remove his write privileges from his home folder.

He storms into my office about 10 minutes later, yelling about how he can't save anything on his computer. 

I tell him, ""Oh sorry, I meant to take away your *shave* privileges, not your save privileges! Let me fix that for you!""

Now, two things could have happened in this situation. Either:

1. he could have punched me in the face, or
2. he could have backed away slowly, realizing that I had complete and unchecked power over all of his files.

I am a senior tech. All names have been changed to protect my job. 

I am on the phone to $nice_guy_older_field_tech. I have a long history with $NGOFT, as we resolved several issues at the regulated facility that he is working at. The site had hired a company with a fast talking sales droid who originally sold them our product, whose company did a drive by installation that was unacceptable. $NGOFT and his company was hired to re-do the install to correct the numerous problems. 
One of the issues that I had identified with the install was that the servers had been installed into an unlocked disused basement room with little airflow and no power backups. The server towers were plopped under a desk with loose cabling leading to a switch sitting exposed on the desk. Their first major outage was due to a power loss that caused drive corruption.
$NGOFT responded by building the room into a real computer space with actual server server racks, a UPS and a backup tape array. The security system servers and the surveillence camera server and storage array had been installed only a couple weeks before. 
The UPS was installed at the bottom of the rack, and the only problem with the whole deal was that the UPS had shipped without a couple of parts including the comm cable, switchguard and software.  
The customer was duly impressed with his display of competence. 

Which brings me to my real story. 
We were doing a significant patch install. This required stopping the redundancy services to apply the patch to the common application drive. We were doing this at 10pm, well after the facility had closed. 
We had just restarted the mirror process, when $NGOFT slipped on some condensate from the additional AC (the facility had not run the drain line properly) and kicked the faceplate of the UPS. The switchguard was still missing, and he made full contact with the UPS power switch. A moment later the phone line got real quiet except for $NGOFT's profuse swearing. 

The swearing got worse when $NGOFT got the rack started up again and found that both drive arrays were corrupted. Thankfully he had done backups, I walked him through some hack n' slash surgery to bring my company's product back online. Three nights later we were complete again. 

TL;DR: missing three dollar part causes outage at major site, good tech manages to recover system because he had backups.

So you all know from [the last story](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/r58tc/how_i_turned_a_demotion_into_giving_me_power_over/) that the office manager had bumped me out of the office tech position without actually thinking about the resulting side effects. When he realized that, technically, in an office without a tech guy all the computer problems are the responsibility of *the office manager*, and that almost 90 people had suddenly discovered that their [magic fix-everything icon](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/qrqsa/ten_minutes_a_day/) suddenly wasn't working any more, he immediately leapt into uninformed action.

His first attempt at replacing me was to determine who else in the office had computer knowledge sufficient to address all the common issues. The answer, as I knew he would eventually find out, was that there was ONE other young, technically-minded and hyper-competent staff member on the roster.

What he didn't know was that she was my girlfriend.
   
  
   
His overtures, in an attempt to get her to replace me, were comical enough. And no doubt, she could have done the job - but she was pissed off at his treatment of me, and told him in no uncertain terms where he could stick his excuse for a management style.

Some weeks later, with computers and printers lying stricken all around the office and no-one fixing them, the office manager managed to scrounge up someone from outside. This dude couldn't have been more than eighteen or nineteen, if that, and he had no more computer knowledge than the manager. However, as the position was technically 'filled', the manager didn't have to listen to staff complaining about the busted computers any more, or why he wasn't allowing me to fix them.

The replacement's sole talent, as far as I could tell, consisted of the ability to turn up every morning wearing a tie, which was more than the rest of the non-management staff bothered with. This earned him the moniker of the Guy in the Tie, which I can remember even now despite his actual name being lost to the mists of time.

The Guy in the Tie was helpful, willing, spineless, and absolutely useless at technical diagnoses. Given that amount of free time I had, I even made it worse on occasion by trailing him around the office, sticking my feet up on a desk while he labored fruitlessly over some piece of equipment for half an hour, and when he left stepping over and repairing it in thirty seconds. It got to the point where whenever he turned up, any staff in the vicinity would give him a look which said ""Go away so the grinning guy behind you can provide the help you obviously can't.""

It probably didn't do much for either his concentration *or* his reputation. Heh. And of course, every time a staff member cracked and came to me directly to have something fixed, I'd shrug and say that I wasn't allowed to because of the office manager's decision to put Youngster McWearsATie in that job.
   
  
   
Fortunately, while all this was incredibly amusing and gave me a spring in my step each day, it didn't stop me finding new ways to improve office efficiency and save money. Which is how I came up with the Cancellation Detector.
   
  
   
But that's a story for another time.

stationed at a Catholic high school. Recently we have had the pleasure
of acquiring a new teacher with the ethereal voice of a buzz saw,
irreparably damaged hair from 60 years of chemically treated self
esteem issues and such very, very...orange skin. I get an email to the
help desk requesting that I set her up in the active directory and exchange server and
give her a quick run down of how things work around here. I assign her
a password, deliver it to her, introduce myself, etc. Seems like a
nice enough lady.


About a week goes by when I receive an email from her:

""HEY SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME MY EMAIL DOES NOT WORK.""

Oh no? Begrudgingly I go to her room to pay her a visit. Turns out she
just assumed it wasn't working because she wasn't getting responses
from other faculty members about an email that didn't warrant a
response. I start to humor the possibility that this lady is going to
start becoming a very frustrating part of my work day.


A few days later there's a knock on my office door. It's you know who:

""Hey can you help me my password does not work.""

""Doesn't work? That's unusual.""

""It doesn't work!""

""Ok, let's go take a look.""


It works. Oh her password works alright. What DOESN'T work is the
random new password she just decided she wanted to start using.


""Where did you get this from? This is not your password""

""I called someone and they said it was my password""

""What? Who did you call?""

""Diane.""

""Diane who?""

""Diane ______""

""Who's that?""

""My friend.""


The person she called does not work at our school, they have no
affiliation with us whatsoever. She called her friend. And her friend
just told her a password. Any password.


""Have you tried using the password I assigned to you that has worked
for the past week?

""No""

""Ok then, we're done here. You will be fine, use the credentials I
provided you with on day 1 and please do not stray from that log in information.""


Another few days pass by when there is a loud pound on the door. It startles me as i quickly sit upright and choke on my coffee. What the hell was that? I get up to go see
what the noise is all about and as I approach the office door to grab
the handle i'm greeted with a repeated, booming knock like a broken
piston in a getaway driver's car. I take a deep, frustrated breath and
open the door.


""Oh good morning _____, how can I help you?""

""HELP MY PASSWORD ISN'T WORKING!""

""You didn't start using a new password did you?""

""NO! PLEASE HELP!""


Class is in session and teachers are all looking out their doors to
see what the noise is all about. They see their new coworker, arms
flailing, raving about a trivial issue and they roll their eyes as she has
already established herself as a less than desirable individual to
interact with. I catch a couple of them chuckle and point at me that already know how much I love talking to this woman.

I go back to her room with her to have her show me the problem. She
sits down to type her password and reveals the issue to me:


""So everything was fine but I don't know how to capitalize the dollar
sign in my password and it always worked before but now it doesn't.""

""Wait, *what*? You can't capitalize the dollar sign in your password?""

""No, I can't.""

""That's because no one can. You do not need to capitalize the dollar sign. Just enter it.""

""Well how do I enter a lower case dollar sign without making all the letters lower case?""


That's where I began to explain to her how to use a keyboard. The
first time I have ever actually had to explain, to a teacher, how to
use a keyboard. I typed up simple, step by step instructions, printed
them out and left them on her desk. Haven't heard from her since and
I don't know if that's a good or bad thing. Someone may have forgotten to explain to her how to breathe.



**TL;DR**: Crazy lady randomly uses different password. Can't log in because she's making all sorts of attempts to capitalize the dollar sign in her password.

One time, many years ago, I worked in internal-support, and did for 4 years.

I did hardware support, OS, application, ad-hoc application, and programming too.

There was just me, our manager who was always off-site and one other guy, and eventually the guy left.

It meant I was the ONLY PERSON on site (400 people in a production place, shop-floor printing system, directors computers, networking hardware... the lot), I also had remote calls for a place 150 miles away!

When the IT phone rang, I answered, when someone needed some local help, I was the one who went down there. When  someone needed access to someone elses account, or there own (face-palm) - it was me.

I was the Alpha and fucking Omega.

It meant I was in a position too few support guys are... I got the calls, and the follow up calls... I got all the requests, and knew ALL the situations people got themselves in with IT. The third coffee on the keyboard, the mobile dropped into the BBQ. The 10th password reset that week...

You know ALL the bullshit excuses people give? I got them, and I fucking QUIZZED THEM on it.

Yeah! Air-punch!

""Hello, IT.""

""Yeah, Stacie's still not got an account, where is it, I phoned last week for that!""

""You did? Oh dear, let me look at what's happening.""

""You guys in IT suck, you know that? We're waiting here for her to log in!""

Now normally your IT Support app may not have ALL the notes in it, because someone forgot to add them, so in situations like this you have to give them the benefit of the doubt.

""I'm sorry, there's no record, let me rush and do it for you now!""

No, that's not what happened, I'b been taking ALL the calls recently, and I knew what was up straight away.""

""Oh, Mike - remember that Email I sent you with the ""New staff request"" form? It was marked urgent, and important?""

""Yeah, I replied to that.""

I look in my Inbox....

""Yes you did, 4:55 Tuesday the 18th, and you said ""SarahC I haven't had time today, I'll email you tomorrow.""...... I've checked and you never sent the form.""

""Oh... wait! You had the information, you could have done it!""

""How can I set up accounts where I don't know the name's spelling? If we get audited, where is the paperwork to show she's a genuine account holder? That's why we NEED that paperwork.""

""Can't you just rush it through now?""

""No, she needs setting up on several systems first. I'll get back to you when it's done. BUT REMEMBER - if some urgent hardware failure happens, I have to do that first, it could be ALL DAY before her accounts ready. 

Next time remember to send me the paperwork, ok?""

""Yeah, hm. right.""

""Ok, bye.""

Mwahahaha! Motherfucker tried pinning it on IT! Not while I'm on the case.
If he'd have told the truth, I'd have done it for him while he waited, but he lied.... fuck im!

""Hello IT,""

""Yeah, hi! The stock's missing in warehouse D on the system, the IT systems keep fucking up, it's the 4th time this week. I don't have time for this shit, I'm busy!""

I recognise her voice...

""Sheila, I've told you how to do this FOUR TIMES this week, it's NOT an IT problem, it's your problem because you don't open the menu marked ""Outstanding stock"" and process it by hand.
Remember, you're supposed to do that EVERY DAY! Now I'm going to have to spend the morning working through the data from backup.""

(she's still annoyed!) ""Well, do that then, and I'll take it from there."" (she said that before)

""I can't, there's a fault on line 5 that I have to sort out. You're just going to have to go out there into the warehouse (-24 degrees!) and stock-take on paper, and type them in by hand.""

""There's 200 pallets! I can't do that!""

""You're going to have to, or your boss will want to know why not.""

""Oh. Yeah. Ok."" (huphs)

I didn't get any more calls like that.  =)


There's many others - it gave me such job satisfaction smartening up the way people worked - they couldn't land it on IT's doorstep, or blame us for things we'd done wrong when we hadn't...

Different systems than most tech support you guys are probably used to but the basic idea is the same.

One day I get a call from a McDonalds because none of their headsets work. Definitely an unusual thing, since we tend to see individual headsets stop working, but not the whole system. Sometimes it does happen, though, since there is a main control unit that all the individual headsets communicate with. People don't really mess with it very often, and most don't even know it's there, but sometimes it goes down.

I spent a good hour to two hours on this thing, checking everything I know to check, even going so far as to having a nearby store try their headsets on the frequency this one is running on to see if there is interference issues.

Then he said it. I never knew before that moment that any combination of works could ever cause me as much physical pain as the store's food has so often caused me. 

Him: ""Is it a problem if it's fried?""

Me: ""I'm sorry what? Has there been a power surge or something?""

Him: ""No fried. Someone took this computer box and threw it in the fryer when he quit so it's fried. Will it still work?""

Me: ""You're asking me if this plastic box.... which is basically a computer with an antenna... will survive a deep fryer....?""

Him: ""Yeah, that's not a problem, right?""

Anyways, because I was really the only person in the building who knew how to operate a computer, I was also impromptu IT. To be fair, I'm really nowhere near professional IT, but I've worked with computers for a long time, and can help out with a lot of simple problems.

So one day I come in and the wireless network is down. Everyone who is hardwired on the first floor is fine, but all of us on the second floor who used wireless aren't getting any internet. So I go down to our server/networking room and start poking around to see what I can figure out. 

Common sense told me that our wireless router (an apple airport) wasn't working, and sure enough the light is blinking orange. So I try a bunch of different things, swapping out ethernet cables, rebooting the router, logging into the router admin and checking all the wireless settings, etc. Can't get anything to work. I dig around and find a Linksys router, set it up, create a new wireless network, etc, works fine. I go around and get everyone set up on the new network, then we're good to go.

I walk over to his office and he proudly loads up a webpage. So I have him open his wireless network list and point out that he is connected to the new network that I set up. What's more, I don't even SEE the old network on the list. He begins ranting that he swears he had it working and he will fix it shortly. So I walk out to check the airport itself.

1331950754.0,642,self.talesfromtechsupport,r0axt,Mission Critical server in service for 2 years with no working hard drives,804,162,218,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/r0axt/mission_critical_server_in_service_for_2_years/,"There seems to be a recurring theme in corporate I.T. that for any given server, the more money it will cost the company if it goes down, the more neglected it will be. May I present to you the most important, most neglected server I have ever had the pleasure of putting out of its misery.

Once upon a time there was a large national corporation in the financial business. As this company grew, there came to be one whole organization in charge of telephony, and one in charge of computers. As time went by, telephony slowly became part of I.T. Phones were just IP connected devices, phone lines became SIP trunks, and PBXs became just another server in the rack. Well, everywhere except for at _this_ corporation. There, the telephony team made a special point to control their telephony hardware, even though they were just servers very much the same as any other in the data center.

Shortly after I was hired there I got an alert that a server had a failed hard drive in a mirrored set. ""No Problem!"" I think, I'll just order a new drive and this will be like any other day!

WRONG.

First I find the server, and realize that it is some frankenstein freak of nature abomination with a consumer class case, a half dozen T1 cards in it, and no hot swap hard drive bays. Wow, okay, I guess I'll have to schedule an outage to replace that IDE drive.

WRONG.

This particular server was one of the telephony team's server. I had never seen one of these telephony people, but boy did I ever hear from them when I scheduled the outage! This particular atrocity was in fact the most important server in the whole building! It provided a text-to-speech engine which meant that if it went down, every single customer calling this corporation would be met with silence! Call into the automated bill payment system? Silence. Call the main line? Silence. You see, this server could not be down, not for 1 second, ever.

""But that other hard disk will go eventually,"" I said! Didn't matter, the server can't go down. Let's fast forward about six months. Lo and behold, the other hard drive failed. However, the system did not crash! You see, the application never performed disk I/O, so it never hung waiting for the drives that were long gone. You couldn't log in to the server, as an audit record couldn't be written to the log. You couldn't do anything to the server really. BUT, the application kept dutifully providing synthesized voice to thousands of callers a day despite all this.

""It's fate is sealed now,"" I told the telephony team. If that server is ever powered off or crashes it will never boot again. This, of course, did not seem to concern them, as everything was ""working"".

Eventually I forgot about the server. Months went by, then turned into years. New applications were built, new servers were installed, old hardware was removed, hundreds of millions of dollars were spent.

Then I heard about the fact that the whole data center was going to have to power down for a weekend! Something to do with the electric coming into the building, a big change, had to be done.

""Well I wonder what ever happened to that server with no hard drives,"" I thought. It was STILL THERE! It WAS STILL RUNNING WITH NO DRIVES! How could this be!?

I talked at length with the telephony team. They were furious, and emitted rage in every possible direction regardless of who was talking to them or whether they had anything to do with the mandatory power outage. They said it couldn't happen! There was no backup of the text-to-speech server, nor was there any copy of the program that was even running on there. Also over the past two years while the server sat there with no hard drives, nobody had bothered to prepare for it going down in any way.

It was like watching a hurricane; everything was going to get fucked up but there wasn't anything anybody could do about it. Eventually the day came for the power outage. It was over thanksgiving weekend, and I had volunteered all my time to participate, just because I wanted to be the one to power off that server. It was so bad that even up into that weekend the telephony team was calling and saying that the server could ABSOLUTELY NOT be powered off.

I made sure to pull the plug on that one myself.

The next three weeks were wonderful. All the fallout of a full power off of the data center, apps down, failed hard drives, missed reports, etc., was all drowned out by the impact of the telephony team needing to rebuild the text-to-speech system from scratch.

I once had a customer call in, trying to get support for a six-year-old notebook (!). It wan't running as fast as he wanted it to (what a surprise). Helpfully, he had already tried to fix it himself (!). I mean, this customer wasn't any old regular customer; he drives his truck and knows how to fix it, so how hard could it be to fix a computer?

I will remind you that this is a notebook and not a desktop that he's opened up and poked around in.

Also, it's worse than you think it's going to be.

Did he remove a RAM stick? Oh, no - he did not.    
Did he unseat the hard drive? Oh, no.    
Did he try to stick an extra processor on top of the old one with silver paste? Not *our* man!

In the course of troubleshooting, I found out that, when he had it open, he had *intentionally* **SNAPPED OFF A PIECE OF THE MOTHERBOARD** because he thought it didn't look important. I'll pause and let you all contemplate that for a moment. 

He. Snapped. Off. A. Piece. Of. The. Motherboard.

It was at this point that I realized nothing was ever going to be the same in the world again.

As might be expected from someone of this caliber, he was surprised and angry that we wouldn't cover his notebook's repairs.     
""But,"" I hear you ask, ""Wasn't his notebook well outside of its warranty anyway?"" Yes, by about five years, yet somehow he didn't see that as an issue either. (Even if he had bought the longest extended warranty we offered, it would have been outside warranty by a year at this point.)

I stayed with Sarah for most of the Sunday before I left her in the care of her family again. I didn’t go home straight away but went by Jeremy. I had not spoken with him since the night before. He was rather surprised when I showed up at his door, he still expected me to be with Sarah or sleeping at home. He invited me in and I didn’t leave until the early morning; we had talked all night. I had not slept in 2 days. I was tired, but It was eight in the morning on Monday and school was starting soon. 

I went to school while Jeremy went to the store. Both of us were dreading it, but we had to go. I went through the day thinking about everything except what the teachers were trying their hardest to explain. One of the tests I made that day must have had dreadful answers. It was around four that I could leave and opened up locker to grab my wallet and cell phone. I had 6 texts from Jeremy.

He told me Ron and Don had been informed by him about everything that happened. Ron’s heart went out more to the notebook than to Sarah. “Was it really necessary? Was the only question he asked that sounded genuine. Don quickly intervened though “Don’t be like that. I’ll call the girl the see if she’s ok”. He did actually follow up on it and called Sarah.

My next shift was a Friday again and well, I didn’t quit. I had talked with Jeremy that Sunday night and he was planning on getting back to school again. It was quite expensive and he would need another three months of work to have enough saved up to pay for the tuition and other school expenses. He had asked me to stay with the shop for at least those three months to keep hit bearable for him some shifts. 

I had been pushing Jeremy for months to go back to school and supported him in every step he had taken towards that goal. It didn’t feel right to not support him now when he actually had made the decision and the paperwork was filled in already. We had compromised that my shifts would be with him. It was only three months. I could handle it. It wasn’t Ron &amp; Don’s fault that this happened? Was it?

When stepping in the store again after a week of absence it felt strange and uncomfortable.  I put my jacket and bag in the back and changed quickly in the store clothing. The shift would only take about four hours. Jeremy quickly noticed my unease and offered to take care of the store while I would fix the computers in the back. I gladly took his offer as it was something he seldom did. He felt guilty about making me stay.

The next Saturday was a full day and things started taking their usual rhythm again. I was surprised about how quickly I picked it all up again. I had been in the store for most of the day until we switched places. I went to the back and started working on the computers for about 20 to 40 minutes before I walked to the cage holding the computer that stored the security footage and UPS. It was a quality cage, which was strange for a computer store that sold stuff that never should have had passed Quality Control. I put my head against it. I missed Sarah. I wanted to see the footage of that night. But I couldn’t open the cage.

I asked Jeremy if he knew the code on the cage but he didn’t. Ron didn’t share it with anyone; not even Don knew. I asked Ron if I could see the footage but he told me it was already deleted by now. I knew it wasn’t true. He had boasted to the police agents who had come to collect the video evidence of Alex that he kept 6 months worth of footage. He never lied about stuff like that.

Ron and Don had the meantime had become silent again and started withdrawing from the store again. They would hire new personnel in the coming weeks. “You better do because the both of us are leaving as soon as we can, have fun running the store with just the two of you” was what I mumbled under my breath while walking away from them. [I wanted out.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjV8SHjHvHk).

It wasn’t until three weeks later that I realised there were still other people that could know the codes; Frank &amp; Richard. I still had their phone numbers and called them. I tried Richard first. He didn’t pick up; I got a computer voice telling me it was a disconnected phone line. I tried Frank. The phone rang, once, twice, three times; it went to Voicemail. I ended the call and threw my phone on the desk and smashed my head on my desk. I stayed like that for a couple of minutes.

The desk started vibrating. The phone was ringing. It was Frank calling back. He was doing well and was very talkative. I told him my story. He was silent. Despite the fact that Frank &amp; Richard could do questionable things, they were still human and humane. Frank told me he didn’t knew the code either. I was ready to give up asking nicely and blow the damn thing up when he continued “but I know where it is likely to be kept”. He told me all about the second safe in Don’s office. It was hidden from sight in one of the cabinets along the walls. It wasn’t much of a safe really, one of those cheap hotel safes. He gave me the code and wished me luck. 

With the code in my hand I went to the office of Don and opened the cabinet. I had left the lights off on purpose, though it made me feel even more on edge. I tried the code on the safe and was surprised when it actually unlocked. I tried took out the content. It was a big stack of randomly sorted papers.
The papers were mostly manuals, warranties and invoices. It took me a few minutes to sort through it before I found the manual for the digital lock on the cage. The code was written on the back; 9851. I walked to the cage and tried the code. The cage opened. I was in. I hit the power button from the monitor and moved the mouse around. A windows XP login screen popped up. I was prepared for that and started looking through the papers; the password and login were on another sheet, poorly written. It took a few attempts before getting the password right.

It took me a while before I understood how the software worked and where the footage was located. When I found it I watched it again and again. It didn’t make things easier for me as I had hoped. The footage was hard to watch. It was only one minute and twenty-six seconds worth of footage. Was that all it took to destroy someone’s sense of security?

I closed the window and started looking around on the computer some more. It only had the security video software installed on the system. What caught my eye was the fact that there was a shortcut for remote desktop on the desktop. I clicked it and it opened with the last used address. It connected. It was a Windows Server 2003 and it was asking me for credentials.

I was having a moral problem now. I had seen what I had come for. Would it be ok for me to also log in on this remote server? I decided to try on log in. It was hard for me to find the credentials and after trying the 12th set I decided to give up. I went through the stack of papers again when I noticed random letters written on the edges of a page. I tried that as password. I was in.

I started looking around the server but it looked clean to me. No out of the ordinary software installed or strange files on the desktop. I wasn’t familiar with the server editions of windows and went through the list of server specific applications. DHCP, Active Directory, Routing and RAS. Nothing of particular interest. I didn’t know what this server was for. I decided I didn’t want to know. I closed the connection and logged myself out of the physical computer.

I was ready to close the cage when my eye fell on the UPS again. Why does he keep that around? It doesn’t even work. And locked in the cage? I took a closer look and leaned over. I lost my balance and landed on the UPS with my body. The unit shifted. I saw it had a network cable attached to it. I pulled the UPS out of the cage, making sure I didn’t disconnect any of the cables.

Once out I tried to look in to the openings in the casing but didn’t see much. I put my ear to it. I heard the rattling of hard disks. This wasn’t a UPS anymore. It was a computer. I put the UPS back in again and reconnected to the server. Something wasn’t right here. I wanted to find out. If they were doing something illegal I wanted to know.

I started looking through the computer again. While going through every program down the list. It was then and there that I saw it! This could be the key to understanding this strange setup.",,False,,t5_2sfg5,1354922303.0,,tftsflair,True,t3_14fuy7,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/14fuy7/chapter_15_when_things_fall_apart_pt_1/,

*Names and events have been changed to protect the innocent. And to appear more awesome.*

**Act I: In Which the Battle Lines are Drawn**

Let us not underestimate the love a man feels for his customers. Especially the ones who give him money and don't complain. To have a customer wrestled from his hands by the likes of those Scoundrels! Wastrels! Ragamuffins! Rogues!

It is unfortunate that the man at Worst Purchase who had wronged me so was likely only attempting to do that which was necessary as per the requirements of his no doubt monstrous suit-clad overlords. Yet such is war. Two men may meet on a battlefield, with no personal qualm over one another. They are but two machines, manipulated with the controls of paychecks and commissions from some cruel dictator in the background.

I had endeavored to let it go. I was to allow this infraction from a man I did not know, who likely had no understanding of what he had done, to pass by me unabated. But soon, a series of unfortunate events instilled in me the need to take immediate action.

Over the course of the next few months, I received three computers that came from that citadel of darkness. The computers, seemingly unrelated, all tied together by the simple utterance of two small words. *Nerd Patrol*.

Those two words made my skin crawl. Was I upset for having to handle their incompetence? Was I disappointed that people in my industry could fail so completely in their responsibilities? Or was I merely jealous that they were, on average, paid twice as much as I was?

**Act II: In Which Straw is Piled on a Camel**

The first of these affronts to the technically competent was a customer who came into my store with her brand new laptop. She was unable to access windows. I began my much beloved bench diagnostics. The system booted to it's login. The login name was ""Worst Purchase"". Passworded. Summoning all my available resources and knowledge, I was able to heroically crack the password (the password was ""password"") and was greeted with the software reserved for a floor demo. Despite my prowess, I could not circumvent this insidious trap. Yes, not only had these hooligans provided a passworded, unusable laptop to my customer, but had also charged her for an ""initial PC setup"". I informed her that she was to return to the Nerd Patrol as my agent of vengeance, and demand a refund for obviously not doing the job that was paid for. I did a system wipe and reinstalled windows.

The second of these infractions was a customer with a custom made computer. This computer had exactly nothing in it. A mid-range processor, HDD, ODD, low end video card, and two DIMM's, at 2gig each. That was not the surprising thing. What was surprising was that it also had a basic water-cooling system that only covered the processor, ran to a radiator, and back to the processor. Aside from the insignificant airflow coming off the pump, *there were no fans anywhere in this case*. So was it any surprise that his computer was overheating? ""Who did this to you!"" I demanded, dreading the answer. But I knew the response before he even said it. ""Nerd Patrol"".

Apparently his machine sat in his bedroom, and he wanted it to be quieter so he could sleep at night. The solution, in the eyes of some quack with more knowledge than common sense, was to remove all the fans and install this water ""cooling"" system. To make matters worse, the radiator was caked in dust, and the fluid was over 6 months old. No information had been given to him on the maintenance of this particular cooling system. I demanded a name, but he could not remember it, no doubt due to the shock of finding out his $300's of work was in vain. I installed two low-decibel fans, one on the side blowing onto the motherboard, and another exhausting through the radiator.

As bad as both of those were, nothing could compare to the third one. The final straw. I will begin explaining this with a single quote from the customer. ""The man at Nerd Patrol told me that McAfee and Web Root both pick up slightly different things, so I asked him to install them both!""

She had arrived with a computer that would not connect to the internet. Leery that it had worked fine before she took it to THE STORE OF LIES and not when she got it back, she took it to us for a second opinion. During the bench diagnostics, I saw what had happened, and after inquiring about it, I received the above quote. This will not stand! I confirmed that not only had she paid for both pieces of software, but she had also paid to have the Nerd Patrol *actually install it for her* at the insistence of the sales rep. I had her sit around as I uninstalled both programs, ran the removal tool for both, and installed a free anti-virus for her. I felt sorry that she had purchased expensive software and the subscription for both of them. I didn't charge her, gave her my card, and told her to come back to us next time she needed anything.

It was on.

**Act III: Excuse me, sir. Can you help me?**

I developed a plan. A cunning, beautiful plan. A plan so ingenious that I can't even remember what it was. Because in all actuality the plan was something along the lines of ""go punch their tech in the dick"". But then fortune smiled upon me.

I was tasked with picking up a new HDD from Worst Purchase for a rush job with a corporate client. Armed with a friendly smile, an unwrinkled polo, and a pair of jeans that screamed ""I'm not a damn bit scared to crawl around under a desk"" I marched towards Worst Purchase. On my way in, I saw a woman carrying out a laptop, displaying the infernal brand of the Nerd Patrol. I stopped her, merely handed her my card, and wished her well. I would see this woman later, but that is a story for another time. I took a deep breath, and crossed the threshold into the very heart of villainy. I made for the service counter, and began to make my inquiries.

""Sir, I am looking for a new HDD to replace an old pATA drive on my computer. Do you have any I could buy so I don't need to go to Mecca? (Nerd Mecca is a nearby computer superstore in a warehouse format. I personally believe that every nerd is required to make a monthly pilgrimage to this store.) I was thanked for this with a blank stare. I repeated my request, and asked if he would please help me.

""Um... hold on sir. Let me speak to one of my technicians""

I heard them planning their nefarious scheme behind closed doors. The technician was close to clock-out, and did not want to assist, fearing I would be here for some time and hold him past his scheduled hours. He also seemed to have a problem understanding what pATA was, and I kept hearing him say ""Are you sure he didn't say sATA? This idiot doesn't know what he's talking about."" I allowed my smile to fade. The technician finally came to the front. His name tag reads ""Techdouche"", and he is likely ten years my senior.

""Hi, I'm the *head tech*. You said you need a... pATA... drive?"" Yes, he put emphasis on the ""head tech"".

""Yes, a pATA drive.""

""I'm not familiar with that.""

""... ... ... a ribbon cable.""

""Oh. Um, I think we have one, let's take a look."" And with that we are away on a whirlwind tour of the most insidious place on earth. Like Disney Land if the only attraction were the ""It's a small world after all"" ride. After trying to sell me on a new PC, and me informing him that I'm not interested, I just need a replacement HDD, he finally pulls one off the shelf. ""I think this is... a ribbon cable,"" he says, turning the product over in his hands. I clearly see the box marked as sATA. I also take note that it's the largest, most expensive HDD they have on the shelf. This repeats twice more, and finally he finds one clearly marked as pATA. I smile at the guy, and ask the killer question, ""Does this support ATAPI?""

**Act IV: A Villain Defeated!**

Techdouche's eyes glaze over, as he realizes he has no answer to that question. At this moment, I believe him defeated! But alas, I was a fool for this was only his first form. A change overtakes him. A fire burns in his previously glassy, soulless eyes. He fixates me in his gaze. ""Are you trying to make me look stupid?"" I must admit, I was slightly taken aback. I had not expected our game of cat and mouse to so quickly dissolve into a direct, armed confrontation.

But, in a game of wits, I always pack overwhelming firepower. ""No sir, not at all. You seem to be doing that just fine on your own."" Thus began his full on onslaught. Though he kept his voice low to avoid spooking the herd, he was able to instill the heated rage of ten thousand white hot suns into every word. In these situations I tend to tune people out, allowing them to fall upon their own sword of vitriol and ignorance. This man had gone to college! He had been working with computers for over *five* years! He had worked in the IT department of *three* major corporations! I was just some punk kid who didn't know the ass end of a USB port!

People had taken note. The citizens were becoming restless. Eyes watched cautiously from around lines of overpriced electronics. Then, I saw my opening. He made the fatal mistake of asking ""Who the hell do you think you are!?""

""Sir, I am also a PC technician. I have been working with computers for over ten years. Today, I was looking for a HDD with these specifications to replace a HDD on a server that hosts a corporate firewall.""

The man stepped back in stunned silence. A number of people had gathered around, intrigued by the hushed yet angry tones coming from our direction. I took the HDD, my trophy, from my vanquished foe. My path to the register took me by the service desk, where a customer was sitting, awestruck. I handed her a generic business card, and suggested she might want to give that place a try. She nodded quietly. I purchased my HDD, and returned to my store.

The war was far from over. I made no attempt to get the man fired, and he didn't seem interested in pursuing the issue. He retained his job.

But this battle had been won, and the seed of discontent had been planted. That seed would grow into a majestic tree over the following year.

...a macro which ran through all the government benefit-issuing and -reviewing interviews which were scheduled to be performed at the office in the upcoming week, and would make notes where the interview had been canceled or rescheduled or otherwise moved out of its original timeslot. Originally, these slots weren't checked by anyone until an hour or so beforehand, and even then only by the interviewer, so they could find themselves with a very patchy workday instead of the neat set of interviews they'd been expecting to use as an excuse to pass off their back-office paperwork to someone else.

Only around 70% of interviewees actually turned up to their original times, as it transpired. Which meant it was taking around three days to do two days' work, and more to the point, members of the public who actually *wanted* interviews in order to get their government entitlements before they starved to death were being booked in timeslots weeks away.

I solved this by having the macro identify all the spare timeslots in advance, phoning up the people who'd been booked more than a week away, and asking if they'd like to be fast-tracked to a closer timeslot - like tomorrow, or even today. All of a sudden, the time blowout on interviews is cut by a third, interview days are more predictable, and interviewees are happier because they've been 'fast-tracked'. Stress drops, stats soar. I write up the process, pass it off to the section booking the interviews, and build...

   
  
   
...a macro which speeds up the data entry of manually issued benefit checks. Previously, each one was punched into a set of slow-to-update mainframe screens, and then *literally* 92% got rejected three days later and had to be redone because the figures didn't match up. My check reconciliation macro took all the check data for ALL of the checks at once, compared it to the relevant records on the system, and then entered it automatically. Check rejection by the audit systems dropped to 2% overnight, and I no longer had to spend hours every day slowly moving through the same workflow over and over. Which meant I had time to build...

   
  
   
...a set of simple forms I could print out and attach to physical files which had been sent to us accidentally. Such things were a problem, as many of the files which turned up in the interoffice bag each morning had been sent by people at other offices who were unfamiliar with the actual rules and policies governing when to send a file and when not to. The forms I created looked official, and quoted the appropriate policies and their references, and got attached to the front of the files which were sent right back to where they came from (or where they were supposed to be).  

I combined this with a program which scoured the 60,000 customer records for our region and identified discrepancies between where a file *should* be, according to policy, and where it actually *was*. This led to me purging the file stacks of an awful lot of files which we shouldn't have had at our site, thus making it easier for the rest of the staff to find something in the archives when they had to go hunting. I also used the opportunity to re-alphabetize the archives properly - no-one had done that in twenty years, and it gave me something to do when I didn't want to be sitting at a desk staring off into space. And when I got bored with *that*, I sat down and proceeded to build...

   
  
   
...a game of Arkanoid on the mainframe, so I'd have something to play with that would at least look like I was doing something with the keyboard if anyone glanced my way. I mean, hell, I'd automated everything *else.*  

Now, while all this was happening, someone in Head Office had decided to set up an Innovation and Improvements team. You'd email them an idea for making things run better, or faster, or cheaper, and they'd enter it in a publicly accessible database, pass the idea on to whichever manager or executive was the lowest level with the authority to approve it, and theoretically update the database eventually with a Yea/Nay/Maybe as to whether it had been implemented.

I had a lot of free time, and a lot of imagination, and it wasn't hard to work my way to the top of the national list of contributors to said list. I was also looking for a way to *enormously* piss off my office manager in a way he couldn't possibly retalitate to, and I soon hatched a devious plan which would take me all the way to the CEO's office...

   
  
   
...but that's a story for another time.

I get the job basically because I'm a whiz with RS-232.  I'm learning unix and more about PCs, but I've been doing customer support and technical electronics for about five years.

I'm working for a company that does software for county government.  Taxes, courts, and law enforcement.  I'm at a big installation where we have about ten techs.  I'm struck by the hours- up at 6 AM to make an hour drive from the hotel to the customer site, then work non-stop till 10 or 11 PM.  I'm given all this ""real men/hard core"" blah about the hours.

But, I witness our lead tech pulling out old serial cable.  We're working about 10 PM after several 18 hour days.  We're all working on salary, so no overtime.  He doesn't notice that one cable is orange while all the others are grey and- snip.  Yeah, down goes the fiber connection between the courthouse and the jail bringing all of our work at the jail to a halt.

He knows wires but not fiber and soon discovers we can't just splice the fiber back together with our wire crimpers.  The cable belongs to the phone company, and they give us a 48 hour ETA on repair.  Customer is obviously not a happy camper.

But next week, I'm in another county seat.  Not as bad as we don't have the hour long commute from hotel to customer site, but similar hours.  Just me and my boss.  She knows the technical stuff and I'm still learning that, but I have quite a bit more life experience than she does.

After some insane number of hours in a few days, we're taking our customer contact, the county judge, out for lunch.  My boss is driving, and at a stop light, she falls asleep behind the wheel, her foot slips off the brake, and we hit the car in front of us.  The people we hit want an ambulance rubbing their necks and such.  

The Friday after that trip, I'm called into the official manger's office.  I'm told ""You're one of the most mature people in the department, and so we're wanting to make you a manager as soon as you're up to speed on the technical stuff.  What do you see as a problem?""

So, I tell them about the hours.  I point out that human performance falls off after a certain number of hours and you get bad labor that calls for people to fix the errors later.  I point out the accident cutting the fiber and how it resulted in two days downtime for 10 techs.  I point out you'd get more usable labor by having people work fewer hours each day.  I point out we're putting the company in danger from liability by having someone work 80 hours in 5 days and then having them drive home 14 hours.  They're going to fall asleep and hit someone on the highway and kill people.

That Monday, I'm fired.

I find out later their entire hardware department had quit together before I was hired, and everyone only had a couple of weeks more experience than I did.  They all formed a new company to do hardware support.  

But, knowing how the phone numbers there, when I got a new job, I poached their techs for a few years by calling the desks where the hardware people worked, introducing myself, and asking if they'd like a 40 hour a week job with real overtime where you're home every night.  They were our recruiting department.

TLDR: Force techs to work 18 hour days for days on end, fire people who point out performance degrades when people work without rest.  Car wreck.  Human Poaching.

So here I am, basic tech support for an internet provider. Crappy job, but better than unemployment. I take calls with the general level of 'help my internet's not working' and the like. I had to do basic diagnostics with the customer you know the drill.

So this old lady calls, by the sound of her voice she's probably in her 60's or 70's so I gear up for a very tough and long troubleshoot because her internet's not working. But thankfully she's a clever old biddy and takes my instructions seriously.

We figure out all the cables are plugged in, the computer's working properly etc. etc. it all boils down to this: 

Me: Ma'am, I'm afraid your modem has died.
Customer: Oh that's too bad. 
She sounded pretty concerned as if she thought this was a very big deal or somthing. And today I still don't know what came over me but...
Me: It's allright Ma'am, it's an old modem and he had no friend or family.

My coworkers where all staring at me when they heard me say that. The old lady though burst out laughing. We got her a new modem and as far as I know the other one was buried in the trash can.

It had a few computers to rent internet use, made copies, etc and it was in a gated community that catered to the uber rich, politicians, dignitaries, etc. Many of the people there had no clue how to use technology, so after hours my buddies and I would do tech support and we charged $30 for first hour, $20 each after. Everyone we helped always said what a bargain it was.

A woman came in one day obviously upset. She said her computer wouldn't work and she HAD to get to a file and asked if I could help. I explain I could come in a few hours after work, but she wanted it now as she was trying to submit an entry into the summer poetry contest and the deadline was an hour away.

She left and came back 10 minutes later with a laptop. Sets it down on the table and shows me that Microsoft Word was froze and she couldn't use it.  I hit CTRL+ALT+DEL, closed it from task manager, and restarted Word with no issues. 

She dropped $30 on the table, scooped up the laptop and was gone less than a minute after she walked through the door.

This lady really pissed me off, the call had a bit more of her swearing at me and yelling in general that I censored out for the sake of your virgin ears. She genuinely thought me or my coworkers were purposefully messing with her internet and making it so she couldn't connect to the internet. Such a great call to end the year on, if you ask me.

I had a customer call me and ask for his password to be reset. I asked him what the problem was since this is kind of an odd request. He said that he could not get his email and he needed his password reset. I asked him if he had changed his password and forgot it. He said ""No"" but that this happened quite a bit. I looked at the previous calls and he had indeed called to have his password changed quite a few times and the previous tech had made the change and just ended the call. I told him that passwords do not just change on their own and asked him to try to pull a web page. He couldn't and I told him that his password was not his problem, he wasn't connected to the internet. All good so far.

The next bit of the call went as follows:

&gt;Cust: ""I have told you enough to do your job, NOW JUST DO IT!""

&gt;
&gt;Me: ""Why yes sir. Just one second"" I change password ""Ok, sir. I have changed your password. Your new password is '**jerk**'. That's  '**j'**, '**e**', '**r**', '**k**' all lower case. Please type that in for me and lets see if you can get your email. I'll stay on the line. Do you need me to spell it again?""

Then the sound of typing. Another long pause.

the ""high profile client"" is a random local DJ, who is doing a show at 6:30, no response from his computer. an off the rack acer, nothing special about it, even in 2006. 

so i begin my diagnostics, tearing his laptop down to the motherboard, infront of him, hes panicking, running short on time, im in that 'zen' moment of taking something apart.
 
come to find a micro fracture on the cmos battery mount, giving intermittent drops in voltage, causing the machine to A) not power on B) hang at random times. 

the shop did not allow soldering, there wasnt even an iron in the lab area, and bringing one from home was a fire able offense, as they were in the business of modular replacement, so...what to do, this guy needs to get out of here, he NEEDS his machine..apparently.

so..the solution was a post-it note. folded, jammed between the battery and the case to put pressure on the contact, and give uniform current flow, all the time im doing this, explaining, this is a stop-gap. this is an emergency procedure, youll need to bring it back in monday to order a new motherboard. blah blah blah in one ear out the other, got it working and he left. 

fast forward to a couple months ago, i left that company, started my own, and he shows up in my shop one day, we make jokes about that terrible post it- i ask how long it worked, he said it still is, like a champ, but now it needs a dc in jack repaired. needless to say, i did that and the cmos battery....and framed the post its.

So, I look at the wireless settings, tap on [network name] and it prompts for a username and password. I asked her if she’s ever put in that info or tried to connect it to the network.

""Nope, never did that."" 

Have you ever looked at your settings to ... 

""no, what's a setting, I don't have time for this, fix it!""

Ok, deep breath. I had her input her username and password. On the next screen, she had to click to accept a campus certificate, and c’est voila, it was online.

Her: “Why do I have to tell it to connect to a network? I thought it was just supposed to work. This is stupid and I don’t want it.” Left it on my desk and walked out.

**tl;dr anyone want a very, very lightly used iPad?**

**edit** No, sorry, the tl;dr was a joke; the user is a faculty member and the iPad is a school iPad that we assigned her. Also, she was under the impression that it was like her iPhone, which ""gets internet everywhere.""

Many of our users are young 25-30 so I used to expect them to be a little more knowledgeable about computers than our older employees. This job proved me wrong.  One Monday morning I get this call from a user:  

**User:**  “Can you come over and help me, I’m having a breakdown. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.”  

**Me:** “OK I’ll be right over.” (Our sales staff brings in a lot of money and there is a lot of pressure to keep them happy.  I don’t ever ask why, I just show up at their desk.)

You know how you have multiple camera cards and photos in all these folders. I wanted to put them in sequential order. I’ve tried this five times now and (Deeply sobbing) It never remembers the order I put them in. What am I doing wrong?! I spent all night doing this.

**ME:** “OK- well, show me how you are trying to organize them.”  

**User:** (She proceeds to show me on her Mac how she is just dragging thumbnails around within the folder.)  

**Me:** “You know you need to rename each photos, or add in a Date-Taken column. Computers don’t work like that. It does not remember when you dragged a thumbnail to in the folder.”  

**User:** “But it’s a MAC!  It’s supposed to know what I’m trying to do!!”

But one of my projects recently involved releasing a website for employees to access certain things from home.  Of course things like that require a lot of support, since the variety of users and devices is pretty large.  Most users problems were pretty straightforward, but one employee, lets call her Brenda, really broke my brain.

Day One after the release - Brenda sends me an email.  She tried to login, but her ""PC wouldn't accept the website.""  Um, what? I ask her about her browser and OS. She tells me that she doesn't use an Internet Browser, she has her ISP. Double what? I send her the link to her personal email (which she says she can check) and tell her to click it, and if it doesn't work to send me a screen print of what she's seeing.

Day Two: I go see Brenda at her desk, to see how things went.  She hands me two printed pages, one with a list of search results for the site, and another one with a diagnose connection error message, with handwritten notes about what happened when she pushed the repair connections button. I confirm that she was able to get to websites as a general matter,  and retire back to my desk with a promise to figure something out.

Day 3 - I take screenshots of a couple browsers, their icons, and circle where she should be entering the site address, send via email.  She emails be back that she clicks an E, but doesn't have that bar for the address.

Lightbulb. Bingo. Duh.

She's in full screen mode.

Go downstairs to her desk, have her open IE and go to the site that's her home page at home (which she enters into the correct location). Press F11. Ask her, is that what it looks like at home? 

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner. 

Brenda now knows how to switch views in Internet Explorer, and I feel like a super genius.  Hugs all around.

A customer came in store with their printer as they said they couldn't get it to work. Lets call him Barry.

**Me** - Hi I'm Limitr. What can I do for you today mate?

**Barry** - Hello my printer isn't working. I tell my computer to print but nothing comes out.

**Me** - No dramas at all can you just set it down on the counter and I'll hook it up and take a look.

Customer puts the printer down and I plug it in and fire it up. While it's going through it's short start up procedure I run through in my head what it could be.

**Me** - So did the printer display any error messages when it wouldn't print?

**Barry** - I'm not sure. It just doesn't print.

**Me** - Okie dokie then. Normally if something isn't right on a printer it'll give you some information on how best to fix it.

By now the printer has finished powering up and has displayed a message stating that it has a paper jam.

**Me** - Righteo so it's saying it's got a paper jam. If it's got a paper jam it won't print until you remove the jam. I'll sort that for you right now.

I turn the printer around and open up the rear hatch and find half an A4 page stuck in there. I quickly remove it and close the hatch.

The printer then moves the print head around and runs the rollers preparing to go back to it's ready state.

I tell the printer to print out a status report which is does so without an issue.

**Me** - There you go sir. Just a simple paper jam. Nothing too serious.

**Barry** - ...

I then go about unplugging the printer again so that the customer can be on his way.

**Barry** - Limitr where is your Boss. I'd like to speak to him.

I'm a little worried why the customer want's to speak to the Boss (I'd only been working at this place about a month by this point)

**Limitr** - Just a minute sir I'll go and get him for you.

I go and find the Boss and get him to come back to the Service Counter to see the customer.

**Barry** - I just wanted to speak to you quickly about Limitr's service. It was fantastic. He had my issue sorted out very quickly and was very helpful.

**Boss** - That's great!

**Me** - Thankyou very much Sir. That really means a lot to me.

I was cheering when the customer commended me to my Boss. Especially since I had only been there a short time.

I actually saw Barry again about a month later. Again the printer wasn't working. Turns out it was just out of Toner that time. Again Barry asks to speak to my Boss and commends me for sorting it out so quickly.

It's just thanks but it leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.

One would assume that as a software company, users would be tech-savvy and give sysadmins fewer headaches than what other industries in this subreddit show, but you'd be surprised.

We give laptops to our users as their workstations so they can bring their work home or in meetings. Part of our job description is to upgrade workstation laptops after a year or so using their workstations.

This story took place 3-4 years ago, when I was tasked to upgrade this one developer. He was known in our department as a notorious whiner who thinks he is entitled to *everything.* For example, he bypasses our ticketing system claiming that he needs to get things done ASAP and we are *severely* hampering his work. When we do ask for reasonably similar things from him, he takes his time before actually doing it. (Please bring your laptop to the IT office and we can assist you, etc.)

When he did finally arrive for a scheduled backup for his laptop (an hour past his scheduled time too, past working hours already) he was in a rush because he wanted to get home. This was clearly evident while I was explaining the upgrade process to him. For this story, I will refer to him as AssholeDeveloper.

**-AssholeDeveloper hands his laptop to me for backup-**

**AssholeDeveloper:** ""Make sure that none of my files are deleted, [folder X] has to be in the same place, blablabla...""

**GranZero:** ""No problem, those will all be taken care of. (I've been doing this for years, and I've experienced worse experiences) Just something to note though, you will need to sign-in on the services---""

**AssholeDeveloper cuts me off**

**AD:** ""Can we talk about this tomorrow? I need to get home quickly.""

**AD leaves for the day**

It's as if he thinks I live in the office, I grumble.

Part of the upgrade process is cleaning the old workstation, (this one had the most amount of hair from some animal. Maybe a cat.) check for damages, (he spilled coffee a year prior) and check for user belongings in the optical drive, if applicable.

Lo and behold, there was a disc inside his optical drive. Not just any disc, a *porn* disc. Remember what I said earlier about having laptops so users can bring their work home? Well, they also use their workstations for -ehem- questionable reasons.

Fast forward to the next day, I give AD his new upgraded laptop.

**AD:** ""Did you transfer the files I told you? What about my programs? What about [folder X]? Blablabla...""

**GZ:** ""All done, sir. Nothing went wrong in the upgrade process.""

**AD:** ""Good, good. I'll make sure to come back again for problems you caused.""

**GZ:** ""By the way,""

**-hands over the disc covered in a self-made CD sleeve to hide the label-**

**-AD recognizes the disc-**

**AD:** ^Fuck.

**GZ:** ""Please ensure that you don't have your discs in your laptop when you turn them in for an upgrade. Have a good day.""

Needless to say, it was very awkward for both of us --- for him leaving red-faced with embarrassment from our office, and for me trying hard to keep a straight face throughout the whole ordeal. He never pestered us again after the incident.

I know it's a recurring theme, but this time they even told the computer not to delete the trash!

------------------------------------

Hello,

I access my &lt;derpco&gt; email through Apple Mail. For about a year now, I've noticed that even though my Mailbox Preferences indicate that deleted messages be stored on the server and that deleted messages ""never"" be permanently erased, I've found that messages are still being deleted. For instance, when I look in my trash, I have about 10 deleted messages from 5/15/13, but only 3 deleted messages from 5/14/13, and no deleted messages on 5/13/13, etc. I have no deleted messages between 4/25/13 and 4/29/13, and none between 4/13/13 and 4/28/13. The oldest message in my trash is from February 2013.

This hasn't been a problem until today, when I discovered that I tried to find an email from a year ago, which I had deleted. (I found the message I sent thanking the person for the attachment, but the message the person sent me with the attachment is gone.)
Do you know how I can fix this problem so it doesn't happen in the future? I contacted Apple, but they said there was nothing they could do, and that I should contact the administrators of the server.
Thanks so much.

*During the battle, our intrepid hero managed to obtain an outdated HDD for his secret weapon - an old firewall, with enough power to protect an entire network.*

*Yelled at by an unskilled technician, he raced back to his store in his car, custodian of the hardware that would eventually bring freedom to his entire career...*

[Check It!](http://starwars.com/play/online-activities/crawl-creator/?cs=rxzdmdcarw)

**Act I: Our Hero Returns...**

I returned to my store with the device cradled in my arms like a newborn child and hand it off to KungFu Manager. ""Many Bothans died to bring you this HDD.""

My manager turned to face me. ""PolloMagnifico... come sit down.""

My heart leapt into my throat. As I have mentioned before, KungFu Manager and I were on pretty friendly terms. Even then, he was still my boss, and I was still his employee. We had an unspoken agreement that, when it was necessary, we would shift back into that relationship, deal with the official business that needed to be dealt with, and shift right back into our friendship with no hurt feelings. I had been ""spoken to"" on several different occasions at the behest of the company owner. It always started out with him asking me to come sit down. This would not be good.

""So, I talked to the boss about your raise...""

So far so good.

""And he said that if you're going to get a raise, then you need to start doing a little more. I talked him into adding you to my contract.""

Wait... what?

""So tomorrow, I want you to show up to at the DreamKiller Offices and help me install this firewall, and meet some of the people.""

This... this is finally happening!

**Act II: FBI's most wanted**

Business slowly began to improve. The store (which was being funded by the parent company) was on the verge of turning a profit for the first time. Many of the new customers were former NerdPatrol customers, who through word of mouth or sheer dumb luck had found their way to our door. I had been given an admin account, some training for exchange and active directory, and a crash course on the network topography for the three DreamKiller offices. I was officially doing helpdesk! And it... was boring.

While yes, technically, I was doing helpdesk now, I was not given enough access to the important things. Things like the PBX server. Or the inventory. Or the firewall. Or really anything except active directory and exchange. So my abilities were basically limited to password resets, account creation, and escalation. Doesn't matter, had tech!

Enter the rich kid. His parent's were doctors. He was probably 18 or 19, and was the poster child for every nerd who still lives with his parents. Quiet, stuttering, lanky, pizza faced. He puts his ""very expensive"" custom made computer up on the desk and tells me he's got a problem. This is the story according to him.

He was spending his day doing the normal manchild computer thing, when he decided he wanted to hack into some low-security systems. He said he does this ""all the time"" but THIS time, he got caught. The FBI hacked him back and installed a virus on his computer, demanding he pay a fine within 48 hours or they would come knocking on his door. Remember this particular story, it's relevant for the entirety of the rest of this recollection.

I inform the kid that no, that's not what happened. I don't even need to boot up the system to know that the FBI would not demand you pay a fine for hacking. They would come to your door and kindly escort you to the nearest holding facility, where you would be given three hots and a cot until someone paid your bail. So I boot up the system, and confirm that the kid does in fact have a virus claiming to be an FBI virus and demanding he pay a fine of *$100*. The virus comes complete with an official FBI watermark, and even has a place ready to input the credit card number.

I tell the kid that I can get the virus off for our usual fee, which is more than the cost of the ""fine"". Kid doesn't want it, he would rather pay the fine! I inform him that it's just a regular virus, and if he puts his credit card in there he's going to wind up with 98 additional problems (and a bitch still won't be one!).

Finally he relents and I remove the virus. When he comes back in the next day, I give him my normal talk about being careful where you go on the internet, this is your new antivirus, and other general safety tips. But when I mention downloads, he dismissively says ""I never download anything"".

Dude. You have complete manga scans downloaded and saved in a file on your desktop. Don't BS me. But whatever. I send him on his way.

**Act III: Again dude? Really?**

Time clicks forward another month. I've settled into my role as helpdesk, and have even learned a few tricks to keep from escalating *everything*. Kid returns with another virus. I clear it off for him, and when I'm done, we have a short discussion about some of the games I saw on his desktop that I had recently been working my way through as well. That leads to this gem.

""Hey, since you've got it, do you know why I can't play **graphics intensive** game at full graphics?""

I hook up the computer, and get into the hardware manager.

I inform him, nicely, that he has a pretty shitty computer and the graphics card isn't very good either. His response is that the computer was ""very expensive and new"" and actually had a pretty good graphics card in it!

Nicely, again, I tell him that my computer at home (which cost me ~700 to build) was at least twice as powerful as his and it still had problems hitting max graphics for this particular game. But but but I have six gigs of memory! Yeah, but you have a dual core processor and a discount graphics card. Seriously, I don't even think they make this anymore. Once again, kid leaves.

**Act IV: The third times the charm**

Now we're getting to the good part. Flash forward another half a month. Things are going quite well now, until this kid walks into my door. I nod to KungFu Manager. ""There's the guy that keeps calling, asking questions that don't make any sense. Why don't you go deal with him?""

KungFu Manager Obliges. I sit outside the door and listen. The first thing the kid says is ""I think someone is hacking me.""

KungFu Manager stammers for a second, and finally responds ""what?""

""I keep getting viruses even though I never download things. I think I'm being targeted by a hacker who keeps putting viruses on my computer!""

KungFu Manager calmly explains to him that it's not extremely likely that he's being targeted by a hacker, as it doesn't fit with a typical hacker MO. But regardless, he would be happy to take a look at it. Oh, and viruses (again). KungFu Manager takes it in, we remove the viruses, and he goes over the firewall looking for open ports and a few other things (he's far better at security than I am) and can't find anything to indicate a problem. While we're doing this, I'm telling him about the previous two times the kid had been in, and how you would think someone who supposedly hacks well enough for the FBI to take notice would know how to keep his system secure. We decide to have a little fun with him.

*""We found some very interesting things on your computer. You had several open ports, and your local DHCP was configured to reroute all of your internet queries to a server in china through a network of proxies. It was very hard to trace, so we called in an FBI computer forensics specialist to help us. He did some digging, and found an extremely sophisticated virus that had infected your BIOS, which is why the format didn't get rid of it. He traced it back to a known server exclusively utilized by the Chinese military for spying on American systems. He believes that you were originally a primary node in a chain of proxies used in a recent attack on the pentagon. Your computer was confiscated as evidence in an ongoing investigation into that particular attack, and he wanted us to thank you for being a good American Citizen.""*

Kid was absolutely devastated. He looked at us like he was about to cry and said ""Really?""

We place his computer on top of the counter.

""No, we didn't find anything wrong with your computer aside from the virus. Here's a list of places that we know are clean to get your manga from instead of using rapidshare. If you're really worried about being hacked, call your ISP and ask them to change your external IP address. Have a nice day.""

So I'm on her laptop poking around, and decide to check her router info. Seeing as the wifi she's trying to connect to is Linksys, and I know the default admin info, I head to 192.168.1.1, default username and password. I reset her WPA2 password, and while I'm at it, I rename her wifi from 'Linksys' to our family's last name.

I try to connect, and I'm still having big issues so I reboot the laptop and go to the desktop. There, I notice that the desktop is connected to a different wifi, with a different name. I had been trying to connect to the wrong wifi. It must have been at the absolute range of the neighbor's wifi, or something. I didn't notice because it was the 'default' wifi choice on her laptop, and I really didn't think twice about it.

So, I try to 192.168.1.1 back in and reset it all, but...now I can't connect to it, and I'm not sure why.

My parents recently had dinner with a senior couple in the neighborhood who own a small business in town. They explained over the course of dinner and conversation that a few of their computers at work and home were 'infected' somehow and they were trying desperately to get them fixed because of the sensitive information on the machines. My parents say something to the extent of, ""Hey, our son is a nerd- maybe he can help you?"". 

The next day I find myself going to their place of business and looking at a computer there. The wife meets me at the office and shows me the infected computer. It looks sketchy and seems to have some bad juju on it but after a quick run of Malwarebytes and Combofix is back up and running fine.  

Then, she decided if I can magically fix that one machine I should be able to fix the ones at her house. I follow her back to their house and take a look at two more 'infected' computers. They both exhibit the same problem as the other; connected to the internet but can't browse. I go and look at the internet connection status and see that the machines are both sending and receiving packets so at least I know they're getting something. After almost 30 minutes of messing with internet connection settings I come to the conclusion that nothing is wrong there since both computers are getting the signal (and both wireless) so I start to look at programs that may be blocking internet access. Ah, looks like Norton 360 is installed on both machines... Double click on Norton 360, nothing happens. Try to uninstall Norton 360, nothing happens. I restart both machines and go into Safe Mode with Networking and voila, now I can browse the internet. Go to uninstall Norton 360 but still- nothing. After another frustrating 30 minutes or so I give up and Google for the answer. Turns out you have to download and install Norton Removal Tool to uninstall Norton 360 from your computer. After all that, both of her machines booted up normally and could browse the internet. 

I couldn't help thinking though that if someone didn't know how to boot into safe mode, how would they be able to download the removal tool if Norton 360 was blocking internet browsing???

Each one would take less than 10 minutes to sew if my sewing machine was working, but after the first, I spent over an hour trying to figure out why the thread was bunching up on the bottom instead of sewing cleanly. I checked every setting, took it apart as much as I was comfortable, and read the manual cover to cover without finding an answer.

Finally, I gave up and called my grandma to see if I could come over and use her sewing machine to finish the batch of bags I was working on. She ended up helping me troubleshoot the machine over the phone. Even though I was getting tired and cranky, I tried everything she told me to, even rechecking the things I had spent the previous hour on. After all, she's been sewing for at least twice as long as I've been alive, I'd be stupid to not listen to her advice. 

And what do you know, it turns out I had completely missed checking the thread tension on the bottom, and I was only fiddling with the top thread. It was way too loose, and that was causing most of my problems. 

Unfortunately, it was still bunching up in a few places even after I corrected the tension, and since sewing machines only have so many parts, it wasn't long before we exhausted the list of possibilities. My grannie's final suggestion? ""Have you tried turning it off, completely removing the spool and bobbin and rethreading it, then trying it again?""

Reboot my sewing machine? There's no way that could work. Still, I said, ""why not?"", rethreaded it, and... Now it works perfectly.

It made me realize what people like her feel like when we help them with their computers! They're up against a machine they don't fully understand or feel comfortable using, and they don't want to go outside of their comfort zone and poke around in case they break something, but they know something's not working. Bless my grandma for being so patient with me while I was being the silly person who didn't know how to do something incredibly basic. One person's inability to copy and paste is another's inability to check both the top and bottom thread tension. 

I love you, grandma! If you had a computer I would always help you fix it!

**TL;DR: Roles were reversed when my grandma helped me troubleshoot my sewing machine by phone. I actually listened to her advice, unlike many users from this subreddit's tales.

They were (and still are four years later) very good about keeping the number of issues to a minimum.

Because of my troubleshooting mindset, they'd occasionally ask me to come take a look at other less computer-related problems. These tended to be little things like

* The garage door won't open (It had somehow worked its way off its track)

* The fairly expensive sprinkler wasn't working properly (Clogged with hard water)

* Universal remote not working as intended (TV + Stereo + VHS + DVD + DVR = too much going on)

Normally, these came with dinner and drinks, so I never minded the half hour drive out there. At worst, I'd spend some time looking at it and tell them to call an expert.

One such occasion arose and he gave me a call. The ice maker in the fridge wasn't working right. More specifically, it was working intermittently. Sometimes it would be broken then work for weeks before going back to its broken state. We arranged a dinner/repair.

That afternoon, I called to confirm I was on my way. Dad was grilling beef tenderloin and had just filled the garage fridge with the local brewery's latest seasonal. It would be a good night.

I finally got to the house, and as soon as my dad hears my truck pull into the drive way, he walks out of the house.

&gt; Dad: You're never going to believe this. I fixed it.

&gt; Me: What was wrong?

&gt; Dad: What do you tell me to do *first* every time a computer isn't working?

It's about this time a big smirk comes across both of our faces.

Yup. That was it. Unplugging the fridge for several minutes reset all the stuff inside and the ice machine has been working fine for 2+ years since then.

I feel as if I have found my people.  From 2000-2002 I worked for an airline in a reservations call center.  I started on the phones due to not having a CS degree (dyscalculia) but was aiming to get into IT as they promoted within.  So, even before I had finished my initial 6 weeks training course on taking reservations, I had learned the network structure and hardware system mostly inside and out.  The entire airline was used to a GUI and we were the first to be trained on the original CLI system because the GUI was glitchy as hell.  So, as a new hire, I still wound up helping retrain everyone in the 220 people office.  Did I mention this all ran on Windows 3.11 terminals?  Fun.

So, as I mentioned, I was aiming for IT so I did whatever I could to help people with their computer problems and was looking for ways to impress the right people.  I had already made friends with the tech in the building, unfortunately, he didn't have a passion for any of it.

So, the chance comes along to help one of the supervisors out.  Keep in mind, this office was a carbon copy of Office Space, but that I had 13 direct supervisors.  Yes, 13.  Anyways, she was having trouble getting commands to enter and it boiled down to her not starting anything with a prompt.  The terminal program had the ability to record macros so I set one up that cleared out the screen and reset with prompts in place.  I showed her how to trigger the macro and she just kept looking at me like I was doing something horribly wrong. Then she says, ""I don't know what you did, but you shouldn't lie to me like that and don't make fun of me.""  I was totally bewildered.  I asked her what I did wrong and she told me just to go back to my desk.

Later in the day, the IT guy pulls me aside and tells me to watch my back.  The supervisor thought I was making fun of her by telling her I had changed her PC to a Mac and it would work properly now.  Yeah, macro=mac.  Apparently she had an iMac at home, so that's how she knew I was lying to her about changing it to a mac.

**Me: Yes.**

Supervisor: Ok, down on the bottom row of the keyboard and to the left there is a key that's got a circle on it with the windows logo on it? Do you see it?

**Me: Yes. The Windows key.**

Supervisor: Ok press that key, but keep holding it down and also press the ""r"" key at the same time, then let go.

Supervisor: Yes they are.

**Me: Nnnnnnnno, They're not.**

Supervisor: Ok well what are they then?

**Me: Well for example, one of the ""Errors"" is from last night when a game I was playing (Skyrim) crashed.**

Supervisor: That is because of a virus.

**Me: No it isn't. The program crashed. It is a known issue that is affecting thousands of people with this game and the company that make it are making a patch for this and other known issues as we speak.**

Supervisor: Well what about one of the ""Warnings""

**Me: Ok, well the first warning here is an advice that my Samsung software's update service could not be restarted. Also not a virus.**

Supervisor: But you don't know. All of these could be viruses.

**Me: Thay're not. As I said to your colleague, I have up to date antivirus software and anti-malware software. But even ignoring that knowing that new viruses are always being made, I know what the Event Viewer is and how it works and you won't scare me saying all these ""Errors"" and ""Warnings"" are viruses and infections. Because they're not. They're normal things like program crashes and notifications that things didn't quite go as expected, and they get logged so that if you need to investigate further, you can.**

Supervisor: That's not true, you don't know anything.

**Me: I do. In fact I work in IT. I have built and maintained my own and friends and family members' PCs for over 15 years. I've installed and troubleshooted operating systems as far back as DOS, most Windows versions over the years and Linux as well. Where I work, people call me for technical support for their PCs.**

Supervisor: But you're not a Microsoft Certified Engineer.

**Me: I am** 

(I lied. The only lie of the phone call but I was having too much fun at this stage.)

Supervisor: Well then why are you talking to us.

**Me: You called me! I know all about the Event Viewer scam. It even happened to my best friend's wife recently and as soon as your colleague said he was from Microsoft I knew what was going on and I wanted to see how you operated. I must admit I'm pretty unimpressed.**

Supervisor: Well why didn't you end the call?

**Me: I was having too much fun. It's my birthday today and you guys have just made my day.**

Supervisor: Well then why don't you just hang up then?

**Me: I think I just might. It's been a blast. BYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!**

I say, 'Well I can't drop what I'm doing right now but soon as I can' She's says, 'So you're not going to fix it now?' and I just say no. Which she storms off and clearly is extremely mad.

They simply shipped them as is to us to see what we can salvage. When opened, they were just a wall of mud and test equipment poured out, with chunky computer systems sprinkled through the flow.

I call a halt and go to work. I build a cleaning station of grounded pads, grounded grate work surfaces, and a grounded water nozzle, all using a common ground point to equalize potential. Next to it is a similarly grounded brand new automotive parts washer filled with technician grade alcohol to prevent water residue.

Every machine is set on the grid, opened, and gently hosed out. Once clean, it is transferred to the alcohol rinse, then set to dry.

All of the test equipment (Oscopes, multimeters, etc) came through fine, and passed recalibration afterward.
Most of the computers, minus hard drives, survived as well. We lost maybe 10% of them. I forget total cost of equipment, but definitely 8 digits.

I run a small in-home tech-support business, so this happens all time time. It goes something like this:

&gt;""Yeah... my computer is broke...""

&gt;""All right. How exactly is it not working?""

&gt;""....It's broke.""

The conversation goes on in this vein for a while, but eventually I schedule a visit the next day. A drink, sleep, and a drive later I arrive at this fellow's home, deep in the downtown ghetto of my city. I knock on the door.

This is where I made my worst mistake. Forgive me; I have since learned better.

When I entered the house, I found four or five kids around fourteen to sixteen years old sitting around a tv watching a horror flick. Apparently the guy who hired me isn't there, but they know where his computer is. Seems weird, but I go there, find out what the problem is, fix it, and then return to the living room for payment. They call their mom.

&gt;""Hey there! I'm SomeDutchGuy from SomeDutchCompany. I just took a look at your son's computer.""

&gt;""Oh you did? What did you find?""

&gt;""Well ma'am, it turns out there was a problem with his operating system that was causing it not to boot. I was able to fix the problem, and he can use the computer normally again.""

Me: oh wow, ok...well we currently host their website and we have a full panel with hosting access.  You can pretty much do anything you want inside their account.  It would be far easier if you just used their existing account.  If you'd like I can set you up a user/pass for their panel.


Contractor:  (annoyed)  No thank you.  I use lots of complex things on my sites that require specific settings.  I need them moved.


Me: Ok, well we also host their email and several CNAME headers in their DNS for ease of use (such as mail, office, VPN..etc) so it would be easier for them if I just changed my A record to point to your host.  Is your host a shared host or a dedicated IP host.


Contractor: (30 secs of silence)  I'm not sure what that means.


Me: **Realizing that this whole process was about to go horribly wrong** Ma'am let me get your number and I'll give you a call right back.  I need to check some settings here on my end.


Me:  (I call the customer explain the situation, they are adamant that I do whatever she needs done to get their new site up and running)


I make the change to the nameservers to point them at ns1.templatehostingservice.com and almost instantly all email and vpn goes down.


Contractor calls back, I determine that she's a stay at home mom using some wordpress template site with pre-installed modules.  The sites look like crap and cost 15 bucks a month.  She's charging customer several thousands of dollars to do the new ""site"" for them.  Making a nice little paycheck as a home business.  (My panel does wordpress)


Almost in tears Contractor:  CustomerX just called me and said their email is down, said they would sue me for lost revenue.  I don't know what to do please help me.


Me: -sigh- Ok fine...(i get the admin acct login and fix the dns, all services return to normal)


Contractor:  Thanks -click-

Supposedly.

Management talked to me extensively before doing this; they really were good folks there, and wanted to be sure I was 'ready' to have to deal with this guy on a regular basis, and be able to fully document everything well.  I assured them that first, I didn't care if I supported 1 user or thousands so long as you kept paying me, and second that he wouldn't bother me much.

The day they gave him my extension saw me get a few 'Phil' calls, ""just to make sure it works"" type of thing.  Yep, we do know what we're doing; the company had it's fingers into multiple telecom products ranging from phones to cellphones to internet at the time, and all were managed and setup very, very well.

When I got to work the next day, though, was rather humerous.  I logged into the phone system, and the little red light for voicemail started blinking.  Normally, it blinks once for each message left, then goes solid for 10 seconds, etc.  It just kept blinking.  I smirked, and dove in.

35 messages; 32 of which were from Phil.  I start going through them, and each and every one is him just ranting about various unrelated, silly things; web design questions, problems with his keyboard, phone problems, problems with his *desk chair*, everything and anything.

I carefully, and meticulously made a brand new ticket on his support account for each and every one of these calls.  Then, I'd make an addendum to any repeats. In total, 10 'issues', none of which we support were there.  Apparently, ""Phil, if you have problems with your Internet service, call this number"" had mutated to ""Phil, if you have problems with your bunions, call this number"" inside his little mind.  I've been off-phones for the first hour of work now because of this; I laughed, they're paying me to babysit, why would it bother me?

So, I go through the usual 'check our side' work that I noted in the last call.  Everything's still golden (of course).  I make an outbound ticket, fill in refs to all the other tickets I'd made and closed, copy and paste all the terminal output of the tests I'd done, and make the call.

Me: Greetings, this is SilentDis from XYZ, is Phil available?  
Phil: It took you long enough to call, I have all these problems are any of them fixed yet?  
Me: Hello Phil.  Do you have time to discuss the voicemails you left this morning?  
Phil: It better be quick, I have work to do!  
Me: Oh, it will be quick, I assure you.

I proceed to list each and every issue he called us about off to him, and asked if each is correct.  Verbal contract established across 32 calls and 10 issues.

Me: Now, as we have discussed before, we are here to help you with your Internet service.  We help get you online, we help make sure you can browse webpages, we help make sure you can get your e-mail from our servers, and we make sure your hosting is working.  
Phil:  Yes...  
Me: I've already verified that everything concerning that works on our side, and will e-mail those results to you, as well as the details from this call.  Are you able to browse webpages?  Are you able to get e-mail?  
Phil: Yes, but this is...  
Me: No, Phil, this is not a 'general life support' line.  Nothing has changed regarding that; we still only help with the same things, just now I'm the only one you'll be dealing with concerning them.  Do you understand?  
Phil: (sounding a bit deflated) Yes.  
Me: Good.  As soon as I close this ticket, I'll e-mail you this ticket log as a reminder of what we can help you with, and it can act as a 'receipt', if you want, for all the calls you made.  Again, Internet connectivity, your website, and e-mail are what we help with.  Do you have any questions regarding those things now?  
Phil: (yeah, that's defeat in his voice) No.  
Me: Good, thank you for using XYZ.

I finished up the (mostly done) ticket.  It formats fairly well right out of the box, I found, from the ticketing system; a few minor changes here and there, but nothing major.  It lists each ticket number that was 'referenced', the title, and the close reason (Unsupported for each, of course), the start and end times.  Then it lists all my notes.  This gets sent to Phil, as well as BCC'd to my supervisor.

Phil didn't call me again that day...  [But it gets better](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/w62i0/phil_33_13_the_final_insult/).

My job mainly consisted of doing whatever the hell I was told, for a very small check, which was fine with me!  All my friends were working at grocery stores.

Anyways, I'm on the phones one day when an elderly lady calls in with a computer problem and I give her my standard speech, ""Thanks for calling Yada Yada, my name's [name], how can I help you.""

She informs me that her computer is 'being slow'.

I tell her that she'll need to bring it in, that there's not much troubleshooting I can do over the phone.  (This was pretty much my mandated go-to line for non-Internet related support.  We didn't make money unless they brought the PC in.)

I proceed to start asking her a few questions so she has less paperwork to fill out when she brings it in.

""Alright, ma'am, what operating system do you have on your computer?""

*silence*

""Windows XP?  Windows 98?""

When she stepped through the door there were several odors that hit me.  One of these was the unmistakable scent of roaches.  That was coming from the computer.  The other odor(s) were similar to garlic and parmesan cheese but nothing you'd want to put in your mouth.

She was wearing a yellow T-shirt, Nascar flannel pants (I'm not making this up), and bedroom slippers.

I put her computer on the workbench and before I even opened it I saw literally DOZENS of pairs of antenna protruding from the honeycomb metal on the back of the computer.  The area around the VGA ports &amp; USB's were caked with dark brown roach shit.

I opened the case anyway and it looked like I had taken the top cover off of a honeybee hive, only roaches.  Scores of them.

I know IMMEDIATELY that this PC is going in a BAG.  But I didn't have any bags.

I say ""Hey Carol (name changed),  I've got to run on a service call real quick, how about I do that and just call you when I've checked it out?"".  She replies something which I don't remember and leaves.

I move the computer as carefully as I can without disturbing the residents within because I do NOT want them in my shop.  In retrospect I should have immediately taken it outside.  I make no claim to being extraordinarily bright.  Instead, I set it (still opened) on a cardboard box about 6"" high.  In my haste I forgot my phone, and when I turned back around to get it I cracked the lower part of my shin against the case sending it careening onto the hardwood floor.

Imagine taking a cup half full of water, tilting it at an angle, and smacking it on the floor.  What would have happened with the water, instead happened with a handful of now startled roaches that scattered in all directions seeking a hiding spot.

I headed for the nearest WM to procure spray and bombs.  When I returned, they were everywhere.  I lock everything down, bomb the hell out of it and go home.

Most of the next morning was spent in cleaning up the aftermath.  Then, she arrives, still wearing the same clothes.  I didn't really want to show her the carnage because I was embarrassed FOR her.  But I did, with surprise results.  She says ""WOACHES?!?!?!  I DON'T HAVE WOACHES IN MY TWAILEW!!!  YOU MUST HAVE WOACHES IN HEWE AND THEY GOT IN MY COMPUTA FROM BEING IN HEWE"".  WTF?!?!?!?!  In defiance of that, I take the side panels off of two other desktops showing (surprisingly) an absence of infestation.  I tell her I can't/won't fix it because it's done.

She wants to know if I have another one I can sell her, I do, just give me a day or two to get it ready.  Ok.  Two days later she comes back IN THE SAME CLOTHES to pick it up.  I boot it up and show her everything is working and she leaves with it.

The next day the phone rings.  It's her. ""THAT COMPUTA YOU SOLE ME STOPPED WUKING"", well, bring it in then.

She brings it in and guess what?  The power supply is FULL of ~~WOACHES~~ ROACHES.

She denies it, can't believe it.  ""I BOUGHT SOME SPWAY AND SPWAYED, IT CAN'T BE WOACHES"".  I don my gloves and take the power supply apart, take it outside on the sidewalk and SLAM it on the concrete.  When I remove it there are no less than a dozen of all sizes, some alive, some dead, some twitching.

It's my first post here, so be gentle (which I know you all are :)

I just recently (past few weeks) got a job at a small tech support place near where I go to school. It's not much, but it's a permanent thing (I've just had summer work at my old school district) with a little room to move up. I've seen more weird crap that people do to their computers than I've ever encountered in the rest of my life, and I've been into computers for a long time. I'm excited to share my first clueless moment of this job!

Okay. So this guy bought the computer from somebody. It's a custom-built machine with an Athlon tri-core and a GTX 280. It's pretty much a gaming machine. He says that he saw it boot at the guy's house, and when he brought it home, it wouldn't boot. (When I got into it, I noticed that it also had power plugged into both the SATA and Molex connections on the HDD, so somebody didn't quite know what they were doing along the line)

I say that I can take a look at it and get back to him after I run some diagnostics and such. He's perfectly okay with that, so I take the machine, write up a receipt, and take the computer. He seems kind of antsy and asks if he'll get an update that night. I say maybe, but it'll most likely be tomorrow, since we have a certain procedure for progressing through work.

I set it up and have one helluva time getting it to boot into a disc. First, both of the optical drives inside are completely disconnected. So, I proceed to plug in an external one. It doesn't boot to anything. Just a blinking cursor. No nothing.

After some clever work, I finally get in, run diagnostics, and everything checks out just fine and dandy. I continue investigating.

So I finally get into the BIOS after googling the key to do so (seriously, MSI? What the fuck kind of BIOS key sequence is Tab+Del? And you don't even tell me this on the splash screen? And you need a PS/2 keyboard because the USB ones aren't recognized? Really?), I switch the boot order so that the main HDD is above 2.2TB Infinity and it boots right up. Nice clean install of Windows 7 with no malware or anything in sight.

I'm all like ""sweet!"" and send it right over to the call center, where they quote him out the minimum charge to fix it. Now, I'm not privvy to what goes on in those conversations, but he declines the work. My guess is that it would be too expensive. Per policy, I've gotta get it back to the state that it was in when the customer brought it in, since they didn't pay anything. So I just swap the boot order back to how it was before and *poof*, we're back to the cursor and no Windows. I put it out front to wait for a return appointment.

You'd think declining to pay anything would mean that nothing would be fixed.

You'd think that declining to have work done would mean that no work would be done.

Apparently not this guy.

He comes back in acting thankful and such as if we had actually fixed it. I make it crystal clear that I'm sorry he declined work and we didn't fix it. I never got close to saying anything like we had fixed it.

He just kinda says okay and stuff, still giving off the impression that we fixed it and starts walking out the door. I stop him to give him a receipt and such. I print off two copies the receipt, one for him and one for us. He signs the one for us, and takes his. It says on the receipt that he declined work and no work was done.

And even though it's not what we're supposed to do, I tell him off the record that he just has to swap those two settings in the BIOS. He tells me that he's not a tech-savvy guy, so I just explain a few quick steps, and he nods and says okay like he understands. He leaves.

But then he calls back. He's all in a tizzy because his computer has the same problem as before. He complains that we didn't fix it. 

[Wat?](http://i.imgur.com/9R0Ae.gif)

No shit sherlock. You didn't pay anything to fix it. You declined to have us fix it.

Now another appointment is scheduled tomorrow so I can tell him that we didn't fix it because he didn't want to pay to have us fix it. We'll see how that goes.

TL;DR: Customer doesn't understand that declining work = no work.

**UPDATE 1:** He is a no-show today. We'll see if he reschedules.

1339398601.0,612,self.talesfromtechsupport,uvu0r,Infinite backups,791,179,196,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/uvu0r/infinite_backups/,"Update! 

There is now an update - head over here to read it. [Infinite Backups Update!](http://redd.it/v1dqp)

This just happened in my company...

The big guys at the top finally decided to start doing backups. We have to keep records of transactions for two years - but for some reason, actually dedicating some money to a real backup system was too much of a pain. Someone hadn't ""backed up"" to a CD (and promptly deleted from anywhere else) when their HDD died, losing about three months of their data. A customer complained about never receiving a delivery, but we had no record if it now so had to just take the customer's word for it. This managed to scare the top enough that they let the IT guy finally put in a system solely for back up.

I don't know the details of it (not my department), but he set it up so that we all have our own folders, and now we run a program at the end of each day to copy our vital data over into our network folders where it is backed up. (Edited for clarification - the server runs a RAID, but the server is not the only backup. It is the first level of backup. The data there is backed up offsite after a week. It is just a dedicated online,  onsite server storing the most recent daily backups.)
It was all working great for the past two months. We already run something to close the day, so it has been totally painless. We have backups of our active data that we can access, and daily backups of everyone's data are compressed and saved. Our IT guy is great and I commend him for setting this thing up over just a couple days.

Anyway, there is someone who I will just call E. He knows just enough to be a huge pain. He thinks he knows a LOT more. He goes on and on about how he thinks Unix is the greatest, Linux is for lazy losers, and that he has (gasp) actually installed it a couple times. He knows he would do a much better job than the IT guy, but he is too ""important"" to waste his time on that. Luckily, the guys at the top don't let him mess with the IT stuff. (To give him credit, he is good at his actual job, so is not just an irritating waste of space.)

On Thursday, E decides that he has come up with a better plan for the backups. Or at least for his backup. He sets up something that checks his computer for modified files and backs them up to his network folder every ten minutes. His entire machine, not just his vital data. In no time he fills his space quota with swap files and cache backups.

This should have ended there. His space was full. But no...
He goes to one of the bosses. Says he has some trouble with his network folder, but knows exactly how to fix it so doesn't want to bother the IT guy who is out. He just needs to ""borrow"" the root login for a bit. The boss (stupidly) gives him the login info - after all, E seems to know what he is talking about. What could happen?

E sets it up to make just backup wherever (to get around the space limit for individuals) and then sets it up so that the root of the backup server is one of his network drives. It is now included in his every-ten-minute backup list. He changes a bunch of other settings so that it ""works better"" and then goes on with his day.

At the end of the day, we close the day... and get an error. The backup server has no free space. All 12TB have been filled. (Our daily backups for the entire company are about 1GB before compression, to give you an idea of how impossible this would be under normal circumstances.) 

E had been backing up the backups, which were ""new"" files, and those backups were also backed up, until the entire server was filled. E saw that there was no more space before everyone else - so what did he do? He set it up to just delete files based on date, starting with the oldest. Not just the backups - from anywhere on the server. He didn't have any trouble - closed his day, and then headed home (about half an hour early, for some reason.)

Nothing was actually lost in the end, but we had to stay late until we could figure out what was wrong. 

We are still waiting to see what will happen to E. He has only come in to meet with the bosses and the IT guy. 

TL:DR - Server starts to make copies of itself, which overrun our building demanding blood sacrifices to quell their thirst.

We just recently published a software tool and one of the first users was an Assistent Professor from another Institute in the same City.

He is semi computer literate. I mean, he's no techy, but he's doing fine. Still, he had some issues with our Software. We usually only provide support via our User Forums and by E-Mail, but in this case my Boss asked me to help him personally.  

One day he asked me to come to his office for some simple task. When I arrived he was just in the middle of a phone call with a representative of a Software company. He told me she was doing a live demo of a software similar to ours. I was interested, because it's always good to see what others are doing and so I sticked around.

This is what happened:

Her: ""Ok, now you can click here to load the inputfiles."" *opens a 6GB text file* ""You can see the progress here.""    
Him: ""That takes quite a long time to load..""    
Her: ""Yes, that is strange.. May I ask what kind of Computer you have?""    
Him: ""It has 16GB of RAM and an 8 core processor.""

Now, I have to say I saw the specs before, and this was one monster of a desktop machine. 16GB of RAM, Intel Xeon 8 core (with hyperthreading) with I think around 2.4 GHz each).

Her: *pulling up the system information* ""Oh I see you have an 8 core processor.""    
Him: ""Is that not good?""    
Her: ""Yeah, you know the problem is that with the 8 cores the GHz are actually **split between the cores.**""     
*sound of my jaw springing open*

Her: ""You see, you have 2.4GHz split in 8. That means it's actually just 300MHz. Modern PCs nowadays all have more than 2GHz! You should get a new PC.""

He looked at me and saw me facepalming really hard. I shook my head to symbolize that he shouldn't believe her. 

She then tried to start multiple worker processes for the software. The GUI would then connect to the worker process over the network - or the loopback interface in our case. Perfect for compute clusters. Anyways, after about 10 minutes of her reading instructions on how to set this up (instructions that he also had on the screen and I could read), she came to the part where she had to enter his PC's IP address. Up to this point I was quiet, but now I was about to lose my patience.

Me (to the Professor): ""Just enter 127.0.0.1""    
Him (to her): ""My colleague here told me I can just enter 127.0.0.1""    
Her: ""No, no we have to find the IP address!""    
Me: ""127.0.0.1 works too!""     
Him: ""Are you sure?""    
Me: ""Trust me.""       
Her (to him): ""Is your computer in a network""    
Me (thinking): ""You are remoted in on it.. what do you think?!""    
Him: ""Yes, it is in a network.""    
Her: ""Then it must have a different IP address. **127.0.0.1 is a default IP Address that only computers that are not in a network use.**""

I gave up there. Just facepalmed again and let her do her thing. Worst of all was that when she found and entered the correct IP address she was all proud ""You see? This is the correct address! The other one is not correct if you are in a network!"". She later ended the call again emphasizing how important it was for him to buy a stronger PC.

He never bought their software, btw. It was crap anyways.

The HDD was spinning up, clicking, and then stopping altogether.  Told her it would need a new one.  Cost of the part, backing up her data, and formatting the new one would be $219.99, or we could forgo the data backup and be $199.99

Her response?

""My cousin will do it for $50 and a case of bud light!""

I told her to take it to her cousin.  A month later she comes back claiming he said it wasn't her HDD gone back, that her motherboard was dead because he replaced the HDD and it still didn't work.  I opened it up.  She had a SATA HDD sitting in there.  Nowhere for it to go though since this was an old 2004 PC with IDE only.

And I have parents.  Of course that means they qualify for the unspoken rule of free tech support.  I have smart parents, but when they call me for support, it seems like their brains turn off.

After this incident, they are required to only get support for my employees.  It seems like since they are not talking to their son, they actually listen.

On to the story.

I sold my parents a new laptop (their FIRST new computer purchase) and had it drop shipped to their house. I wanted them to have the new PC experience – unboxing a new PC, experiencing the peeling of the protective plastic from the LCD screen, and the new out-of-the-box PC smell.

My mom calls:

**MOM**: Hi son, we got the new laptop in and have it plugged in and setup on the desk, but the mouse buttons do not work.

Now, I am as proud of my parents as can be.  I was pleasantly surprised that they got as far as getting it out of the box.  Even more surprised that they plugged in the power supply and found the power plug on the back.  But the mouse?

**ME**: What do you mean the mouse buttons do not work? Do you mean the touchpad?

**MOM**: Yes, the touchpad, I just turned on the computer and am at the welcome screen.  I can move the mouse across the screen and am trying to click the ACCEPT button, but it does not work.

**ME**: So you can move the mouse cursor, the little white arrow, around the screen but you cannot CLICK the Accept button?

**MOM**: Yes

This is frustrating, the last thing I want is to have my parents receive a laptop with defective mouse buttons, and of course if my mom can move the cursor it is obvious that she found the touchpad.

**ME**: Mom, this is a new PC, I really cannot believe it is defective… right of the box.  When you click the mouse button you can feel it click right?  It actually moves?

**MOM**: Yes, I used the touchpad and put the mouse over the accept button and then I am pressing the ENTER button to accept.  And when I click the accept button, nothing happens.

**ME**: Mom, did you just say ENTER button?

**MOM**: Yes, and when I click the accept button nothing happens.

**ME** (frustrated): Mom, the ENTER button is NOT the mouse button.  The mouse button is right on the touch pad.  You didn’t use the ENTER button to click with your old computer right?  Why would this be any different?

**MOM**: You mean the little black squares here are the mouse buttons.   Oh yes that works.  Thanks son!

Anything else is this conversation was a blur.

**tl;dr** mom thought the enter button on the laptop was the mouse left click button.  Her son no longer provides direct them support, rather his employees do.

We had a ticket come in that read as follows:

&gt;The Computers in the Old Returns Area do not have windows access.

Since we run a combination of Windows and Linux machines in production, I figured maybe there were Linux machines out there instead of Windows machines, but due to the vagueness of the ticket, I went out to investigate.

When I encountered the man who put in the ticket, he looked thoroughly confused as I began asking him questions about it.  Conversation went something like this:

**Me**: Hey, so there are computer in the old Returns area that don't have Windows access, huh?

**Him**: Yeah.

**Me**: Any idea how many are affected?

**Him**: No.

**Me**: Any error messages or anything else you know of?

**Him**: No.

**Me**: Any idea what's going on over there at all?

**Him**: No, not really.

**Me**: Alright, let's go over there and see what's happening then, because right now I have no idea what's going on here.

So we started walking toward the old Returns area, and he figured that was a good time to tell me the issue wasn't his, but one that belonged to a woman in another department.  So basically, the chain of custody went from her telling him about an issue in a vague manner without any real details, to him telling someone on our Helpdesk without really knowing what was happening, to the Helpdesk person putting in a ticket with us.

And to top it all off, when we finally arrived, we saw that the area in question didn't even have computers in it.  It was just a series of empty tables.

He was the friend of a friend of a co-worker and was one of those self-proclaimed ""web designers"" who bought a copy of Frontpage and proclaimed they ""knew the web"". He wanted to stop creating every new page on his site by hand and start using a database to store his *articles*. He lived in a house his grandmother had left to him, computer in the basement. I see his face every time the *Make Love, Not Warcraft* South Park episode airs. He was that guy.

The site was about the government and cover-ups and the moon landing was fake and what if aliens and put on these sunglasses to see the truth. I thought it was hysterical. He thought it was as serious as an HD not found error. So I agreed to help him for $500 over a week (I high-balled him, he accepted) to *teach* him how to code this up in a secure and intelligent manner.

Him: *Oh, by the way, it has to be ASP and use an Access database.*

Jesus. Ok, I guess, no problem. It actually took two weeks, because the guy was as slow as molasses in December, but he seemed to finally get it. And it was pretty damned good code if I do say so. It took him weeks to pay me, $20 here and $50 there. I never heard from him again once paid.

Until today, that is - he called me up out of the blue, on my home number no less, and proceeded to bitch at me once I remembered him.

ME: Oh, yeah! I remember you. How have you been?

Him: *Bad. Your code has failed.*

Long Pause

ME: What? What code?

Him: *Your site code. It's not working. You need to fix this shit now. My site is a goddamned mess.*

ME: Dude, that was around 10 years ago! And we wrote it together, remember. I taught you so you would be able to fix it.

Him: *Nope. I don't have a clue what you did. But it's messed up. Not working at all.*

ME: You mean you haven't touched the code in 10 years? You should have moved on to something else by now. A CMS, or a blog or something.

Him: *Fuck no. When it ain't broke, why should I fix it? Except now it is broke, the site's a mess and I paid you all that money back then, so you are responsible to fix it.*

""All that money"". Heh. With some further questioning, he proceeded to tell me he didn't want to lose his ""followers"" over the years - he was once mentioned on TV and had nearly 1,000 hits in one day! - so he had kept the site the same. I also found out that once he had roped a guy at his host to re-code something because they had changed the way you connected to the database. But, he persisted, it was still my code and I was responsible. I tried to calmly let him know that what we had done was a fun side project and 10 years on I wasn't under any obligation to fix anything. But I felt sorry for the guy. This shit was obviously his whole life. So, I volunteered a couple hours to see what I could do. I went to the site and every page showed the ASP code. I used his login info. It was a Linux box.

ME: You changed web hosts, didn't you?

Him: *I don't know. My cousin said (host name) was great and I think we switched. He said he moved me. I have no clue what he did.*

ME: Your hosting the site on a Linux machine, they don't natively support ASP code. You can talk to your host about installing Mono, but I doubt they will. It might not even work if they do. You should really find a Windows host.

Him: *I already have Windows XP. The site still looks like shit. I can see the programming stuff. You didn't fix it!*

ME: Dude. You're using the wrong host. You need to use a host that runs a Windows server. Linux does not run ASP.

Him: *You run a web host company. Can you host the site for me? Shit, you can do it for free I bet. Help a friend out.*

Me: Well, without those boilers you're basically running at one third heating capacity.  That's why your building is cold.  You might be able to get by with one inoperative in the warmer weather, but you can't run in the middle of January on just one boiler.  It's not powerful enough.

Customer: Can't you do anything about it?

Me: Not from here.  Like I said, you should probably call [local contractor] I can get you their emergency service number if you like.

Customer: Can't you tell the working boiler to just work harder?

Me: Sir, it autmatically did that when the system started cooling off.  It's already running at 100% capacity.

Customer: What can we do about it?

Me: Get your gas line fixed and bring the other two boilers back on-line?

Customer: That's not an option.  What else can we do?

This is when I was a technician and looking at day-to-day issues.

Story: Myself and a colleague, we'll call him SlightlyShortDood (SSD for short), were investigating a networking problem after expanding the ICT suite of the school. We saw that a lot of the computers were very slow to log on but because there were some that worked fine it looked like a network switch was possibly faulty.

The suite itself had a cupboard which stored the panels and the switches in a cabinet that was located above the one of the school's photocopiers. I was on a ladder looking at the cabinet, testing ports while coordinating with SSD. Unfortunately when I leaned into the cabinet to reach one of the higher-up connections when the whole thing detached from the wall.

That's right, a network cabinet came off the wall and on to me while I was stood on a ladder. SSD takes a moment to realise but I then ask for his help and he comes to assist.

My first thought was to not let it drop. I held on until SSD could take some of the weight. I then assessed what could be done that did **not** involve removing all of the patching so tried to remove the panel and have it squeeze through the gap the cables came through. No luck. SSD and I swap places so I take the weight and he looks at how to get it down without redecorating too bad but he also comes up short.

We're at this for over half and hour when a member of staff comes into the suite and sees us. We very focused and don't notice until she's stood there, staring at us. I'm not sure what to say, neither is SSD. She looks at each of us, up at the cabinet and then back to me. After a moments' silence she simply says, ""Can I use the copier?""

But this call takes the cake.

Recieved a call from an extremely irate lady. When I picked up, it was in the middle of a stream of her cussing someone out. Once she finished her stream of obsceneties, she laid into me by screaming ""TURN IT OFF!! TURN OFF THAT INTERNET NOOOOWWWWW"" 

After a bit of pulling teeth to figure out what phone number she was referring to, I let her know that line was already suspended. Which opened another flood gate of cussing and accusing me of being stupid and/or lazy and not wanting to help her.

After a few more questions, it comes to light that her daughter is still able to use her smartphone to video chat with her boyfriend.

I ask if she has a wireless router through her home internet provider. She doesn't know. I ask how she uses internet at home, she says through her ""wee-fee"" ... So at that point I am thinking she uses her Nintendo Wii console for internet or netflix. Not helpful, as a Wii can be connected to a hard wire.

I ask if they are in an apt complex because there could possibly be a neighbor with an unlocked wifi signal. Nope. 

I am truly at a loss. Then I realize wee-fee. Wifi. She DOES have wifi.

Explained the smartphone connects to the wifi just like her laptop and can still use internet. 

I then hear chaos of cussing, slapping, crying and then finally loud bangs immediately followed by weird crunching. 

Then she gets back on the phone and says she needs to file an insurance claim because she smashed the phone with a hammer. 

I explain intentional damage is not covered by insurance. 

More cussing. At this point I opt to use the ""if you use that language again I will disconnect call"", which she responded with a resounding ""Fuucccckkkk yoooouuu!"".

The machine ""gets a cursor, which is what it wasn't doing before"" (aka windows starts just fine and dandy). I ask, what now?

Keeps you humble.

So there I was, just being a tier 1 tech at my job, supporting users remotely. I get a call, the user's Single Sign-On isn't working with one website. Now, if you're not familiar, Single Sign-On is a program that tracks all of your login information whenever you sign into a website on your computer, and then it inputs it for you automatically every time after that so you don't have to type anything. It's like TiVo for lazy people, and it'd be great if not for two things:

People often forget their login info if they haven't typed it in since they got the computer, and SSO never works the way it's supposed to.

Well, I say to myself, this shouldn't be too difficult; this site has a known issue with SSO, and there's a nice workaround where we can just grab the login info from SSO and put it in manually. Quick, five-minute fix, tops.

So I remote in, I try to access SSO's login information; it asks for the user's smartcard PIN, as it's supposed to, and I have him input that for me. It comes back saying the PIN isn't correct, even though he typed it in right and is certain of it. Not wanting to second-guess his judgment, I figure it's an issue with SSO itself, and I run through the tedious process of fixing the program's checksum and renewing its GPO. Requires a reboot, takes longer than I'd like to admit.

Once we're back online, I'm shocked to see that it's still not accepting his PIN, which baffles me. It should work by now, damnit! So I ask him:

&gt;""That *is* the right PIN for your smartcard, right?""

&gt;""Absolutely.""

&gt;""And your smartcard is in the machine, right?""

&gt;""No, I forgot it today.""

&gt;""...oh. ...that would probably explain it. You can't open up SSO without your card.""

Call time 35 minutes so far.

Customer brings a Macbook Air to us to take a look at and see if we can recover the data off it.  It doesn't boot and Apple has told him it would be a $700 dollar logic board to fix.  So he's decided to buy a new one but would like all his stuff off the old computer.


When I asked him why he didn't bring it to me first (since he is a customer) his response was basically, well you guys don't 
have a fancy store like apple and since this is a fancy computer I assumed you couldn't work on it.  **sigh**


So I tell him I will do my best and will call him by end of day to let him know what I find.


I have a special adapter that allows me to basically convert the SSD drives that Apple uses to USB so I was pretty confident I could get the data off.  So I proceed to take apart the Air to remove the hard drive and to see if there are salvageable parts I notice that the keyboard ribbon cable is unhooked.


**sighing heavily** I plug in the keyboard cable and press the power button.  I hear the familiar apple tone and the Air boots back up exactly where the customer had left off.


I call the customer back and let him know what I've found and his problem the whole time was a disconnected keyboard cable (the power button is part of the keyboard hence you can't boot it), that I have his data and it's ready for pickup.


I found out later that it sat at apple for over a week ""broken"" and that he'd already gone out and bought a brand new laptop and was outside of the return policy.

Backstory: I got a temp job as a tech support for a large cableprovider as i was stuck on economic-shit-island. I got fasttracked into the job by a friend that worked there, he spoke for me and in less than one week i had a minimum wage job. It paid the bills and my friend got someone more intellectual than a doorknob to converse with at breaks.

The callcenter was quite small, 35 people working at most and less people during night hours. The center was open 24/7 as the contract with the cable provider specified. That meant that me and my friend often took gravyardshifts, less workload and management didn't care if we dose of from time to time when there was no calls. As long as at least one person was at their desk ready with the headset.

One such night in the middle of the week, me and my friend was playing chess at my desk and i get a call. I can't remember exactly but it went something like this (and mind you that this is translated):

-me: Hello and welcome to Derpcable helpdesk how can i help you?

-customer: Hi, my internet's not working. (yes, in all of the world they all sound stupid. Doesn't matter what language you use, that phrase is just stupid)

-me: Yes i understand, can you provide me with customer number or an address.

-customer: Herpderpstreet 123 in Derpingtown.

-me: Excellent. Can you be more specific about the outage. Is it just the internet that's out or are there other services that are out.

-customer: I don't know. I don't want to check, but i guess they're fine.

-me: Don't want to check? Why not?

-customer: Are you retarded! I'm not going in there to check!

-me: Umm, ok. Are you at the specific house that has this cable subscription?

-customer: Ofcourse i am! I'm with my laptop by the garage and the wireless isn't working.

-me: Ok can you see the name of the cable modem on the list of available networks?

-customer: NO! That's what i'm trying to tell you, the internet's not working. (Right about then i hear sirens in the background getting louder and louder)

-me: Can you please go somewhere so that i can hear you speak.

-customer: I CAN'T HEAR YOU! THE INTERNET'S STILL NOT WORKING!

The sirens got turned off and the customer is still shouting. I dial down the headset and try to understand the mess of sounds. After 2 minutes i get the customer back and he tells me he has to assist the firemen.

It turns out that this customer had his house on fire and could not understand why his cable router/modem thing didn't provide him with wireless in garage as his house was on fire.

I'm that Navy guy from [that one time](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/13r980/isnt_the_c_safer_for_my_files_than_the_share_drive/). I'm back with a story from the user side! Sorry, but this is kind of a long one.



So I moved into Virginia (guess where) back in October, and got set up with a local ISP. When I got the modem/router^hybridmonster in the mail, I got everything set up, and being as ~~paranoid~~ security conscious as I am, I decided to get the 117pg instruction manual off the magical interwebz and configure my new modem/router to my liking.

    default

    default

    access denied

Wonderful.

After about a solid ~~day~~ few hours of trying get in, I gave up, and just used the thing as a modem and set up my personal, shiny router that I used at my last residence. All is well.

Fast forward to last night at about 7p.

I'm sick and tired of the crappy bandwidth, and decided to screw around inside the ~~hybrid monster~~ modem/router to maybe improve my bandwidth. So I pull up the magical 117pg user manual and proceed to enter in the default credentials, which I was never able to change.

    default

    default

    access denied

F this.

So I used the reset button^andanail to restore the piece of ~~crap~~ tech to factory defaults.

    Power: up

    DSL: up

    Internet: no dice

Fcuk, now I can't even ping the default IP.

I call the 24/7 tech support line (it was about 9pm by now) and I'm not able to get any help. Tired of dropped calls and lack of internet, I go to bed.

I recommence troubleshooting at about 8am this morning, until about 11am, when I call tech support back. They walk me through resetting the modem/router, when the call drops. OK, well I can get back into configuration, so I have my fun setting up WPA2+PSK, MAC filters, and all sorts of other fun. However, to my dismay, the internet is still not working, so I call back at about 2pm, and finally get a real trouble ticket submitted. I get told I'll get a callback in about 6 hours.

Great.

The callback finally comes back in a little after 6pm, with someone who actually works on the gear. Now for a truncated version of our conversation:

    ringaling

Me: Hello?

TS Guy: Hi, this is TS Guy from TS Company, am I speaking to Pipiopi?

M: Yeah, that's me.

T: Hey, I was working on trying to get you back on the internet. I was looking at your modem, and I don't mean to come off as rude, but it looks like I'm seeing all sorts of crazy configurations on here, do you know anything about that?

M: Yeah, I got into the configuration and set it up for my house.

T: Yeah, that's actually really surprising, how were you able to get in?

M: Well when I first got it, *insert all that up there in here*, so I was able to use the default credentials and configured it.

T: Huh. Well, that's pretty interesting, because you're not supposed to be able to do that.

M: Oh wow, I'm so sorry, It's just that every other router I've gotten from ISPs in the past were at their defaults, so I've configured them to my preferences.

T: That makes sense, but these are actually only supposed to be used as modems and not as routers, so when we send them out, their loaded with our configurations that only allow our onsite techs to access them, but not the end user. The reason I was concerned was because from my end it's hard to be sure if you're a malignant user that's setting up for a DDoS, or just a tech savvy user. Here, let's go ahead and get this thing reset to our settings.

We get the thing rebooted, and in conversation, I mention that I'm an IT in the Navy. Before the conversation continues, the modem is back up.

T: Interesting, now, for some reason, you're not able to establish an internet connection...and I can't even get into the configuration. Are you able to get in?

M: Let me see...*put in default credentials*...ok, I'm in!

T: That's odd that I'm not able to get in. Well, here, let me go ahead and pretend you're a tech onsite, and we'll go ahead and get this thing set up and ready to connect.

M: Well, I can load the default config file if you want to email it to my phone and I can pull it with a USB cable.

T: Yeah, that would be ideal, but here's the problem. This sort of thing has never happened before, and I'm not one of the guys that has access to the config files, so I wouldn't be able to give that to you. All I really can do from here is get you back online. Here's what you do...

And we get everything we can back to where it's supposed to be, and it's about 8pm now.

T: Now, typically, you're only supposed to use this thing as a modem, but since I know you know what you're doing, and since we've gotten this thing back up and running together, I'll go ahead and let you set her up however you want.

So yeah, this guy was awesome, even though I sort of accidentally ^deliberately broke into their hardware and had my way with it.

1342319959.0,591,self.talesfromtechsupport,wkrfz,IT Under Fire - a Military Experience,714,123,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/wkrfz/it_under_fire_a_military_experience/,"I work for the US Air Force as an IT administrator.  Now, I've noticed that most of the posts here are concerning idiotic customers you all have had to deal with, and for the most part, my submissions have been on a similar topic.  However, It dawned on me today that this group is called *Tales* from Tech Support and not *Idiotic Customers* from Tech Support, so I thought I'd branch away from the usual storytelling.  Since being in the military puts me in a unique perspective from a lot of you, I've decided to tell you about an dramatic experience I once had while deployed.

It was 2007 and I was deployed to a base called Kirkuk in Iraq.  The base was a joint Army and Air Force base.  We had two separate networks set up for the two services, since both had their own rules for governing their networks.  However, at some point, some high-ranking Army General demanded an account on our network so he could access our resources.  Then he decided his aides needed to have access as well.  Then his whole office needed access.  Somehow, more and more Army guys got accounts set up on our network until it eventually became the standard that all Army personnel gets an Army and Air Force network account.

Now, I would like to point out that the Army is a little more lax than us Air Force when it comes to network administration.  We'd get calls all the time from Army personnel complaining that they were blocked from certain websites that worked fine on their network.  They would complain that they can't check out their Facebook or Gmail from work.  The rule we generally go by is this: if it isn't work-related, then there's no reason to unblock it.  This not only promotes a professional work environment, but it also ensures that people don't access malicious websites and expose our network to hacking/viruses, etc.

Blocked websites weren't the only problems I had to deal with concerning Army personnel.  It was like these guys had absolutely no network training at all.  We had to enable port security on all our routers, switches, and a USB lock-down on all PC's because they would just walk in with a personal flash drive or laptop and just plug them into the network.  Talk about a huge vulnerability!  This of course meant that any time they fiddled with any of their cables, we'd have to head over to their side of base and re-enable them locally.

Any given day, our ticket log was over 90% Army problems.  We would practically be out of a job if they weren't on our network.  One of our head civilians in my office was actually fighting to get their Air Force accounts revoked.  *Let their own IT guys deal with their problems,* he'd say.

Okay, enough ranting; on with the story:

One particularly hot 140 degree day, I got a call from an Army office.  One of their computers had stopped running.  I heaved a sigh and drove over to the Army side of base to track down their office.  The office was just a small wood and sheet metal shack.  My boss later informed me that it used to be our office, before we moved to the Air Force side of base.  The Army used it as a type of supply depot.  There were only three Army guys here who inventoried and accounted for all the Army supplies.  One of them greeted me and led me over to his computer.

It won't turn on.  I tipped it and some sand pours out of the back vent.  This is a common issue in the desert.  Sand gets everywhere.  So I shook it out as best I can and then remove the side panel to blow out the insides and check for damage.

Damn, I forgot a can of compressed air.  I thought there was one in the truck I came in, though.  I went out to the truck and started rummaging through the toolbox in the back.

The next thing I knew, I was lying on my back with a ringing in my ears.  It takes my eyes a moment to focus before I realize I'm staring up at the sky.  I tried to get up and found that my head was spinning and my body ached.

When I got my bearings again, I realized that the shack I was in a moment ago had a chunk of roof missing and one of the walls was blown off.  A mortar had landed right next to it.  My truck was a little ways away, so I was just stunned by the blast.  I did a spot check on myself.  No holes, no blood.  No searing pain, just a dull ache all over, like I had just finished an intense workout.  I looked up to see people from a nearby building rushing toward the shack.  I made an effort to walk over there myself.

The shack was relatively small.  Two of the Army guys died instantly.  The guy I was helping was still alive, but missing an arm and parts of his legs.  He was slipping in and out of consciousness and didn't seem to know what's going on.  I wanted to help, but I was still dizzy and it was an effort to keep my footing.  There were already people standing over him trying to stop the bleeding.

A few minutes later, there was an ambulance and fire truck there.  There's no fire, but the ""Fire Dawgs"" ran around securing parts of the shack that might collapse.  EMT's are getting my wounded customer onto a stretcher and then off to the hospital.  A few hours later, he died in the ER.  I went to the hospital to get checked out and they just said I had a very minor concussion.  They gave me the rest of the day off and sent me back to work the next day.

At Kirkuk, the Anti-American groups off-base would try to scare us away by shooting mortars at the base once or twice a week.  They never really aimed for anything, they just pointed a mortar at the base, set a really long timer, then ran away.  By the time it went off, they'd be long gone.  Most of the base was just open, empty space, but every now and then they'd get lucky and actually hit something.  This was one of those unfortunate days.

Late that night, there was a send-off ceremony for the deceased.  Close to 100 military people showed up, including me.  We lined up silently on the dark flight line and rendered the slow salute as the caskets were carried onto the plane destined for home.  I made sure to attended every send-off ceremony after that, regardless of what hour of the night it was held.

It is the late 90s and I'm working as an internal software developer for a major accounting/consulting firm. I am upgrading a PowerBuilder application used by a small but important group of people to access HR information from an HR data warehouse. My office is in a suburb of NYC, but the main office is in midtown Manhattan.

This may seem odd now, but 20 years ago there were plenty of network systems that competed with TCP/IP. My company had a large infrastructure of Digital Equipment Corp VAX/VMS machines, and had standardized on DECNET. By the time I was there, DECNET was being phased out in favor of TCP/IP, but there were still plenty of servers that were DECNET only.

I had the new version of the software ready to go. I had not only upgraded the front end to the latest version of PowerBuilder (which supported Win95 instead of Win3.1), but I had upgraded the backend from Oracle 6 to Oracle 7. The executive in charge of the HR group asked me to install the new version on her machine so she could do some acceptance testing before the upgrade was rolled out to her staff. I agreed to come into Manhattan for a day to perform the upgrade.

She, like many people in the company, had two PCs at her desk. One supported DOS/Win3.1 and was used for legacy apps that were not yet compatible, and the other with Win95 for newer apps. When I get to her office, I discovered that her Windows 95 PC did not have the drivers installed for DECNET. I did not have the drivers to install myself, so I called tech support...

&gt; **Me (Mike):** Hi. This is Mike. I'm normally located at $suburban_office. Today I'm at the main office. I'm attempting to install a new version of the HR Data Warehouse for $executive, but the DECNET drivers aren't on her Win95 PC. Can you send someone over to install DECNET?
&gt;
&gt; **TechSupport:** What do you need?
&gt;
&gt; **Me:** I need the DECNET drivers installed on $executive's Win95 PC.
&gt;
&gt; **TechSupport:** Why do you need the DECNET drivers?
&gt;
&gt; **Me:** I'm trying to install an upgraded version of the HR Data Warehouse.
&gt;
&gt; **TechSupport:** OK. Hold on.

At this point I'm put on hold for about five minutes. Eventually TechSupport comes back on the line...

&gt; **TechSupport:** Hi. Sorry it took so long. Look, when we have issues with the HR Data Warehouse, we contact Mike in $suburban_office. I left him several voice mails, but he is not answering.

Last year, we had a booth at a pretty big IT trade show. Now, there are a lot of douchebags at these shows -- most of them are middle-aged white men who have come more to ogle booth babes than to actually learn anything about the technology and service offerings. And plenty of big players pander to them.

We aren't big enough to hire anyone whose sole job is to man the booth, so we used our own staff. Most of the guys that work for us shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a potential customer, so about 90% of our booth staff were female. These are the ladies that help create our products -- designers, writers, developers, and systems engineers. And their booth wear is jeans and a logo t-shirt -- not the sort of thing that *anyone* could interpret as inviting sexual attention.

These girls got their fair share of inappropriate comments and the like, and we could all tell it was taxing. We gave plenty of breaks for them and tried to run interference as best we could. Until some asshole decided to try and grope the developer.

I was stunned - that's pretty over-the-line even for a venue like that - but my manager's reaction was priceless. From across the booth, I see him excuse himself from talking to a dude in a suit, quick-step over to the douchenozzle, and grab him by the arm.

He pulls the guy to the middle of the booth and says ""this assh-le just groped one of my employees. That is *not* OK, and he's gonna have a bad time."" He then proceeds to march the guy to the security guards at the door.

Manager comes back, tells the lady involved to go back in the ""closed"" part of the booth and take a breather.

Suit-guy says something along the lines of ""I can't believe you just did that to a potential customer"". I'm not sure whether he's pissed or impressed. Manager says ""I should have asked him who he worked for, because I don't want that assh-le's business.""

I am right now doing weekend shift in our support center. It's Sunday morning. So there was one whole day, and altogether 5 shifts in between now and Friday evening. 

I went to get myself some Mountain Dew from the machine in the kitchen, when I saw a computer on the desk of the team next to ours. Not too surprising, we are an IT support center and that involves computers for some reason. The team is not working here on Sundays, as the lucky bastards only give support during weekdays, so the desk has been empty since about 6pm on Friday. 

The computer in question was running. 

Windows was open. 

It was not locked. 

Since Friday afternoon. 

Right next to the kitchen, where the weekend shift of 4 different teams, on the weekend altogether 50 people, as well as the cleaners and maintenance guys, could easily see what was displayed on the monitor every single time they went to the kitchen.

Now for the story:

About 18 months I was put in charge of setting up a new datacenter (New building and everything).  I arrive to a completely empty 15,000 sqft datacenter with a few network racks in the corner with our cluster of border routers (4x Cisco ASR-1013), Load Balancers and our core routers.  I confirm that everything is plugged in correctly and get the fiber plugged in.  All was good for the moment.

Now to get us some internet.  I call up the NSP, get our shiny new AS numbers and IP ranges (nothing sexier than a fresh /16 of IPv4 and a /32 of IPv6).  Enter all that into the routers and after a few moment, the fiber comes alive and we start seeing some traffic, Its Aliiiive!!

Then came more traffic (Some IPv6, but mostly IPv4), then more IPv4 traffic so I get a bit concerned and call our NSP and they re-assure me that the IP range used to belong to $HostingProvider and everything should be fine (it was only about 60 MB/s after-all).  Over the next few days I get the rest of the routers, firewalls and Viprions configured and ready for the servers.  I then disabled BGP until everything was completed.

The next two weeks were full of 18-wheelers dropping off a 500 racks, 1000 ToR switches and 25,000 servers and 100s of shelves of SAN arrays.  It was a glorious sight: mountains of boxes as far as the eye can see emblazoned with the logos of HP, Cisco, NetApp and Panduit.  Then came the contractors: 6 to set install the cable trays and install the patch panels; a dozen to rack-and-stack the servers and cable them up; a dozen to image them.

All was right in my kingdom: servers had their OSes and applications; switches had their 40 GB trunks and joined to spanning tree; Drive arrays in the SANs were configured and prepared for use; cables were properly managed and labeled; the floors were cleaned and polished.  It was truly a heaven.

But there were dark clouds heading my way...

Launch Day came with much fan-fare, we can now retire our old servers and give them their well-deserved rest, hundreds of tickets will be closed, the champagne was at the ready.  There I sit at my laptop with my bosses and most of the C*Os, its the moment of truth.

My fingers did their dance typing 'bgp enable' on the router-cluster command prompt.

I declared ""Let there be light!""

The network came alive, the NOC displays showed network usage graphs rising:  100 MB/s, 250 MB/s, I start to get nervous as this is well past our normal bandwidth use.  It continues rising 500 MB/s, 750...  1000... 1500.  I am full-on worried now.  The Viprions start freaking out over the number of HTTP/404's the web boxes are serving up, the number of failed FTP connections, rejected mail...  Logs show the requests are for domains that we don't control, and there is a lot of them.

Now I am panicking

I disable BGP again and call up the NSP and after some escalations I come to find out that $HostingProvider is still actually using that AS number and IPv4 Subnet and that I had just managed to take out almost 50,000 Web servers and even more websites...  The engineer that assigned us the subnet apparently didn't even confirm it wasn't being used and didn't do their due-diligence.

Then began the process of getting a new subnet and AS number with the NSP; the next few weeks ended up being near hell for me, re-configuring all our Routers, Load-Balancers and firewalls to use the new subnet.  Then there were the thousands upon thousands of DNS entries I had to fix...  All because  an engineer was lazy and it managed to make it through all the people that are supposed to prevent this...

It Reads:

""I don't know what you did with *Company Owner*, *Rggoalie3* but now no staff can delete icons or install the printer for *Important Company App* on their desktop anymore.

I understand tight monitoring but they have to have the freedom to customize their desktop with icons for portals etc.

They can't even rename an icon.""

Now, Jane holds a new position in the organization and I had in fact met with the company owner to decided what permissions her new position would have. And plans to modify existing permissions were drawn up, but not yet implemented.

I emailed her back and let her know that no changes had been made at all yet. I also explained that users can not install programs on their own because they don't have administrator rights. I made her a local administrator of all of the computers in her department so that she could authorize any updates or changes she sees fit. (Standard policy that the owner had signed off on the day before)

**Three hours later**, while I'm at lunch, I get a frantic phone call from my assistant telling me that Jane called twice followed by the owner because Jane couldn't do any work. WTF...

So I call Jane and she is obviously pissy at this point. And this is how the conversation goes:

**Rggoalie3**: Hi Jane, whats going on?

**Jane**: Well, my whole department has been sitting here with nothing to do all day because of the changes you made yesterday.

**Rggoalie3**: Oh, sorry about that. Did you get my email?

**Jane**: I've been too busy to look at it. I've been dealing with a 500k settlement issue. Really, I just need you to change back whatever you changed.

**Rggoalie3**: Ok, well, I made you an administrator of all of the computers in your department. Just reboot them 2 times (make really sure the GPO rolls) and then you can put in your username and password to let them do anything that requires admin rights.

**Jane**: Well, what did you change?!? Just put it back to the way it was.

**Rggoalie3**: Honestly Jane, we haven't done anything yet.

**Jane**: Then how come I could install the program yesterday but not today and why can't I rename icons like I could before?

**Rggoalie3**: Well, not all of the updates to the program need administrative rights to install. This one does. So you just need to put in your username and password for them and they will be set.

**Jane**: Well, it doesn't make sense why this worked yesterday and not today. I just need you to put it back to the way it was.

**Rggoalie3**: Jane, I don't know what to tell you. Honestly, nothing has changed.

**Jane**: So, basically more work for me then and you don't know why it doesn't work the same?

**Rggoalie3**: Well, I explained why the program doesn't install the same.

**Jane** (talks over me and starts going on a tirade that would make this page 3x as long. Talking about how she can't rename icons, so that isn't it. I think she asked what I changed 3 times and finally I told her that we could go around and around with it, but nothing had changed.)

**Rggoalie3**: What icons are you trying to rename?

**Jane**: The *Important Company App* icon

**Rggoalie3**: Ah, that makes sense then, that is a program that was installed as an administrator. So, you have to be an administrator to change it. If you make your own icon, you can rename and delete it all you want. Try it...

**Jane**: Ok... Oh... Well... Yea, that did work. Ok, well then I can fix the rest then.

**Rggoalie3**: Ok, well call back if you need any more help.

***2 hours later***

**Jane**: I'm sorry. I just realized I was completely wrong.

**Rggoalie3**: (long pause) Ok... Well... Thank you. Iv'e never had someone actually call back and apologise before. I really appreciate it.

**Jane**:  Well, I'm new here and I want to work well with you and I'm going to do what I can to make it right.

Why they hired a 17 year old kid with no experience was beyond me, but this particular industry was doing very well at the time (still is, actually).

My first ""ticket"" (the office was far too small to need a ticket system) was for someone in a nearby cube trying to read data off of a cd. As she would start loading the (industry-specific, somewhat complicated) data, it would always die at the same point, throw an error, and crash. For reasons that I can't recall, replacing this disc was not trivial.

So, I watched it happen a few times to make sure she wasn't doing anything to interrupt the process without realizing it, thought for a second, and said, ""let me see what I can do with it."" Taking the disc back to my cube to see if it would work on my machine, I paused for a second... in a House-like moment of clarity (minus the brilliance, of course), flipped the cd over, and sure enough...a big smudge from an unidentified substance. 

I licked it in the privacy of my cube (that sounds terrible), wiped it on my shirt, and returned triumphantly to my co-worker. Handing it back to her, I asked her to give it a shot now, and sure enough, it worked like a charm. I could overhear a few talking talking in amazement after I returned to whatever work I was doing before, including, ""Wow, that kid's a genius...""

No I'm not. I just had the sense to think that if there is something wrong with an optical disc, it might be worth actually looking at it. Besides, *no one* is a genius at 17.

I've been on reddit for some time now, especially on tfts and I enjoyed it immensly.


I do work as an IT certified specialist but it appears we have decent customers so I dont have much to tell. However, on christmas I remembered a story that fits here quite well...


You see, I wasn't always in IT. In fact, after school, I started working in a bar, shortly after, I sort of owned it. Anyway, it did not last (not my/our fault - the new owner of the bulding diddnt give us another lease since he diddnt want a bar in there) and being unemployed being frowned upon, I had to search for a new job.
Long story short, instead of getting into IT what I would have prefered, I got stuck at another job working behind a bar - since that is where I had 5+ years experience. 


Please bare with me, I realise this is not techsupport related yet, but kinda important.


Now, this bar was a dive and a failure. It tried to be hip but it failed. Failed on an epic scale I did not think possible.
The owner was a guy, mid 40s. His (ex-)wife wanted the bar and he co-signed the lease. Some months later the women took all the money and skipped town. So now he was stuck with a bar and two choices: close it down and pay for the lease the next 4.5 years - or keep it open to recupriate some of the losses.


Few more details needed...
Above the bar were rooms for rent. They were reasonably priced. One of those in the 3rd floor was sort of an office (aka a bed and an old PC).
The music we played in this bar came from an Toshiba Vista Notebook.


So, I ended up working there. I wont bore you with all the crappy stuff that happened there, lets just fast forward to my last day I worked there...


Boss came in and told me to follow him in the ""kitchen"". There a package from an internet provider was lying around, as well as a new modem/router (AVM FritzBox) with a few cables attached. He proceeded to tell me that he ordered internet and asked if I could set it up so it can be used in the office (since he knew I was interested in stuff like that), he tried already but couldnt get it to work.
I told him that it will be hard since I diddnt think the wifi would get up that high and that he would in all likely hood need to get a wifi repeater for ~ 50 eur so it would work.
But for now, I, of course, said yes, I can and will set up the internet. He took a beer and went outside.
This was around 4pm in the afternoon on a weekday, no other customers and experience told me, there wouldnt be any for hours and if there would be, they would not cause much work.


So I proceeded to look at the FritzBox which was hooked up. It was all wrong, so I re-attached it correctly so it would get DSL and the phone would keep working when the boss came back and asked me what I was doing.

M: ""setting up the internet""

H: ""what? who told you to do that now? what if a customer comes in?"" (he was pretty anal about not ""slacking"" (smoking/sitting/eating/drinking/doing anything besides standing at attention behind the bar))

M: ""well, I assumed...""

H: ""no, stop it!""

So I stopped, thinking ""yeah, he will leave soon then I can continue""
And he did. Still I had no customers, so I went back ""to work"", set up the FritzBox, connected it to the music laptop per wifi, gave it the providers info and had internet. the next few hours (no customers) the laptop was busy getting updates and more updates.
In that time I set up a second box I found lying around in the box as a wifi repeater.


At around midnight I closed down the bar since I did not have a single customer the whole day. I installed the wifi repeater in the 2nd story of the building and went to the office. wifi was available, I set up the computer and again, lots of updates.


I wrote down all the stuff I did and why, the ip adresses, the passwords, put it with the bar related paper that we had to do every evening and went home. It was 1am.


At 7am I woke to the frantic ringing of my cellphone. It was my boss demanding to know why I would write I worked until 1am when I closed the bar at midnight. I told hom because I set up the wifi for his office, even saving him 50 eur becau...
He interrupted me, demanding to know who ever said me that I would be getting payed for setting up the internet.
That was the last straw. All time slowed down. I had to take so much crap in the last year from this unimportant, ignorant, posing penny pincher and there was only one thing I ever could do...


M: ""Listen. If you even THINK that you MIGHT find someone else stupid enough to set up your internet, save you 50bucks by ""hacking"" a router to serve as a repeater and update your two computers for 6 eur (my hourly rate - midnight to 1am) I will come to the bar immediately, rip out all the cables, reset all the boxes and delete all the updates and give you your money back...""

Immediately he tried to backpaddle ""...well *stammer* it wasnt ment like that just ... you know ... we dont have money ... I diddnt know ...""

M: ""yeah... right""

H: ""still, I did not say I would pay you for it but its ok, keep the money. we will talk about this at your next shift in 2 days. bye""

M: ""...""


I turned around, thinking about my life, this job and that idiot until I fell asleep again. When I woke up and after the mourning routine, I went there, gave him his key back and told him I will not be coming to work in 2 days. or ever again. I quit.


Probably one of the best decisions in my life. No 3 months later I had moved away and a better paying job with the best boss ever in IT (where I am still today)


I saw this guy at christmas again when 2 friends ""forced"" me to go to that bar since every other one was closed for the night already. He had trouble with his laptop and asked if I could have a look. I supressed my laughter, turned to him and told him about our hourly rate and if he would be ok with that, I will be happy to look at his problem. tomorrow, when I am sober. He did not call me the next day... And I was not sad about that. Not even a bit...

Stark pipes up and says ""Hey SeeScottRock, come here."" I walk over, and loud enough for Frank to hear says ""Here's some shit. I figure everyone else is giving you it, so you must want it.""

This story is about none of those, but the reason I am doing this job.

If you don't remember from previous posts, I work in advanced tech support for an ISP, handling issues beyond getting connected to our network.  We do everything - viruses, printer setups, networking, XBox port forwarding, helping Granny type an email, and keeping Farmville animals alive.

Today, one of our long-time customers called in, not with a problem, but to thank us for all the help we'd given her over the last few years.  You see, she had just gotten out of surgery, and the doctors told her she had a ""death sentence"" and would not be around much longer.  Before she left, she wanted to thank all of us for the support, help, and assistance we had given her, and with the patience we had shown in helping her.  

After this call, which was not to me thankfully or I'd be curled up in a ball right now, as I have helped her more than once; as this message was shared with my department, many of us had teary eyes, some of us wept.  

So for this customer, who I cannot name but wish I could, who took some of the last moments of her life to thank us for helping her, thank you for reminding me of why I do this job - to help people.  You will be missed, but your kind words will keep at least this tech in the trenches, fighting the good fight, helping people overcome their PC issues, and hopefully touching a life or two here and there, as she has touched the lives of the techs that have helped her.

My company is very vague when telling me what I specifically need to be prepared for.  I won't delve further into my distaste for my job, considering it pays the bills. 

This morning I was dispatched to a customer about 30 miles away. Standard stuff apparently: Slow computer, viruses, tune up, all that jazz. It was an HP all in one PC and it has a wireless keyboard and wireless mouse.

I arrive on site and the customer (a 60 y/o man with a 30-something y/o asian wife...) tells me ""Now the keyboard isn't working!"" so I do what any sane person would: Check the batteries. They turned out to be dead so I told him he would need new batteries and asked if he had any. This is our exchange.

**Me** : Sir you need new batteries. These are dead. I need two AA.

**Customer** : Why are they dead? I just bought this computer 6 months ago!

**Me** : Well, they're just batteries. You can't expect the keyboard to run forever without power. It's a really quick fix though.

**Customer** : Can we call HP? I want to use their warranty.

**Me** : (internally screaming) Sir, HP will not cover your batteries. They are a user-end part. They're literally just a few bucks, but If you find it a hassle you can use a wired keyboard.

**Customer** : But they said this computer is wireless.

**Me** : Sir, that's the internet connection. Wireless connectivity.

**Customer** : Just fix the damn thing! I'm paying $99 an hour!

At this point I get up, walk to my car, grab a wired keyboard and plug it in and get cracking on fixing his 'problems.' He says to me ""How come yours is working?"" and I explain that my keyboard is wired. I'll resolve his problems shortly.

Some time passes and I'm about to leave. I unplug my keyboard and ask the user to use it and he (again) says his keyboard doesn't work.

Right next to us was a remote for his TV. When he's not looking I open the battery cover, take out the AA batteries and put them in his keyboard. Boom. Working.

Some of you might remember me from [""I'll take the antenna down](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/16b69a/ill_take_the_antenna_down/) and [Big Bad Badass Bastard Boss](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/16jmmg/the_big_bad_badass_bastard_boss/). Since they were well recieved, I thought I'd return with another good story.

This takes place early summer 2002, when I was working at the ~~salt mine~~ call center doing internet support - and first point of contact support for the ISP that did a lot of radio LAN back in those days (same guys as in the watertower story).

This is the tale of the angry printer. And no, not a networked one. Literally. You'll see.

I walk into the office at 07:55 Thursday morning to start the 08:00 shift, and read up on my e-mail. During the night, at about 03:00 to be specific, a customer to [Radio LAN ISP] have reported an issue. His Internet is down. Very well.

Me: ""[ISP] support.""
Printer:  ""Hello, this is [owner] from [small printing firm FAR up north]. Our Internet is down. I reported this issue during night, but wanted to check if there's been any updates. Our customer number is [XXX].""
Me: ""Alright, hang on, I will check.""

I check in the system. This guy has bought class 1 support. It means he pays a lot extra to have 24 hour guarantee on his connection. [ISP] is required to restore his connection within 24 hours. Not business hours. 24 hours. And we're required to tell him just that, and immediately report it to the technicians. Which we have done during the night.

Me: ""Hi, I see that you have 24 hour guarantee class 1 support on your contract. I cannot see anything the techs have done yet, but your connection will be restored within 19 hours - 24 hours after you first reported it.""

Printer: ""Good. Please ask the technicians to hurry up. We got class 1 support because we need it. You see, we're a printing operation, and we take in all our printing materials over Internet. The files are about 1Gb in size, so our backup modem connection will not cut it. I have seven people standing around doing nothing because we have nothing to print. This is costing me a lot of money.""

Me: ""I will add this to the case and call the techs.""

Printer: ""Thankyou.""

So, I update the case and give the techs a call. There's no reply, but I leave a message.

I return to work, and after lunch I hear that my collegue has gotten a call from the printer. Slightly more irritated, but till correct and polite.

Come Friday, and I get a call. Note that the problem, according to contract, should have been fixed by now. The case has been updated with 'tested - no contact with the customer's local equipment' but nothing more.

Me: ""[ISP] support.""

Angry printer: ""This is [owner] from  [small printing firm FAR up north]. Our connection is still down. The customer number is [XXX].""

Me: ""Sorry about that, I'm checking now...""

Angry printer: ""And don't tell me it will be fixed in 24 hours, it has already been more than that. I am paying seven people to drink coffee and read the newspaper.""

Me: ""Looks like they have tried to reach the local equipment...""

Angry printer: ""I know that already. Have you done NOTHING since then? Tell them to get their arse out of the wagon!""

Me: ""I will contact them immediately. It should be fixed within 24 hours...""

Angry printer: ""Well it is not. Get to it! Goodbye!""

At this time, I was a bit agitated, but the customer had been correct and not irate, even if he was angry. So I updated the case, called the techs and left a message when they did not reply.

Then it was a sweet, sweet weekend with two full days of respite from the ~~salt mine~~ call center.

When I get back for the 11:00 shift on Monday, I get called to the teamleader almost immedately.

Teamleader: ""[vonadler], we have a very angry guy up north called three or four times a day. You know the [ISP] account, can you check?""

Me: ""Sure.""

So I check. There has been no update from the techs. We have done our part - we have informed the customer that his connection will be fixed within 24 hours (as we are required to do) which seems to send him off into a spin each time, called the techs and updated the case. One of our guys have also e-mailed the tech lead of the [ISP] to inform him of the case.

Me: ""Hey, [teamleader]?""

Teamleader: ""Hey [vonadler].""

Me: ""I checked the case. We've done everything that the contract say we should do and then some. It is [ISP] that has not fixed this guy's connection as they should have.""

Teamleader: ""Thanks, I'll call [ISP] and hear what is up.""

Yet, the issue was not fixed that Monday. A collegue was thoroughly berated by the angry printer during the afternoon.

On Tuesday morning, the angry printer berated another collegue for quite some time.

On Tuesday afternoon, a tech from [ISP] got into a car to drive the 542 kilometers (337 miles) up north to where the angry printer's business was located. I worked the late shift (14:00-23:00) that evening, and got the call.

Me: ""[ISP] support.""

Tech: ""Hi, this is [tech guy's name] from [ISP], I'm onsite in [town FAR up north].""

Me: ""Hi. How is it going? Can you fix the connection""

Tech: ""Unfortunately, we have a bit of a... problem. I can't get online. Can you update the case for me.

Me: ""Sure.""

Tech: ""Ok, write this: We have a problem. We're going to need spare parts. BIG spare parts. The antennna has molten.""

Me: ""Molten?""

Tech: ""Yeah, looks like it was hit by lightning or something.""

So I update the case and call the angry printer to inform him that they are working on the issue.

Me: ""They are onsite now, but ran into some problems at the antenna. They will be needing spare parts, but they are working on the issue as fast as they can.""

Angry printer: ""Yeah, they checked the equipment here, and it was ok. I figured something like that. They better have it fixed quick, it is Tuesday now, and I reported this issue on Thursday!""

But spare parts like that does not come quickly. [ISP] suffered badly from the dotcom crash and was close to bankrupcy. They did not have those parts on hand, and had to order them. Which took time. 

And the angry printer called in. Three to four times a day, angrier and angrier, to the extent that we all feared any kind of call with his regional code. Other people who called in started to wonder why we exhailed with such relief when they brought up normal issues.

Two weeks after the initial report, I got angry printer on a call. The translation will not do his fury full justice, but I will try again.

Me: (cringing in fear) ""[ISP] support.""

Angry printer: ""I am sorry for what I have to do now. You know who I am and what my issue is. When will it be fixed.""

Me: ""Within 24 hours?""

Angry printer: ""**WITHIN 24 HOURS? YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR TWO WEEKS? ARE YOU INBRED CRETINS, OR JUST MIND-FUCKINGLY STUPID BEYOND ANY RECOGNITION? I HAVE SEVEN PEOPLE, ON PAY, HERE, EVERY FUCKING DAY. I HAVE PAID** [tens of thousands of dollars] **OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS TO HAVE CLASS 1 SUPPORT, AND YOU DON'T GIVE A SHIT? YOU RETARDED FUCKING SCUMBAGS, YOU DEVILSPAWNED STINKING INCOMPETENT MONKEYS! HOW IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE TO BREATHE WITH YOUR MIND-NUMBINGLY LOW IQ? HOW DO YOU EVEN DIFFER BETWEEN YOUR OWN MOTHERS AND THE SLIME AT THE BOTTOM OF THE AQUARIUM? HOW IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE TO BE SO INCOMPETENT? IT GOES EVEN AGAINST THE LAWS OF PHYSICS!!!**""

Me: ""I will put this in the case.""

Angry printer: ""YOU DO THAT! BYE!""

This went on for another week before they managed to fix his connection. Three to four times a day. The worst part was that the customer was right. He had paid a LOT of money to have a secure connection with 24 hour guarantee because he knew he was dependent on his Internet working. The relief was massive when we got an e-mail from [ISP] saying the issue was fixed. Then, another week later, a call.

Me: ""[ISP] support.""

Angry printer: ""You know who this is.""

Me (cringing in fear): ""Yes.""

Angry printer: ""Don't worry. I know it is not your personal fault. I just wanted to call and tell you I have terminated all contracts with [ISP], so you will not hear from me anymore. Bye.""

Me (with extreme relief): ""Thanks for letting us know. Bye.""

We did the human wave to massive cheering all over the office. So loudly that even the managers came out of their offices wonering what was going on.

I'm an electronics technician/electrician by training which pretty means I can work on anything that has electricity running through it.

We have a saying called RTFM. Most people don't realize how many answers a manual will give you. Hence my first story, the engineers that were too busy to read the f'ing manual.

Two engineers had been charged with setting up a facility to install configuration settings in some specialized equipment.

It took them about six months to become operational. Once they did become operational, our shop kept getting calls to change out a power supply about every three or four months.

Boss man hands me the trouble ticket when it comes in asking for another power supply changeout. These things were not cheap, but we were not paying for them. 

I arrived at the facility and took a look at the problem and talked to the engineers. They repeated their need for a new power supply and pointed towards a new one all ready to be tied into the buildings electrical supply.

I took a minute and looked at the gear and the error codes that they were getting. I asked the engineers for their book on the power supply. The power supply was shutting down due to overtemp. I looked at how filthy the filters were and realized that this was an easy fix.

""Is it OK if I just fix it or do you want me to replace it?"" I asked.

""You can fix it? Go ahead.""

In plain view of the engineers, I pulled the filters and cleaned them and plugged the power supply back in.

This was the fourth power supply that they had gone through.

Once the engineers realized how much money that they had blown on replacement power supplies they made one comment.

""Please don't tell anyone.""

Bonus: Routine maintenance instructions were on a label on the side of the power supply.

**Legs:** I can help you today. Please use the coffee ticket system next time, it makes it much easier for us to expedite your etc..

Gal: Sorry but I've submitted a few tickets and I've never received a response.

**Legs:** Ok! Let me review those tickets, can I get the ticket number ..etc..etc

Gal: Numbers, words

I proceed to read the ticket and immediately see why there was no response. Our ticket system is pretty advanced. When you select a problem it automatically gives suggested fixes for the issue, and at the minimum asks for basic information about the problem. The ticket also had the ability to be 'pinged' for updates by the user, rather than opening another ticket.

This user had opened 10 tickets over a span of 3 hours. 

**Legs:** Ma'am here are the fields you should fill in in the future, I see here that you have put in the problem field ""email isnt working"" with no other identifying information...etc...

Gal: Sorry. I will next time. Can you help me now?

I resume piecing together information from the rest of the tickets when I run across a sentence that baffles me.

Gal (in the ticket): I tried writing smtp.fruitcompany.com on the outbox, but it is still not working.

**Legs:** Ok ma'am. The server you are using looks correct. Can you describe the issue for me?

Gal: Yeah, I write the address on the outgoing mailbox but I still cant send emails. 
(I think it is a little strange the way she words this, I cant quite place why at the moment.)

**Legs:** Ok, lets open fruitpreferences on your fruit. Great, go to etc...click etc..Ok do you see the line ""Outgoing server""? 

Gal: (shuffling, sounds) Ok I'm at the mailbox. I see the line where I wrote smtp.fruitcompany.com 
(At this moment, I'm feeling a little more confused about the sounds that occurred. It sounded alot like she was walking somewhere, again...cant quite place my confusion. )

**Legs:** Ok, lets clear that out and put in sierra-mike-tango-papa-dot-etc...etc...

Gal: *pause..........* Ok, I'm not really sure what you want me to do. I already filled in the line and I dont know how to delete it..?

**Legs:** ..... (thinking she is confused) ok, can you highlight the text for me?

Gal: (audible *pop*, *squuuek**squeeek*) Ok I've highlighted it!

**Legs:** (confusion continues, mixed annoyance, this user is obviously doing something on the side. grumble.) Great, hit backspace for me to clear it out.

**Legs:** (where else?!?!) Yes ma'am

Gal: Ok, one second while I get to it...

**Legs:** I'm sorry? Are you not at your computer?

Gal: No, I'm at the mailbox? You told me to go to where I wrote the server name and highlight it, right?

(I'm still not understanding, in retrospect....I think at this point I should have caught on.)

**Legs:** (Trying to salvage the situation) I'm sorry ma'am I think you might have lost me there. What do you see on your screen? You should see blue highlighted text smtp.fruit.etc..

Entire departments have been hit with the axe on occasion over the past few years in lock-step with increased outsourcing support contracts in Asia.  It's a thing people think about on occasion, especially with mortgages and the other trappings of modern life in mind.  

Last year as part of what seemed to be a big initiative to get everyone 'pumped up' about the work we do for our customers, a series of tall cardboard cutouts were installed in well-traveled corridors representing customers holding up letters talking about how much our software helped them.  Development had cutouts where the letters (apparently real) were about how their data had been saved or problem X had been solved by the program, etc.  Marketing presumably got cutouts with letters from stores talking about what a mitzvah the products had been to their bottom line, etc.  

Technical support...  got cut outs with customer letters describing amazing technical support experiences they had received.  Not bad, right?  To paraphrase the general format, ""I had a problem and Tech Support was able to get me up and running quickly and it was a very positive experience.""  Cool, good to hear except...  in each instance, they called out the name of the tech support agent who had provided this amazing experience.  ""Sriharsha"" and other very Indian names were always the agents who had been so great.  

Now, I'm happy for them.  Our outsourced tech support folks do a good job and we're all in this together and so on, but...  when you have a domestic call center full of concerned employees and you put up a bunch of displays that talk about how great the outsourced support agents are, it sounds kind of like you may be sending some sort of message.  :(

I work in a copy and print center.

Some older lady brought in her laptop and asked if I could print an e-mail off for her. She booted it up and proceeded to get angry because her Internet wasn't working. I explained that she would need to connect to our store wi-fi to work. No, that was unacceptable and 'made no sense'. She 'didn't have to do that at home'. And started yelling at me that I did something to her computer to delete her Internet (??). I hadn't even touched her computer at this point.

She pushes her laptop toward me and says 'fine, you do it then'. I connected her to our wi-fi. (Oh god her computer was a mess. Her desktop was completely covered in icons). And gave it back to her so she could get to her e-mail. 'See, this is my Internet. I told you...' She half mumbles this in irritation.

Now, she doesn't know where her e-mail is ('usually it's automatically on there!'). I ask her what e-mail she uses. Gmail? Yahoo? Hotmail? She looks at me like I'm stupid. 'why does that matter?' At this point I'm getting pissed off. I have several other customers waiting on me. I mess around on her bookmarks, hoping that it was on there somewhere. Thank god it was. I connected her to the Comcast e-mail site. *She doesn't know her password.* After a few botched password guesses, she decides to call her son to ask him. I help the other customers while she does this. I come back and she gives me the correct password. I get into her e-mail. She doesn't remember which e-mail it was. I'm going one by one in her inbox. Nope. She then tells me it was from a few months ago. *Are you kidding me?*

I had to sift through 3 months of spam to find it. *It was an EXPIRED spa coupon.* I pointed out that it was expired and she waved it off and told me to print it out. I explained that I would need to transfer it to a flash drive to print off from our computer. She tells me that it should print off from her computer. 'Thats what it does at home!' I have a headache at this point.

Then, the Windows update thing pops up. I ignore it while I'm trying to transfer the file over.'What are you doing? You can't ignore that'. She pulls the laptop toward her and presses update, which requires it to shutdown. No, she didn't postpone it for '4 hours'. She does it for right. now. I am pissed off at this point.

The computer turns off and she turns it back on and lets the 100+ updates proceed. She's there for at least another hour letting it update before giving up and leaving.

The script I'd written (in [Ten Minutes](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/qrqsa/ten_minutes_a_day/), above) had succeeded beyond my wildest dreams. Apart from the very occasional printer jam, changing the backup tapes, and occasionally rescuing users from fat-fingering, I had most of the day to myself.

Unfortunately, however, the script was very crude and in certain (rare) cases it would need a once-off alteration to a particular file in order to have enough information to do its job in future. This was an example of when I really, *really* wanted the user to call me directly instead of Trying Something Themselves. So instead of putting up an message saying ""Call the tech guy"", it displayed:
   
  
   
""Error! Not enough [magic](http://catb.org/jargon/html/M/magic.html).""
   
  
   
This fulfilled the purpose of getting people to call me immediately, because the message was so bizarre that they just wanted someone to make it Go Away. Of course, I'd rigged the script so that when they ran it for the first time after my adjustment on the server back end, it displayed:
   
  
   
""[More magic](http://catb.org/jargon/html/magic-story.html) found!""

So I've arranged to have a lot of spare time on my hands at this one government job, and I've been tinkering with the mainframe scripting language HQ has started developing. I've noticed that my manager (who is not part of IT, but I have to report to *someone* better-paid on the org chart) spends her entire Friday running reports.

And by this, I mean ""manually calling up over *three hundred* mainframe screens one at a time, waiting for them to load, writing down the numbers on a piece of paper, doing basic math on said numbers, and then punching the final handful of figures into a template report which is then physically printed out, goes off to HQ in the internal mailbag, and is probably binned.

It occurs to me that this is the kind of thing computers were invented for. If only there were a guy like me around to automate it.

Wait a moment - **I'm** a guy like me!
   
  
   
So I use the supplied increment and decrement commands in the scripting language to create a library of basic math functions, and write a script which will flick automatically through the 300 screens and record their numbers. (Fortunately, the screen names are very predictable and can be generated in a few loops rather than having to manually specify each one.) Then all the numbers are added, subtracted, multiplied and whatever to get the final result, which is simultaneously displayed on the screen and printed out on the manager's printer as a one-page summary.

The whole process takes about fifteen minutes from go to whoa, most of which is screen retrieval time. Coincidentally, it's also the exact amount of time specified in the union contract for the mid-morning break. So my manager could set it running on Friday morning, go have a nice cup of coffee, and have all her Friday workload done and printed out by the time she got back to her desk.

Given that she was a pretty good (and hands-off) manager, I casually mentioned after the first successful test run that I didn't see any particular reason why I should talk about the existence of this script to any of the other managers in the office. After all, it wasn't _official_, was it?
   
  
   
After that day, I could pretty much get away with almost anything on her watch. Including things like semi-accidentally undermining the state-level helpdesk, or the ""More Magic"" stunt. But those are stories for another time.

The first part of the deinstallation is notifying users that the system will be going away and that they need to migrate to the VAX 8850.

The VMS operating system could display messages when you logged in. The UNIX equivalent of motd. Since users are notoriously bad at ignoring login announcements I would put in fancy ASCII banners and ring the terminal bell several times.  I would also change the banners around every few days so they would hopefully notice that something had changed. I would also change the data on the message and change up the wording a bit.

Then I sent email to every user on the system. When you logged in or were already logged in you were notified of any new email messages you had. So of course I am sending out a reminder email every week that the system is going out of service and will be permanently removed from the building. Please call me if you have any questions, issues, yada yada yada.

Then, because I know users don’t read login messages or email messages I write an interoffice memo, ON PAPER, and distribute it to the thirty or so users of the system, plus department heads.  So I have notified people three different ways, repeatedly, months in advance that the system is going away. 

So the big day comes, the system is shut off. A week later I have field service come in to take it apart and take it away. We’re trading it in for a newer, bigger piece of iron.
A few weeks after that a user, let’s call him Derp, comes to me:

Derp: “Where is the VAX?” 

Me: ""It was deinstalled and it’s not even in the building anymore."" 

Derp: ""What?!""

Me: “Didn’t you get my memo?” 

Derp: “Yes I did, I have it right here.” 

Now Derp was a bit of a packrat and he never threw anything out. So he is able to pull my memo out of one of the piles of paperwork in his cube and reads it in front of me.

I'm a journalist, not a tech support guy, but I fix what need to be fixed, so we save money on it. In a few weeks we will be moving offices, and while doing so, we will be reconfiguring out servers, because right now we have 5 of them, and we really only need one. I was tasked with finding out which files were on each of them, this sounds simple enough. Well no.

The first server I checked into was fairly easy to figure out. It had all the stuff we actually work on. Articles, InDesign files for all the pages, the pictures we use and so on.

The next one was slightly more tricky. After poking around a bit I realized there was a shared folder called ""Archive"" in the C:/ root directory. This turned out to be an old image archive, with images from more than 10 years back. No one knew they even had access to it.

When I got to server number three I had to figure out what was actually on it before I could begin looking for the actual hardware. As soon as a tried connecting to it it disappeared from the list of available servers, and never returned. OK then. Moving on.

Server number four was also located at an undisclosed location, so before I could begin looking for the actual machine, I had to check what was on it. Lo and behold, a shared ""User"" folder, complete with sample photos, sample videos, sample music, **and nothing more!** After looking through every single server here I realized it was one of the desktop computers. Why all the files were shared I have no idea. There was Literally NOTHING there.

Then finally. Server number five was impossible to connect to. The name didn't give me any information, so I began looking at the last two server machines sitting in the server room. On of them wasn't ours. I have no idea why its here, I don't know who owns it, and it isn't now, and never has been connected to out network. I figured it couldn't be that one. The other one wasn't even plugged in to anything, no power no nothing. It had apparently been sitting like that since we got it, years ago, never having been connected. OK, can't be that on either. I look through the entire bloody building, and I find nothing. Well, nothing apart from an old broken HP mediaserver sitting on a shelf in a room we never use. None of us know who it belongs to or where it comes from. It has the name of a person. A person in no way connected with this company. Hell if know... I still don't know where that last server is.

At the end of the day I found that we have two working servers. One of which we actually use. One desktop PC sharing its library, one server that running without us knowing what it does, one thats never been connected, one broken mystery server sitting on a shelf, and one phantom server that makes no sense what so ever. A total of 7 servers. Quick math. We there are 7 servers. 2 aren't ours. Out of the remaining 5, one doesn't exist and one isn't a server.

A week later we have reason to have a couple of the same model laptops in the office and the screen pops on one of them.

I have a rant but the techy doing the job googles and after a while finds out.....
The laptops have magnets in the case to detect when the lid is shut - rather than a physical switch - so when you stack them up the laptop on the top is affected by the laptop underneath and the screen goes out.  Strangely it doesnt seem to come back on again when you move it..

So we phoned Dell to tell them that they had wasted their time and to ask them to make a note of it.  You can imagine how that went down with the call centre.

Today we get a call from Dell.  They thanked us and told us they had added that info to all third party support documentation and they are sending us a free mystery gift.

Our conference tables have a dock in the center so users can plug in a VGA or HDMI cable and show their screen on the TV or projector. Generally these calls involve the TV being on the wrong input or the laptop not having its display set to multiple monitors.

I walk into the room and see a MacBook and immediately know that the resolution is set higher than what the VGA cable will allow. I tell them that this and say that I just need to lower the resolution and they'll be all set.

While I'm trying to find the display settings (I have been a PC user my entire life and generally dislike Macs, so I wasn't sure where it was) this was the conversation.

Client: ""There's no possible way the issue is with the frequencies. It has to be the TV or that cable that's hanging down behind the TV.""
Me: ""That's just an extra HDMI cable. I've seen this issue before. Newer Macs with the Retina Display, like this one, actually have a higher native resolution than that 50"" HDTV.""
Him: ""No, the screen is bigger on the TV so that has a better resolution.""
Me: ""Screen size doesn't determine resolution.""
Our COO: ""mmmmbeer, he knows what he's talking about. He used to work for Dell.""

~~~~ wavy lines indicating impending flashback ~~~~

Year and years ago I was working for a one store high street PC shop (One Step Beyond, Norwich, if anyone cares).

A roving sales guy occasionally rung in new business, in this case he'd sold a PC to a woman so she could do her graphic design. It had the works for the time, both hardware and software. I remember Adobe Photoshop 5 going on there, and a bunch of other stuff for webdesign and graphic manipulation. It was also my first introduction to a Wacom tablet. 

Pretty expensive bit of kit, I remember it came to the best part of £1500 all told (19"" CRT, printer etc etc). 

Anyway, I got a call from the guys down stairs. The woman who'd bought it was on the phone and was complaining about it. She'd only just received it and was claiming it didn't work. At all. I took the call (I was a wet behind the ears 17 years old nerd in his first job).

""It doesn't work"" she yells.

""Errm... what doesn't work exactly""

""This bloody computer""

""Yes, I undertand that... does it not power on? Is there an error? Anything else?"" I'm shitting it now, I have to test all these things before they go out. What if I made a mistake!

""It doesn't do my graphics, I need it to make my pictures!"" 

*...extended conversation with increasing horror and confusion on my part and furious rage on her part...*

So it transpires that she isn't a Graphic Designer. She's simply heard about being a graphic designer, and that you need a computer to do it. Our sales guy has got in there, sold her *everything* and happily ignored the fact she obviously doesn't know what she's doing. 

She genuinely expected Photoshop to literally draw stuff for her. She had no clue. I can only imagine she sat in front of the computer and did [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hShY6xZWVGE).

It ended up with her threatening to come down to the shop with placards and her kids, saying that we ruined her business and that she couldn't afford uniforms for her children thanks to us.

I believe that at that point we capitulated, refunded the computer and let her go and be mental somewhere else.",,False,,t5_2sfg5,False,,tftsflair,True,t3_13k4o2,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/13k4o2/i_need_it_to_make_my_pictures/,
1351274153.0,564,self.talesfromtechsupport,124uj8,The mouse that roared (and killed the IT department).,668,104,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/124uj8/the_mouse_that_roared_and_killed_the_it_department/,"I used to do consulting for a company with rather paranoid management, and most of that paranoia focused on the IT department.  IT was the magical place where bits were arranged but no one understood how, and since the CEO was a bit of a sleazebag himself, he assumed that anyone doing something he didn't understand could not be trusted.  Since I was the consultant, I was often approached to deal with things with an outsiders perspective because I wasn't caught up in the day-to-day politics.

One day the assistant to the COO comes running to me about a potential security breach and describes someone trying to ""hack"" into a computer.  It's a typical hit-and-run, giving me just enough details to think ""WTF?"" and leaving me to figure out the rest.   I hit up the help desk guys who had been dealing with the situation already; the initial complaint was ""erratic mouse behavior"", so they replaced the wireless mouse with a wired mouse.  That didn't fix it, so they did full virus, spyware, rootkit scans to no avail.  However, to upper management, ""erratic mouse behavior"" is a clear sign that someone is h4x0ring your company and stealing your dataz.  Hey, the CEO configured a switch once, he knows these things.

The whole hacking idea gets upper management spun up and they task me with locating a suspected mole in the company who they think is funneling customer data to the competition.  Funny they ask me this, since the guy they want me to investigate is one of my hires (maybe they forgot).  Anyway, the mouse situation is on the back burner (in my mind) while I start digging into SQL and VPN logs, looking for anything unusual.  As I'm neck deep in SQL audit logs one of the helpdesk guys runs over and says ""Hey, it's doing it again, come look"".

I walk over to the vacant workstation and sure enough the mouse cursor is wandering around the screen.  It's at a locked log in screen and the movement doesn't coincide with any elements on the screen, so it definitely did not look purposeful.  I stand up and look around, noticing that the girl sitting across from the cubicle with the possessed mouse was vigorously editing spreadsheets, clicking all over the place.  ""Hey, J, move your mouse to the left"".  She moves her mouse to the left, the mouse on the screen jitters to the left.  I peek behind the computer and find that the help desk guys had left the wireless receiver plugged in after they replaced the mouse.  Why? Because the keyboard needed the receiver.  And everyone in the area had the same $30 Logitech Keyboard/Mouse combo.

Unfortunately the avalanche that was started with the hacked mouse cursor had already broken away from the top of the mountain and was picking up speed.  The DBA who was being investigated opened his mouth to the COO about something that set off the lawyers (who were already on edge over the data breach) so they fired him.  And anyone who worked with him, had drinks with him, or said ""Hi"" in the hallway more than once a week.  All told, 15-20 people in IT were canned within the week.  The only people left were the IT manager, a handful of developers, the help desk guys, and one network admin.

The most ironic part?  The data breach was not perpetrated by the DBA, or anyone else in IT with high-level system access.  Why would a bunch of people making near six figures risk getting fired or arrested?  Nope, it was the $10/hour sales drones who were screen-scraping customer data as they went through accounts and emailing it to their former coworkers who now worked for the competition (the e-mail trail was found later).  There was some poetic justice though; the company was being sued left and right for various reasons, and they fired all of the technical people who could have bailed them out.

TL;DR - $30 hacker mouse starts avalanche of paranoia, which culminates in 15-20 good IT employees getting fired while the sales drones who actually were stealing data are left unscathed.",,False,,t5_2sfg5,False,,tftsflair,True,t3_124uj8,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/124uj8/the_mouse_that_roared_and_killed_the_it_department/,

The material wasn't how a computer works or what software does it was basically, 'A CPU is like the brain, video cards don't exist, RAM doesn't do anything, this is what each peripheral does, now lets practice how to type incorrectly.'. 

Since the teacher only knew how to 'type', and had no idea what anything else did besides what was in her teaching guide, I was generally the person who could fix anything.

Confused as these accusations, I offered to fix it. It was a simple reboot, but the computer teacher refused to let me do that, saying it would break the memory. 

Not sure why I was told to fix it, and then when I said how, I was denied...

Working to keep two thousand top-level civil servants happy day-to-day meant a lot of running around, but no moreso than the weekend we were summoned and told that the central building in HQ was rejuggling the internal locations of all its teams for whatever arcane reasons had drifted down from the politicosphere. This meant that volunteers were being sought to perform the physical breakdown, relocation, and reassembly of approximately a thousand PCs across many floors of government offices, over the course of a single weekend.  

Hell no.  

...and volunteers would get double overtime bonuses.  

Hell yes!  
   

And so it was that I found myself and four other ~~penniless bastards~~ strapping volunteers walking into the workplace on a Saturday morning for a rundown on which computers in which locations were being moved to what desks on other floors where. This was not so much a problem in the cases where the move was taking place on the same building floor (and both sides of the floor were accessible from each other instead of there being a wall in the way), even when the layout was somewhat mazelike. Break the PC down into components, wrap the cables, tote the PC (and CRT monitor, of course) to the other side of the building, plunk on desk, reassemble and remember to plug the network cable back in.  

We got started with these in order to warm up and because it was easy to keep track of each other - just yell across the floor. And it wasn't too hard - the most annoying bit was lugging a desktop case and 17"" glass tube in one go while trying to make sure none of the accessories got dropped along the way, while making sure everything got to the right desk (some of which were not labeled).  

So far, so good. We got through about 25% of the workload by lunchtime, and considered ourselves on track.  

Then came everything else.  
   
  
It turns out that it takes a significantly longer time to stump across a floor-maze with a double-armful of IT kit, juggle it in order to press the elevator button, wait for the elevator, juggle the kit again to press the floor button, ride the elevator, trudge across the other floor, dump the gear and reconnect it, and then walk all the way back. We started to fall behind schedule. By the end of the day, we'd done perhaps 35-40% of the total moves, and were a bit discouraged. We made our ways home thinking about what we'd need to do tomorrow.  

Sunday, we arrived back in the office, and one of our compadres had had an Idea. He'd found some goods trolleys in the maintenance department, and, uh 'borrowed' them. They weren't anything fancy, just giant skateboards with long handles on, but you could fit maybe three, four computers on them at a time. Surely with this increase in productivity, we could transport everything so efficiently we'd be done by lunch!  
   
  
...yeah.  
   
  
Lunch rolled around, and we were still only about two-thirds complete. We were also slowing because we'd been leaving the longest hauls for last, and these were taking more and more time. We weren't going to make it.  

And then someone found the tubs.  

The plastic storage/transport tubs were apparently used at one point to transport large amounts of physical mail around the building. These things were about three feet high, about the same across, and nearly six long. If you've seen large plastic storage tubs, you know what I'm talking about. We saw them, and instantly realised that there might be a chance to make this work after all. One ~~blatant theft~~ *borrowing* of the tubs later, our new PC transportation regime went like this:  

1) Everyone showed up to the source location for a move. We then proceeded to rip the PCs apart like we were looking for gold coins in the wreckage.  
2) The base units and monitors would get tossed into the tubs, which would go on the trolleys. Eight, ten, twelve at a time - a dangerously swaying tower of breakable IT kit. Then, a trolley-wrangler, a stablizer, and someone carrying twelve sets of keyboards and mice would hoof it pronto to the nearest elevator.  
3) Everyone left behind would continue stripping PCs down, or if there were none left at that location, move on to the next one and start componentizing like they could sell the parts.  
4) Meanwhile, the trolley squad unloaded all the PCs and parts at the destinations and left them in pieces. One person stayed behind to manage reassembly - they would rejoin the disassembly team once they were done. The other two took off at a run to the next location where there were piles of beige bits waiting, snag one of the disassemblers to be their third, and the process repeated.  
   
  
Effectively, all of us were continually on the move or doing *something*, whether that be pulling PCs to pieces, putting parts-puzzles to rights, or booking it between those two ever-changing locations with an unstable cartload of expensive things. HUT HUT HUT!  

With fifteen minutes to spare, we made it. And come Monday, we had *absolutely no idea* why a couple of people were ringing us to say their computers weren't turning on, or their keyboards weren't responding, or their screens were upside-down... still, out of a thousand moves under heavy time constraints, even our management acknowledged there were always going to be one or two which needed a little fine-tuning.  

It was, we all agreed, simply a mysterious coincidence that the affected people were overwhelmingly ones who'd irritated the IT department in the last three months. And at least none of them had to look at my latest invention, which I'd dubbed Cthulhu's Desktop...  
   
  
   
...but that's a story for another time.

Obviously, I'd be called on almost daily to re-plug everything in right.

I started updating this system.  Step 1, put in a KVM switch which was clearly labeled, easy to access hookups to networking, video, audio, etc, along with detailed illustrated instructions posted nearby.  People still unplugged everything.  Step 2, signage on the AV cabinet reminding people to use the other connections and referring them to the nearby instructions.  Still destroyed daily.  Step 3, a sign taped over the connections on the back of the computer with my phone number and (nearby) office number and a note that pleaded for them to simply plug into the other connections.  Sign is torn off and cables unplugged.

Finally I decided to replace the ancient system I had inherited in there with something more modern and foolproof.  A projector with wireless capability was installed.

At first, I was mystified-- between having trouble understanding the loud ranting and trying to identify the caller's voice. It was a woman..no, a man, with an effeminate, deep voice. Who is this? I wondered. 

I listened to the message again, and made out bits of it, all spoken passionately and dramatically, ""last night... came in, rude staff, especially woman at front..."" I thought, wait... we aren't open late, and there is no woman at the front desk. What is this?

""I know it was late but shouldn't give customers attitude...never been so upset in my life...  surely going to call your national office!"" Ah. National office? It was a local company, no national anything.

The caller continued, ""And we are never buying your pizza again!"" Ah. That sealed it, apparently our support line telephone number was one off from the LargeCardboard Pizza Chain neighbourhood restaurant number.

What to do? After I'd stopped laughing, listening to the call again, laughed some more? Well, she (we'll call her 'she') was upset, and had a good point. I think she deserved to have her complaint heard by the right people. It was a slow day. So I called her back!

I was gentle, very straight with her that I know she didn't know it was a wrong number, so she should call the correct one and definitely tell them her story. She was embarrassed. I said it could happen to anyone. Said I wished all of my callers cared so much about doing a good job. Wished her good luck and closed the call.

Normally we don't do phone support- there's a separate department for that. If they're particularly busy though, or if they want to remind us in-store techs just how good we have it, occasionally they'll transfer clients to us. This was one such occasion.

Me: Laserpewpew here what can I do for you

Durpington: Hello? Yeah, I was just talking to your phone support guys and they couldn't help me. They told me I might have better luck talking to you.

Me: Alright, what seems to be the problem?

Durpington: Well, I have *generic netgear router* and some of the lights aren't on.

Me: I'm going to need a little more information sir. Which lights aren't on.

Durpington: You know, the lights. The ones that usually blink. Two of them are on but the others aren't.

Me: ........Alright..... can you try plugging it in to a different outlet? 

Durpington: It's plugged in, I'm not a total idiot. I just can't get wireless! 

(why couldn't he just say this from the start?)

*Me, starting to piece things together*

Me: Alright sir, there's a button on the back of your router near the power button that says ""wireless"". Can you please press that button?

Durpington: Sure... Wait, now all the lights are off.

Me: that's the power button sir, could you press the other one? (keep in mind, there are a total of two buttons on this router)

Durpington: This is too complicated, can I just bring it in for you to look at? I only live a few minutes away.

Me: Uh... Sure.

Now, I figured that would be the last we heard from Mr. Durpington. I was wrong. About 10 minutes after our conversation, I noticed a commotion at the front door, and decided to check it out. I didn't witness the incident, but a few of my coworkers did. This poor user, I shit you not, **ran himself over with his own car** on his way into the store. 

Apparently, before exiting his vehicle, he neglected to take it out of drive. Predictably, it rolled forward, and he somehow managed to become pinned between his car and the car parked in front of him. He wasn't seriously injured, though he never did get his router issue resolved.

I offered them to setup daily backup copies to keep all data safe in tapes.

Their CEO refused on the grounds that it was ridiculous to pay someone for something he could do himself.

Fair enough, so as time went and as you can imagine shit hit the fan and all their data was lost due to a new virus (back in those days, a common occurence). So I asked for the backup copies to restore all the accounts info and the CEO went :""sure here they are....""

* How many times I explained to him that data on disks was stored in a magnetic support and photocopy machines work on refracted light.

When I was still going to school I used to work in a gas station as a clerk.  A little down the road there was a Dairy Queen franchise whose owner used to come in quite often, and we'd shoot the breeze.

Eventually I got a job at Best Buy in the Geek Squad (literally behind the gas station).  One day the man who owned the Dairy Queen came in to get some RAM installed in his laptop.  Delighted at seeing me again (and remarking that he had just asked the people at the gas station where I had went) I got his specifics and we started to chat like old times. He mentioned that his daughter was going back to Europe at the end of the week for her second year of college and that he was not looking forward to the phone bill.  His wife and daughter were really close and they would talk daily, so the international charges added up fast.

I asked him if his daughter had a laptop and he replied in the affirmative.  I plugged the laptop into our network and I went to skype's website.  I explained to him what VoIP was, and that if he got a headset for his laptop and his daughters he could talk to her for free over skype.  He could even use a webcam to literally see her whenever he wanted.  He thanked me and promised to look in to it when he got home.

A couple of weeks later he came back and started to thank me profusely.  He said that skype was working perfectly for them. He had also purchased a webcam and while the internet was sometimes spotty where she was causing the video to cut out, it was an immense relief to be able to see his daughter on a regular basis.

*Pete was an older gentleman I worked with. He talked his way into a management position by hypnotizing the company owner with jargon and buzzwords. ""Java"", ""Drupal"", and ""automagically"" were the core of his vocabulary. Pete wasn't with us for very long, but he will always be infamous.    
These are The Adventures of Pete, and I assure you they are mostly true.*

##\#001 Meet Java

It was Pete's first week on the job, and to us lowly peons it was clear that although Pete may have once been well versed in technology and computing this was no longer the case. Middle management told us that the owner hired him to relaunch our flagship product, a web-based service powered by PHP and SQL, using Java. Java, as Pete loved to remind us, is the wave of the future; there is absolutely nothing it can't do.

Pete's insistence on change was met with resistance, and rightly so. The programmers had just spent the last two years optimizing spaghetti code written by a man who got up and left the company in a hurry, and they weren't too keen on learning a programming language just to ""revitalize"" a rapidly growing website as a Java desktop application. Especially since they were also expected to provide technical support.

More new faces began to appear at the company, and after some questioning and vague answers, the Office Manager was able to piece together that Pete was creating positions at the company — and filling them. What nobody suspected, however, was that Pete was also preparing his new hires to move forward with the second phase of his plan to increase revenue at the company.

I walked into the office on a Monday morning, early as usual. The receptionist had powered her computer on, stepped away to start the coffee brewing, and was just returning to her desk.    
""What the fuck is this?"" she exclaimed as I walked by.

On top of my job description as a graphic designer, the IT and networking duties had fallen into my lap months before. Looking at her monitor, I noticed with some confusion the typical user login prompt… with a Linux UI. I figured somebody left a Live CD in the tray by accident, or as a joke, and assured her I would take care of it as soon as I got settled. I proceeded to my cubicle, turned on my workstation, and gaped in horror.    
""What the fuck is this?""

It wasn't just the receptionist's computer, and it wasn't a Live CD prank. Pete, with his newly hired minions, had taken it upon himself to install Linux on every workstation of a company that relied on Windows software. His explanation? ""We can't move forward with Java until the entire office is Open Source.""    
And that was only week one.

This story is from the perspective of a bemused observer as related to me.

Shebeast calls and yells at technical support because her software isn't working. What this actually means, is that her software isn't working the way she expects it to and is, in fact, working fine, but regardless some updates are in order. Jehoshaphat walks her through running the updates, which consists of the highly complex task of typing in an URL and pressing run, then next twice, during which time she complains non-stop about working features of the software that she doesn't know how to use, and how she doesn't have time for this. 

*Yes, she's so busy today because she's using a handheld calculator to add and manually enter the results of the additions of columns from Excel, and she is so abusive to the staff that no one dares explain to her the wizardry that is Excel's column summation function.*

Post update, the technician asks Shebeast to reboot the system by clicking start, clicking shutdown, and selecting reboot. She responds to these instructions by pressing and holding down the power button on the server, then informing the technician that she has followed his instructions. It's at this point that our faceless observer has to leave the room for fear of their headache becoming terminal.

We don't need no steenkin' servers!,702,147,159,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/xj5hz/servers_we_dont_need_no_steenkin_servers/,"**Background**: My place of employ is not renowned for spending lots of money on technology. Which is funny, because without decent technology, we don't make *any* money, but I digress. Recently, the PHB and I managed to convince senior manglement that yes, it **was* a bad thing that everyone stored business critical work - you know, stuff that, if it goes missing, costs loads of money because contracts get missed and shit like that - on local hard disks of computers that were, for the most part, 3 years old.



    
So, we managed to get budget to buy a reasonably decent fileserver (8Tb raid 6 storage) and tape backup unit, and sent specific instructions - with reminders - on how to move data from users local hard drives onto the server. We pointed out the joys of tape backup, and of being able to share documents and work without trying to email 10, 20, 30 or even 50 meg files to each other, or walking around the office with a bunch of USB keys to swap files. we walked around and specifically asked people if they had successfully moved their data to the server share, and assisted if they had problems.


    



And Lo, all was happy in the world.


    


Or so I thought.


    


Yesterday, as I was about to go home (isn't that *always* the way these things work), one of our training developers (makes internal and external training course material for staff and clients) came to me and said her computer was giving her a disk error which indicated a pretty catastrophic failure.



    



No big deal - we'll just give her a new laptop with a standard image, stick on her custom software and then get the failed unit repaired.



""But what about my work? Can you move that to the new computer?""



Cue look of absolute, complete and utter astonishment on my part.



Turns out that saving her data to the server was too slow when she was working at home via VPN, so she kept her local copy, and all her work, for the last **2** years was on the local disk. when she'd told us she had moved her data to the server, she flat out lied when she said she'd done it.



    



Much weeping and wailing occurred when I said I could, in all probability, not recover her data - despite my best efforts - without the management coughing up big dollars for a professional data recovery agency, and even *then*, if the bad sectors had data on them, it was unlikely they'd get it all back.



    



I'm sure the brown smelly stuff is going to impact with the rotating air distribution blades over this, but it's not going to stick to me - I've got documented proof that I checked with everyone about moving their data - a signed checklist from **every** user, even.



**tl;dr** Everybody lies. With apology to Greg House.

With all these rooms, I can proudly say I've built a pretty solid reputation for my quick turnaround for solutions and coverage for all of my responsibilities.

So, today, one of my bosses approaches me and says ""Just the guy I was looking for!""

Most of you know, with the correct tone, this basically implies ""I know you're good, but you done goofed.""  Naturally, I was a bit nervous.  Surgeons and doctors are notoriously picky and egotistical; lots of things will set them off and really don't require a good reason to get angry about some perceived slight against their OR.  At this point, I was about as excited as though someone told me I needed to finish my vegetables before I could go play with my friends, but this boss is one of the better ones and if he's coming to me like this I must've goofed somewhere...

But where?

Well, as it turns out, Boss has the answer.  Apparently, a room ""told me"" about a room not having image capabilities to a wall-mounted television ""almost 2 months ago.""  Also, they really needed this wall image to display mri/ct scans for an important case coming up and the doctor was not happy at all that the room couldn't handle ""basic"" tasks.

Naturally, this is now an emergency.

At this point I was doubting myself.  I had set that room up myself and tested each connection.  Network was good, cables were good, machines were fine and the program was running flawlessly providing any image they could possibly want from any hospital system.  Frankly, I've got the small battery of tests down to a science; where'd I go wrong?!  Did I really miss this and they ""told"" me?

So, I venture down to the room in a leisurely manner (i.e. ""power walk"") and open the door...

*To them using the monitor with absolutely no issues whatsoever.*

Well, great, now to figure out what happened.  Some quick interrogation reveals to me the following annoying discovery.

The person in question who said it ""wasn't working"" assumed the monitor would turn on *automatically* if he brought up images...

*So he kept the monitor turned off until he ""needed"" it, and when it didn't work he tried to pin it on me.*

Best part about it is that it wasn't a single offender; someone in the room backed him up that a monitor was to turn itself on when he brought up the images.

Today I got to tell my boss with absolutely zero repurcussions (and no holding back) that a doctor and a tech did not know how to properly hit the ""on"" button, despite it even being clearly labeled.  Acquited on all charges.

Company's owner was old man always selecting selecting the cheapest solutions. So no AD, no SAN, Windows XP Home Edition on most of the machines etc. Most of the employees were young people, they had some knowledge about computers, but there's the story of the youngest of them all (being 19 years old at the time).

As I said before: no AD, no deploying, just download, install, reboot. Because the boss told us about new employee on friday, and she was starting on monday, we just gave her the laptop on monday morning, told her how internal systems works and warned her about possible updates installs she may see.

""Yeah, ok, it's fine, I have same PC at home, no problems, I know computers"". Nope. She didn't.

* Me: So... What's the problem? How long have it been like that alredy?
* Her: I don't know. Minute? Two?
* Me: Oh, so that's normal, when did the last update took place?
* Her: Last wednesday
* Me: That's normal too, Microsoft publishes new updates all the time, do you remember how long did it take to install last update?
* Her: 2-3 minutes, but that's not true, Microsoft doesn't so much updates! There must be something wrong with this PC!
* Me: Excuse me, but Microsoft does publish updates as soon as possible when they found new vulnerabilties
* Her: But my home PC never had any updates! My private Laptop doesn't update at all! I want this PC to work that way too!

Okay, and now I know where are we heading. There are two ways now: just  ignore security policies (which were pretty non-existient) or act like douchebag and show her she's an idiot. I took the second one.

Me: *sigh* Ok, I see you have your private laptop with you, let me show you something.

She starts her laptop, shitloads of programs on autostart, dozens of icons on desktop, pinky background, I belive I've even seen a thumbnail of a picture of her naked.

But most important thing: her private laptop booted into Windows 7 Ultimate.
So i just cloed it, flipped it over and checked one more thing: yup, it had a Windows XP sticker on it. Jackpot.

Me: I'm sorry but you have illegal operating system installed on your laptop. That's why you don't have any updates. Microsoft is not kind enough to give them to the thefts. And one more thing. You can't bring this device here. We don't want to have any problems with police or Microsoft getting reports about illegal software from our network (of course I made up that part).

With her jaw on the floor, I left her office.

I never heard from her again, because she filled a report to my supervisor about being me being unprofessional and rude to her demanding him to fire me. When he rejected, she started being rude to him and other execs about that. In the end she got fired.

Now Read On...

---  

[In the last exciting episode](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/u5yeu/weeklong_rebuilds_let_me_see_that/), the week-long workstation rebuild process at my employer had been cut down to 24 hours. This did free up some time, although of course the Helpdesk received absolutely no recognition of this improvement.  

It was about this time that, musing on the rebuild process, I asked myself why it was necessary at all to physically transport the PC away from its desk and building, into the Helpdesk area, crack the case, attach a floppy drive, and so on and so forth, simply to rearrange the bits on the hard drive. After all, they all had network connections, right?
   

So I looked at the build disk images, and of course they were pretty much shells around booting a PC, establishing a network connection, and then just pulling down the workstation software. Pretty simple. In fact, there was really no reason to run them from floppy at all except that it was convenient when the hard disk got formatted.  

Now, sure, we *could* have simply stuck a two-meg partition on the workstation and booted/reimaged from there, but management didn't want to do that. Sigh. Thus the whole debacle with floppies and the related schlepping of PC carcasses back and forth.  

*However*, if, for example, the repartitioning and reformatting processes were separated out into a batch file of their own, the entire rest of the build process (sixty to ninety minutes) could be run to completion from the hard disk.  
   
  
Hmm!  
   
  
Some slicing and dicing later, I had an FDISK-and-FORMAT batch file which would also ask which OS to build to, copy the relevant sections of a floppy build disk to C:\BUILDDISK, kick off the build process, and then clean up after itself. And while we couldn't get approval for a keyboard stuffer capable of driving FDISK, FORMAT was fully automatable from the command line.  

(And yes, I know now about FDISK &lt; inputfile, but I didn't at the time.)  
   
  
Workstation rebuilds now consisted of:  
- stick a floppy in the workstation and reboot;  
- choose an OS (it would write a flag file to the floppy);  
- fly through the FDISK repartition options;  
- watch the workstation fast-format automatically and copy files down to the hard disk; and  
- eject the floppy and boogie on back to the Helpdesk while the workstation self-built.  
   
  
After a couple of process refinements (sticking an A4 sheet over the keyboard saying ""DO NOT TOUCH UNLESS THE SCREEN LOOKS LIKE THIS [end-of-build screenshot], and turning mice upside-down because the rebuild software used at the site was fragile and stupidly sensitive to user input), this new method worked brilliantly. Apart from having to hang around for the fast-format, it didn't waste much tech time - and certainly less than having to crack a case, attach a drive, run upstairs to the server room each time etc - and we could GBTW in five or ten minutes. From the user perspective, a week-long process which had dropped to one day was now almost entirely completable over a lunch break. Scheduling most of the rebuilds for lunches or at the end of the day also enabled us to minimize disruption to employees and teams overall in cases where a PC needed rebuilding but was still more-or-less running and being used.  

   

The best bit? Users could now no longer play the old ""Oh the computer is busted, time to report it and spend the next week doing bugger-all at my desk until IT gets it back to me"" game. Anyone pulling that stunt now got two hours, max, and most managers in the public service at the time would not assign your work to someone else if you were only offline for two hours - you just had to suck it up and work harder. Particularly if one of those hours was your lunch break anyway!  

Funny, how a lot of employees who had annoyed the Helpdesk over the years, and were well-known to be slackers, suddenly found their best work-avoidance excuse utterly destroyed in the weeks that followed. I got a LOT of ""Oh God no"" looks when I cheerfully informed them *and their boss* that instead of a week's downtime, I could now have them up and running in ninety minutes flat, and that they could use a workstation in the next section over in the meantime so they wouldn't miss a *single minute* of work...
  
   
  
Of course, all this extra productivity meant that the users also had more time to test the rather Swiss-cheese-like security around the government systems. Thus leading to the incident I like to call The Alsatian Porn and the Executive Printer...
   
  
...but that's a story for another time.

So today at work, I sat down at my cubicle to notice that my supervisor had installed Windows 8 on my work desktop. Unfortunately, he had neglected to activate the installation. So I proceed to try the normal activation steps and get an error code that our Multiple Activation Key license had been activated too many times. So I called Microsoft.

This is where it gets fun.

The first person I talked to was very calm and upon finding out that I was trying to activate Windows 8 Enterprise, he transferred me over to an ""activation specialist"". This specialist proceeds to ask me for my installation key. As I don't have it handy, I inform him that I have the product key and asked if we could use that. He said no and asked for my installation key again.

When I told him that I wasn't exactly sure where to retrieve that key from, he proceeded to try walking me through finding it. Here's how the conversation went:

---

Me: ""I don't know exactly where I need to go to get that for you.""

Him: ""Ok, I will walk you through it. I need you to click on your Start button.""

Me: ""Well, I'm looking at the Tile Screen right now, where do you need me to go?""

Him: ""No, sir, I need you to click your Start button.""

***facepalm***

Me: ""This is Windows 8. I don't have a Start button.""

---

He then proceeded to get very frustrated with me and start talking to me like I was a child. He informed me that I needed to call a different number because he couldn't help me.

30 minutes and 3 transfers later, I finally got back to the same department, but someone who actually knew what the hell they were doing. She got it activated within minutes of getting connected to her.

TL;DR: Windows 8 doesn't have a Start button? What is this black magic?

This happened today morning. I am currently heading two projects for a client and work from the client premises. We usually have a daily Dev Report and a Weekly Status review with the clients. I see my communicator pop up from the Delivery Head (DH) of my department (we are an IT services and Infra company).

DH: Hi Anomandris (Ano). Do you have a Minute?

Ano: Sure DH. What's happening?

Dh: I was just going through your projects QA stats (we have a Project health Metric which we update) and was wondering where the Monthly report is.

Ano: There is no Monthly report as of now. I haven't made one.

DH: You do realise that we need a monthly tracker. We can give the Clients more information on the Code dev and Infra issues, and a lot of value add here. Perform monthly analytics and show improvements on Infra performance management and capacity overview.

Ano: But we already have a dailiy and weekly review which has a snapshot of all this. I can't squeeze the monthly information here.

DH: Lets be proactive here Ano. Let us put all this data into a Monthly sheet, do the trends from the week sheets and present them in a hour long Monthly Status review. That way we would be able to..

Ano: (I cut him off half way with) I sent you an email. Can you check it please?

I sent him the email that the client sent to me saying they didn't want a Monthly report and they didn't want to waste their and my time in having this made and reported and it is useless to them!

DH: Oh, alright. So they don't want it? Ok. Fine then. I will talk to you later.

Why do people want to do things which are useless, to impress people who won't be impressed and create work where there is no need to? The best People are the lazy ones who do things efficiently.

We had one user, let’s call her Sandy, who was particularly hard to deal with.  Not only was she rather dense, but her phone manner was . . . unique as well.  One of my co-workers described it as “Darth Vader sucking a cock.”  Unfortunately, that’s a pretty accurate assessment.  Funny thing is, I’d met her in person, and had no problems communicating with her, didn’t notice any heavy breathing or slurping, but for some reason, when she picked up the phone, she turned into a monster.

So she calls up helpdesk and reports that when adding PTO to timecards, the monetary totals are incorrect.  After initiating screen sharing, I had identified the issue.  She was attempting to enter very precise amounts of PTO (i.e. 6.18 hours), and our software only allowed PTO entry in hh:mm format.

Me:  OK, well, that dialogue doesn’t allow you to enter time in decimal format, so you’ll have to put in the totals as hours and minutes.

Sandy:  How do I do that?

Me:  Well, you’ll have to convert hundredths of an hour to minutes.

Sandy:  How do I do that?

Me:  Well, you can use Excel, or look up a conversion table.

Sandy: . . . 

Me:  Or you can use a simple proportion, with the number of minutes over sixty on one side of the equals sign, and x over 100 on the other, and solve for x.

Absolute. Fucking. Silence.

So I was on the phone with her for about 30 minutes, she read off the PTO amounts one by one, and I did the conversion for her.  So for that brief period, I was no longer software support, I was math support.

Every now and then though, we are needed to cover for our data center techs if they go on vacation and no one else can cover their shift.

This happened on one of those times.

The support ticket starts with the client just copying and pasting an error message, and nothing else. Thankfully the error was specific enough (there have been many times when I get tickets with that, and the error itself gives no reference to where it came from, or why exactly its an error). Turns out that ssh wasn't responding on the server and the client was logged into WHM trying to restart it through there, but it was failing.

I check our back end system for the root password for this server and immediately regret it. The password is 64 characters long, and is a completely random jumble of letters, numbers, and symbols. Granted, contrats on a secure password, but you've just ensured the fact that I will not be able to log into this server. For shits and giggles I do write it down and walk down the hallway to see if I can type it quick enough.

No. Not even close. Only could make it about half way through the password before the log in prompt would reset itself. After two more tries, I tell the client that because of their password, I will need to reboot the server and single user it to troubleshoot and to change the password while I'm troubleshooting.

Nothing is ever easy, and the client refuses to have their password changed, or their server rebooted. Client also happily informs be that ""You can actually COPY the password and right-click on the console to paste the password."" After explaining to the client that as much as I would love to be able to do that, since I'm physically standing infront of their actual server's hardware with a physical keyboard and mouse, its somewhat hard to copy and paste from one system to another.

Thankfully, since WHM was still working for the most part, I was able to just reset the password from there and log in at the console. Once in, try starting sshd only to find it giving permissions errors. ""Well, that's odd."" I think to myself. I then try restarting another service just as a test, only to find I don't have permission to do that either. Thinking I might be going crazy, I look at the prompt, and yes, I am logged in a root, why does root not have permission to restart a service. Check the sshd config, everything looks right. Then check the permissions on it.

Its owned by a cpanel user. Check the permissions in /etc/init.d/. Everything is owned by a cpanel user. Check a few other directories...all owned by a cpanel user.

At this point, I already know exactly what happened, and I decide to check history.

There are a few chowns on a couple files and folders, then a few more, then a few more. Looks like the client was troubleshooting a permissions error. And then I see it.

chown -R &lt;cpanel user&gt;:&lt;cpanel user&gt; /

Twice. I could almost feel the frustration of the client that resulted in running the command twice. Gotta make sure its done completely.

Needless to say, the server had to be reinstalled.

Now, I've previously told about how I got AT&amp;T to reduce my neighbor's phone+DSL bill by $20/month AND up the bandwidth from 768kbps to 6Mbps, and in return he lets me use his wifi for free. [I also set up his new laptop] 

So I log into his 1701HG and... all the settings are wiped. I call AT&amp;T and immediately say ""Hi, all I need is the provisioning code for the modem."" and they actually go off script and give it to me! Well done!

I enter in all the setup info, and there's no DSL signal. I'll have to wait for morning and go over there and fix things.

Well, it turns out he was on the phone to AT&amp;T the day before for over an hour, trying to fix his inability to get on the net. AT&amp;T support had him swap filters, phones, wires, reset the modem to factory default...

I swap the filters, phones, and wires back to the way I had set them up before and connect with my Nexus 7. We have internet!

Now I look at his laptop. Can't browse, not even to the modem [this is where you fucked up AT&amp;T, you should have realized the problem was the PC]. I ping google.com. That works. Perhaps some malware has borked something, added a proxy or altered the hosts file? He tells me he installed Norton 360, there's no way he could have gotten a virus.

Norton 360... When I set the PC up, I installed Microsoft Security Essentials. Obviously some evil do[good]er has influenced him to pay money for the superior [ahem]  protection of Norton 360...

I take the computer home to work on it over night. Can't browse, can ping. Proxy setting blank, hosts file untouched. I Google that. Oh, someone said this happened to them, and Skype still worked. Try Skype, it works. So ICMP and UDP work, TCP is blocked. Interesting. Boot into safe mode. Everything works. Reboot. Maybe it's Norton? Try to remove it. Nothing seems to be happening. What? Malwarebytes is on this thing too? Try to remove it. Error message about broken uninstall. Great.

Time for System Restore! I go back 2 days, before the latest windows update. Damn this takes a long time... reboot. I can browse! Try to remove Norton again. Nothing. Pop! ""Windows has installed important updates and needs to shutdown"". Go ahead, I'll get some coffee. ""Installing update 1 of 3...""

I'll have to go to the Norton and Malwarebytes sites, get the softwares, reinstall them to uninstall them. ARRRGHH!! Can't browse again! I delete the wifi profile so it won't update again, run System Restore again. On my PC, I go to download 360... no trial version on the site? At least I couldn't find one. Well, maybe he bought it directly from Norton, let's try logging in with his email and password [of course he has one pw for everything]. Well, that worked, I take a look at his account. He bought the family package, 3 copies of Norton 360 [for him, daughter, grandson]. And there are 0 downloads left. You mean I can't download again? WTF Norton?! WHY!? Trying to stop pirating?

I obtain a copy of 360 by other means [wink wink] and a copy of Malwarebytes, put them on a flash drive, install them and uninstall them, reconnect his wifi, let windows update again, reboot, and INTERNETS!

I reinstall MSE and bring the laptop back.

I tell him that the problem was indeed malware, and its name is Norton 360.

Then I fix his mail filters so his dating websites mails gets into his hotties folder.

tl;dr - if malware authors used UDP or ICMP they wouldn't be stopped by Norton.",,False,,t5_2sfg5,False,,,True,t3_1bezax,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1bezax/another_tale_about_my_85_year_old_neighbor/,

She was very pleased with it, and everything was working fine, for a few months that is.

One day she called me and said that her cellphone had become alcoholic, and because if it, refused to receive SMS messages. I was very unsure as to what she meant, and went though a few basic things. Restarting it, taking out the battery, checking that it had a signal, checking that the SIM card was properly secured, but everything seemed to be in order. I decided to head over to her house to have a closer look.

When I had her phone in my hands I started by trying to send her an SMS. It is worth noting at this point that this took place in Norway, where the word for drunk is ""full"", which just so happens to also be the word for ""full"" in the English language.

""Memory Full"", the phone exclaimed as I tried to send her a message. She said the phone had been like this for a week now, and even went as far as to call the phone ""A worthless drunkard, just like my last husband.""

I deleted her messages, all 2700 of them, which had accumulated over the past few months, the phone sobered up, and everything was fine again.

These are The Adventures of Pete, and I assure you they are mostly true.*

##\#002 The Light Switch

It was Pete's third or fourth week with the company, and he and his minions had settled into a happy routine. One of his three new hires had already quit, realizing he was woefully under-qualified for just about everything, and Pete was told in no uncertain terms that he was not to hire anybody else without clearing it with the owner.

I was working late, trying to figure out why our two big printers disappeared from the network and brought production to a halt, and Pete was the only other employee left in the office. He didn't have anything to do as far as I could tell, since he just followed me everywhere I went like a lost puppy. Our travels took us into the server room, where I was fiddling with the network cables trying to find the one leading to the switch that served the printers. No, they weren't labeled.

Pete's face lit up like Christmas as his eyes took in the splendor of rack servers and networking equipment.    
""Why don't I have any of this?"" Pete asked.    
""Any of what?"" I replied.    
""These!"" he exclaimed, pointing at the rack.    
I shook my head and laughed. ""Those are the servers, Pete. You and your team already have access to them."" I pointed to one in particular and said ""This one hosts your development environment, among other things. I've found what I'm looking for, come on.""

Pete followed me to the production room, pestering me incessantly and disrupting my thoughts as I tried to sort out the problem. I finally realized that the uplink port on the network switch used by the printers had burned out — nothing a crossover cable can't temporarily fix.

It was the first time I had locked up the office, so I wandered around for a few minutes trying to find all of the light switches while Pete returned to his office and made his preparations to head home. I stumbled across a switch in the office next to Pete's that didn't seem to do anything, so I flipped it off and on a few times while looking around. Sure enough, it controlled the lights in another room: Pete's office.

I stepped through his door and pointed up at the lights as I asked ""Did you know that the switch for these lights is in the office next door?""    
""Oh, no,"" Pete said. ""These lights don't have a switch, they just stay on all the time. They use less energy that way, but sometimes they short out. I think they need their ballasts refilled.""

I spent another five minutes toggling the lights in his office, trying to explain the cause and the effect before I got tired of his increasingly insulting comments and shooed him out the door so I could lock up. In spite of my best efforts, Pete never learned that the switch controlling the lights in his office was in the room next door.",,False,,t5_2sfg5,1349467692.0,,tftsflair,True,t3_10znvb,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/10znvb/the_adventures_of_pete_002_the_light_switch/,

So I work at a University Help Desk, we get some pretty strange stuff from time to time...(my personal favorite was someone asking us what the price of milk was)  At any rate...

The apartment style living center just off of campus is controlled by Residence Life and for the life of me they have their internet configured through a local cable company instead of running through the University System like all the rest of the Residence Halls.

For the longest time we kept getting phone calls from people new to the Apartment style living center saying that they couldn't setup their internet and we told them to contact the cable company or residence life because there's simply nothing we can do to support them besides generic ""Have you tried turning it off and on again?""

So finally a user, Derpina calls saying they can't get internet in their dorm and I ask if they've contacted Cable One, and apparently Cable One said that they didn't work with that particular building.  I then asked if they had talked to Residence Life and they had said that they needed to talk to Cable One.  Mind you this conversation had been across 3 or 4 different phone calls and I was really starting to feel bad for this person who was getting the royal run-around.  (I don't feel this way anymore, i had my sympathy gland removed last week.)

So with Derpina still on the line I call Res Life and I after a short introduction say, ""Assume that I have just come to campus.  I'm trying to setup my internet in this Res. Hall... what's the first step.  And so for the next 45 minutes we go through bit by bit (starting with room sign up) to figure out what we could possibly be missing and apparently there's a form that needed to be filled out that only the Residence Life has access to.  They send that form to the cable company who then activates the internet in the room.

I then ask ""Have you guys ever, considered, actually telling anybody about this form?  Y'know maybe letting people know that this step needs to be completed?""  To which he responds ""No.""

I very audibly smack the receiver against my head mumbling loud enough for them to hear ""stupid, stupid, stupid...etc...""  After a few moments of this I tell Derpina, ""this is the form you need to fill out.""  

Since that phone call with Residence Life, I'm not sure what they did, but we've never had a complaint regarding the internet issues in the Apartment Style Housing ever.  (~ 2 years)

I work in entry-level tech support for a major US computer company, where I handle approximately 20 different accounts, ranging from manufacturing to healthcare facilities/hospitals. Furthermore, I happen to work the night shift, 7pm-7am, with only one other agent in queue. Simply put, it's the Perfect Storm of Entry-Level Hell.

We begin our story shortly after I started my job with the company. I'd had some experience working on computers from a few high school classes, and from tinkering on my own rig, however this was my first actual tech support job- hell, my college degree was in Engineering Tech: Robotics. As I had only been there a couple months, I was still in that phase of ""Oh god, I'm gonna screw something up and get fired."" However, I had thankfully already mastered the art of **bullshit**.

This fine evening, I received a call from a rather irate doctor. He was using a portable scanning device that authenticates through a medical records program known as Cerner. Now, the problem with these units was if they lost their wireless signal for even a moment while you were logging in (and this happened quite frequently at this hospital), their cerner account would be locked, so they'd have to call in to have it unlocked. Well... this doctor had the unfortunate bad luck of having it happen to him multiple times that day. So by the time he gets to me, he's rather upset. The call goes something a little like this...

**Me:** ""Thank you for calling the Derp Service Desk, this is Ocramzeej66, can I get your last/first name please?""

*information is gathered*

**Me:** ""Thank you, Dr. Herp, what can I do for you today?""

**Doctor:** ""It's these damn C5 units! I've gotten locked out of Cerner again! This is the 4th time today! You know, it's people like you that let people die every day!""

**Me:** ""... I'm sorry, sir? I apologize that you keep getting locked out, it's an issue with the wireless infrastructure, it's nothing we have any control over.""

**Doctor:** ""SEE!? There you go passing the buck again! You're letting people die every day because you can't man up and take responsibility! This issue needs to be fixed NOW""

**Me:** ""Sir, if you have an issue with the way the hospital's wireless infrastructure is set up, I recommend you bring it up with your hospital's IT Director. It's unfortunately nothing that I have any control over. I would fix it if I could, sir.""

**Doctor:** ""That's unacceptable. Now, since you're such a lazy sack of shit, I demand that you bring this issue up at your next staff meeting. THIS WILL BE ADDRESSED!""

**Me:** ""... Yes sir. I will be sure to do this at the very next staff meeting. It's unacceptable, and you've motivated me to take responsibility for our actions.""

**Doctor:** ""Good. It's nice to see someone listens to their betters these days.""

I went on to unlock his account again, and he was able to log in. I should note, however, that since I've been employed here... we've never had a staff meeting. But the next one we do...

I actually work at a bike shop, which let me tell you has a LOT of interesting stories, but that's for another sub. This is a story a good friend and customer of mine told me.

His mother (we'll call her Mary) is an administrator at a Catholic nunnery in New England. They do a lot of community work and are wonderful people, but...not very tech-savvy, as one might guess.

So, something had happened to their networking equipment. I'm not sure of the details - it wasn't completely inoperable, but it was certainly not working properly. Mary had scheduled an appointment with their IT contractor, but he wouldn't be able to come in for a couple of days. Meanwhile, the nuns did their best to fix it through prayer and faith, which was ineffective to say the least.

The IT guy came by, and Mary showed him to the server room. He went to work and about five minutes passed when she heard him yell ""OH JESUS --- AAAAAUGHH"" some fumbling, and then he rushed by with his tools in tow. She was in a phone call and couldn't ask what was wrong, but a few minutes later she heard sirens outside. After going outside she discovered the distraught IT guy on the steps being questioned by several police officers from the homicide squad.

Increasingly alarmed, Mary asked the officers what this was all about. They said the had received a call from the IT guy about discovering human remains in the server closet. Thinking this impossible, she took the officers to the closet. When they opened the door, they saw what the IT guy had seen.

The nuns had exhumed the body of their founding nun and placed her skull and several other bones on top of the servers to assist in their prayers. They had neglected to tell ANYONE, even Mary.

The remains were returned to the tomb and the nuns were given a very stern talking to about proper protocol with IT, as well as bones.

I used to work in an unnamed big box store as a computer tech.  I'm not proud to have worked there, I was desperate, but am proud of the job I did - we were one of the few stores that actually did a reasonable job.  You could bring your computer to us and get it back with the problem solved in a day and a half, and we'd never try to sell you shit you didn't need if you didn't want it

One day this unpleasant older lady comes in.  At this point I'd been there long enough to be able to smell the bad ones from ten yards, and she's already huffy because she's incapable of reading signs, waited in line at the wrong counter and was sent round to us, but I greet her in my usual cheerful fashion and ask what I can do for her.

&gt;""I'm here to pick up the computer my husband dropped off.  You guys have had it for ever but the guy finally said it was ready.""

Well crap, this is going to get worse in a hurry - we can't release a computer to somebody whose name is not on the ticket without a copy of the receipt, for liability reasons.  She's already unhappy, and she's just going to flip when I tell her I'm going to have to call the number on the ticket and ask permission to release it.

Sighing inwardly and putting off the inevitable a moment in the vain hopes that her name is on it somewhere in addition to her husband's, I get the last name, and go in the back.

It's not there.

I check the completed section.  I check the waiting-for-stuff section.  Nada.  Oh cock.

I go back out and verify the name.  I ask if there's another name it might be under.  I return to the back, re-check all the shelves, then check the bench.  Nothing.  I pull up our tracking system and try a few spellings of the name, still nothing.

OK, this is going to be a problem now.

I go back out and say ""I'm sorry, I'm having a little trouble tracking it down, could I get your phone number so I can try looking it up that way?""

And with that, she goes from 0 to murderous-bitch-from-hell.

&gt;""WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU'VE LOST MY COMPUTER? HOW COULD YOU LOSE MY COMPUTER???""

""Ma'am, we haven't lost your computer, I just didn't see it when I looked.  If I can get your phone number, I can look it up in our system and it'll give me a better idea where to look"".  Thinking possibly it got sent off for service for a hardware fault we couldn't do in-store.  Or at least I'll find notes on it saying it's definitely completed, or actually waiting for OS discs, or something.

I finally coax her number out of her and plug it in. Still nothing.  Fuck.  I ask if there's another number it might be under, she says no and just gets louder and more obnoxious.

&gt;""YOU'VE LOST MY COMPUTER, I TOLD HIM THIS WOULD HAPPEN, YOU GUYS ARE ALL INCOMPETENT AND YOU'VE HAD IT FOR A WEEK NOW AND HAVE BEEN GIVING ME THE RUNAROUND EVERY TIME I CALL, AND THE GUY FINALLY CALLED THIS MORNING TO SAY IT WAS READY AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU'VE LOST IT???""

Now I'm starting to get confused.  I'm pretty sure if we'd had a system for that long I'd know about it - as I said, we typically had people back out the door in less than two days.  Well, there's one more thing I can try...

I ask her if she has the receipt, knowing she probably doesn't, but that will have the ticket number on it, and with that I can DEFINITELY track it; ticket numbers are infallible.  Of course, she doesn't, her husband probably has it at home, despite our repeated reminders to customers that if they want anyone else to pick it up, they HAVE to have the receipt.  I have nothing else to go on, though, so I ask her if she can call him and ask him for the ticket number.  She continues to call me incompetent and bitch about our awful service, but she pulls out her phone anyway.

After a few words to him (none of which were ""do you have the receipt for the computer"", more like ""these idiots have lost my laptop""), she hands the phone to me.  HE then starts cussing me out for losing their computer.  He slanders my competence and uses language I normally won't stand for, but I need this damn ticket number from him.  I finally get a word in edgewise to ask him for the info off the receipt.  He won't give it to me, he just keeps yelling.

Then, something clicks.  The *guy* said it was ready?  I ask her who she talked to.  She said ""I don't know, I think Ryan or something"".  Well, the person who did our calling that day was called Tabitha, so something wasn't right.

I say ""one moment, let me check something"", and hand the still-squawking phone back.  In the back room, I pick up our phone, and dial the other big-box store in the same shopping center that also services computers.  I get my friend who works there.

""Hi Nate, do you guys have a computer there under the name of Dorner?  You do?  And it's ready to be picked up?  Great.  She'll be in in a minute, you might want to have it ready"".

I go back out and say ""Ma'am, I've figured out where your computer is.  If you go out and turn left and head over to our competitor in the next parking lot, I already spoke to Nate over there and he has your computer waiting for you"".

And in a blissful moment, she finally stops yelling.  She looks at me glassily for a moment, but refuses to deflate.  ""Oh"", she says, ""he swore he dropped it off here.  He must not have had his coffee that morning"".  And turns and walks out, without even so much as a ""sorry I was such a colossal c**tpuffin to you for the last 20 minutes"".

And that is the story of the worst customer I ever had.

Go on, I know you will read this!), I figured I would post this tale of humor and woe, regarding his new job in a customer support/engineering role.


He has been there for just under a week now, and has been fitting in quite well. From what I've been told, he loves it there, and there is even a pin ball machine in the lunch room. 


So, two days in, and he listens in on his first tech support call with his supervisor, just to gauge what it would be like. It apparently went as so... (after all the customer service number pleasantries) 

**Customer (C)**: We're having a few issues accessing files at work


**Supervisor (S)**: Ah ok, let's get this fixed up for you. What server are you trying to access?

**C**: We don't have a server.

**S**: But you still use our systems?

**C**: Yes, on this laptop.

*At this point, the supervisor put it on speaker phone for people to listen to.*

**S**: So all the files for your data base are on that one laptop?

**C**: Yes.

**S**: Can I talk to your manager?

**C**: I think that is me.

**S**: Good, well can I talk to your IT department head?

**C**: I think that is me as well

*The amount of -headesk- was astounding.*

**S**: (In an attempt to try and get somewhere with this guy) So, what went wrong with the laptop?

**C**: I don't know. Everyone just gets the files off this laptop. We keep it on all the time.

**S**: Hang on... does the laptop have administrator privileges?

**C**: Everyone in the office does.

**S**: So no firewalls or protection? Do you have any back up to go on? (Such a hopeful question)

**C**: We never bothered with back ups. This has happened before, so we just assumed it would happen again.

**S**: Wait... how many times has this happened?

**C**: Three

By this time, the people listening were facepalming so hard their hands were just about touching the back of their heads. Apparently it was a tradie (laboring) workforce who didn't have much in the way of an IT person, and had basic use of a data base system. A whole years worth of work, lost. The worst thing was is that they just wanted to see if they could recover the files, not improve their system in any way. 

Honestly, it was the worst amalgamation of circumstances surrounding a tech support call he could have witnessed. Although, after being on this subreddit, I have heard worse.

People who aren't tech-savvy, people who get IE with their default computer installations, etc.; we have Firefox installed on all university machines as a matter of procedure, but we can't really control anyone's private hardware, and I don't really begrudge people for using IE, even if I personally condemn it.

However, IE is enough of a problem with the university website, and especially Moodle, that it was disrupting normal workflow here at the helpdesk. Throughout about the first year I spent here, roughly half or more of our tickets could be boiled down to ""I'm on the website, but [x] isn't displaying!"" ""Are you on Explorer?"" ""Yeah..."" ""Well, quit it."" It was starting to get in the way of the real problems, so a couple of our guys decided to do something about it.

Their solution? Make a gigantic graphic telling people something to the effect of, ""We've detected you're using Internet Explorer; this browser can cause problems, so we recommend using the free browser Firefox instead,"" with a link provided. The graphic is bright yellow, and big enough that to see *any* page on our site, you need to scroll down a bit to get past it. 

Naturally, this still posed a few problems, such as one memorable call that went, ""Ugh, what is with that big ugly yellow banner on the webpage? I keep having to scroll down to see anything!"" But for the most part, all was well.

Until tonight, however. A couple people attempting to log in managed to completely miss the warning banner. One of them had apparently been using Firefox until recently, but had accidentally set her default browser back to IE without knowing it, and was befuddled.

&gt;""I keep trying to log on, but everything looks different. Some stuff isn't showing up.""

That was my first clue.

&gt;""And there's this big yellow banner in my way! That was never there before. I don't understand what's going on, can you fix it?""

Suspicions confirmed; I decided to have a little fun of my own, though, so I followed up with a concerned voice and a wry grin,

Fast forward to last week (Mid January). Get a call from above user, wanting to know when we were going to take a look at her computer. I told her that computers freeze up all the time for various reasons, and that we had put been putting it off until we got caught up, or until it started to cause her a problem.

* * *

I had been working in the store for a good half year by now and the summer vacation was just a few weeks away. Working in the store had been good for the last few weeks. The regular customers were finally accustomed to me and did not ogle as much anymore and uncomfortable interactions were at an all time low. Not responding to the webcam offer probably had made its rounds and made the creeps give up hope and move to other things.

Don had a newfound love for playing video games and was locked up in his office for hours on end. I did not know what he was playing, but it was probably an MMO as I sometimes heard him talk and shout in his office. One of our headsets was missing too. 

Richard and Frank were in the back working on the computers, at least that was what I wanted to believe; they were probably browsing through peoples files and copying whatever they found interesting to their hard drives. We had been sold out of ethics a long time.

I was cleaning up the store, which was slowly but surely recovering from its midlife crisis. A poster had made its way on the store windows again and one of the tables had already disappeared to the back.

A middle-aged woman came into the store. She had an old IBM Thinkpad in her hands and I signaled her to go up to the counter.

When we both got to the counter she put down the Thinkpad and I asked her what was wrong. She told me that she had bought the computer here over a year ago and was using it without any problems until yesterday. She had been typing an e-mail on her computer when it just died. She had tried to turn it back on again, but it did not work, and neither did replugging the battery and charger. 

I checked with a different charger; nothing. I tried with a different battery; nothing again. I now had to tell her the problem was probably with the power management on the motherboard. To be sure, we had to open it up and see for ourselves. Repairs would probably run into the high hundreds for a motherboard replacement. She did not like the estimation. 

“But I have a warranty!” she said with a somewhat threatening voice. “Only for the first 6 months,” I said, “It’s a refurbished model”. She did not want to pay hundreds of dollars for repairs, and honestly I could understand that. “I’ll see what other options we have for you.” I checked the store computer if we had any comparable notebooks in the back that could replace the broken one. We did; the exact same model with a slightly better processor. She asked what the price would be. “$249,” I said, “and we will switch the hard drive so you will still have all your files.”

She did not want it. Knowing that we had another computer, she tried to get that for free because she had a warranty. “Can’t you just switch them? Your boss doesn’t need to know,” she said. I was not going to switch the notebooks. 

By now she had made enough noise for Jeremy to come to the counter as well. Her face lit up. Not thinking anything else of it, I turned back to the PC to look up the price for the motherboard of her notebook. Before Jeremy could even say anything she said, “I bet you can use some fun around this place”. I looked up; she had pulled up her shirt and was now showing her boobs to Jeremy and me. “Get my ThinkPad replaced and I’ll let you play with them”. She saw my surprised face and frowned. “Sorry, I don’t do girls, sweetie.”

Before us now stood a 40-something woman with her top off. She probably was pretty back when she was my age, but that had faded away from the large amounts of sunbathing she had done. Her skin was orange and old, looking like the surface of Mars. Her breasts were saggy and wrinkled. She had a bit of a weight problem, but wasn’t obese. Jeremy quickly replied with what had to be his magnum opus: “The fact that I work with old computers doesn’t mean I like all old things.” Her personality sphere malfunctioned; it was a critical hit on her system. Jeremy continued on, “please pull up your top and either pay for the repairs or leave the store.” I was laughing at this moment, adding to her anger.

Her charm had not worked. She demanded to speak to the boss. Neither Jeremy or me wanted to deal with her anymore today. We told her Don was out for the day and would be back tomorrow morning. She left, saying she would be back the first thing tomorrow morning. I didn’t care, I wasn’t scheduled until one in the afternoon. 

When I came in that afternoon the first thing I did was to check the stockpile of notebooks. The ThinkPad was nowhere to be found. I did not want to know what happened this morning. Don’s office was closed as usual, and I was not going in. I went to work and had an uneasy feeling all day; Jeremy had the same. At around four Don came out of his office. He was leaving early; he had a date with somebody he met this morning. 

Jeremy later went into his office to look at his internet history: he had been looking up dating advice all day.

* * *
 
So this next story happened about a few weeks before Richard and Frank got fired and may involve trace amounts of time travel. So, word of advice: if you meet yourself reading this, don’t make eye contact.
 
I was working in the store when a father and son came in. The father was a man in his late 50s and looked like a mix of a British lord and a crazy scientist. The son was a perfect stereotype of a Hollywood computer geek with an extra dash of social awkwardness.

They were looking for a new notebook he could use for college. He would be studying computer science in the fall, his father told me. The son remained silent and probably felt uncomfortable in the situation. I noticed that he kept looking at me - he knew what was going to happen and he could do nothing about it.

“My son deserves the very best notebook to make his study a success,” the father said loudly, as if he was proclaiming the word of God. Thinking about it, I should have said something along the lines of, “and thats why you chose our store, you will only find the very best quality here.” However, I know I could not have said that with a straight face.

I tried to pry out some more information about his needs, but the father kept insisting his son would study computer science, and nothing less. I gave up on trying to pinpoint what he would be specializing in and showed him a number of notebooks that would be suitable. All the ports you could possibly need, a good CPU and enough options to upgrade the memory and storage. We actually had some decent notebooks in our shop.

The father was a self proclaimed computer scientist himself, as he had read all the computer magazines religiously since 1995. He quickly dismissed everything I had said and looked at me with a stern face of disapproval before saying “That notebook cannot be faster than the other one, it has more gigahertz!”. This was not going to be easy. 

I tried to explain that the megahertz of the CPU were only part of the performance of a computer; there were many other factors to consider. He looked at his son and asked him if he knew about this. Still uncomfortable with the entire situation the son silently said that yes, I was right.

The father did not care to apologize for his stupidity and quickly changed the subject to one of the other notebooks - a rather old off-brand notebook. This computer was from 2005 and nothing special. It was too late; he was in love with it. It was perfect, other notebooks be damned. I saw the look in the eyes of his son and tried to persuade the father to buy one of the ThinkPads instead. They have a better build quality and are in the same price range. He was having none of it. We walked to the register with the notebook and a collection of the burning antivirus and firewall software that had been rated the best by his computer magazines.

At the register, the father finally noticed that his son had been looking at me all the time. He went silent for a few moments and probably arranged our wedding in his head. His demeanor changed. He now wanted to buy me too, for his son.

“You and my son seem to have a lot in common, with computers and things,” he said in a rather over friendly tone. I said, “We probably do. Your total will come to $499; how would you like to pay?” He ignored my question. “Do you play any computer games? He plays them constantly.” I looked at him and said “I share a Gamecube with my sister, how do you want to pay?”. He ignored my question again and kept asking questions. Finally he asked how much he should add to the $499 to have me go on a date with his son. His son hid his face in shame, he wanted to leave. “Can you stop asking these questions and just pay your total?” I asked. Not taking half measures I added “I have a boyfriend anyway”. He refused to believe me and now got a little aggressive, demanding a photo of this boyfriend of mine before he was going to pay. I was never going to get rid of him. I had become more assertive by now, standing my ground and about to cancel the transaction. 

Suddenly Richard and Frank got out of the back and walked up to me, putting their hands around me and kissing me on the cheek. Richard from the left, Frank on the right. They looked at the father and son and said in unison “We are her boyfriends, is there anything we can do for you?”. The father was shocked by this love triangle. He quickly grabbed his son and walked out. Richard and Frank had been listening in the back from the beginning and had seen their opportunity. I was happy they did, though I felt like smashing my head into the glass counter afterwards.

I suddenly remembered this as being a great example of the crap I saw come through my door that had been BUTCHERED by Nerd Patrol.

So a gentleman enters my store with a computer problem. Specifically, his laptop won't come on. Hitting the power button causes the fans to spin up, but nothing appears on the screen. However, the screen comes ON. After it runs for about 30 seconds, it shuts itself down.

I'm flummoxed. If it were memory, there would be some kind of error code on the front panel. If it were the processor the LCD wouldn't even power on. It could have been the video, but that doesn't explain the restarting. Maybe it's the video AND a heating issue? I tell him as much, and offer to hold it for our standard diag cost.

I take it into the back, hit the power button, and to my amazement, the machine comes to life! It posts and then goes into windows!

What... what the hell? So I fiddle around with it for a bit, and decide to give it a restart. Now it's dead again.

Cycle the power a couple of times, but it just keeps repeating the symptoms it came in with. Suddenly, I notice something. The front bezel (the section of plastic above the keyboard that has all the touch sensitive buttons) is lighting up and blinking like mad. The whole thing. Double weird.

I decide I'll start with some component replacement. I know it isn't the HDD, because the system isn't even booting. On an off chance, I pull off one of the back covers and see a single SODIMM. This means the other one is under the keyboard. Oy. So I yank that SODIMM, power, nothing new. Replace that one and start working my way towards the other memory bank. Since I had to disassemble half the laptop to get to that one, I decided to look for any scorching that might indicate a short or heat damage.

It was by sheer dumb luck that I saw [this](http://i.imgur.com/Clv6RkK.jpg).

Now, the picture is blurry, but if you look closely you'll recognize it as one of the cables that connect external laptop components to the system board. you'll also notice that it's pins have been ABSOLUTELY MAULED TO HELL. I have never, ever, in all my years of working with computers, seen one of those connections get damaged like that before or since. This particular cable goes to the top bezel.

Pow. I yank the cable from it's other end, replace the bezel, and the machine hums to life. I turn it off, replace the cables, machine wont start. Yank em again, machine comes to life again! I send it through a series of reboots (restarts, power downs, battery out, battery in, AC out, AC in, etc etc) just to make sure. POSTS and logs into windows every time.

I call the customer. Actually, first I sent the picture to my manager and some other techs I know asking ""Have you ever seen anything like this!?"" Of course none of them had.

THEN I called the customer.

PM: ""Hello Sir, I have some great news! I managed to fix your computer!""

Cust: ""Oh, that's great! What was wrong with it?""

PM: ""Well sir, I found a cable that connects the touch buttons above your keyboard to the main circuit board of your computer. Somehow, the pins on the cable had been completely mangled, and we found scorching on them to indicate that they were in fact shorting out. I've honestly never seen this kind of damage before, I didn't even know it was possible. Have you recently taken this computer somewhere else for service?""

Cust: ""Actually yes! I took it to Nerd Patrol a little while back to have them replace the keyboard.""

PM: ""And you didn't try to get into it to replace the keyboard yourself?""

Cust: ""No, I don't know jack about those things, and this laptop was expensive."" (This sentence might be in the running for the smartest thing I have ever heard leave a customers mouth)

PM: ""You are a very wise man.""

The customer comes to pick it up, and I show him that cable and explain how it could have happened. Since the bezel was easy to remove, I showed him the connection and everything. I didn't charge him for the work, since it was technically fixed during the diagnostic. I suggested that the next time he need work done, he bring it to us first.

And that is why I will never suggest Nerd Patrol to anyone ever again.",,False,,t5_2sfg5,1370187204.0,,tftsflair,True,t3_1fhlzc,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1fhlzc/the_worst_computer_from_nerd_patrol/,

Me:  I know that.  That isn't the issue.  What can I do about the problem I am actually calling about.  Do I need a new motherboard?  Can I get a replacement jack?

Tech:  I can't help you unless you boot into windows and we check a few things.

Me:  Please listen to me.  I cannot boot into Windows.  There is no power coming from the wall into the wire into the jack onto the motherboard.  Period.  Do you understand?

Tech:  Well I can't help you with that.  We do however, have a sale for xxxx that we can give you for 599.99.

Me:  This conversation is over.

Tech:  Thank you for your call.  Please tell me on a scale of 1 to 10 how was this experience.

Me:  A very generous 1.

Tech:  Why would you say that.  I solved your problem.

Me:  Really?  I am sitting here frustrated with a broken laptop, how would I be satisfied with that.

Tech:  I gave you an option that will solve your problem.  Your experience is a success.

You know the one.  Poses as a fake AV scanner, hijacks your system and demands you pay $$$ to get rid of the viruses on your system.

Well after having cleaned off the upteenth system I sent around an email to the company describing the issue and alerting people what to do should they find their system infected.  I included a pretty laymans term explanation and even screen shots.  I added (which included red font, bold, and like 30pt) the words, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU PAY THE $$ ASKED BY THE PROGRAM.  CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY SO THAT I CAN REMOVE THE VIRUS AND RESTORE YOUR SYSTEM TO WORKING ORDER.

So I send this out and people thank me.  About 2 hours later, I get a call from one of the older folks in the company saying, hey I saw your email and my system was hijacked.  I said, no problem, bring it on by.  He tells me then that he decided to pay the ransom thinking it would fix the issue.  I said oh dear lord no, didn't you read the part of my email where I said to not do that?? He says yeah but...

I'm like, oh boy.  So I tell him to bring the system on by and I start delousing it. Meanwhile he's asking me if it was a bad idea to pay the ransom.  I tried to explain to him not only did they now have whatever he agreed to pay, but also his credit card info.  Thanks to him not listening to my email, I had to instruct him on calling his CC company to put a watch on it, and reverse the charge if they could.

Last I knew it turned into a CC nightmare for him.  At least his laptop was cleaned after.

Until our recent VOIP conversion, this included analog phone systems.  Also, some of the buildings I work in are old.  Very old.

Here's some history of the building I had to visit.  When this building was first turned into a bank, 25-pair cables were run to each office and teller station.  They provided a connections for the terminals (yes, terminals) and phones in each office.  Eventually, they upgraded to BNC network connections for the PCs, which required running coax for each terminal.  The continued to use the 25-pair cables for the phones. After that, they ran CAT-5 for the PCs, still using the 25-pair connections for the phones.  Some time in the early 00s, they remodeled the place completely.  New CAT-5 was run for the PC and the phone for each office and teller station.  The termination points on the 25-pair cables and BNC cabling were cut off and stuffed into the wall, then the boxes were covered with blank plates.

What they never did during all of this, was pull the old cables out of the walls. The 25-pair, BNC, and old CAT-5 were all still there, in a huge rat's nest in the corner of the comm. room.  The new cables were terminated very neatly on a rack right above this, with all the new runs tightly bound together and disappearing into the ball of unused insulated copper below it.

One day, I got a call to check out a phone.  No dial tone, no power, all the others in the branch are working.  I grabbed a spare phone, my phone tools, and a couple cables, then went out to see them.  I arrived and verified what the user was saying.  Yep, dead phone.  I replaced the cable going from the phone to the wall.  Nope, still dead.  I replaced the phone.  Nope, still dead.  I replaced the cable going from the phone system to the patch panel.  Nothing.

Now things get to be a pain.  I re-terminated the phone jack in the office, but that didn't help.  My last thing to try was re-terminating at the patch panel.  I didn't have a jack that fit the panel, so I got a biscuit jack so I could just pull the wire off the panel, re-terminate with a new box, and attach the box to the side of the rack.

In order to move the wire that far, I had to pull it out of the wrapped bundle.  I started undoing the velcro strapping, pulling the wire out, then replacing the strapping on the remaining bundle.  Finally, I got down to the last strap, stuck right in the middle of the rat's nest.

At this point, I discovered it was a literal rat's nest.  I reached my hand down and heard rustling and squeaking and saw a large rat poke its head out at me, then start climbing the cable bundle, using the velcro strapping like rungs on a ladder.

I screamed like a little girl and jumped back, and knocked my toolbox off the table, scattering tools and connectors everywhere.  The tellers heard this and one of them came running, thinking I must have hurt myself.  They sew me, backing out of the room, a mess of IT debris, and a rat, perched on the rack.  After a few seconds of staring, it scampered down the cable bundle and disappeared into the same hole in the wall as all the cables.

After a visit from an exterminator and an electrician, they figured out the rat had chewed through tons of cables, mostly hitting dead ones, until it finally bit through a live one, causing the phone to die.  Thankfully, the manager was able to convince the electrician running the replacement cable to pull out all of the old ones that weren't being used, hopefully preventing future rodent visitations.

""Someone snapped the fiber trunk""",650,109,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/14ocm3/another_testament_to_the_joys_of_being_on_call/,"Here's one from a few years ago I think you'll all enjoy.

Some time ago, I worked for a casino/hotel as a sysadmin. I loved my job and the people I worked with, but it got crazy from time to time due to SLA's and uptime necessities. 

6 months prior to the incident, I had become a brand new father and as such, spent the last 6 months doing nothing but working, keeping house, changing diapers, and trying to get sleep where possible. Having a super-colicy baby is no cake walk and both my wife and I were beyond tired and stressed all the time. 

I was off the on-call rotation this particular week, and my wife and I decided to try to squeeze a date in, since it had been at least half a year since we had spent time with just each other. We had decided to see a movie and grab dinner, made plans, and dropped our 6mo daughter off with my parents across town for the first time ever.

About halfway through the movie, my on-call phone started blowing up. We were required to carry our phones 24/7 in the event we were needed for any reason, even off-hours, though we never got on-call calls when off the schedule. If I'm getting a call now... something serious is going down. My co-worker was the first to call. I ignored it and continued with the movie. My manager rang my phone moments later, and again, I ignored it being off schedule on my first date in who-knows-how-long. Another minute passes and my director rings me. This one I can't ignore, something must be seriously messed up for him to step in at this point. I take the call outside the theater door.

""You need to get down here asap. I know you're off rotation, but this can't wait. One of the construction workers was running an excavator trenching for some new plumbing install and snapped our fiber trunk from the NOC to the hotel and casino. They're completely dark right now, hotel and guest services and the casino floor are down. We need to get them back online ASAP! How soon can you be here?""

I told my wife what had happened and she reluctantly agreed we'd have to reschedule. I was usually the day-saver there, having the skills to create a workaround for something like this on the fly.

I rush to work while formulating a plan in my head. I had facilities on the phone gathering some extension cords for me. I had my co-worker on the phone next, to find me several 150+ foot runs of cat5e and a switch. Then security, to get entrances and exits set up for immediate access.

When I got there, I quickly assessed the damage and went to work. I had facilities help me pull power out to the middle of the parking lot, where we dropped a 5-port gig dumbswitch. Out of each side we ran a line back to the core in our NOC, and a IDF panel in the back of the casino. After a few minutes of cross-parking-lot cable stringing, plug and play, and finger crossing, we were able to establish a link between the remote IDF and the core in our NOC. Slowly but surely, remote network gear came back online and we had to reconfigure the systems to work over the new link. At a blazing single 10/100, we were back in business. Temporarily. No comparison for 3 pair of fiber strands, but it let us take care of our customers. Time to deploy when on site: 20 minutes.

We had an emergency repair service come in and help us patch up what was left of the mangled fiber. The runs were pulled so hard, it unsheathed the glass from the casing and pulled the conductor out of the cable looms and almost all the way to the wall conduit leading out underground. It was a fugly mess.

We were able to patch in a few unused links from another run, and temporarily repair one or two of the dead runs for some temp service. We needed a few days to figure out replacing the damaged runs. The repairs tested working, and seemed to carry signal just fine, so we had a bit of time to get some new runs set up over the next two weeks.

After re-establishing the temp fiber links, we decom'd the temp cat5e run, reconfigured, and brought everything back up. Everything came back up FF, and we were ""restored"". My total time on property was about from 5:30pm to about 12:30am to address the issue. Total downtime was about 45-50 minutes, iirc.

Being on-call sucks... but it does sometimes feel pretty rewarding when you're the hero that pulls the business back out of the oblivion of a downtime black hole. I don't even remember what movie it was, either.

I'm an older college student and she is a manager at a quick service restaurant.  I work tech support for the school part time while taking classes.  I know how hard it is to be a student, so I give a STEEP discount for my services when other students need help.

Yesterday, a guy gives me a call.  He asks me, ""Can you do anything for me if I've been hacked?"" My first thought was ""Hacked...right. Everyone thinks they've been hacked.""  So I ask him, ""What is your computer doing?""  He responds, ""Well, this window keeps popping up from the FBI saying I need to pay them $200 or they are going to arrest me.""

Ah yes. FBI Moneypak.  I've actually been reading up on this one the past week just in case I encountered it in the wild. My body was ready.

I told the guy, ""You haven't been hacked, but you do have a pretty serious virus. I can take care of it for you.  My rate is $20.""  He brings me his laptop, leaves for his class, and I go to work.  This variant was one of the easy ones, just a startup menu item, an .exe file in appdata/roming, an .exe file in a temp directory and surprisingly NO changes to the registry.  I manually cleaned up what I could and used Malwarebytes to take care of the rest.  

The next day I give him back his computer, teach him how to tweak his startup a little using msconfig, and explain safe surfing practices along with some trusted free antivirus solutions.  He had been using Norton when he got this one and was unhappy with it.  This is an older guy. I think he's working on a Doctorate.  He asks me, ""How much for the work?""  I respond, ""20 bucks is my student rate.""  The guy puts some folded bills into my palm and says, ""The rest will help when someone else has a hard time paying you"" then he smiles at me and walks away.

I opened up the bills in my hand and see $120.  

What a great guy.

 I ask her name and reason for the call, and she quickly exclaims how worried she is that all of her information has been compromised.  Seeing as how usually most errors I see on a daily basis are user error, I ask her how she knows this.  She replies:

""I called Geek Squad and a guy came out to my house to fix my computer.  Well he stole all of my information, and then proceeded to set my WiFi password to 'murder.'  He did this right before exited my house and killed my dog.""

At this point, I was stunned.  I've had crazy stories and drunks, but nothing like this.  ""Ma'am, I would suggest you call your local law enforcement and get in contact with Geek Squad with the name of the associate who came to your location.""

""I already called Geek Squad!  They said they didn't have anyone by that name even employed there.""

At this point, I could do nothing but refer her to law enforcement.  I saved the case number, forwarded it to my manager, who proceeded to crack up down the aisle as he listened to it.

He started last week, and he's about as technically inclined as a potted plant. Every day it's been something different. The first day, he couldn't get into his machine because the starting password we gave him contained the ""@"" symbol. So he was trying to log in using his e-mail address as the password. This was day one. He also got lost in the (about 85-90 people, single story) building trying to show me back to his desk. 

Our network will lock users out if there are too many failed login attempts. So at one point earlier this week, he came back to tell us he was locked out of his system for trying passwords too many times. We log into the Novell console, see that this is not the case, so I head to his cubicle to go take a look. He was ""locked out"" of a third party CRM application that will not lock you out, no matter how many times you fuck up the password. I still have no idea what the hell he was talking about.

Today, however, he really got me. He brought back a calculator (you may know it as an adding machine) and asked us how to turn down the volume. My supervisor and I looked at each other, equally confused, for a second and I finally picked it up. I looked at the top. The bottom. The back, the front, the sides. 

Me: ""I'm...not seeing a speaker anywhere.""  
He: ""No, I mean the uh...sound it makes when I push the buttons.""

My supervisor and I share another confused look.

He: ""Like the plus or minus buttons.""

Having a degree in accounting, I'm somewhat familiar with adding machines.

Until something that happened a few months ago that finally came full circle.  I think I may have finally found my white whale.  Prepare for a wall of text (sorry).

Toward the beginning of this year we moved into a brand new building.  It is a wonder of modern technology that literally everything can be controlled via one of our central networking rooms.  One room for building management (HVAC, lights, elevators, the works) and one for networking and IT.  I was one of the few people that got to spend a lot of the time in the building during the construction phase so I know where just about everything is.  Generally I tend to be more a database and networking guy but I love to get my hands dirty and will play with about anything people will let me so my current job has expended to handling most of the minor problems we experience when moving into a new building (read as “shit breaks”).  And thusly I have been requesting a raise due to all the added job duties I’ve been performing which management had been abruptly ignoring.

So fast forward to about mid May as temperatures start to get over 100*F (38*C).  I come into the office at about 8:00, about 30min before the normal crowd gets in so I can have my morning in peace just for a bit.  I’ve checked the network and nothing seems out of place and picked out my general task for the day then head over to the kitchenette to make some instant oatmeal.  I hang out in the kitchen for about 20min talking to one of the mail guys who was passing though and start to head back to my desk (it is about 8:35 at this point).  As I’m about 20 steps from my desk I can hear the phone ring and it cuts out just before I get there.  I got to sit down and see who was calling when I notice my email has a lot of unread messages and my desk phone has 6 missed calls. This is the point I feel a disturbance in the force.  Well not really the force but my cell phone goes off and I do not recognize the number (no one really calls my cell).  I answer my cell with my general level of morning enthusiasm only to find out that it is the secretary of the head of the company, there were no greetings or pleasantries from her only the opening statement “We have a problem!  It is currently 89*F (32C) in this office and no one is doing anything about it.”  I flounder for a minute as I’m not sure why someone is called me about the HVAC system when I notice all my emails have a headline along the lines of A/C not working followed by names of the Executives (or their assistants).  Before I can get out that this is more of a Facilities issue not an IT one I get told “Neither of the HVAC guys are answering and you’re the only person the guy at the help desk could think of who would know how to fix this.”  I ask her to hold just a sec while I try to scrape together some sort of answer, eventually settling on “There is nothing I can do from my desk here so I’ll walk over to the facilities room and see what is going on then give you a call back.”  She hangs up and I start checking though all the emails that have piled up when I notice all of these people have similar office numbers, then it hits me the A/C handler for their part of the building (which mostly consist of the higher-ups) has completely stopped working.  

As I get over to the facilities room I hear the ominous beeping coming from one of the terminals.  When I turn the monitor on the first thing I see is the red warning text saying; “Air handler #X FAILED, fault 26”.  I go looking for a phone to call back the secretary to tell here their A/C is fucked when I notice a white board with 2 of the facilities guys name on it say they would be on vacation this week and for the other guy to have fun (there are 3 people that normally work this room).  I call the secretary back to inform her that the entire AC system for their part of the building has failed and 2 of the 3 guys that work on that system are on vacation and the 3rd is MIA, to which she is pissed because apparently it has gone up 2* since I last talked to her (who would guess 10ft glass windows with no way to block the light would cause a room to heat up like an oven if it didn’t have a dedicated AC system).  I inform her the best I can do is try to get a factory tech on the phone and see if they can get a repair guy out to us sometime today.  “That is unacceptable how can we be expected to work in this heat, is there anything else you can do?”  Not wanting to say no, because then my day would just get worse since I was already in the email chain I would be dealing with it either way at my desk I say, “I can go check the physical unit while I try to call the factory guys maybe they can tell me what fault 26 is and if it is simple I can fix it, or maybe they can tell me how to reroute some of the cooling from another part of the building to you guys.”  It is at the point that I find out I was on speaker phone with her and the President was listening to what was being done when he speaks up thanking me for working on this for them.  They hang up and I find the number for the manufacture prominently displayed on the screen of the computer with the error message and call them only to find out they are in a different time zone and do not open for 2 more hours.  It is at the point I realize this day is going to be my own personal hell.  I say fuck it and start walking up to the maintenance area because being anywhere someone else can contact me is out of the question at this point.  

When I get to the air handler room everything is dead quit and actually kind of peaceful.  I stand in the middle of the room staring at this huge machine that I’ve ever only seen once during construction when I was helping hook it up the network for the facilities guys.  As I’m walking around it I notice a piece 1” conduit lying in the middle of the floor completely out of place.  I kick it up against the wall and look at the side of the machine where it was laying when I notice a white box about the size of a small computer tower with a small  screen on it that says “Fault 26: Power interrupted” with 2 options ‘restart’ and ‘view error log’.  It also has a nice scratch down the front of it that goes right over a few of the other buttons.  That is when it hits me, the 1” conduit was something some dummy leaned against the wall and it fell over hitting this box causing it to freak out and turn the power off.  I press the button beside restart and after a short loading time the AC unit roars back to life.  As I’m walking back down to my area I decide to pass though the Executive offices just to make sure the cool air is making its way down to them.  As I’m wondering around the halls staring up at the ceiling with my hand raised to feeling for any airflow the voice from the phone stops me to ask what I am doing.   I inform her I was the IT guy she talked to about the AC issues and I was just coming though to see if they were getting cold air.  As we are standing in the hallway the first signs of cool air start to come out of the vent we are standing under.  Her mouth drops open as she realizes the AC is back on hugs me while thanking me for performing some kind of computer magic and runs back to her office.  I decide to take the long route back to my desk where I sit down and delete about 40+ emails all complaining about the AC and go about the rest of my day.  This all managed to occur before 10:00AM

2 months go by and no other major issues have popped up.  I managed to track down the missing tech that was working the facilities room alone that day only to find out he had been in the hospital with food poisoning.  We had a good laugh over the story and he bought me a bottle of Jack as payment for my troubles.  Mid July comes around which means the mid year awards ceremony, which generally means a way for the sells guys and management to pat themselves on the back for all the hard work they do.  All the tech guys and I are hanging out in the back making the usually crude jokes just waiting for the free food and drinks at the end when the President takes the stage and says he has one more special award he would like to present followed by a 2 minute speech about all the hard work this individual does that goes unnoticed.  All of the tech guys are kind of laugh and I hear the comment “Wonder which boob is getting this award.”  Then the president says, “Will Ormuzd please come up here.”  Dead fucking silence, few people outside of the techs know who I am and all of them are too slack jawed to say anything.  I make my way up toward the stage while he tells an abbreviated and kind of exaggerated story of how I had gone above and beyond to fix the AC for their offices.  I accept the award and shake hands when he informs me this award comes with a bonus and the raise I had been asking for plus some.  I just stand there kind of stunned when from all the way in the back my fellow tech guys burst into applause.

TL;DR: Reset a computer and justified my existence to management.  Got paid.

Apparently, the night before, she had a party in her dorm room.  Some drunken idiot had spilled a FULL glass of beer into her brand new laptop that her dad had JUST bought her.

In her haste to try to fix it, she had attempted to take a hair dryer to it on high.  She had melted the keyboard.  In addition, while drukenly trying to fix it, she had dropped it and cracked the screen.

The laptop was filled with beer, melted, and had a broken screen.  

""My dad's gonna be here in three hours!  You have to fix it!  Dad's gonna kill me!""

Needless to say, there was NO way we could fix it in three hours.  At the very MINIMUM we would have needed a few days to order the parts.

She bawled when we told here there was absolutely no way we could do it in time.

She ended up buying another of the exact same model from the Circuit City down the road, and passing it off as the one her dad had bought.

My heart skipped a beat.

Joe was the top trader for our company's highest revenue trading desk. It was Monday morning shortly after market open following a weekend of major developments in his sector. A few minutes downtime could cost his business tens of thousands of dollars and I was the only first-line support guy in the office.

The prior emergency I was rushing to attend melted into insignificance. I doubled back for the stock room and with a new keyboard under my arm I sprinted the length of the maintenance corridor to burst onto the middle of the trading floor opposite Joe's desk.

Joe had a Bloomberg keyboard and as anyone who has seen one will testify, they are sturdy, dependable devices that rarely fail. More often than not it's a loose cable or a software problem so that was my train of thought as I skidded to a halt.

""The bloody keyboard is bloody knackered"" said Joe in his thick cockney London accent. ""I'm losing money 'ere, see if you can fix it pronto.""

A quick visual inspection revealed nothing obvious. In fact Joe's desk was a conspicuously tidy example of sanitation compared to his fellow traders, whose filthy input devices almost certainly contravened the Geneva convention ban on biological weapon stockpiling.

Typing on his pristine keyboard produced nothing but the mouse was working fine. I ducked under the desk to check cables but everything was plugged in properly. With no time to troubleshoot the new keyboard was swiftly unboxed and cabled up through the desk conduits to his workstation below. A quick switch of the connectors and a working Caps Lock light confirmed it was alive.

""So, what happened?"" I asked Joe. ""No idea son, it just stopped working"" he replied. ""Oh well, these things happen"" I reassured him. ""I'll take the old one away.""

And with that I picked up his old keyboard and tilted it into the box, only to have a torrent of lukewarm coffee piss out over the desk, new keyboard and my freshly dry-cleaned shirt and trousers.

I was coming in to work one day and was told that I had been awarded employee of the month.  I got some cool things out of it and was given a special parking spot for the month that I didn't use once since it was farther away from my normal entrance and desk than where I normally go, but I digress...

I was working T2 support and we were required to take T2 calls, answer chats, answer emails and take T1 calls.  I worked the night shift and it was always much busier at night than during the day.  We are also not allowed to go busy (not take calls) to make outgoing calls or to do any of the other responsibilities.  We can also only call by 9PM at the latest and I started at 3 or 4PM (time is kinda foggy).

We would have non stop incoming calls and 20 minute - 2 hour waiting times until about 10PM depending on how bad our admins screwed things up.  You can see where making call backs would be a little difficult at times.  Mornings however, rarely had to take calls because they had more staff, fewer calls and were allowed to go busy...

As soon as I was handed my award another manager (Team Lead) came up to me and said:

**TL**: ""You're lucky you just got employee of the month, otherwise I would have written you up for not making enough call backs this month

I know that only my TL can write me up and he can't.  He also liked to try and bully people into fearing him.

ME: No please write me up.

**TL**: No, you made employee of the month, you get to slide

ME: No, really I want you to write me up.  The fact that I made employee of the month should only add to the fact that that I get written up.  Make an example of me.  

**TL**: Go sit down

ME: No, not until you write me up.  I want you to.

**TL**: I'm not going to

My first time post, sorry for my bad English.

I work in Finland at the IT-company that provides other companies with the IT-solutions. We also take care of companies workstations.
One of our customer is our own city and we renew every workstation that this city has like fire departments, schools etc.

One day we took  about 30 workstations with new monitors to a cityhall. After switching most of the computer we notice that one workstation have a 15"" LCD monitor that was probably made in 90s. The monitor also had two ""blackscreens"" on it.

After few moments of wondering the owner of the workstation comes in and says ""no, no, no don't change my monitor"". We said that we have to change every monitor. The lady reply's that ""This new monitors give me headache, because of the electricity that comes from the monitor"".

We try to explain her that this are new LED-monitors, they are bigger which will help you with your work and the light can be dimmet.

She said that she will test that monitor on her co-workers workstation. She went for the testing and after 15 seconds she said ""no I cannot work on this monitor, it gives me headache"".

After that we reply that we will leave you with the old monitor, but we would need to get adapter for the new computer (old monitor --&gt; new computer... no input)

I ask her that do you own a TV to which she reply that yes. I ask her what kind of TV you have. She said its big and flat. I ask her and do you get headache from watching the TV to which she said ""no, but thats because TV's do not have computer inside of them"".

My boss at the time had previously been the head of the IT department, but had several years earlier become the project manager of our entire support contract (we provided several services, including IT, training, financial analysis, etc), so he was no longer working IT on a day-to-day basis, and as time went by, any knowledge he had retained become less and less relevant.  This, however, did not stop him from completely micro-managing our IT department on a daily basis (which really wasn't his job anymore), often making our lives miserable.  He would even often ""break"" things, just to keep us on our toes, testing us to make sure we responded correctly to the problems he'd intentionally create; usually these would be minor annoyances like stopping a print spooler, but obviously it wasn't the best way to manage.

He was also extremely head strong and would never admit when he was wrong, even though he had little experience actually working with any of the current systems we had.  One day, he's in our office poking his nose around and notices that the free disk space on our Exchange server is getting a *bit* low.  For what it's worth, it had been the way for quite some time, and given it's operational state, definitely wasn't anywhere near a critical state, plus we were in the process of setting up a new Exchange 2003 server that we would migrating everyone to in the very near future.

Well, he about flips out when he sees this, and rushes over to his office, apparently Googles something, then comes back on starts tinkering on the Exchange server again (I don't remember why, but at the time we could only console to our servers from a dedicated workstation in the IT lab).  Then, I notice my Outlook client suddenly says ""offline, attempting to reconnect...[etc]"", and here's our ensuing conversation:

**me**: Um...what exactly are you doing over there?!?

**boss**:  I'm defrag-ing the mailbox store to free up space

(Keep in mind this is a production system and it's middle of the work day)

**me**:  What?!? You should take the database offline first to do that, and it doesn't even *need* to be done!!!

Obviously he was trying to use Eseutil to shrink the database, but whatever it was that he did, shrunk our priv.edb file from 60GB to about 6GB, and no clients could connect to Exchange.  As you can expect, the phone calls start rolling in at an exponential rate.

It became obvious we were going to have to restore from a tape backup, however the last good backup we had was from about 3 days prior.  Luckily, all of our supported users (about 100 total) were using Outlook in cache mode, so we had to go to each user's workstation and make a backup of their cache so they could restore all their recent email messages.  My other colleague and I ended up working through the night getting the Exchange server back online and everyone's mailbox restored, and all my boss could say to us was, ""see, this is what happens when you don't monitor your servers for free disk space"".

This is, sadly, only one of many stories I have about this now ex-boss...I'll try to share some more in the future.

My days as the vengeful wench of the east had passed and I was back to working in the store. It had been two months of nothing and by now it was already November. My trip to Sweden with 3 of my friends was only memories, photos and junky souvenirs. I was bored — really bored.
 
While I was mindlessly browsing on the internet behind the counter, a customer came in. He was only the 5th one that night. Only 2 hours to go until closing.
 
The customer was dressed in a blue-black business suit that was 3 sizes too big for him. It was actually quite the accomplishment as he would easily hit 400lbs (180kg) on the scale. He wore unmatching light brown shoes underneath the suit. He missed the necktie and an overall sense of how a suit should be worn. Girls do take notice of your clothes.
 
He stood in the store with a sense of authority. I wanted to walk up to him, but he quickly put his hand in the air and, as if proclaiming the word of God, shouted “I AM JUST BROWSING!” No help? Fine by me. He started looking at the notebooks on display one by one and was shaking his head at each of them, mumbling underneath his breath.
 
He turned his attention to me and again with a raised voice said “WHY DON’T YOU HAVE ANY MODERN COMPUTERS?” I don’t know what he expected to find when he walked into his store; we are clearly in the business of selling refurbished and last-years models.
 
Staying behind the counter, I looked at him and said “Sir, you can lower your voice? I can hear you perfectly fine from here.” I paused slightly and continued: “we mostly sell refurbished notebooks, but we have a few new Sony VAIO models in the back that have not been put on display yet. Do you want to see them?”
 
The VAIO notebooks were the newest models available in Europe. Why and how we had them, I don’t know. I went to the back to get one out and show it to him. I got back just as he started furiously pacing around, angry that I had taken so long. I was away for a minute. “Why don’t you have this stuff on display!? You are making a customer wait! My time is worth a lot of money! This is not how a business should work!"" 
 
I decided to ignore this comments as he wasn’t attacking me personally. I unpacked the VAIO and showed him the specifications. This notebook had the best configuration of all the notebooks in the store, but it wasn’t good enough for him. “I need a better GPY,” — that is not a typo — “I need to do important business work on this computer!”
 
“You mean a GPU,” I said. “That’s what I said,” he replied immediately with irritation in his voice. I decided to ignore his comment again. “Why don’t you tell me what you need the computer for and maybe we can find something that suits your needs,” I replied in a last ditch effort to get this man to stop complaining and actually work towards finding a fitting computer.
 
“It’s probably too complicated for you, but fine, if you want to know,” he replied. It was around now that I started becoming agitated and started to lose my cool. “I handle import, export and distribution for many big companies in Germany. My company is worth millions. Do you understand this?” 

“Yes, I do know what all those words mean when put into a sentence, but I need to know what you want to use the computer for.”

“I need to keep important spreadsheets and contracts, invoices and letters and copies of shipment papers and use websites for tracking.” He just needed an ordinary notebook, with maybe a bigger hard drive for storing his library of 20kb word files.
 
I told him I felt that this computer would meet his requirements with a wide margin and asked him where he felt it did not. He replied that it doesn’t matter, “You are not helping me! I want someone who knows what he is talking about, not some GIRL.” He had played the gender card; I raised him a Don.
 
With Don coming in his demeanour changed. Maybe it was because Don was even heavier and bigger and it impressed him. With Don taking over and repeating exactly what I had said, the notebook was suddenly fine. He wanted to buy it now. The “GPY” was also good enough. Don’s work was done here. A sandwich was waiting in his office. I had to finalise the sale.
 
When we got at the counter the big important businessman wanted to know about our premium services. While I still think that Ron and Don were intimately familiar with the offerings of premium services, we never used that terminology. We only sold some shoddy extended warranty and Chinese knock-off USB-gadgets with our notebooks.
 
As such, I told him he could purchase 1 year extended warranty that covers some of the hardware defects that the notebooks are prone for. It must have been at the register that he finally started to register my face, as his next comment was sudden and unexpected from a man that just minutes ago called me “some GIRL.”
 
“I was hoping you’d be a premium service,” he said to me. 

I had been working at the store now for over a year now and had built up a tough skin. I wasn’t the shy, easily flustered girl anymore; I was the one that knocks. I answered him with an air of arrogance,  “that would be quite a few levels higher than premium.” I paused slightly, “How’d you like to pay for your notebook?” What I hadn’t realised with my new found savviness was that I was talking to the important business Gorilla that was worth millions. I just gave him an opening to keep trying.
 
He was quick to react and started talking again about his multi-million company and how he would dominate the export and import for the whole of Europe in just a few years. That I could be there with him was the underlying tone of his story. 
 
I quickly cut him off, pointing out that I was not interested in any way, that I was only 17, and that my comment was a bad attempt at a joke. He did not lie about his persistence. It was very much there. After a few more misplaced comments from him about me I had had enough.
 
“Please stop with this. I don’t believe you are worth millions and honestly no money in the world would make whatever you are fantasizing happen.” His grin changed into a frown. “Stupid girl, you just don’t recognise a true man when you see one”.
 
He ticked me off. I was done being polite.

I started yelling at him, “Do you know why I think you are not a true man? For one, you are in a second hand computer repair shop. If you were worth millions you would be in a different store. Two; your designer suit isn’t a designer suit. It’s a cheap black market knockoff from Hugo Boss. The fabric is wrong, the stitching are wrong, the buttons are wrong.” He was getting angry. “Besides, it’s 3 sizes too big; it’s not even tailored”. 

He slammed his fist on the glass counter and pulled up his sleeve, showing a Rolex watch. “Does this look fake to you!? It’s a 50,000 dollar watch.” I replied to him simply, “I cannot believe that. If your suit is fake, why would your watch be real?”
 
While I might sound cool now, I sounded more and more like one of those awkward girl on those scripted reality shows from MTV. Those that explode in rage and fail miserably in delivering the message.
 
By now Don had walked into the store again to hear what the commotion was all about. He saw me and the 400 lb Gorilla shouting at each other. He started calling me all kinds of names; I kept on repeating calling him a fake.
 
Then out of nowhere, and in front of Don, he hit me in the face. I don’t know if he hit me because he felt cornered being called out for being a fake, or the fact that a seventeen year old kid was insulting him. 

Don dropped what he had in his hands and walked up to the supposed multimillion dollar Gorilla, pushing him towards the door. Don shouted at top of his lungs to “LEAVE AND NEVER COME BACK.” He gave another push. The Gorilla became aggressive and hit Don in the face. Don reacted with a headbutt. The Gorilla took Don with him in his fall, knocking over the tables and promotional material. Two fat men were now wresting and rolling around on the floor. I did the only thing I could do: I called 911.
 
It took well over a couple minutes before any police arrived and pulled them apart. I was scared of what would have happened if Don had lost the fight. They had been all over the store by now, finally ending in the back, the Gorilla with his back on the floor. The store was a mess. They were both bleeding. Blood smears were on the walls next to the back door.

When the police came they arrested both Don and the Gorilla. They took a statement from me, helped me close the shop and brought me home. Don called me later that night, apologising for what happened and asking if I was ok. He gave me the next two shifts off; Frank and Richard would clean up. 

Don seemed to still be a decent human being under all those layers of saturated fat. I was happy Don took responsibility and tried to get him out of the store instead of charging him extra for damaging goods.
 
The businessman was charged with assault, but things never went anywhere. He got off with a fine and the same happened for Don. Ron wasn’t too pleased about it all. Jeremy told me that all he seemed to care about was where the cops had been in the store and if they had taken anything. When he learned they had been in the back Ron exploded in anger to Don. 
 
4 days later when I came back to work again, I had been working for over an hour and noticed something strange in the upper corners of the store. We had state-of-the-art cameras covering every square meter. This was Ron’s work. Security cameras in a store should make you feel safe to a certain degree, but for me it just felt eerie knowing that Ron would probably be watching.

One of my main duties is to teach basic computer skills one-on-one to people who sign up (mostly seniors and clueless older adults) Although I'm mainly there to teach people how to use the library's system (weird public interface/outdated software), sometimes people will bring in their cell phone, laptop, or ask me questions about their home setup. I try to be helpful when I can be. 

One of my favorite students was a Norwegian man. He had a heavy accent and was always polite and adorable, smiling and asking questions. Sometimes his wife came along and watched him learn. They would look up pictures of Norway on Google, and liked to ask me what the internet could do. I tried teaching them email, searching, Google maps, Wikipedia, etc.

TLDR: One day funny old Norwegian man comes in looking puzzled and says ""My computer, it von't move. Nothing happen!"" speaking of his home desktop computer. 

I quickly explain that it sounds like his computer is ""frozen,"" and explain to him that the simplest way to fix it is to hold down the power button until it shuts off, wait a minute, and turn it back on again.

""OK! I vill try zat vhen I go home""

On our next appointment a week later he comes into my office area beaming, and puts his hands on my shoulders. Immediately he exclaims in triumph ""I defrosted it!!"" 

It took me a minute to figure out what he was talking about. Of course a frozen computer needs to be defrosted. 

BTW my second love besides computer lessons is teaching ESL which is probably why this story is one of my favorites. I teach ESL as my main job for 20 hours every week.

Edit: Since you guys like hearing about nice old people learning computers, here's a picture of me and a different student who I have had for a few years. [Mr. Trimmer and I](http://imgur.com/pVoTx) He participates in toastmasters club, where he gives speeches, and he is also an artist. He mainly uses the computer to look up information for his speeches, but in November he also comes in to look up pictures he might draw on his yearly hand-drawn christmas cards. He often comes in just to chat and he will bring in pictures of the painted portraits he does of his relatives, friends, or of their pets. One day he asks for a picture of me, and I give it to him and a month later he brought in that painting of me. It must have taken him forever. He's very old but very sweet and calls me ""darling"" I worry that he won't live too much longer, but I'm happy that I will always have that painting he gave me to remember him.

A few weeks ago I get a call from him asking if I know anything about network wiring (I'm by no means an expert, but I know the basics), since step-mum's boss wants dad to completely re-wire an old cottage and he also wants network points all over the place.  I the basics over the phone and suggest that I pop over and take a look as it'll probably be easier to explain on-site.  

So off I drive to this rickety old cottage with a few hastily printed diagrams to show dad.  As I'm explaining the concept of patch panels and switches and how each socket needs it's own run of cable back to the patch the owner arrives.  Introductions are made and we start talking about how many sockets he wants, and where they are all going to patch back to.  He draws out a diagram showing various network sockets in each room, but no termination point.

When I mention patch panels he stops me any says

'I don't need a patch panel, I want all the sockets on the same ring.'

Me: 'Ummmm, you want all the sockets connected to *one run* of Cat6?'

Him: 'Obviously'

Me: 'You want *all the sockets* connected in a *ring*?  That won't work.....'

Him: 'I don't see why I should pay for all that extra cable when your dad can just do it in one go!'

Me: 'But the minute you plug more than two devices in nothing will work!'

Him: 'Stop trying to rip me off, I asked an expert in PC World and he said it should be like a ring-main!'

Me: '................!'

I advised dad to do it the way the owner wanted but get him to sign a disclaimer to that effect.   Dad spent a couple of weeks doing a complete electrical re-wire and adding the owners new 'ring-main' network topology, got his disclaimer signed and walked away a couple of grand better off.

Last night I get a call from dad telling me the owner had just called him.  He'd moved in, plugged his PC, Router, Xbox, IP security cameras, and networked smart meters in and nothing was working.  He wanted dad to go out and fix it.  At no cost.  Apparently he has 'no memory' of my 'you're doing it wrong' conversation or of signing anything to that effect.  Dad emailed him a copy of the note he'd signed, along with a suitably outrageous quote for putting things right.

I work in a mobile phone repair kiosk in Australia and i usually have customers just coming to get their phones done, they don't want to chat much and just get a price book in and leave. I had an old man (OM) come in today with a old nokia phone that was no longer ringing, when he got text messages it rang and in settings it rang just when he got calls it made no sound. It was diagnosed to be a software issue and we decided to factory reset the phone. 

because we were fairly busy and i had to wait to use our POS i started talking to OM, he was asking me about my job and how i got into the tech business, my parents own the company, but i have always been interested in taking apart electronics to see how they work. we talked for a while and he said ""im 87 years old, the most technological thing we had back in my day was the telephone, i think its good that you know so much about this at a young age"" (im 16) he talked about how he only used the phone for texts and calls and he needed help to use his computer. It was just a very pleasent exchange.

We eventually got the phone restored to factory settings and all his contacts transferred back on and it was ringing again, haazaa, i gave him a ring to test and it was all good, i set the phone to maximum volume (he had a hearing aid) and gave him the phone back. he asked how much for the help, and i said it was free because i didnt really do much, and it only took like 10 minutes and was a good change from the usual customers, he called me in close and said something that made my day, he said "" if you have a mum, tell her i think your brilliant"" 


he thanked us massively for the help and went on his way and thats how this one old man made my day :).

If you recall, I was working for a consulting firm based out of Texas in a high travel position.

This week I was returning to South Carolina, where I had spent some time working at a client's location.  I was working on implementing part of a bigger enterprise rollout, and putting it politely, the rollout was fucked.  I was contracted to a different consulting firm to help them on the project.  

My chain of command went: Me, Project Manager, 3rd Party Project Manager, Client Manager.  And, I was the only rep on-site from either consulting firm, so I had to deal with all of the angry complaints from the customer on why this project was two months late.

And, to be honest, they customer deserved to be upset.  They had been promised a lot of things that hadn't been delivered yet.  And, the software I was implementing from my firm - it turns out that this customer was one of the first clients that was using certain functions, and I was finding serious bugs in it.  

I was getting nightly builds of the software from our engineering department to resolve the issues.

Finally, I got a clean run of the software through the sample data set that had been supplied.  It was Thursday evening, and I was set to fly home on Friday.  I had a friend's wedding I was going to on Sat, and for me to make it, I needed to be on the 2pm flight on Friday.

I was thrilled that the data worked, because I didn't want to come back the following week.  So, I emailed the client manager that we had a clean run of the data, and that we could run through their live data tomorrow to see how it went.  

I stayed late working on the system documentation, and had everything ready so that I should be able to leave by noon.

So, Friday morning, the manager was too busy to supply me with the data.  Finally, just before noon, she comes with the 40 000 page data sample which needs to be parsed.

It turns out that the sample data set I had was NOT representative of the live data set....  Information which was in a fixed field in the sample data was free form text in the report.  The data set was seriously inconsistent with the sample data, and to no great surprise, the report was not parsed correctly.

The manager then blows up in my face, starts swearing at me, telling me how I am not allowed to leave until this is fixed, and how the lawyers will be after my company, etc.  

Like I said, I needed to be on a plane by 2pm, and she had waited until noon to supply the data.  There wasn't even time for me to look to see whether this would be an easy fix or not.

I tried telling her that I would be back on Monday, and that this would hopefully be able to be resolved in a day or two.  That just made things worse.  She is screeching at this point.  People are groundhogging out of their cubes to see what is going on.

I interrupt her, inform her that I have to leave now, and that if she has an issue, here's the number for the VP of professional services.  He'll be happy to listen to you.

As I walk out the door, before she has time to reach her phone, I have my cell speed-dialing to the VP.  Luckily, I have been an excellent employee with no complaints from customers in the past.  I explain what happened, and say that I had needed to leave before I blew up at her.  But, that if he needed me to, I could go somewhere to cool off for a bit and go back.

His response was ""Hell no.  You won't be going back there until you get an apology from her.""  I was told to catch my flight, and that they would let me know where I'd be working the next week, but it wouldn't be there.

I spent the next two weeks working at a nice easy gig, until I got a phone call from South Carolina.  The manager was calling to aplogize, and asked if I would consider coming back to work.  Apparently the VP had sent the 2nd string consultants there to 'help' her the previous two weeks....   

I told her that I hadn't ever told my management I didn't want to work there, and that if she would like me to return, she needed to talk to VP, as he was responsible for my schedule.  I then called VP to let him know she had apologized....

I spent the next week in South Carolina, successfully delivered the product to them, and made everyone happy.

But it was a strange situation at the end.  I received a thank-you letter from the client for my hard work at the same time they were suing the consulting company they had hired for the project. 

But nothing bad happened to my company from there....

We SA's rule over our kingdom of 8 reconfigurable lab spaces, with 8 individual networks, as fairly as seems just. Users don't have physical access to the systems, but through KVM's in their labs. As I'm sure most of you know, most KVM's allow only one workstation to have keyboard and mouse control on a system at a time, while multiple stations can view. Keep this is mind. This is important.


We received a call from a particularly stubborn (and arrogant) software developer from one of our labs. We've always known him to have a particularly foul temper, and usually dread having to work with this one.


**SA:** Ops center, this is *[SA]*.

**Derpus:** Get off of *[computer name]*? I need it and you won't give me control.

*He attempts to gain control of the system through our own KVM, but to no avail.*


**SA:** Is there someone else working on-**Derpus:** NO THERE IS NO ONE ELSE. IT'S ONE OF YOU F*CKING AROUND.

*This lab is only 14'x24'...*


**Derpus:** No I'm not doing that *click*


The noble SA then regaled us with the tale of what just transpired on the phone and left, heading to what was surely his doom. After a brief moment of silence, he returned jovial. 


When he'd finally gained control of his laughter, we learned that he walked into the lab, removed a binder from the keyboard *immediately next to* the rapscallion developer, lowered his voice and furrowed his brow, and spoke two simple words...

In my [last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/153lv8/oh_thank_heavens_youre_finally_here/) I told the story of an old lady who forgot how to use a key. This story is the tale of a belligerent patron who felt he had to resort to violence... 

In addition to the background I gave in my previous story; We worked 12 hour shifts, 8am to 8pm, 7 days a fortnight, including weekends. Friday and Saturday were our busiest days.

I had a service call one Saturday for a single terminal venue whose internal barcode scanner had stopped working. I'd attended this venue previously an knew that a replacement was required. The whole process to change it would take around 5 minutes. The operator (who was a nice lady that we'll call Ms Nice) called out to the customers that the terminal would be down for a few minutes, and if they wanted to get their bets on, to do it now. 2 older gentlemen did so, and thanked us for letting them know. A third man, probably mid-40's (who I will refer to as Mr Angry), just grunted and paid no attention.

Getting the go ahead from Ms Nice, I open the lid and get to work. 2 minutes in, Mr Angry comes out of the viewing area at top speed with a card in his hands, skids to a halt on front of the disassembled terminal and frantically looks for the card slot. After about 5 seconds, the realisation that the terminal is down kicks in, and Mr Angry gets angry...

**Mr Angry:** *points at the disassembled terminal* ""WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS!!??""

The outburst is so loud and sudden, that it actually startles both myself and Ms Nice.

**Me:** Um... Sorry sir, just replacing a faulty part, I'll onl-

**Mr Angry:** *cutting me off* On a fucking SATURDAY!? You little c*nt! Why the fuck would you pull this bullshit on a Saturday!? (Yes, he actually called me that... Welcome to Australia.)

**Ms Nice:** ""Sir, please refrain from using that language. I called out saying the terminal would be down for 5 minutes and to place and bets you wanted, but you didn't-

**Mr Angry:** ""I should be able to place my bets whenever the fuck I want! This is BULLSHIT!!""

He then scrunched up the ticket and threw it at me. It hit me in the face, but it was only a little piece of paper, so...

""You'd better hope it doesn't win."" *Points at me* ""You watch your back! I should take you out to the carpark and fuck you up, you little fuck!""

Mr Angry then storms off back to the viewing area, and while I quickly get back to finishing the scanner replacement, Ms Nice picks up the card he threw, smooths it out, reads it, and then places it on the counter next to the terminal. ""Just in case..."" She says.

Another minute passes and I'm almost done reassembling the terminal and Mr Angry make another appearance...

**Mr Angry:** *pointing at me* ""YOU! You cost me over $5000! Because of YOU I missed my bet! You owe me $5000! I had $XXX to win on that winner and- 

**Ms Nice:** *cutting him off* ""ACTUALLY...  "" *She holds up his discarded card* ""You had 50 cents for a place on number Y, and it ran dead last...""

The look on Mr Angry's face was absolutely priceless. The kind of dumb, shocked look, coupled with his face going ghost white. He said nothing more, turned, and left the venue. 30 seconds later the terminal was reassembled, tested and working beautifully.

I saw Ms Nice a few more times after that, and she said he hadn't been in since then.

**TL;DR:** Would you care for a serving of threats with those lies?

My class was the first one to be in that particular classroom on the next Monday morning. Obviously, we noticed the fancy, shiny new smart board. The teacher was excited, and quickly decided to try it out. It powered on OK, projector displayed the image, but the computer wouldn't correctly install the drivers. 


Teacher: Hey MikroMan, could you help me with getting this set up?
I walked over to the computer desk and started checking: USB cable connected, power cable for the board connected, LEDs on whiteboard working, screws holding tightly... Wait!? Screws? 


About 2 cm from each border, in every corner, there was a screw holding the board on the wall. In the parts of the interactive area.


Yep, you read it right. The IT guy mounted the whiteboard by screwing four screws into the pen-sensitive area covering the electronic circuitry. I can't imagine how the guy kept his job afterwards... The damned thing cost 3000 EUR (3800 USD) a piece and he completely destroyed it.


They were never able to fix the thing up. I was there when the official company support tech came to check if they could do anything, and he just stood there dumbfounded for about a minute.

I take the call and it is a guy with a very heavy middle eastern accent. We work often with people from that part of the country and have had some great experiences. One of our major clients outsources all there IT needs and we work great with them. I'm excited for this one. 

They guy lets me know he is from ""Mircosoft call center"". Oh ya. Not ""the"" Microsoft call center, the one located in the Garden of Eden and plated with gold and diamonds is it?

he continues to tell me that my computer is seeing a report that there is something wrong with it. I ask him which computer. We have over 100 computers in the building not to mention all the servers. So I ask him if the report to him included a computer name or Ip address. Looks like the report to him only include the information ""Windows 7"", and nothing else. But he is pretty adamant that it is the computer I am currently sitting at. 

Well if he is so sure I had better let him troubleshoot this for me. So I proceed to let him troubleshoot it. 

""You see the c t r l key on your keyboard?"" he askes.

""yes I see the control key on the keyboard."" I reply

""Yes the ctrl key."" he asks again.

I let him know again I know the key.

Finally he gets that I know which key it is. He then continues, ""Next to it is the windows key. Press that and the R key""

""Yep, done that. What do you want me to run?"" I reply.

""Type I N F and press enter.""

""Got it I have the INF folder up.""

He continues going on tellling me that all those files are responses to the virus that I have and we need to fix it.

I then start to see if he will play. I ask him again how he got my info and what my name was. He was good enough to know my first name from the Admin Assistant that transferred the call to me. But doesn't know my last name. 

I then ask him where he worked. Which again is just ""call center"". I then asked him for some random made up Microsoft reseller partner number. 

Hey then asks me if I am IT. I say yes. His response is classic, ""Liar, you're not IT"" and hangs up on me.

ME: So what's the problem?

HIM: I need to get to this website.

ME: So, what happens when you try?

HIM: But how do I do that?

I had the good fortune to work for an ISP in the sunset of the dialup modem.  Technology was mature, PCs were actually getting powerful enough to handle WinModems, and I was salty and experienced.  I have a million stories from this era, some good, some bad.  Today I'll give you a sketchy overview, and the tale of the phone whore.


Tier One was characterized by my trainer, a lovely lass who hit every hotbutton in my brain - she was beautiful, she was brilliant, and she was a complete nerd.  


She also had and IRON FIST of authority.  I had found my new god.


Tier Two was the summer of love.  I labored willingly and gleefully under her stern discipline, my fellow Tier Two monkies pulling alongside me.  Pay went up.  Life was good.  


Then I got the night shift, and the keys to the palace.  


Night Shift was the best thing ever, especially once I trained myself to wake instantly and quickly to the ring of the phone.  I spent many nights sleeping at work and playing during the day, zero missed or dropped calls and high satisfaction ratings.  One memorable evening, I was building legos in the helldesk, and the phone rang. 


""Thank you for calling $Best_ISP, how can I help you?""


The reply was velvet over shapely hips, the caress of softness on naked skin.  It was one of the sexiest voices I have ever heard.  


""Great, now I'm going to have to put up with some young buck giggling about my username AGAIN""


It was also a rather irritated sexy voice.  I hastily assured this unknown user at the other end of my line that I was a trained professional buck, regardless of my age.  She said she would give me a chance.  Then she unloaded on me with both barrels. 


""OK, my username is Phone_Whore, my primary email is Phone_Whore@Best_ISP.net, and my secondary account is Proper_Name, which is of course Proper_Name@Best_ISP.net.   I have two of your biggest DSL connections, and one of them keeps dropping offline.  I'm losing income because I'm unable to reliably upload my videos.  I am a sex cam performer, is that a problem?""

I had been prepared for this.  This was the absolute peak of my career, and it was a call I had taken while playing with legos.  I took a breath to cover the pause. 


""No, Ma'am, I don't see how that could be.  I have your account details up, and both accounts are in good standing.  I do see multiple connections attempts on your secondary account, this is certainly indicative of a problem...""


We troubleshot the problem, which turned out to be a split pair at the NID - the customer was about 200 feet away from the DSLAM, so even with a split pair (-30db signal right thurrrr), she was able to connect..   occasionally.   I chatted with her about webcam technology, and commiserated about finding a device that could autofocus worth a damn - a problem I still have.  The call ended, the account was noted, and I had a smoke before going back to my legos.


But the story doesn't end there. Three days later, I get back from a drunken weekend of smoking pot and playing RIFTS, and I pull into the parking lot to see the boss's car - not my demigod of a tier 3 trainer, but our corporate overlord.  She who's power it is to bind and to loose.  She who gets off at 5pm - 2 hours ago.


Oh.   Oh balls.


With every minor misdeed and excursion outside the rules playing in my head, I stride into the helldesk to get my walking papers.


Instead of that, I got an early review, which meant a minor raise two months early.  I got a letter of commendation in my file, and a strong personal kudo from the boss (and she bribed in chocolate - hell yes.).  Phone_Whore had called back the next day during normal business hours..   and asked for the boss..    and it turns out, I was the only employee of $Best_ISP to have ever been professional enough not to make a joke or be amused or offended by her username.

Note : Am working in a medium sized office running on a fairly stable network infrastructure. I'm not tech support (anymore) here, but I know enough to know my way around PCs and networks. Most of the users here are fairly competent for the most part when it comes to computers, so I never thought I'd experience the following...


I was sedately going through my work, when I noticed that many of my windows were stuck in the Green Ring of Death (Firefox users should know. I'd prefer Chrome, but the web-based system I am working with seems to be a little more stable in Firefox and IE, and I am not touching IE &gt;.&lt;). 


Walking over to the IT desks to inquire (and grab some free chow), I find that I was not the only one with ""Internets Downs"". As I walked back to my spot in the cubicle jungle with some jelly beans, I see more and more people standing up and chatting/loitering/raging. Very soon, it was the whole office.


By now, our comrades of IT are frantically checking and double checking the connections, which eventually led to all of them crowding into our small server room to individually check each connection. After some time consulting the Network Gods, they marched out and proceeded to our boardroom single file. A minute later, they marched right back out, then went back to their desks, laughing amongst themselves.


Not to be left out of the levity, I sauntered over to our IT manager's spot and asked ""So what happened?""

1346174573.0,524,self.talesfromtechsupport,yyy0u,The Tablet Fapper (Long story. Sry.),617,93,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/yyy0u/the_tablet_fapper_long_story_sry/,"Background: I am a female IT manager for a medium sized company. Aside from helping out on escaladed issues and running over to hit mute on a team member's phone before they let an end-user have it for being incompetent, one of my 'benefits' is sitting in on 'technically related terminations' with HR. Our end-users generally work in either MWF or THS shifts.

I present to you the events leading up to my Tuesday morning:

Tuesday (one week prior): Level 1 receives a call about a tablet that is acting funny and keeps re-directing the web pages to other 'not appropriate' sites. We assume some malware and clean it up remotely. Problem solved.

Wednesday: No calls from that location, but we received an email commenting about the amount of lag on the internet that day.

Thursday: The Malware is back with a vengeance (on that tablet only, thankfully.) The tablet is re-directing again and slow as molasses. Because we have a web filter, not only are the sites bogging it down , but the web filter is going crazy with alerts all over the screen saying ~~'No! Bad end-user!~~ Page Blocked due to Content. Please contact your administrator.'

Everyone is aware of the web filter and that it is tracked by IT. However, they are also aware that it’s only really checked if a problem arises (we don't like to be over-bearing internet police.) It is also a cheapy one so we don’t track by user. So, out of curiosity, I checked the filter logs from the day before. I was ready to see some 'not appropriate' sites in the log and was not let down.

As policy states, I notified HR and showed them a printed version of the log. Confused about what some of the sites and terms were, they looked them up on their computers whilst I sat there. The looks on their faces told me that damage had been done. They requested that I track down the user and watch the logs live on Friday (when the user will work next.) The woman in HR (still unable to make direct eye contact with me after going to those sites for some reason) then thanked me for my assistance. Her face clearly questioning the happy bubbled world she once knew 10 minutes ago. 

Friday: I watch the logs and find the user. To ensure the evidence was concrete, I connected to the tablet and print screened shots while they were using it. To my convenience, they were logged into our user-specific inventory site in one tab and naughtiness in the other. The print screen with the username displayed in the corner tab of the naughty site was more of an artistic icing on the cake for making me track this in the first place. End of day -- I let HR know. After seeing her face the first time, I made sure to include the print screens I took to see if she could make that face once more. She could. 

Monday: HR decides we are flying to that location to 'discuss' this activity with the employee and their supervisor. :: wait for it to register:: 'we?'  Yep! Tomorrow morning. 9am. Conference room at that location. Please bring all collected documentation to be shown as evidence.

Tuesday: D-Day. 9 am meeting begins. Clearly, the employee had not been brought up to speed on the situation and thought he was there for a good reason like a promotion or raise. All smiles and professionalism.  I watched his soul sink and his face turn pale as our conservative bubbly HR lady began to read off the website on the log with a pep in her voice. As I sit there like a fly on the wall, she pauses as she does not know how to properly pronounce a word. She leans over to me for clarification – “That would be Hentai, Ma’am.”

In the end he was terminated without any protest. His only justification being that he mainly used the tablet in the bathrooms. I handed him a copy of the printscreen to ensure he had it for his records. I’m trying to not crack a smile as the immature child in me is going [omgomgomgomg! Hahaha!]

As we go to leave, the HR lady stops him and says “How on earth do you even find something like Space Dicks?!” I bit the inside of my cheeks to keep from laughing. I had missed Reddit in the logs, but apparently the HR lady had not.  

We are currently sitting in a coffee place killing time before we fly back. The HR lady turned to me and said ‘I never really appreciated IT until now. The things you must see and the people you have to interact with. I always wondered why IT people were so quiet, now I know. There are things on the internet that you just can’t unsee.’  I am attempting to keep a calm consoling face as she is clearly disturbed by what she has seen, but have been typing this story in the interim to avoid laughing. I don’t know why I even want to laugh at her for that, but I will TOTALLY stay professional and release this onto Reddit instead. This has been an adventurous and entertaining tale from Tech Support that will keep me smiling for at least a few days. I know it’s not a glamorous one of technical networking feats, but to me it has still been pretty awesome.

Anyway, I'm not in tech support myself, but I am a software engineer. So as all of you are familiar with, I help all my family with their technology needs whether it's trouble shooting computer problems, or showing them how to work the TV.

My mother owns her own company, and one day she comes home with an iPad from some of her clients claiming that they couldn't connect to their WiFi and asked me if I could help in anyway. Naturally, I can't do anything at my house about it (my mother is fairly technologically inept) and tell my mother that I'd have to go to her clients' house to see if I can fix the problem.

She calls them, and asks if that's okay. They agree and we head over. Once there I'm greeted by the nicest elder couple I've ever met (the husband is in his 90s and the wife in her 70s I believe). So as I'm troubleshooting their problem, the husband is telling me about his son(from a previous marriage) and how he was one of the first people to do computer-generated art back in the eighties. He also mentions that his son has passed away(which was pretty sad). I try everything I can think of to get the iPad connected to their encrypted WiFi, but I couldn't get it to work. I even reset their router to try to bring it to factory settings, for some reason it doesn't work.

Now I'm pretty exasperated as I couldn't figure it out so I decide to try one last thing. The woman tells me what her password is, and I guessed that maybe the tech who used it made the first letter a capital. Boom, iPad connected to the WiFi, the woman was ecstatic. 

As I go to leave the husband insists that I take a couple pieces of his son's one of a kind artwork, and forty dollars as payment. I try to decline the generous offer, however he insisted again, so I accepted. The next day I promptly took the artwork to get custom frames made for them. They should be ready today. It just goes to show you, sometimes awesome things happen.

**EDIT**: If you guys want, I could post some of the pamphlets that the husband gave me of his son's exhibits when I get home later tonight.

**EDIT 2**: fixed a spelling error

**EDIT 3**: I called and they said *maybe* they'd be ready  tomorrow. In the meantime, [Here's a scan of the pamphlet that I have] (http://imgur.com/girHV). Also: Damn this got a lot of attention, Thanks!

**Edit 4**:
 So replying to you all about the pamphlet, I think got you all. Does anyone have a better suggestion to deliver the actual goods? it was a pain replying to you all XD

**EDIT 5**: alright I called the place yesterday, and while I thought the art would have been ready this past tuesday, they actually said  tuesday the 24th. so bear with me for a few more days! I will deliver!

I've been with my company for a long time now, and I've made the whole gradual transition from the early decentralized days when you were given an office full of people and an IT budget and left alone to decide on infrastructure and servers and PC builds etc., to where we gradually centralized everything across several sister companies internationally.

In the end shuffle of all that re-organization I wound up in the server support team for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).  Of course managers will always sign off on integration long before things are actually integrated.  So we still had several offices in several countries where we had no idea what was actually there and how it was being managed.  Turkey had three such offices (Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir).  There's one guy who takes care of all three offices and he just got caught ordering servers that he was buying with company money and then selling for private gain.  So he's out and they hire a new guy.

The new guy is only supposed to handle local desktop support since all of the server stuff has been centralized, even though nobody on the server team knows anything at all about the boxes they have.  His first day in Ankara where his actual office will be, the new guy gets a call that none of the users in Istanbul can log in.  He hops in his car and drives out there and sees pretty quickly that there is a problem with the servers.

He tries escalating it to us but nobody can remote into any of the IPs he gives us.  After a frustrating day of trying to handle things remotely my boss puts out the call to see who can make it to Turkey quickest.  I'm in Frankfurt which is a major hub for air travel in Europe, so I win.

Okay, I get there and they have two racks of servers.  Their server room doubles as their storage closet.  It has a mobile air conditioner in it that crapped out a long time ago so temps are pretty goddamned high in there.  I take a quick inventory and they have a couple of Lotus Notes servers, an old file server, and a virtual host server with a DC running on it, SMS and another file server.  Every one of these servers has melted components inside.  I'm not using ""melted"" as a euphemism for broken.  They are physically melted and worthless.

I do what any one of you would do and start looking around for the tape drive.... but there isn't one.  So.... new guy...  where's the backup?

He runs off and asks the people who work in the office if they know anything about the backup and comes back with a hand full of DVDs, the most recent of which is a year and a half old.

Some of you are probably thinking exactly what I thought.  ""This sucks, but we can pull the hard drives and still get the data.""  One of our sister companies is actually a top provider of data retrieval so we send the disks to them.  They charged €16000 and still couldn't get anything off of the disks.

We got new hardware in and working air conditioning and kicked off a project to have a proper server room put in for them.  But 18 months of work was irretrievably gone for an office of around two dozen people.

A couple weeks later I can remember sitting in a meeting with my bosses boss and the business lead for Turkey with both of them yelling back and forth.  As fucked up as it was for them to be blaming us for a situation that they had watched build for years and never questioned, I was more pissed at my boss for taking over responsibility for that situation without having done any due diligence.",,False,,t5_2sfg5,False,,,True,t3_19e77z,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/19e77z/an_it_hooooorrrrooorrr_story/,

This was a really cool job because I got to go to all of these high end nightclubs for “work.”


Anyways, one day I realized we were running dangerously low on loaner laptops (we were expanding and hiring a lot of new people who all needed laptops).  I do the logical thing and draft a few purchase orders for five new laptops for each department (restaurants, nightlife, hotels, events, and corporate).  Each purchase order has to get approved by the VP of each respective department as well as the CFO of the entire company.  The CFO goes ahead and approves all of the orders, and so do all of the VPs, with the exception of the nightlife VP (this guy is kind of a prick).  Anyways, I go ahead and place the orders for all of the laptops except for the nightlife ones. 


A few weeks later I get an email from the VP of nightlife saying that his laptop crashed.  I go through some general diagnostics with him and eventually I tell him to bring it in and I would back up his hard drive and re-image it.  


Then the following dialogue takes place:


Me:  “The reimaging process takes about three hours and seeing as it's already pretty late in the day, the soonest I could get it back to you is tomorrow morning.”


VP:  “That is unacceptable. There is an event tonight at [insert nightclub name here] and I need a laptop tonight.  What about one of those?” He points to the bin on my desk labeled, “loaner laptops.” 


Me:  “Well unfortunately those laptops are reserved for other departments and there are no spare laptops allocated for the nightlife department.”


He then starts cursing at me and telling me that I need to a better job of fairly allocating technology.  I kindly remind him that I tried to order five spare laptops for his department earlier that month and he was the one who denied the purchase order.  He starts yelling again saying that he's a VP and he should be able to just borrow one of the corporate laptops for the night.

I'm still learning the ropes, and I like the job. 90% of the customers are saints but I've gotten some of the worst out of my training group this first week.

The first was on my second day in training. Customer didn't like the update to our shitty inferior email service (no one does), but of course it's my second day in training so it's all my fault and **I** need to realize that my terrible email service has competitors. She took down my id number, chewed me out, wanted to talk to a supervisor to complain about me because obviously I was doing a shitty job not fixing an update to a service I have no control over and minimal training on. She then proceeded to chew out the supervisor and take her number down too. It's not awesome to be sitting there with the rest of your training group looking at you while a supervisor has to finish your call. :C

The next call was the same day actually. Drunk, possibly mentally ill woman calls in wanting to fix her internet connection. She immediately starts crying about her son dying. I do my best to be kind and empathetic while still attempting to troubleshoot her modem. She sucks at it and is extremely drunk, is marked in notes as an abusive customer. The troubleshooting doesn't get very far before she starts swearing and screaming at her computer (and into the phone, so my ear rings for hours). Then she rambles on for a while as I slowly get up the nerve to piss her off just enough to get her to hang up the phone. Finally she mentions wanting compensation and I latch onto that and tell her we can't do that (correctly). Another few ear shattering screams and choice names before she slams down the phone.

And the last one was from today. All good calls right up until the last fifteen minutes of course, I get a lady who doesn't know her email address from her old dial-up account, and rather than listen to me she's just going to keep re-entering variations of incorrect addresses. Finally she listens just long enough to log in to facebook and then she complains that her facebook games keep crashing and she wants a tech sent out to fix it. I try to explain to her that her ISP is not responsible for updating her flash player and she loses it. Obviously facebook is the internet and we're supposed to fix everything on the internet.  I'm not a confrontational person but her whole attitude the entire call has been slowly pissing me off. I just want to get her off the phone at that point since I can't help her anyway and we're wasting each other's time. I tell her if the tech has to come without doing any troubleshooting of her modem there may be a charge (which is pretty much the case). She gives me an earful and hangs up.

Now Read On...  

----

So we had this Netware network running Windows 3.11 and Win95 workstations over BNC-connected Token Ring, and like all government systems it was a bit behind the times and not terribly well planned. One of its problems was that due to the significantly pre-registry age of the workstations, they stored most of the user and application configuration in INI files, and the logon and logoff processes including the copying of these files down to the workstation on logon and back up to the user home drive on logoff.  

The problem arose because, as in so many other environments, whoever wrote this process didn't stop to think about the issues which could arise from thousands of users who used different workstations from day to day. Yep, that's right, there was nothing in the INI-copying function which first removed existing INI files from the destination. (Partially valid as there were half a dozen ones vital for the running of the workstation, but even so.)  

The result? User A would log on to a PC. Their INI files would download to that PC. They'd log off, and their INI files would remain on that PC as well as being copied to their home drive. User B would log onto the PC. Their INI files would download. They'd log off, and their INI files *plus those of user A* would copy back up to their home drive. User B would then log on to another workstation, where both sets of INI files would copy down to the workstation, and when they logged off, they might pick up INI files from users C, D, and E who'd been using it before - not to mention that the workstation now had INI files from C, D, E, B, and A on it, and would be passing those on to users F, G, and H in the following week.  

So while a new user to the department might have ten or so INI files which belonged to them, as soon as they logged onto a workstation, they would pick up another eight hundred or so. Some workstations had as many as two thousand INI files on them, mostly because staff tended to install (against the AUP) lots of little shareware games which used them. Logging on and off now took thirty minutes or more as the machine tried to copy thousands of these things over the ageing network, particularly during as almost everyone in the multiple buildings had the same schedule and so arrived and left work at the same time.
   
  
On top of this, there were problems where the few actual valid INI files would build up enormous amounts of junk in their subsections because some of the logon processes would merge the user settings into the existing workstation copy of the file. And on top of *that*, all it took was for one copy of an INI file to have the read-only flag set, and it would not be overwritten, but instead would copy up to a user's home drive on logoff. If a user logged on to a PC with one or more of these, and the wrong interface settings came up, their first instinct was usually to log off and log back on, and then try another PC - meaning that the read-only INI files were now not only on the original PC, but on the user's home drive and the second PC, too. These 'vampire' files were ridiculously difficult to kill, as they could be exterminated again and again by the Helpdesk but would keep popping up as long as there was a single copy anywhere on the network. It didn't help that the executives tended to fly around the country a lot and log onto random PCs in our other city offices, meaning that any exec who came back from a visit was almost guaranteed to have a bunch of these vampires sitting in their home drive, starting the whole process all over again.  

Something had to be done. However, as my previous scripting experience had largely been limited to batch files, I needed something a little stronger.  

I sat down with a copy of *Perl for Dummies* and wrote a script called Buffy.  
   
  
I built Buffy to kill vampires. It was designed to patrol the network servers at night, whereupon it would scan through all user home drives, wipe out the unnecessary INI files, pull the guts out of the necessary ones and rewrite them, remove the read-only attribute from whatever was left, and generally act as guardian of user settings, preventer of the spread of vampirism on the network, and all-around watchdog.  

It was three-quarters documentation and comments, in excruciating detail. It logged every single thing it did. It took backups, verified the backups, checked that any changes it made conformed to correctness, restored from backups if something had gone wrong, and was generally hyper-conservative in its work. I tested it on some test accounts, using horrible messes of INI files copied from live users, and it worked perfectly. All it needed was access to the servers, which I (being a low-level peon) did not have. This is *why* I had written all the documentation and use notes, so that I could give it to the (effectively) Level 3 server team for implementation.  

I had written Buffy in spare moments gleaned from the unrelenting waterfall of incoming tickets, during lunch breaks and government tea breaks, and otherwise largely in my head while working on other items. I would arrive early and pore over Perl syntax, stay back late and run regexes. It was my very first Perl script of any length, and a labor of love. I worked on it for weeks, polished it until it shone, and then went cap-in-hand to the Level 3 team.  

""Guys,"" I said, ""I know we're having a problem with network response in the morning and evening, and with INI files being read-only and copying themselves around the network. I know it's causing problems with service levels and the ability of staff to do their jobs. I have here a script, with full and complete documentation, which I think might be able to help. Would you have a look at it?""  

And the Level 3 team said:  
   
  
""No.""  
   
  
And that was the end of Buffy.

I'll never forget this one moment I had, getting on two years ago now...

It was one of those simple days, one of those days where you're able to really help people because there aren't hundreds of people lining up to beg for help. That's when someone, a woman probably in her late 40s, phoned up and cried down the phone at me, exclaiming that the **DEVIL HIMSELF** had appeared in her shared folders. I was skeptical to say the least. Not quite one for imagining the devil raising from his throne to cause some havoc in a little shared drive... but more that the devil himself was real.

At first I just guessed that her assumption that **LORD SATAN** had infiltrated her folders on the network was her way of describing that she had lost some files, perhaps they had moved around or deleted themselves through *scary* voodoo magic. Her description, however, was fairly vivid. She had entered her shared folder looking for a certain file, and could only describe her *terror* as she found **EL DIABLOS** staring back at her, right there.

Naturally; she immediately closed the folder (to protect everyone, obviously) and phoned IT, and not her priest, to report the infiltration of the lord of the underworld.

I have to point out here that I'm not really joking when I say this woman was fairly hysterical. This was not a person who phoned up and jokingly said ""lol the devil's here guys"" but actually displayed the signs of fear, save for urinating upon oneself. After the moments of confusion finally subsidided, I decided the only course of action was to connect to the PC and see for myself what exactly was going on.

I asked her to guide me to where this folder was, and although she was reluctant... well...

He'd apparently stumbled across an article about web security and in a state of terror upped the security settings on his antiquated copy of Internet Explorer to the maximum. This resulted in a ""This site requires cookies"" page displaying when he visited his site, which he somehow interpreted as a demand that he phone us up and order a packet of baked goods before we'd let him continue through to the homepage.

We (somehow) managed to maintain straight faces while explaining what was going on. He grudgingly accepted the explanation but in no uncertain terms expressed his displeasure that the IT industry could use such 'confusing' language.

This takes place just a few months after beginning work at my current workplace.  So a bit over 11 years ago.  By this time I was over 5 years strong as a technician, but of course still learning.  

I received a trouble ticket for a faculty member, his computer was in an endless cycle of rebooting.  Never good, figured something was bad off there.  So I go look at the desktop - sure enough, it's pretty hosed, won't boot no matter what I do.  So I take it back to the workroom, back up his data, reimage and restore, setting it back up for him. Everything was working, and when I leave he is happy and I am feeling good that I helped him out and got it back to him quickly.

And then one day later I was substituting on the helpdesk for someone who was out sick.  Mr. faculty member calls back, saying his computer is just not working and hasn't been since it was worked on, and he was just incredibly unhappy with the shoddy work of the tech.  Which of course I found confusing since when I walked out, all was happy for the both of us.  Through this bit of conversation with him, it was painfully obvious he had no clue I was the tech he was lambasting.  But I tried to be professional - no reason to get up in arms, perhaps I can fix it.  And to not let on that I was the technician he had been complaining about, I was going to pretend to transfer him to my line and change my voice a bit.  OK maybe a tad silly, but I was just trying to keep all parties happy here...and this is the conversation that ensued

**Me**:  May I transfer you to the technician that worked on your computer?  She will be the most...

**Him**:  *cuts me off*  no I don't want to talk to her, she didn't know what she was doing

**Me**:  *feeling a bit offended but still trying to be a professional*  Ok, then can I input a new trouble ticket for you?

**Him**:  No. 

**Me**:  OK, then what would you like me to do?

**Him**:  I want to talk to a technician, just not her.  I want to talk to a REAL technician.

**Me**:  *at this point...yes I'm boiling, I tried to be a professional but I know my tone was not as friendly here*  Well then who do you want to talk to?

**Him**:  Who is there?

**Me**:  *looks around naming off people, and as soon as I mention the first male name*

**Him**:  Yes, him, I want to talk to him.

**Me**:  *grumbling* of course...

And I transfer.  And went ballistic after the tech was done talking to him.  Found out that wasn't the first time that faculty member had pulled that stunt.  I felt better, at least somewhat, knowing I was not alone with that slap in the face.  

Oh and his problem?  Non-functioning computer?  Nope.  One program had a particular setting he liked, and it had not been set up that way.   Program still worked - just not how he liked it.

I am still at the same place after 12 years, as is this faculty member.  And of course he still has trouble tickets.  Want to guess who has a bare minimum of a week wait when he has problems?

Tier 2 support at this University mean that I dealt with all sorts of special folk, students and faculty alike. On this particular evening I received a support call from a disgruntled Prof, and the conversation went something like this:

**Me:** Yes.

**Prof:** Oh, Um, OK then...

*So after about an hour of trying to get him to get to his email, click the link and install the extension, I get access* 

*I am greeted by dozens of saved JPEG icons on his desktop. This is gonna be fun.*

**Me:** What type of files are we looking for?

**Prof:** Urm, Videos. 

**Me:** OK, lets browse to some of your default folders and you tell me if you see them. 

*I browse to the default video folder and nothing is in there at all..and I assumed there wouldn't be, as I assumed this guy didn't know how to move them, so to the downloads folder we go!* 

*Upon opening the downloads folder, I am greeted with many, many thumbnails of nekkedness.*  

**Prof:** Oh I think they be in here..

*no shame in his voice at all*

**Me:** Well, Ill leave it to you to browse through these files and locate what you need, just give us a call back if you need anything else, OK?

*At this point, different helpdesk employees are gathered around me enjoying the hilarity of the situation I'm stuck in*

**Prof:** could you move my videos for me so I could find find them easier?

*By now, the pervy Prof is now on speaker phone for all to enjoy and Im being cheered on to move the videos*

**Me:** OK, I will move them in a folder on your desktop

*cheers erupt from around me*

*Scrolling through his bag of goodies, I come upon a few videos that appear to be home videos by the thumb nails...*

*nope. nope. nope. nope. nope. nope* 

**Prof:** Oh yes, please move those as well

*At this point, the crowd around me clamoring for me to indulge the old perv, so I oblige. However, I get a sudden mouse seizure and instead of clicking cut, I click play. What comes up in the lovely Windows Media player can only be described as a nekked old dude spread eagle on the floor and a dog nearby.*

**Me:** BLAAAH OK, soo...lets close this here...um....OK, so.....

**Prof:** Whats the matter young man, haven't you ever seen  a nude man?

**Me:** Excuse me? 

**Prof:** Are you not comfortable with nudity?

**Me:** I don't think this is appropriate sir, so I think at this point....

**Prof:** Seriously, its just animal porn.



*At this point, the entire helpdesk team is on the floor dying laughing and I am completely astonished as to what is happening. I end the support session and wish captain happy pants well on his way.

I work for a small manufacturing company with limited IT resources.  We had, at the time, an in-house Exchange 2003 server with about 100 mailboxes.  

Well, eventually the size of the store was getting too big, we were running out of hard drive space.  So my bright idea was to move the Exchange store to a temporary external drive (after a couple good tape backups of course), shove bigger hard drives in the server, then move it back.

So, Saturday morning, I hooked up an external drive, and started the move process within Exchange....

I don't know how many of you have ever tried something like this, but once you start moving the store, there is no cancel option.  So it starts moving.  And immediately I see a BIG problem.  And then two seconds after that I realize what the problem is.  And then one second after that, my life flashes before my eyes.

This old server, an HP DL380 (G2 or G3 series, can't remember) has USB 1.0 ports.  It's moving data to the external at an incredibly slow rate.  And like I said, there's no cancel, so I have to let it go.

I started that process mid-morning Saturday and it didn't finish moving the store completely until 7pm Sunday!  

At this point I'm screwed, I can't start moving it back or people will be without email for two business days.

My only choice was to run the Exchange store on an external USB drive for an entire week!  It worked, there were a few glitches along the way.  I had to restart the store several times due to I/O errors, but it made it through the week.

In the interim, I purchased a USB 2.0 add-in card for that POS server.  Finally when the weekend rolled around, I installed the USB 2.0 card, and moved the store back to the internal RAID drives.  It took 20 minutes to move it back!

Pretty scary deal, running a 100 gig Exchange store on an external USB drive for a week.

This of course, meant that I was now their personal tech support. They would call me every now and then with the typical stuff, but for the most part they were pretty good with it. When ever I do anything on their computer, they will sit beside me, and usually write down everything I tell them. This was great as I really only needed to show them things once.


Fast forward to the middle of last year and the thing finally gets to the point where it can't handle what they want to do with it (Photoshop etc). As I worked for a large chain computer store at the time, I sold them a moderately powered all in one desktop and all the little extras they needed. And me being the tech support, I was tasked with setting it up and moving all their stuff across.


I've already set up the new computer and we are getting into what photos, documents, music etc they wanted to keep from the old one - the first stop was My Documents. Now, this was Windows XP, and of course they had the folders set quite large with thumbnail previews. To be honest I don't know why I didn't just grab the whole folder, but I drop into My Docs and scan the folders to check what was worth moving, and that's when I see it. The Downloads folder, sitting in the bottom right corner, complete with four thumbnails of hardcore porn. I quickly click back, and announce ""Uh, I think I'm just going to transfer the whole folder. So I uh..Don't miss anything.."". I pretend like I saw nothing, quickly dump the last of their stuff onto their external hard drive, plug it into their new computer and put everything back in it's place.

***

The store was still doing well with selling Chinese knockoff items, but the sales were declining each week. Obviously it was because people started to notice that with these devices you get what you pay for. Ron and Don however didn’t think so, it was all about service and the distance between us and the customer.

The atmosphere in the store was still bad 2 months after the store outing and mainly the tension between Jeremy and Don and Ron was at an all time high. Jeremy who could be so indifferent at times now had strong opinions whenever it concerned me.

He did not really like the store all that much anymore. He had never really had to much of a problem with it, but started dreading going more and more every day. He wasn’t unhappy in his life or developed any desire to get a degree higher than college dropout. He just felt like leaving.

I had seen Ron and Don during the week interviewing a lot of new people, subjecting them to the same assignments I had gotten when I first came here. I saw a few people I recognised from school and was a bit surprised about it since all of them knew my stories about working here.

It took another full two weeks before we had another team meeting. I was getting sick of these things. Aside from the usual folks we now had two new people: Marcel and Johan.  

“These are our two new employees to make sure that the store is staffed while you guys are out on the road,” we were told.

“Excuse me?” was the first thing Jeremy shouted. “What is this about!?”

“Well, we are going to offer service at home for our customers.” We all paused.

“So this will mean that most of the time Jeremy, Frank and Richard will be on the road with our new staff joining in as the new daytime store employees. We already have a few reservations for our service for tomorrow, so you’d better be on time”.

They quickly ended the meeting and said goodbye as if we weren’t allowed to even say anything about it. I now had Marcel and Johan looking at me. I grabbed Jeremy’s hand and left quickly; I was not going to deal with them too.

* * *

When Jeremy went to the store the next morning he had gotten a bike from Ron with the stores logo printed on the crate in front of it. “It’s healthy for you, and good for the environment!” Ron said rather cheerily, “and you have an appointment in 10 minutes, so you better hurry.” He put a list of all the addresses in his hand and closed the store door.

Jeremy didn’t like going to other people’s houses to fix their problems. He was happy fixing their computers, but not dealing with the people standing behind him, yakking on about them. He tended to get all kinds of questions as to whether he could look at their TV and vacuum cleaners as well, as they are all electronics anyway.

Pricing for the service was premium to say the least. Easily 2 times more expensive than bringing the computer to the store. However, many customers didn’t know this and lost their calm quickly after Jeremy told them the price. He really did not feel comfortable doing this.

* * *

Meanwhile, I had to work with Johan and Marcel on a Saturday shift so as “learn them the ropes,” as Don called it. Hopefully it would not end like it did with Alex. I quickly learned that Johan and Marcel were in their thirties and had worked in a couple of other computer stores, but their resumes were rather empty when asked about them. Work experiences were few and far between, it seemed to me. It wasn’t too hard to figure out why this was; they were hard to get along with. 

Johan and Marcel tended to know it all better. They weren’t stupid, but smart was another story and social even more so. They found themselves to be managers because of their age and infinite wisdom about computers. I can understand why they were hired: Ron and Don saw their younger selves in them.

My shift with them was rather strange. I knew just about everything about the store: how to work the systems, how to best stock the store, how to make best use of the space and most importantly how to deal with the customers. But somehow they knew it better then me and were glad to show me my mistakes.

A customer came into the store while I was explaining to them how the register worked. It was a customer I knew, and actually really really liked. He looked like James Randy and loved old computers — the older the better. He didn’t come here because he liked the store that much, but because we often had old stuff lying around that I sold him on the cheap. 

He had invited me once to his house to see his collection of computers and it was simply amazing. He had been working in computers all his life and had designed circuit boards for many systems throughout the years. He had taken the time to explain to me how the systems worked and how complex they could be. If I had to give my reasons as to why I am a hardware designer these days he would be on the list. 

When he saw me in the store, he walked up to me to say hi. He didn’t, however, get the chance, as Johan and Marcel were fighting each other as to who was going to help this old man find a new computer. He was overwhelmed at first by the insistence and aggressiveness of them both, but quickly recovered.

“I only want to be helped by Leila as she has helped me countless times before. Please go do something else instead of harassing me,” he said calmly, pushing both of them aside. He walked up to me and asked for the old Pentium processors I had called him about. Meanwhile Marcel and Johan gave me an evil look while I walked away to get the processors.

After that shift I started working less at the store, doing only Saturdays and some weekdays at night. I did not want to work with them. Working with Richard, Frank and Jeremy could be tiring at times but at least it was fun and we didn’t make each other feel like shit.

* * *

Meanwhile Richard and Frank were having the time of their lives going to their customers together. They had convinced Ron to let them handle all the appointments and scheduled them to their benefits, often going together to the same customer.

You could tell they had even more fun browsing around people’s computers and finding out what dark parts of the internet they visited when they were actually with the persons in their house. Getting free drinks and food from the people wasn’t too bad either.

Jeremy, however, was finding it harder and harder to go to work every day. It wasn’t something for him. He really did not like it. It was about 5 weeks in when he came across the prototype of a bad customer.

The customer had the vague problem that his computer didn’t work. He never gave any specifics about it, so Jeremy went in without any idea. The computer was old and fragile. It looked like the computer was a victim of domestic violence, or at least was dropped a couple of times from the concrete stairs of the flat it was residing in. The keyboard and mouse weren’t in any better condition, and the screen had what looked like a couple of bruises. 

Jeremy tried to talk with the customer as to what was wrong with the computer, but no matter what question he asked, the computer was always just “not working.” Giving up, Jeremy went to work and tried to start the computer. It didn’t work. When he checked the cabling he found that the power cable had been completely torn apart. He replaced the cable and tried again. The computer turned on.

Hearing the startup chime from Windows, the man rejoiced and quickly pushed a huge list of poorly described problems into Jeremy’s hands saying he should fix those problems as well. Somewhere around an hour into this process the customer started becoming angry and started shouting at Jeremy calling him a slow and worthless. He also wasn’t going to pay anymore “because he was taking so long on purpose just to rip him off.”

When Jeremy tried to calm the man down, he started throwing books and other stuff at him. Jeremy stood up and left. He didn’t care about the money, or his job or anything. He just wanted to get out of that house and to quit his job if they were going to keep making him do house calls.

If it wasn’t for Richard and Frank, he would have. Richard and Frank had secretly started their own business in a business. They kept two agendas: one from the store, and their own one. Reservations would be distributed around a 60:40 ratio on the agendas. Easy cash, and no-one was the wiser.

The scheme had been working brilliantly for some weeks and Ron and Don did not know anything about it. That was until they got greedy. They had been called by a old couple that had trouble with their TV’s set-top box. Given they could earn a quick buck and the problem would not be difficult to fix, they took down the job details in their second agenda.

When they were at the old couple's home, they found the issue quickly. The set-top box just needed to be restarted and the only way to this was by taking out the power connector and putting it back in. It worked again. To keep suspicion to a minimum they fiddled around with the setting and doing some other non relevant stuff for another 20 minutes and declared it fixed.

They charged 75 euros. The couple paid. Two weeks later the couple had the same problem and they charged 75 euros again. It was now that the couple’s son found out about this and went ballistic in the store at Don. 

Don didn’t know anything about it and called Frank and Richard. They tried to keep the situation under control but the sixth sense of Don must have picked up on the missing money. They were forced to show their secret agenda and it was now Ron who went ballistic.

Frank and Richard were fired, right there and then. It was mostly about the money that never reached Don and Rons pockets, but also damage control to keep the rightfully outraged customer happy. But it was too late. The damage was already done.

My job involves attempting to resolve various issues remotely through VNC, if we can't fix it then a field engineer will attend and repair it on site, we're also responsible for assisting the engineers if need be.

My apologies. A TL;DR has been provided.)

-------------

This dates back from back in the days before Pagemaker gave way to Adobe InDesign.  

So there I was, younger version of me working away in a print shop when an order came in from the local cable company office.  They had some 11x14 pages that kinda looked like a spreadsheet, with text inside each box, cell, whatever the heck you call it.  This was a lot of text in very small type.

What they wanted seemed simple: change some various bits of text in certain cells and send it off for printing.  Copy a block of text from one column and replace the existing text in another column.  Seemed easy enough...

Not quite.  Whoever originally created this graphic file had decided that the best way to format the text was to type something in a cell, hit the spacebar several times to end up in the next cell, type that text, rinse and repeat.

This text was not in column format to start with. So when I tried to change or cut the text, whatever text was below that cell just went kablooey.  Yikes.

What we needed was to convert this word salad into pretty much one looooong column.  Then I could easily format it back into proper multiple columns in Pagemaker.

After pasting the text into whatever word processing program I had at the time, I started copying and pasting by hand to try to transform it into that long column, timing the work as I went.  I then did some math and realized that completing this job as/is would take about 8 hours.

I called my boss over to look at it and tell him the bad news.  After some discussion he was about to break the news to the client when I had a brainwave and told him to come back in a couple of hours.

I immediately called a fellow geek and said:  ""Email me a copy of Word Perfect 5.0 NOW.   I'll explain later.""

I used to create newsletters in Word Perfect 5.0 back in the day.  One thing I loved was the macros...  you could do some pretty neat, complicated things with WP5 macros.  You could take a bunch of spaces and turn them into a single semi-obscure character (such as a ^ symbol).   Then you could create another macro to notice the ^ and do something cool with it, such as copy whatever text was below it and paste it wherever you wanted.  

Too many years have gone by for me to remember the exact macro sequences I created to accomplish what happened next.  All I know was that I started by having it change the damn spaces to some obscure character, then used that obscure character as the beginning of a series of macros to have WP5 cut and paste each bit of text into one sweet long column which I could easily format properly in Pagemaker.   This included deleting the obscure character as it went from one bit of text to the next.  Total time:  45 minutes.

I showed the boss what I did.  It blew his mind.  He praised me in an employee meeting later that week.

Some experienced coder later told me:  ""Sezzme, you think like a programmer!  You were doing real programming right there!""  That compliment felt even better than the boss bragging on me. :)

TL;DR:  Desktop publishing environment.  Dragged Word Perfect 5.0 back from the dead to reformat a bunch of badly-formatted text into a sweet, convenient, clean column format, changing 8 hours of work into 45 minutes.   Took advantage of macro capability that only this ancient DOS version of WP had, as far as I knew.   Got compliments from the boss.  Some coder later told me I should be a programmer.

I got a job for a small ISP as a linux and network admin. I found routing problems(not fix), I maintained the dns and mail services, and I did commercial intertube installs. Now something that is common is that ISPs provide a relay host for business' mail servers. The purpose largely is to keep your owned ip addresses clean from any lists. That way if 1 customer leaves and you give their IP to someone else there's going to be no problem of RBLs for the new customer. So naturally lots of businesses are doing this and just about every IT place would immediately blame the ISP mail servers.

Well back story is that there was this one customer who spent loads of money and was constantly spending more and more. They had 5 mlppp internet connections(used at most like 1 dsl connection) and other services we were selling and they were in line to buy our future products. They 'needed' basically none of it. The part however is that the IT person at this place was a 10 and she always got her way. She also had a very large budget but she didn't have the first clue about what to do in her job; however everyone bent over backwards for her because she was very flirty and hot.

So I get a call from her saying 'no emails are being sent out' and i check postqueue I see nothing stuck. I check mail.log and grep for their domain. I tell her, ""I am seeing here that I am getting emails from your business and they are being delivered, for example so and so sent an email 2 minutes ago with subject of 'blah blah' I then check and see nobody else is having problems. I send a test email to her to see if she received it and she could reply. According to her she never received it. So I check mail.log and follow the transaction. Their mail server absolutely did receive the email. I ask her to tell me what email they were trying to send to and see if there's something? I get told and I send a test email explaining the situation briefly. The person gets back to me within like 1 minute. I also check mail.log and I can see my email, I can see past emails from lots of other businesses. I never see a single attempt from anyone at this applicable place.

So I basically drew the line. I said that their mail server isn't my responsibility and I'm much too busy to do a back and forth with her. That their exchange server must have some block or their antispam is blocking it or smtp connector is pointed the wrong way. I didn't know what was wrong but it was certainly not at my end. She counters, 'We have an SLA with you guys and for every second we are down this is costing us millions, we are going to sue you if you don't fix this' Which mind you they're a non-profit which had only been open a few months and they'd gotten ridiculous cash from the government to open their doors. I reply, 'Well we don't have an SLA with you and nothing is actually down that we are responsible for so there's really no point in threatening a lawsuit. Plus the only way I could fix this would be to connect to your server and fix it'

She liked that answer, 'Well you better connect to the server now and fix it' and I reply, 'I can't connect to your server without a contract and indemnification of liability and I don't even want to fix it; so this is pretty unlikely for me to fix for you. However I gave you some ideas why it might be down and really the question you should be asking is 'what changed?' and that will tell you why it's not working.' She then admits, 'Well I was just on there changing settings and then it stopped working' I just stayed silent for a good minute and she would say, 'are you still there?' and I would just say, 'yep' and after about a minute of basically silence she's like, 'so have you finished thinking about how to fix it?' and I'm like, 'No I was just waiting for your words to sink into your own head. You did something and now it doesn't work... just undo what you did.'

She was angry again, 'I don't remember what I did, I changed lots of things. However if you don't fix this for me I'm going to go to your boss and tell him how terrible you are and cancel all our services if he doesn't fire you.' Well I happened to want to quit at this point so I reply, ""would you like me to give you my boss' phone number?"" now of note here, my boss absolutely hated when we gave his # to customers, because he would chill at home doing nothing and would only have to work when a customer called him and he'd be extremely mad that we gave his # out. However in this case I already knew she had it and that's exactly what she said.

Then I basically was like, 'Well is there anything else I could help you with today?' and you could hear papers being tossed and then you could hear her cup her phone so nobody could hear her and she whispered, 'I want you to fix it for me or I'm going to get you fired.' and I respond, ""Sorry but this isn't going to happen, if you want I can tell you some phone numbers for some local IT businesses that could help you out."" You could hear her typing angrily and she's like, 'I've already racked up $30,000 in bills this month from IT businesses in the city. That's why I need you to fix it before my boss finds out and questions what's going on.' I'm was taken aback by that number and say nothing.

I think she was starting to realize wtf was going on, 'Fine I'll call one of the IT businesses and if we find out that it was you all along... you're done' and she hung up. I go tell coworkers about what happened and send email to my boss because I know he might care. I then find out how we got them to buy so many of our products... apparently anytime there's a problem like this we would just have her buy this new whizbang thing that they were pushing that month and while we installed or did that work we'd fix her other problem on the downlow.

I never did hear from her again as I quit that job not that long afterwards but my next job after that I had heard about how she would get them to do work and then she'd have another IT place go in find any problems and use those problems to not pay for the other. The IT places started to clue in and play hardball right back.

I'm the Computer technician for a school district.

For budgetary reasons and the fact that I work for a school that is budget conscious and likes to ""save money"" by freezing the budget come December. So I use to order about $3k in ink supplies for the inkjet printers and about another $2k in Toner supplies in September in anticipation for the school year. Or at least that is how it was until I went to lunch one day and didn't lock my office. I came back to find my entire cache of HP 27 and HP 28 ink cartridges, a 6 month supply GONE. I sent out an email regarding the incident and never got a response except for management who was upset with me for the loss.

SO in retaliation I assumed it was one of our employees with a printer that used HP27/28 ink (hoping it wasn't just someone looking to sell them on eBay, doubted as most are older and ... well I just doubt it.) I pulled inventory for the Elementary school, drilled down to Inkjet Printers, HP 27/28 Ink. 8 results... I waited until that evening when it was just me and the custodial staff. I then went from room to room as I have a master key checking desks of the teachers on my list. 7 of the 8 had 4 or more cartridges that I could find in assorted places from desks to closets to cabinets. During my late night raid I collected 43 cartridges leaving only 4 behind for each teacher, 2xHP27 and 2xHP28.

Then next morning I then reported to management what I had done and the number of cartridges that I had confiscated, and reported that this was a faculty issue not an issue of me not locking the door as a number of these cartridges were 5+ years old based on the manufacturing date on the boxes, so this preexisted my employment. Apparently the teachers come to me and just ""say they need new cartridges, meanwhile they are just storing them for a rainy day.

I now have a locked closet away from my office to store the supplies in...

Oh yea and I also shot out and email tanking everyone for returning their additional ink cartridges. I have since cut my ink expenditures 25% as the dated ink was still good and I used the surplus to offset expenditures.

Over the ext month I had several faculty members come to me and report that someone had stolen their ink cartridges…

I never disclosed to the district what faculty members it was that I recovered the cartridges from, figured it dint make that big of a difference as I was getting a locked supply closet. I’m not sure if these were the actual “thieves” or just hoarding teachers.

If you like this let me know as I have many more stories as many of you do.

Edit: Those of you thumbing me down if you look at this again please let me know what you didn't like, the only thing I can think if was the fact that I raided their rooms.

What happened was she recieved an email with a picture attached. Outlook opened it in the Microsoft Picture Viewer from cache. A cache it shares with IE... so the preview bar at the bottom is full of porn.

I got a call from this woman's manager, upset that it was taking so long to fix. The conversation went like this: 

Her: I've noticed that the ticket is still in normal severity. This application is critical to her job. 

Me: I know. I've been trying everything I can think of, including asking techs from other departments. 

Her: Well, I think we should increase the severity on the ticket. Also, I think it should be escalated.

Her: Yes. And escalate it. This should be escalated. 

Me: I'm not sure what that would accomplish. I'm already working on it. 

Her: Just tell me who I need to talk to in order to escalate this!

Me: Um, okay. Talk to (manager's name) at (phone number).

Boss: Hey, you still working on that ticket? 

Me: Yup. 

Boss: Okay. Well, do it more intensely, it's been escalated. 

Me: Will do!

So, I started typing with extra vigor, and mouse-clicking with the focused intensity of a laser. 

Still have no idea why she wanted to escalate something that was already being worked, though...

I worked at a grocery store in high school. I worked the security position at the store. I wasn't a security guard, I was employed by the store and did carts and stuff too. Anyway. I used to stand at the entrance of the store and make sure people didn't walk out with things, check reciepts, etc. Next to me, was a little booth that had a computer, and sold pre-paid debit cards. There was one person working it, and, you guessed it, she was completely computer illiterate. I have no idea how she acquired this job. 

Anyway. One day, her computer was being slow, and she asked me if I happened to know anything about computers. It was a slow day, and I was bored, so I asked my manager and she said I could help her. A previous employee had been going on ""free movie sites"" so there was a ton of adware, Trojans, the works. So I ran an optimization on the machine, cleaned it up, and it ran like new. 

This is where I messed up. I should have never, EVER, shown her I knew ANYTHING LIKE THAT about computers. Let's just say, after about a month, I was basically running the booth for her. I walked her through everything, all the time. 

One day, the store was closing up, and she was getting ready to leave, and she dusted the computer tower too before leaving (which she had never done.) She came up from her cleaning, and said in a worried voice, ""derbeaner, I think the computer is on fire, I see sparks.""

I quickly walked over, and asked her where they were coming from, and she pointed at the back. I inspected it, and didn't see anything but the usual dust and LEDs. She kept telling me, ""Look, there's more sparks.""

I finally realized that she was pointing at the LEDs that show a connection on the ethernet port. I have never, in my life, wanted to slam my head against a concrete wall, in my life, until this moment. 

I told her what it was, and she said, ""No, I really saw sparks!""

I finally just agreed with her and made up some BS about them coming out from the fans. 

The next day, I came into work, and she had a brand spanking new Dell computer.

The rain is pouring, the winds are howling, and in my head a migraine has started that I can only attribute to the very *thoughts* of coming into work.

I'm only two calls into the day and I get a gem. I know from the labored breathing and high pitched, shaky voice that either the woman on the phone with me is giving birth or having a panic attack.

Cust: ""Oh GOD!! A person. My internet isn't working. What's *wrong*?""

The woman is clearing experiencing the later of my theories. I manage to get her details. Enough that I can work with anyway. And I find out that the modem is showing a red internet. DSL and sync shows solid signal. Modem probably just needs a reset to kick start the connection. 

I check details on the model of modem. That it's one of ours without any custom settings as far as she's aware. I check previous logs, yep, no custom settings as far as I can see from our end either. Great.

""That's perfect. Now, if you look at the back of the modem. You know, where all the cables clip in? You should see a small little pin hole. You should be able to use a pen, maybe a paperclip or pin and what I want you to do is to push it into that hole and hold it in. The modem will reset in about 10 seconds.""

Cust: ""Okay...""

There's something about her voice that has set me on edge. I have to double check.

Me: ""Do you need me to go over it step by step with you?""

Cust: ""No, I'm pretty sure I understand.""

All of a sudden she's calm and a lot more confident. The hairs on the back of my neck start rising.

There's about a minute of silence then. I'm assuming she went off to find a pin or something small. But then comes the grunting. Now, let me just say that with the noises the woman was making I was going back to my original theory of panic attack and doing a little re-evaluation.

Me: ""Hello? Can you hear me?""

I can hear the grunting in the background and if I wasn't worried before I'm worried now because it's being accompanied by a fairly noisy banging.

I'm calling out on the phone hoping that she can hear me and that she comes back. So far my brain is running away with itself and I'm now theorizing that she's actually giving birth to a robot.

As I'm sitting there with a confused and slightly scared look on my face I hear a male voice in the background. There is some raised voices and then some laughter.

The laughter made me feel a little better. But only a bit.

A few seconds later the phone is picked up by a man. The son of the woman in question that called in. He proceeds to explain that his mother, after being advised on a reset, wasn't able to find anything small enough and so decided she could *hammer* a philips screwdriver into it instead.

Proceed me to order a new modem.

**TL;DR Woman can't find pin to reset modem. Hammers a screwdriver into it instead.**

(For the record, neither one works in IT.....thank god.  They're from a different department.)  

OM:  You really should stop using wi-fi and start using your cellular data plan instead.  It's much cheaper.

RE:  Really?  I always thought you should use your home or work wi-fi and just use your cell network when you're out on the road?

OM: No no no.  My friend just told me that they're going to start charging $12 an hour for people who use wi-fi instead of their cell's network.  The cell companies want to be able to track your usage and they can't do that if  you're using wi-fi, so they're just going to start charging people $12/hr for those who go on the internet without using their network.

*(At this point, I'm debating whether to just bang my head against the desk repeatedly until I put myself in a permanent vegetative state or find a lethal weapon and euthanize the OM for the benefit of all mankind.)*

RE:  Wow.  I never knew that. 

*(I'm in the process of walking out when I see the receptionist fiddling with her settings, and I assume she's attempting to connect to her cell network instead of our wi-fi.  For the record, employees are expected to use the wi-fi instead of their cell network and are allowed to use it for personal use, but they're still subject to the usual restrictions.)*

Me:  OM, where the hell did you hear that from?  There's no way the cell companies could do what you're claiming they are going to do even if they were stupid enough to want to.  They *want* you using your wi-fi instead of their network because it takes pressure off their network.  

OM:  My friend told me about it last night.  She heard about it on &lt;some local talk show I've never heard of&gt;.  And they.....

*(At this point I stopped listening, as it was obviously one of those ""friend of a friend"" stories with no real merit.)*

I tried explaining it to her but she went into great detail about it.  You supposedly can ""buy"" an hour of using your own wi-fi for $12/hr, or 4 hours for $20 (!).  Or you can avoid the charges entirely by just using their network and letting them track you so you can get more ads.

Anyway we replaced the server and everything was fine for long enough time for Backup Exec 2012 to calculate disk trend.

Woman calls in; ""My boss is checking up on me and he says I haven't done my job in months. I go into the excel document and it has nothing since 2011. I saved that document on the server several times over the last couples days. Obviously something went wrong and you guys restored the server from an old backup.'

We say, 'We haven't but what files are you looking for? Let me help you.' She gives us the location that she saved it to; the place that the boss was looking. Sure enough the file hadn't been updated since 2011. We check the backups and they are all identical files. So obviously she's lying and she didn't save there. So we say, 'Did you perhaps save it to your desktop? because the file on the server now hasn't changed in weeks.' 

She didn't seem to like that answer, 'Just fix it and get my work back because I save that file to the server every day.' We explain 'there's no file by that name or even one saved recently with a different name. If it's not saved your desktop or my documents then there's just nothing we can do. Can we log into your desktop to see if we can find it?'

She really didn't like that, 'I save it to the server all the time and obviously you guys did something wrong and are trying to cover it up.

I run tech support for thermostats, basically determining whether an issue can be solved over the phone or if a technician needs to be sent out to someones' house to service it on-site.

We get alot of wacky calls in the office, but today this one took the cake.

I'm sitting at my desk, idly browsing reddit, when a wild caller appears! He starts off by asking me disjointed questions about thermostats and air conditioners. Normally I wouldn't mind answering fairly random things like this, but there's a queue building and I want to wrap this one up quick.

So I ask him what seems to be wrong with his thermostat. Of course, he doesn't answer me and continues to ramble about things unrelated. So it's one of these calls. Sigh.

After a few minutes of this back-and-forth nonsense I manage to pry out of him that his air conditioner outside is running, but the temperature inside his house isn't going down.

This is a fairly common issue that people call us for. Their compressor outside is running but the air isn't being cooled, and the compressor isn't stopping. It's usually a frozen line or a freon leak, and has nothing to do with the thermostat. We don't service air conditioners here, only thermostats.

I calmly explain this to the customer(he's getting progressively more upset), and he goes ballistic. He asks if I'm a ""technical person"". I tell him that I am technically-minded, and had a good idea of what was happening. He says ""NO. I mean are you a TECHNICAL PERSON?"".

-""Well sir, I'm not HVAC certified if that's what you're aski-""

-""Then how do you know?!"" ""I want to speak to a TECHNICAL PERSON!""

Now here's the kicker: The thermostat he has installed is a model that we no longer service, as per our contract with the local utility.

-""Unfortunately I won't be able to put you into contact with one of our technicians, as we do not service this thermostat""

-""You installed it i want it fixed! yadda yadda""(This continues for a few minutes of him ranting)

-""As much as I'd like to help you, we don't service this thermostat. I cannot have one of our techs take a look at it. Even if you replaced the thermostat you would still have this issue, it really isn't something we can fix here anyway.""

And this is the point where he prettymuch guaranteed that after finishing the call the rest of the office would know of his dickish behaviour:

-""Do you know the function of a thermostat?!""

-""Well yes, it's used to regulate the temperature in the home, sir.""

-""Well then I want it fixed because of that!""

-""I.. I don't quite understand. We went over this, I can't fix your thermostat.""

-""Do you know what 'THERMO' means?!'

Now normally I would not let a situation escalate to the point where a customer is speaking to me in such a rude tone, and I definitely would not put up with silly questions aimed at belittling me, but it's the end of the day and he's sort of entertaining.

-""Well sir 'thermo' isn't a word, but if you're referring to 'thermal', then I'd say it means heat.""

-""NO, THERMO MEANS HEAT! YOU NEED TO FIX MY THERMOSTAT.""

-""I don't understand where this is going, but the bottom line is I'm unable to service the thermostat. As much as I'd like to help, there is literally nothing I can do.""

At this point the call devolved into him swearing at me in punjabi and hanging up.

On to the story. I don't usually get involved directly in supporting individual desktops in my current position unless it's something particularly odd. Occasionally though, my department gets a support request that nobody really knows where to send so we have to deal with it. We got one about a week ago complaining that ""company supported application X"" was not working on Windows 8. 

The answer was pretty simple, we haven't been deploying Windows 8 on anything and Application X isn't licensed for use on computers that we don't own and hasn't been tested on the new OS anyway, so use it on your work computer.


User looks me up in the directory and calls to tell me that he is using the software on his work laptop. I verified that he's actually using Windows 8 and ask who put it there. I shit you not, he comes back with, ""I did. I like the new start menu and I got the disc from [IT employee who shall be flogged with a rusty chain later] to try it out."" First thought in my head is ""screw this, I'm not cleaning it up"" and transfer the call to the genius who gave him the disc. Of course he doesn't pick up and I end up with the user on my line again. In the middle of me trying to explain to him why he can't have Win8, he responds with, ""Listen, it's MY computer and I'll put what I want on it."" The dude then proceeds to yell at me because nobody told him that this would happen, we should have been ready for Windows 8, his herpes is flaring up, it's all my fault because nobody told him not to do it and Starbucks didn't put enough sissy juice in his triple caramel latte this morning. I let the future flogee know what just happened so that he can go to the user's desk to back up documents and fix the mess that he created thinking that would be the end of it.


About 45 minutes ago, the same user calls me directly to complain that he can't get some bullshit app to work on his phone and needs help. We have a BYOD policy for phones here. Users get a monthly stipend and get to go out and pick whatever device tickles their nips, long as they can get to their email on it and answer calls.

I said okay, and proceeded to open up the laptop while asking the typical questions.

About 2 years back I was working at a reasonably sized ISP. A few of our clients had web/mail servers we had supplied to them. One month a client noticed unusually high bandwidth usage and wanted to know which pc/employee was using the most bandwidth.

I went onto the web server and quickly found the guilty IP address. I checked the logs and there it was - webpage upon webpage of porn had been visited. The client asked for logs of all the activity, which I started compiling.

Two thing quickly became apparent - this user was looking at porn the entire day. Pretty much 8am - 5pm everyday, and it had been going on for a long time. By time I finished there were logs for pretty much everyday going back a year. I can only assume he had a desk in a corner somewhere where nobody ever saw him/remembered he worked there. I don't know how he even got any work done

He was fired the day after they got the report, but I will never forget that spreadsheet of the sites visited. I wish I still had it- it went on for dozens of pages

I work for a large university, handling hardware and software support for a fairly large user base (10k or so). We are a contracted department, and we offer support to any department/school that will sign up. As central IT for the University, my department does not charge other subdepartments in our division. They have our support for free.


Enter today's story.


A DBA from our catacombs sends a request to check why his monitor isnt working. Fair enough. We check it out, and it turns out the graphics card is FUBAR. No big deal, warranty is active, so lets just RMA the part and next day mail will have him up and running in no time. In the meantime, we managed to setup a work around where the machine is plugged into the onboard card, so he can at least function.


Next day, call to schedule appointment, user mentions he is busy and has no time. Went on to explain that this is a 5-10 minute process, but he made up his mind. Sure Not a problem.


Fast forward a week, still being difficult about it. I decide to take things into my own hand and walk over with the new card. I explain to him how the RMA works, and that we are required to send the faulty part back to avoid incurring fees. After a conversation that lasted easily twice as long as the process would have taken, he caves and says, Ok fine, lets do it now....


Then goes right back to work.


So i stand there like an idiot for a minute or so. Two minutes. 5 minutes. I used to be a DBA, sometimes saving oracle files takes a while, sometimes you have alot of things to shut down. I get it. 


10 minutes pass and played a few games of candy crush, when i finally decided to look up, i saw he was balls deep in code. 


Awesome. ""Excuse me sir, are you ready?

User- ""I've been ready, what's taking you so long!""

""Well sir, you're sitting at your computer using it. Ready hardly seems like the proper word.""

User- ""You mean i have to move?""


This is not the worst part...


I calmly explain that it would be very difficult for me to open his computer and replace a faulty part while he occupies the space around it.


user- ""Fine, make it quick.""

Great, so i sit down and start closing open windows.

user- ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING???? ARE YOU RETARDED??""""""


So i have this thing about namecalling people trying to help you. Don't do it. Just don't. It makes you look unprofessional, and makes me less apt to help and more apt to cause you physical harm.

""Sir, what seems to be the problem""

User- ""You're closing all my stuff!"" Who told you to do that""

Lightbulb, hes a special kind of stupid. 

""Sir, what did you think I was going to do.""

User-"" You're job is to replace the part. Not ruin my work.""

""Well, how am i supposed to do that with everything on.""

User-"" YOU MEAN YOU HAVE TO SHUT DOWN? WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?""


Yep. A DBA, and colleaguen (for lack of better word) in the same Division had no idea that in order to replace an internal component, the machine would require to be off... 


""I'm gonna come back in 5 minutes. You should take these 5 minutes to save your files, shut you're machine down, and possibly consider a career shift.""


5 minutes later, I return, machine's still on, he's on the phone with my Boss.


K. Here's your part. Left it on the desk and walked away. Went back to the office. My boss walks in after a few minutes and grills me on the story. I repeat this to him almost verbatim, and arrive at a baffled dear in headlights look on his face.


Boss- ""Well wheres the part now?""

""I left it with him""

Boss-""But....""


Almost as if a movie was being filmed, my phone rang. Can you guess what story the other end of the line told?


A mystical tale of the DBA that attempted to swap out a card while his machine was on, shorting the motherboard and (as we determined later) polarizing the hard drive. Lost about 2 months of data because he never stored the work on the network share.


I'm gonna miss him.. :)

Corrected misspelling because peer pressure is a thing.

I am just a bit more apt at computers than the average 23 year old. With the shit you guys put up with, I am surprised there is not a saying about you guys a la 'going postal'. But anyways, this is the story of the final battle between a valiant PC and the ID10T that sought to destroy it. If this gets a good response I will post a few prequels. 

The biggest mistake I ever made was giving my grandparents an old XP machine. I can't count the times I've tried to explain how the Windows OS (or any OS for that matter) works, the one way they seems to grasp the most (with the memory of a dog unfortunately) is ""If you are reading a book and pick up another one to reference a piece of information, the first book doesn't just disappear. It is just behind the book you are now looking at."" It must not be a very good analogy because every time I go over there to investigate the claim of ""it's moving so slow!"" there are between 8 and 16 instances of 'E that shall not be named' running at the same time. But I digress, I get the call one day and head over there after getting off work.

As soon as I walk in the door John excitedly pulls his lazy ass up off the couch and starts walking side by side with me towards the computer room, like an agent briefing his partner on the way to gear up for a perilous mission.

""I performed a thorough search of the computer and didn't find any viruses, so I de-frayg-mented (-_- thanks Google) the drive and that didn't fix it either. I think the internet is the problem.""

""So you're telling me all the programs on the computer are running slowly because the internet is slow (living in San Diego they are treated to Cox broadband, which I don't think I've ever heard described as 'slow') John?"" 

""Yeah it has to be.""

So I sit down at the computer desk with him hovering over me. The shitbag you were just introduced to is my forty-something year old drug addict (using the term 'drug addict' really isn't fair to real addicts, he isn't addicted to anything; he just still has the brain of a 14 year old and likes getting high on whatever he can get his hands on) uncle who is temporarily living with my grandparents. He seems to fancy himself a bit of a technical genius, and had apparently went to work 'fixing' my grandparents computer. Bypassing the fact that the entire program bar was full of open windows, he felt the way to fix it was to install 6 anti viruses, 5 pop-up blockers, and 3 malware solutions. Not just install them (and use a pretty bit of my grandparents money buying the useless shit), but set them up so they are all running at the same time. I sat with my head in my hands for a good five minutes staring in quiet awe at his masterpiece. It took me all of thirty seconds to wipe the undeserved, shit eating grin right off his face.

""You guys still only have one user account right?"" I asked my grandma, and she nodded. I asked her what her password was and immediately set up a second account with toddler level permissions, and changed her password. ""John now has his own account with no permissions to install programs or edit any system files. You are under no circumstances to give him your new password or let him on your account OK?"" She nodded again.

""Wait why?"" John gasped in a disheartened tone.

""Because you know way less about computers than they do but are twice as dangerous because you think you know what you're doing. You have created a ton of work that I now have to do, all completely avoidable if you didn't have access to this machine.""

""But if you undo what I did the viruses are going to come back!"" he said, trying his best to retain at least one sliver of his dignity.

""Never in the history of computation have Craigslist and Pier 21 (the only to sites my grandparents ever visit) loaded viruses on a machine, if this computer has ever had any viruses it was from these creepy porn sites you've been visiting; don't you have a laptop?"" I responded with their internet history displayed on the monitor.

""I don't know what you're talking about"" he retorted as he walked out of the room.

I set about removing the plague John had bestowed upon my poor old computer, and installed Teamviewer and Search and Destroy. I explained to my grandma that this one lightweight program was enough to block anything that the parental controls monitoring John's account miss, and that now whenever she has a computer issue to click on the icon in the upper right corner of her desktop and I will be able to help her right away; effectively ending John's reign of terror over the unit.

Ron had quit his job as IT-administrator at my school to work full time in the store again. After the incidents with Frank &amp; Richard and later on with Johan and Marcel they decided to not hire new personnel for a while. They had told Jeremy and me that they would both work full time at the store again to restore to its former glory. Richard, Frank, Johan and Marcel were to blame for everything wrong with it.

They would start working in the store again on saturday morning, while I had my shift in the afternoon. I was afraid of the mess to be found when my shift started but was pleasantly surprised the store looked normal. I checked the cash register; it wasn’t ruined, meaning it had a good amount of coins and paper money.

I checked the back expecting - maybe even wanting - to find a wasteland of computer parts and casings. Nothing. Everything was normal. And it stayed normal. Ron &amp; Don had been successful in making the store less horrible. My guess was that they were too busy keeping the store running and could not focus on ludicrous business plans and other ideas. It was actually kinda nice.

After a few weeks Ron &amp; Don had decided not to work the evenings and weekends anymore and decided to hire someone new. Sales had recovered enough for them to be able to pay for another employee. They had told both Jeremy and me about this during a rather silent - but still infamous - team meeting. Both of us knew the other one was afraid of getting another Marcel or Johan aboard, we looked at each other knowing what would come.

It was silent for another two weeks and we both hoped that Ron &amp; Don were simply having a hard time getting someone new. Something in me did hope that we got someone even worse than Marcel and Johan to push Jeremy to pursue new things. I was pushing him to start looking for other opportunities. I did not wanted to get married to someone that still worked for Ron and Don a few years down the road. He could be anything he wanted, except this.

I was surprised when Jeremy send me a text on friday that the new employee would start next Saturday on a shift with me. I did not want that. why was it always me that had to help get the new employees get started? What kind of troublesome person would it be now? I didn’t want to go to work and delayed going to the store as long as possible that saturday morning.

I had to get to the store at around 8:45 to disable the alarm, get the money from the safe, start the computers and move some of the promotional material outside. I didn’t arrive until around 9:00 and saw a girl waiting for the store. “Early customer” I thought. I said hi to her but didn’t pay to much attention to her as I started opening the store. 

She waited patiently at the cash register till I was done with the basic tasks needed to get the store in working order. “How can I help you” I said to her. “Well I am supposed to start today to work at this store.” She paused for a second “I think you must be Leila, Ron told me about you”

There were only two things I could think after that; “why did I act like that to her?” and even more pressing  “what did Ron tell her about me”.

* * *

The new girl was named Sarah and was she was about my size and posture with only a year difference between the two of us. Her face was full of freckles and hidden half of the time behind bright orange hair.  There was a feel over her of being calm and easy going. Simply said; Sarah was as awesome as me.

Despite the rather rough start on my part we started liking and learning each other more and more during the shift. I started out by explaining how the store worked and the strange customers we tend to get. She simply said “I know and I don’t mind” I started at her “I can handle it”. She seemed strong but she did to my knowledge didn’t have any experience yet. I was afraid that she was overestimating herself.

She had applied for the job to get some more experience on repairing computers and dealing with non computer literate folks. Like me she wanted to have a professional career involving computers, but was hesitant in what she should choose. 

She was a quick learner and before the morning was over had learned most of what there was to learn about the store. She had not dealt with customers yet, but the time had come to release her into the wild. The land of customers. 

It all went rather well for the first few hours and she helped quite a few customers to find what they were looking for and processed a number of returns and repairs. Not being accustomed to the working day Sarah was quite tired by now but she was still working, I let her go early that day.

Sarah and I had been working together for about six weeks and had become good friends. Working in the store was fun, and Ron and Don seemed to have calmed down as well. Working at the store was actually something I looked forward to at times. It was a bit scary to be honest.

* * *

It was a Saturday when Sarah and I worked in the store. I had seen her deal with customers before and she handled the awkward and uncomfortable situations quite well. She had dealt with a man that was a couple years older than us in her second week. He tried to look like a 50s playboy but had failed miserably.  What he did pin down correctly was the blind arrogance that made him believe he was God’s gift to woman. I had seen him before. He had tried his “moves” on me months ago.

I let Sara deal with it to see how she would react. I did stay close to her. I’d rather have anything strange happen under my watch and be able to intervene than at any other point in time.

The man had been browsing through the store for a while before Sarah got around to helping him. While most customers were either angry for not being helped within the second of entering the store or angry with the fact that they were being helped he was acting normal. He started by asking her about notebooks on display and what the specifications were all about.

After a couple of minutes of pretending to ask questions and looking into her bra he started moving in. He started talking smoothly“I don’t care about the numbers on that computers, I only care about yours”, Sarah looked at him, her face turning into disgust “ I like my digits low.” He continued with a smile.

Sarah looked at him and said “Too bad my phone number is 10 digits long then” she continued to look at him seriously and after a while said “get out of the store”. He walked out of the store. I was laughing out loud. I didn’t know whether Sarah misunderstood he was asking for her age, or I misunderstood it. But her answer and seriousness had caught me off guard She did way better than me the first time around. I did not have to watch out for her.

Or so I wished. It went really well working with Sarah and the customers seemed to behave more and more as the weeks went by. Because of everything I was letting my guard down, and though I had told Sarah about everything that had happened in the store, she had witnessed none of it.

It was Saturday evening and we still had about 2 hours on the clock before the store was about to close. We never got many customers around that time, because people have better things to do. I had better things to do and was in the back working on a school assignment that I had postponed for way too long. Sarah was covering for me and was in the store.

She had helped a few customers this evening but it was otherwise silent in the store. The bell rang as a new customer had entered the store. It was a skinny male around his 30s or something. He wore old and torn clothing and a baseball cap. He smelled weird but nothing recognisable for us. Nothing out of the ordinary in this store though. 

He looked around and started walking to the notebooks and typing on the keyboards. Sarah walked over and went to see if she could help him. He was now acting rather strangely toward Sarah and muttering under his breath. From where I was sitting in the back I had a clear view of the store and didn’t trust the situation, my gut feeling was telling me things were not good.

As I stood up to walk to her it happened. In a split second he pushed her to the ground and shouted at top of his lungs “VERGEWALTIGEN”, or rape in English. He had jumped her and was putting his hands down her shirt. She was shouting and resisting as hard as she could.

In my reaction I ran towards her and grabbed the first thing I could get my hands on. I started hitting him as hard as I could on the back of his head and back. I kept on hitting him until he started bleeding. He stood up and tried to lunge at me but I hit him full in the face causing him to fall to the ground again. He now stumbled to the door and slammed it open while running into the darkness.

I immediately turned my attention to Sarah again who was crying on the floor. I grabbed the phone from the counter and went to sit beside her, trying to calm her down as I was calling the police. It will not be until a moment like this that you learn how long minutes can be. 

It wasn’t until the police had arrived that I payed attention to anything else than Sarah. I saw a notebook lying on the floor, or rather what was left of it. The screen was completely torn from the hinges, hanging from one of the cables alone and the keys were scattered all over the floor.

Sarah was being helped by a female police officer and seemed to do better by now. I called Jeremy to come to the store, he was here within minutes. He lived 20 minutes away. Ron went straight to voicemail as did Don. Neither called me back that night.

Sarah was brought home by the police. I was glad the police was there to tell her parents. I didn’t know how to tell her parents what had happened. I stayed by Sarah’s side all night. She didn’t sleep. Neither did I.

The guy who had done this to her turned out to be a drug addict who after a bad trip had been on a rampage trough town going from store to store. He had tried to do the same to another woman on the street. He was arrested two weeks later and sentenced to nine months in prison. 

As for Sarah, she recovered from it in the months after but never returned to the store again. We're still in contact. As for me; that night I was thinking everything over and knew that this wasn’t how things are supposed to be. I would quit that job. I would quit tomorrow.

It's not a very technical story, either, but the user is one that is leagues beyond any other I've encountered in terms of sheer ignorant willpower. And yes, this is a little long, but that's what makes this tale. 

To begin with, I'm in the military. Military users seem to have a unique way of completely disregarding logic and still somehow managing to get the results they want - or at least sufficiently close to it. 

My supervisor, in particular, never ceases to baffle me. Recently, he's taken more notice of the fact that I'm the only remotely computer savvy person in our office and has developed the endearing habit of calling me into his office virtually every time he has to send an email. Now, this is a man who has been doing his job and using the same systems for a decade and a half before before I even enlisted. Yet, now he's become dependent on me as his walking grammar and spell checker. For the record, I have taught him to use the spell check feature many times, and I've seen him use it successfully on his own, so I don't understand the fixation. 

This particular story is from a couple weeks ago. When he yelled for me from across the office I didn't expect anything out of the ordinary, but I still went through my preemptive cool down routine of mentally counting down my steps across the linoleum floor to his office. Theres 10 steps exactly if I pace it right; 15 if I'm particularly begrudging that day. 

This time it wasn't just an email he wanted help with. He had to type up the text for an award, which is a particularly meticulous process, in that grammar and spelling notwithstanding, simply using one phrase instead of another or not meeting the exact length specifications can potentially change what type of award it is (it could downgrade from a medal to a ribbon, or to just a certificate with no actual award device - or vice versa). 

So I sat there, mostly trying to zen myself into forgetting how far behind on my own work this time was putting me, as we trudged through what turned into a 2 1/2 hour two-fingered, hunt-and-peck death march. Even as long as this tale is, keep in mind that I'm only going to be walking you through roughly the last 15-20 minutes, and know that I'm not too proud to accept your pity. 

Back to the award. The text on his template was all uppercase. At random points throughout the process he would press the caps lock and then just hold down the shift key - but not entirely consistently - for the next few words, while streaming every curse word I know (and some he made up) at the computer each time a random lowercase letter appeared. This was entertaining at first, but it was a lot like watching a three-legged puppy try and fail to climb a staircase. I couldn't help but be moved almost to tears. 

After the last sentence or two was finally completed, he decided it was time to spell check. I had been required to stay present for the entire duration for grammar consultation, but spelling had to wait until the end so as to not interrupt his otherwise *elegant* creative process. I dutifully begin reading aloud (as he insists) and pointing out corrections as I go. Even though this was my entire purpose for being at his desk, he still questions my spelling corrections and insists several of the words are already correct. Trying to control the twitching in my eye, I just stare at the little red squiggly underlines below the words on the screen. 

*Oh*, yes, that's right:  Not only am I his personal walking spelling checker - I'm a *redundant* spell checker because Word is doing its job pointing out his mistakes just fine. 

I've learned not to press these little disagreements too hard, though. After all, it's his name on the bottom line when it gets sent off, so it isn't going bother me any if he looks like an idiot to the Colonel who has to approve it. 

Surprisingly, he gave in before I had to decide whether to keep arguing as tactfully as possible or just let it go. He mumbled, ""All right, lemme take a look,"" and abruptly shifted in his chair, almost bracing himself, like the way a nervous child would prepare for the drop as the roller coaster edges past the peak of the first big hill. 

I should have braced myself for the impending adventure as well. I sat in agape amazement as I watched the events unfold before me. 

Bear with me and try to put yourself in his shoes now, and imagine that you are him. 

Let's pretend you have the low-end of marginal intelligence, tempered by almost 20 years of experience. You have the stubbornness of a mule and the curiosity of a kitten. You hate computers because you fear them and their unknowable keyboards, but you have long since resolved yourself to overcome the technological menace and assert yourself - by brute force if necessary. 

And so, you put on your game face, and begin...

&gt;**Step 1:** Highlight the entire template. (None of that Ctrl+A business though. Click and Drag across the whole document.)
&gt;**Step 2:** Change the text Case to all lowercase using the button on the main ribbon. 
&gt;**Step 3:** Hit the Function key and then manually navigate through the menu to Copy. 
&gt;**Step 4:** Open Outlook. 
&gt;**Step 5**: Go back to Word, and manually navigate through the menu to Copy.  Again. (Maybe you forgot about the first time. Or maybe *you just don't trust the nefarious computer to have done it right the first time*.)
&gt;**Step 6:** Open a new email in Outlook and quietly say, *""That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.""* (Just say it. I don't know why.) 
&gt;**Step 7:** Right-Click in the body and 'Paste'.
&gt;**Step 8:** Ignore the red squiggly spell check underlines in the email body. 
&gt;**Step 9:** Click the Spell Check button, but immediately close the spell check dialogue that opens. (Because *screw you*, spell check)
&gt;**Step 10:** Suddenly notice the red squiggly lines and grunt in disapproval. 
&gt;**Step 11:** Manually fix some of the misspelled words by completely deleting them and retyping them,  and Right-Click to autocorrect some of them. (No pattern or direction here - pick them at random. Oh, and ask ePants for help but *ignore everything he says*.)
&gt;**Step 12:** Forget everything you know about Copy and Paste because next you're going to...
&gt;**Step 13:** *Go back to* Word *and manually fix all those same words.* 
&gt;**Step 14:** Close Outlook - not just the new email; close the application entirely. 
&gt;**Step 15:** Curse again. (Just because. Maybe your desktop wallpaper startled you? I don't know.) 
&gt;**Step 16:** Highlight the entire template in Word. 
&gt;**Step 17:** Right-Click. ...And Paste. 

...

Yep. That's right. Nothing else was ever copied. 

You paste over all the corrections with the originally copied spelling mistakes. 

But you don't notice, *and you're still ignoring ePants*. 
...

&gt;**Step 18:** Change the type Case back to all upper case. 
&gt;**Step 19:** Save and Close the document. 
&gt;**Step 20**: Open Outlook again. 
&gt;**Step 21:** Minimize and then Restore the 'Outlook' window. Do that *twice*. (Because it was so fun the first time, I guess)
&gt;**Step 22:** Spend five minutes typing random words into the Search bar to find an email that was the second most recently received email in the inbox and *was already in the preview pane to start with*. 
&gt;**Step 23:** Hit Reply All. (Never mind the fact that the template was sent to a distribution list and only needs to be sent back to the original sender.)
&gt;**Step 24:** Attach the spelling-mistake-riddled Word document via drag-and-drop. 
&gt;**Step 25:** Stare blankly at the screen for approximately 20 seconds while grunting with each exhale.
&gt;**Step 26:** Attach the document to the email again via the Attach button. (Because, well, if *one* is good, *two* is better?) 
&gt;**Step 27:** Type a two-line email and insert a comma after every fourth word. (Because grammar must be ruled with an *iron fist*)
&gt;**Step 28:** Add several more people to the CC line who are in *no way involved*.
&gt;**Step 29:** Hit Send. 
&gt;**Step 30:** Smugly smirk with contentment as you revel in the victory of another slain email, proud of how little advice you took from ePants.

So, I had a brief stint about 2 years ago as an assistant ITC at my old high school. The county bought a couple hundred iPads and quickly learned that iPads work best with Macs. So like the poorly budgeted morons they are, the county went out and bought a couple hundred iMacs. I’m good with macs, I was good with macs in high school, and I got hired to teach the other ITC how to administrate macs and fix most issues.

Anyway, a few months into the year, one of the teachers reported that some his keyboards and mice weren’t working. I went in after school and took a look at his room.

All of the computers were fine.

Keyboards and mice were working fine, so I told him this and let him know that if it happened again, let me know. The next day, he told me that all of the computers weren’t working, I went in after school and took a look.

Every thing was fine, so I came back the next day during class. Sure enough none of the computer’s mice and keyboards were working. I took one of the computers into my office and plugged it in. Still broken. I waited until after school, when the computers started working again, and started testing things on it. All of the USB ports worked, cables weren’t frayed, etc.

Then I noticed that wifi was on. This was odd since I had set it so that you needed administrative rights to turn wifi on. I tried logging in as root (root password never changed I had to change the administrative password every month) and I got back the most confusing error. It said the password was wrong.

I tried it a few more times and asked my boss if he had changed it.

Nope.

So I logged into my account and checked it out. I changed the root password back to the old one and went back to the classroom. Sure enough, the root password was changed on all of them. I changed all of them back and told the teacher about it and told him that that should fix it.

The next day, all of the machines were back to being broken. I told the teacher that I’ll have to send them all in since I’m out of ideas. Just then, a note popped up on the computer I was sitting at. It said “Be in your office at 12:30”.

Since I really wanted to figure out what was going on, and I had lunch that period anyway, I decided that it would be a good idea to be in my office. At exactly 12:35, a student, lets call him Dave, walked into my office, sat down in the chair next to my desk and pulled out his laptop.

I asked him flat out, “Are you the reason why (Teacher)’s computers haven’t been working?”

His response, being quite cocky I might add, “Yup, and I’m going to show you exactly how I did it, two more ways to do it, and how you can fix it.”

At that point, I just stared at him for a few moments, confused as hell. He broke the awkward silence with, “I heard you say that you were going to send the computers in for repair. I didn’t want to cause you that much of a headache and this was getting boring anyway.”

I told him okay. He pulled out his laptop, opened Apple Remote Desktop and showed me how he was disabling the keyboard and mouse. He also showed me quite a few other things you could do with it and I wrote myself a note to ask the school to buy a copy.

The next puzzle is why the root password was changed. I asked him about it and said nothing, stood up, and gestured for me to follow him. He went into (Teacher)’s room and sat down at an iMac. True to his word, he showed me the way he did it and two other ways to do it, all of which could be done in under 90 seconds. (The methods he used are openly available and can be found with a little bit of google, so I’m not going to post them here. If you really want to know, send me a message.)

I was so impressed that he could do this the I bought him lunch in exchange for him telling me everything else he could do and him agreeing not to change the passwords again and not to tell any of the other students about this. Over lunch, I asked him if he’d be okay being an intern with the ITC and me. He said yes, and now he has my job as part time Mac guru for the school.

TL;DR: Defaults are evil, some students are smart, and there are good people left in the world.

1358083079.0,497,self.talesfromtechsupport,16hnky,Really?  It's $5,755,258,121,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/16hnky/really_its_5/,"I have recently left the world of tech support for the new and exciting world of software development.  Something that happened this week reminded me of one of my last support calls.  

I get a call from a very angry DSL customer.  His internet wasn't working and our tech was out to his home and everything tested fine to his NID outside.  To TS further, we needed inside access.  Now, inside issues usually means that it's the problem is something we aren't responsible, but we repair in the name of customer service whenever possible.    The customer was pissed and uncooperative and wasn't ""available"" nor could he get someone to ""be there"" during our work hours for 3 weeks.  Our work hours are from 8 to 8 M-F.

I'm getting his call a few days before his scheduled appointment to ""MAKE SURE WE DID NOT SCREW UP SO THE TECH DOESN'T COME.""  I confirm that indeed he has an active appointment for the day and time range.  Then he starts ranting about how horrible my company is.  So I let him rant.  Somewhere in the middle of the rant, I get the impression something is wrong.  

During his prior call, customer made it clear he doesn't want to pay for his service while it's down.  Now, it's policy to grant credits but after the incident is fixed so we know how much to credit.  Makes sense, right? This isn't good enough for the guy so the tech support person sends this guy over to a consumer specialist.  These people get calls when 1) customers are pissed and 2) customers want to disconnect service.  There job is basically keep the customer.  They will do what it takes to not disconnect the customer's service.  They are experienced employees.  They can handle angry customers and they understand how our services work.  So I assume that CS put the customer's account on ""vacation"" which is pretty normal.  This is the only way to place an account ""on hold"" without disconnecting it.  The cost is like $5 and the CS usually waives any fees associated with placing them on vacation.  The customer then would be credited the $5 when the service is fixed.  No problem, right?

Wrong!  I look at our customer/billing program.  I wanted to see if the customer's account needed to be taken off ""vacation"".  You can't troubleshoot a line that is on vacation, the line has to be active.  Nope - not on vacation.  Yep - the DSL account was permanently disconnected about 3 weeks ago.  

So the only way this happened is (a) the customer demanded that his account be disconnected so he did not have to pay the $5 fee, and (b) the guy was too busy being angry and ranting that he did not listen to the consumer specialist when they explained what that meant.  What it means - the connection is pulled apart and the wire is pulled from the port.  The port is available for other customers.    To reconnect, it takes up to a week.  There is no ""switch"" that can simply be flipped to restore service after a new account is created.   The connection has to be redesigned and rebuilt.   We don't permanent disconnect a DSL connection whenever possible.  It's Friday afternoon.  The appointment is Monday morning.  

So I explain to the guy he no longer has a DSL account and no connection to troubleshoot.  After he rants for another 10 minutes demanding that his service be working on Monday, I cancel his appointment and send him to sales to open a new DSL account.

Tl; dr:  Customer being a jerk and wants inside repair service outside of our work hours gets no service. ",,False,,t5_2sfg5,False,,,True,t3_16hnky,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/16hnky/really_its_5/,

We handled pretty much anything and everything, because as always, our call centers and in-store staff overpromised (and were promptly beaten with the Clue-By-Four I kept in the VW's trunk).

At the time, I was working out of the Galleria area in Houston - for reference, rich as hell, tons of good clients who I loved to work with (and not just because they'd spend money on what needed to be done). This call? It wasn't in that area at all.

It was in south Houston.

Now, for those of you who aren't Houston natives, or even Texas natives, Houston is a... special... city. There is no zoning law; residential and commercial buildings are mixed pell-mell together to create a vast concrete wasteland not entirely unlike a session of SimCity 2000 on hallucinogens. In this case, the target house was down the road - about a mile and a half as the admin flies - from a landfill.

One of my coworkers, the store's other field agent, had had a call to go out there for a service-plan-covered repair. It turned out that the owner had had his power supply go out for some reason, and it wasn't the first time, either. 

So he drove to the site; he went from the nice, comfortable area of the Galleria to the vast pseudo-post-apocalyptic wastelands that are near I-45 and Beltway 8 South. As he turned into the target's neighborhood, he noted that while it was definitely not the best (far from it, indeed), the denizens seemed to be making the best of it; most kept their lawns well-mowed but not manicured, trash was kept orderly, and the area was, in general, fairly quiet.

He drove down the target's street, looking at the numbers painted on the curbs for the house.

His exact words to me later were - and I remember them verbatim to this day - ""it was like the neighborhood had the Smurf theme song going while I was driving through it. And then I got to the house where everything just seemed to darken and light itself was sucked in as if there was no escape. Then I passed it up, and everything was okay again.""

He checked the numbers on the curb, and sure enough, that was the target's house.

He parked a house down, went up to the door, and knocked. No one answered. He did it again, as SOP required, and wept with joy when no one came to the door. The man, normally so stalwart, fled as though all the hounds of hell were at his heels, and entered notes to the effect that ""client didn't answer door, reschedule"" in the scheduling system.

Sure enough, the client called in and rescheduled. I was available, and so I journeyed forth from the ivory towers that constitute the neighborhoods of the Galleria, West University, and Memorial, and went to the land of Mordor - I mean, South Houston.

I pulled up to the client's house, parked my VW, and adjusted my uniform, making sure my newly-acquired badge (a mark of honor among the field agents) was on my left hip as per uniform SOP. I exited the vehicle, badge on belt, and walked past a green Oldsmobile parked on the curb in front of the house. There were four big men in there, smoking something that definitely wasn't tobacco - tobacco doesn't have a harsh, glassy ""I'M GOING TO MELT YOUR SYNAPSES"" smell - and got deathglares when they saw my badge.

It was at this point I started to think that maybe I PROBABLY shouldn't be here.

I cross the toy-and-trash-strewn lawn, passing up a beautiful, well-maintained late-model black Chrysler 300 with a nude nymph hood ornament and a rich Corinthian leather interior. Eventually, I make it to the front door, gaining 300XP from just passing all my rolls to avoid debris, and knock twice loudly.

The foul stench of a thousand unwashed, rot-and-waste-covered Dagobah swamps burst forth from the now-opened portal, similar to a perfectly cast Stinking Cloud (albeit with a burst 3 radius), as what appeared to be an African-American vertically-inclined version of Jabba the Hutt grunted ""You the repairman?"" at me. When I nodded my affirmative, he beckoned, and oozed his way down the hallway, grunting and huffing with each ponderous step, his back-boobs hanging out of his sweat-and-Xenu-knows-what-stained tank top.

I made it through the hallway, dodging empty trash bags the whole way, as well as unwashed laundry and rotting foodstuffs thrown carelessly along the entire path. Eventually, we reached what was once a garage, but had somehow been converted into what only vaguely resembled a bedroom (in the sense that Windows Vista resembles a modern, functioning, properly-designed OS). There was a massive television mounted on the back wall, above a desk where a CRT monitor sat upon its pedestal. There were two boxes sitting next to it, each marked with our service center's logos, and again, I started to feel serious regrets about not calling in sick that day.

I opened the boxes and found a power supply and motherboard. _OH HELL NO,_ I thought to myself. _This is supposed to be a power supply replacement only._

I take the Compaq Presario (black plastic and metal, silver bezels around the corners) out from under the desk, gingerly avoiding the syringes and 9mm ammunition that had been on top of it, and lay it on the chair. I'm squatting at this point; I daren't touch the floor, for the slick layer of fluid on top of it no doubt housed a million eldritch horrors that I wouldn't recover from easily. The desk, too, has 9mm ammunition on it, as well as a pistol (with the clip out, thankfully), and a whole box full of small syringes.

I swap out the power supply quickly and efficiently, touching as little as possible (and mentally resolving to throw my screwdriver set into the crematorium at another client of mine's later) and remove the old one. As luck would have it, I held it with the cabling on the way out, and sure enough, dead fried cockroaches fell out of it.

A normal tech would NOPE NOPE NOPE out of there at that point. I didn't; either because I failed my sanity check there, or I was hellbent on going through hard mode. I wasn't sure which.

I start to disconnect the SATA hard drive to replace the motherboard, and I accidentally tear the plastic end of the connector straight off the mobo. At this point, I'm going ""eww eww eww"" repeatedly, and I'd decided ""screw this, I'm out of here."" I take off the plastic connector from the cable and put it into a second SATA channel on the motherboard, then close up the box (not installing the new motherboard), hook it back up (gingerly using the case to clear away the ammunition and syringes in the desk area for the computer), and press the power button, praying to whatever deities might be listening that the GORRAM THING WILL BOOT WITHOUT ISSUE.

Fate must have had enough schadenfreude for the moment, for the machine booted to XP and the desktop without further problem. I packed up my toolkit, left the parts that weren't used there, and got up to leave, skidding my feet on the slick floor again.

When I'd arrived, I'd noticed a bed near where the garage door would have been, but I didn't really pay it any attention, since it wasn't near the computer. I turned by it on the way out, and I saw two babies on it, not moving at all. I couldn't judge their age; I'm not an expert on childrearing, but they couldn't have been too old. I yelled to the pendulous mass that was in the other room that I was done, and incredibly, he slithered his way back into the room, somehow fitting past the doorframes on the way, and asked if his porn was okay. I told him that the data was intact, and I diplomatically made my way out of there, as he went over to the bed and brushed several large cockroaches off one of the babies.

I cheerfully and calmly make my way out of the house, pass the guys in the green Oldsmobile again (mentally going ""oh please oh please oh please""), get in the VW, drive around the corner, come to a halt, pop the trunk, and POUR AN ENTIRE 2-QUART BOTTLE OF PURELL HAND SANITIZER OVER MYSELF, shuddering the whole time, going ""NOPE NOPE NOPE.""

After that, I call the Houston Police Department and Child Protective Services, and notify them just what was in the converted garage, and suggest that they would probably want to make a trip out there.

Later that evening, I see on the news that it was a crackhouse, and the babies had been removed to the care of Social Services pending trial of King Lardo the Fifth (who was apparently their ""father"").

As for me? I kept going, did more work, and got a LOT more stories out of it, which I'll be posting here, should there be demand for it. I'm no Geminii27, or talesfromtechsupport, but I've got my share of awesomeness, users with an off-the-scale DERP rating, and even sheer unbelievable WTF.

It's a slight rewrite of a reply I posted in a thread about ""instant karma"" some time back.)

I'm an IT consultant, specializing in Microsoft technologies in general and Exchange in particular. About three years ago I bid on but did not get a project to upgrade an Exchange 2003 environment to Exchange 2010. Multiple servers, multiple sites in the area and right up my alley. The firm that won the bid priced it extremely low, about 40% below my price which was on the low end to begin with. Really their bid was totally unrealistic. I've run into this firm a few times over the years and while some of their staff are good generalists none of them know Exchange worth a hoot.

I'd always had a good relationship with the customer, for whom I'd done a few good sized projects for over the years. When their business manager told me they'd gone with someone else and how much they were saving vs. me I was polite about it but I did take the time to email them and tell them the group they went with didn't know Exchange and that it was likely the project would not go well. I copied the company owner, who I'd known for over 10 years. The business manager replied to me and the owner that I was just full of sour grapes. Irritating, but at the end of the day it's their call so I just went on with my life.

About six weeks later, when they were two weeks into implementing the upgrade, things went to hell. The other consulting firm totally augured in. The customer's entire email system stopped working - no mail coming in / going out, no mail flowing between any of the Exchange servers, every Exchange server just an island. I find this out when I get a call late one evening at my home from the owner of the other consulting company begging me to pull them out of the fire (he'd been given my contact info from the customer). I told him no thanks, my unspoken reasoning being that they've probably fucked things up badly and that I had better things to do than clean up another consultant's mess. Add in the fact that he was unwilling/unable to pay me in advance - something I've learned is necessary when dealing with the competition - and I just was not interested.

About an hour after we spoke the owner of the other IT firm is at my front door trying to convince me to help them ""for the sake of our customer"". WTF, suddenly I'm his partner? This is well after dark and the conversation does not go well. He ends up screaming at me, I slam the door and call the cops because I'm tired and afraid that I'll do something stupid if I keep talking to the guy.

Cops show up almost immediately. He starts screaming at them, they arrest him for disorderly conduct and drag him off. So now I have his damn car blocking mine in my driveway and I have to pay to have it towed away. My evening is thoroughly trashed, I'm in a totally foul mood and on top of that Eureka is a repeat. He spends the next 24 hours locked up, about average for getting through the Dallas County jail,

The customer called me the following day and I again declined to fix the mess. By this time I'd decided I didn't want any of that shit on me, period. I have plenty to do and no interest in putting off the work I'm doing for good customers to help out one that was too cheap to do things right to begin with.

The customer ends up getting Microsoft in to fix everything. Doing so cost them about 5 times what I was going to charge, according to the lawsuit they dropped on the other consulting firm. Of course, the other consulting firm promptly closes their doors and files for bankruptcy.

Every now and then we would get old-age pensioners (actually, all sorts of pensioners, but the old age ones were the most impressive) who were quite up to speed on computers, and were generally self-sufficient, however, if they needed computer work done, because we catered to pensioners, we'd charge them about 1/4 of what it'd cost to take their computers to a retail outlet for repairs.

One day an old guy comes in with his computer, which is a HP 1.4ghz Pentium 4, about a year or two old. He had removed the old OS (which I can't remember) and put a pirated copy of Windows XP Pro on it (the RTM volume license version which I'm sure everyone has run). However, when upgrading to SP1, the key was rendered useless, and he was locked out of his computer.

The boss offered to either order him a new copy of Windows XP, or he could buy a copy of Windows 2000 off us for a ridiculous price (we got them free from Microsoft - we had a stack of about 2500 key labels to attach to each computer - Microsoft also audited every computer we sold with 2000 on it, so we had to keep a database) which was against the agreement with Microsoft.

The old guy had come to us for a reason - he was old, broke, and on a pension. He was a very nice, understanding guy, didn't get angry or raise his voice, he just seemed so let down. He didn't offer us a sob story or try and convince us, he just accepted his fate, and said he had a copy of whatever his computer came with at home. However, he asked, could we take the data from his computer, and burn it to a DVD.

I told him I'd do the job, and boss was happy with that. He told me under no circumstance should I fix his pirated copy of XP unless he could produce the original disk or a key. I told him no worries. I take the computer into a backroom, set it up so no one can see the monitor, and boot his computer up with a WinPE live CD.

I then ask him if he's currently struggling with money. He tells me that yes he is, he recently spent a lot of money getting his car fixed because someone pulled a hit and run on it. He told me he was only third party insured, so repairs cost him almost the worth of his car, which was about $2000. I told him I'd get his Windows XP working again, but on the condition that he tell no one, as I would be immediately fired. He agreed.

A year earlier I was attending college for computer networking (which taught me nothing. Biggest waste of time ever), and while I was there, I ran a key-checking program on one of the computers, so I had the government's VLK for that college. I text message my dad to send me the key, and then pretend to back this guys stuff up. A few minutes later I receive the key, put it into XP and activate it. Goes without a hitch, everything boots back up, and is back to working condition.

The old guy is ecstatic, hugs me and says I'm a computer genius (if only he knew the non-complexity of the task I had just performed). I tell him to honour the agreement and not tell anyone what I have done. I hand him a blank disk labelled ""backups"" and send him to the boss. The boss asks if he's happy, and the old guy goes back to acting sad, but thanking the company for backing his stuff up for him. He pays about $25 or so, and is on his way. 

On his way out I hand him my business card and tell him if he has any more problems, just give me a call directly on my mobile, and I'll sort it out for him. He thanked me once again, and was off. Never saw him, or heard from him again, but I felt happy to have helped him out.

Of course, not all pensioners were nice and sane like this guy, but I'll leave those tales for another time.

Addendum: I realise piracy is generally frowned upon, and these days I insist that people buy a copy of Win7 (I do not distribute pirated software, due to a legit copy being so cheap) however, I was 17 or so back then, so being a broke fucker myself, I could understand why people wouldn't shell out $280 (the price for XP pro in Aus 7 years ago) for it. Thankfully MS have more than halved their prices for Windows. Makes talking people into paying for it so much easier.

TL;DR - Old guy dies in our office, and we desperately scramble to hide his body where the police won't find it

One reason I hate car dealers.",592,98,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1hq41k/originally_submitted_as_a_comment_on_another_post/,"Back in 2005 I was working as a car salesman. (yes I hated the job, and to this day I detest car dealers) I'm in the middle of showing a car to a customer and another salesperson comes up and tells me the sales manager needs to see me, and it is important. I'm thinking WTF did I do? Am I in trouble for something?


I get to the sales office and I'm informed that they can't print anything. Seriously? You just pulled me off a potential sale to look at your printers? The way this dealership worked, if another sales person took over from you and closed the deal then they got half the commission and you got half, so this stupid printer was costing me several hundred dollars.


Fine, whatever, the first thing I notice is the printers are turned off, there are actually 2 printers here one for each manager (I guess the guy who set it up didn't know how to network 2 computers to one printer.) I hit the power button and nothing, same on printer number 2. I check the wires on the back, and they are all hooked up with no problem. I follow the power cables to a power strip conveniently placed between the 2 printers. Sitting on top of the power strip is the managers log book, I pick up his book and notice it was sitting on top of the power toggle for the power strip. I flip the the toggle on the strip and both printers begin powering up.


I hand the book back to the manager, and tell him he cost me half a deal because he put his book on the power switch, and from now on tech support calls will be billed at $50 per hour unless he would like to take me off sales and hire me for full time IT support. (At this store sales people were paid on commission only, so I was not getting paid to look at the printer.)  He laughed and walked away.

Occasionally we get a few interesting phone calls from our users here are a few of them:

**WingDings on every Sheet**

We got a phone call that a printer is spitting out extra characters at the top of every page, (imagine wingdings style characters and other extra stuff,) but only on one line. The rest of the document prints out perfectly fine but every page has this same string across the top. Working remotely we have the user restart the printer, same issue, we test a few different documents and they all end up printing out with the same issue. We got someone else to send a print job to the printer, same issue. We thought it was odd since the first computer (win 7) might have had the wrong printer driver installed, but the other one was an XP computer that had been printing to this printer for years. The issue turned out that the entire package of paper purchased from the local office supply store had the characters printed on every page. New package of paper later and the printer is printing fine now.



**The Endless Print Queue**

Just got a phone call from a customer, their printer was acting up last night, printing the same job over and over, this is one of these Dot Matrix printers with all the paper in a large box so you don't have to refill the printer every so often... Well he it was closing time so instead of turning off the printer and leaving, he left the printer on, and left it printing. We get a phone call this morning asking how to fix the problem (we can hear this printer whirring away printing happily in the background) and our receptionist asked whether or not he turned off the printer when this happened last night. He said ""I did, but then it kept on going when I turned it back on."" Luckily for him/the paper supply the printer jammed at some time in the night and stopped printing until he fixed the jam and called us... So we clear the printer queue and clear out the items and tadaa, the printer stops. Hopefully the next time he will leave the printer off overnight instead.

**Frozen Laptop**

One of our customers fixes trucks, and as such have large open garages that are open late into the night for late night truckers looking for a repair. Anyway, these garages can be cold during the winter, well this story takes place during one of these winters. we got a phone call that one of the computers (a Toughbook even) that had been left in the garage overnight (instead of the nice heated office) had frozen and would not boot. We asked over the phone if anything happens when they press any buttons, nothing happens, so we think its probably a dead battery or faulty motherboard. We do some more troubleshooting and quickly find out that the laptop had not frozen on a process, it had frozen in the garage, the keyboard was stiff and would not move and the computer would not boot. We told them to leave it in the office for a few hours and let it thaw and see if it boots after that. no dice with that, they were too impatient. A few minutes later we get a phone call saying they need a replacement laptop. We get them to send the old one down so we can transfer data from the hard drive to the new laptop, Well it turns out they took a heat gun they had used on the trucks in for Maintenance and melted the keyboard keys together, I guess they had the setting up too high, we got the laptop in the office but the chassis was so warped from the damage that it would not work to just replace the keyboard. We ordered a new Toughbook for them and advised against using direct heat to fix any future frozen laptop whether it be frozen software or otherwise...

It wasn't a bad gig, my colleagues were as jaded about the job as I was and we all hated Management. Par for the course, I suppose.

One day while working the phones, I got a call from a user who was charged a rather large phone bill. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of answering the phone (didn't check Caller ID, rookie mistake) and proceeded to get an earful from them asking why her bill is so expensive. I let her rant, purely because if I interrupted, I'd have to listen again. Before I get into it, I worked for a Government agency who had a relationship with a large telco and supplied devices through us. We then onsold those, meaning we had to deal with the occasional bill issue.

Once she finished, I asked her to send me a copy of the bill, while she was on the phone, so I could look at it. Once I received it, I checked her bill: **$1850**.

Once I picked my jaw up off the desk, I went through the bill to see where it went wrong. There was the standard $49 cap, $10 for the phone, $10 for the data plan and then the big one: $1781 worth of data. It was for approximately 118MB. International Data Usage was charged at $15/MB. So, I had to call her back.

**Me:** Hi, this is AlmostBOFH, I'm calling you back regarding your phone bill.

**User:** /screams I AM NOT PAYING $1850. I WAS NOT AWARE OF THE CHARGES - I SPOKE TO YOU AND YOU SAID YOU'D EMAIL THEM TO ME SO I KNEW AND I NEVER GOT THE EMAIL!!!

**Me:** You didn't speak to me, however you did speak to Herp and they did in fact email you the charges and how we explicitly told you to not use data while roaming internationally. We sent you the email. We even disabled 3G Data Roaming so you could not do it. You obviously turned it back on.

**User:** Are you accusing me of lying??

**Me:** Pretty much. I have the email, I have the information we sent you, I'm looking at the job. And oh look, your manager was CC'd on the email we sent you.

After this, the line went quiet. Had I tamed the beast???

**User:** HOW DARE YOU ACCUSE ME OF LYING!!!!

**Me:** Please hold while I conference in your manager.

So I conference called in her manager and explained the situation. The manager had the email and went into bat for IT before the user went on another tirade.

**Manager:** I have the email here, Derp. You were notified of the charges and you were told to not activate Data Roaming. You weren't told how to reactivate it, so you obviously went out of your way to enable it. You will be paying this bill. I will, however, see whether we can charge some of it to our cost centre as this was work related. AlmostBOFH, thankyou for your help on this.

And that was the last I ever heard from her. I checked a week later, her account was disabled, her mobile phone returned and as far as I know, the bill not paid. I don't know whether she was placed on photocopying duties, but suffice to say, IT 1, User 0.

Each site had all their own equipment, staff, server, etc.  The larger sites would have a part time staff member or a tech on payroll that was given 10-15 hours a month in order to take care of any issues they had.  For the small and medium sites, however, we'd just take the ""techiest"" person on staff and dub them the site tech.  It went about as well as you'd expect, but it was better than nothing.

There was one ""tech"" though, that always made our days worse.  He was a dedicated techs and thought he knew way more than he actually did, which is fairly common.  I'd much rather work with a secretary who says they've never seen a router before than someone who has every cert under the sun on their email signature, but can't use that knowledge in the real world.

Anyway, I digress...I call this guy up and say ""Derp--the battery backup feeding the rack in your server room sent me an email this morning and is reporting bad batteries.  I've ordered replacements at BatteryMart and gave them your name.  Pick the batteries up when you can, print out the instructions I sent you (complete with pictures for each step), and change the batteries out before business hours.""  

""No problem, inebriates!""

_I'll take a quick second and say that of my skills, documentation is the one that I take the most pride in.  I actually enjoy writing up documentation and put a great deal of time into it.  Knowing the audience is important in proper documentation...if the audience isn't technical or has a history of being dummies, then I'd make sure to spell out every single detail and step.  This is what I did in this case_

The next day I get in and have a blatantly dickish message from him.  ""inebriates, you ordered the wrong batteries for our battery backup!  They didn't even fit in the slot.  I wasted a whole morning trying to work through your mistake!""

Crap.  Did I have something documented wrong? 

I call him up, confirm that their model was the model I thought it was and start troubleshooting.  So there's two batteries right?  And you put them together just like the instructions said?  Does it look like this?  

And I send him this picture.

Derp says, ""Yeah, it looks kind of like that...but the ones you bought are wider and not as long.""

I have no idea what he's getting at, so I ask him to take a picture and send it to me.  The picture he sends me has the batteries together just like I had in my instructions...but he had been trying to force them in the wrong way.  Kind of like if you were trying to put a DVD in your computer vertically instead of horizontally...

I say, ""Turn the batteries 90 degrees and give it another shot.""

The language was really very basic. It could read characters displayed on the 80x24 mainframe screen, compare strings, set and get cursor position, increment and decrement numeric variables, stuff the keyboard buffer, and that was about it.

I started playing around with it a little, and built a couple of test tools: a psuedo-CALL function which enabled me to run existing official scripts and then return to the core code, a game of Arkanoid (which used a blank mainframe screen to draw and erase on), an automatic bank-check-details assessment program, little things like that.

One of my tasks was to assist the audit team by extracting local customer records from a list randomly generated at HQ. Previously, they'd run an official script each day which just requested ten records or so out of the mainframe, go pull those files (paper!) out of the archives, and spend all day driving from address A to address B to address C, as the office covered a semi-rural area on the edge of the city. The field agents got about ten minutes for lunch and were lucky to get three or four audits done each day. Being ""the computer guy"", I was put in charge of running the script and handing out the customer names and addresses.

 

After one look, I realised that this was a really bloody stupid way to go about things. I started running the script once a week instead, asking for five times the normal number of customer references. Then I wrote a program which would read the generated list off the screen, pull up each of the records in turn, determine the customer's postcode, sort the records by that postcode, and print off each name and address. I'd then hand everyone in postcode A to the first field agent, everyone in postcode B to the second field agent, and so on.

Result: Agents now had an hour for lunch and were successfully each auditing up to ten customers a day because they were driving a couple of blocks instead of twenty miles between stops. The team instantly shot from the bottom of the state rankings to the top. Everyone was a HELL of a lot less grumpy. And all because I was the first person to actually stop and *think* about the job they were doing.

And yeah, sorting by postcode may have been incredibly crude compared to attempting a limited traveling-salesman brute-force solution with precise addresses, but it probably let the agents jump from around 30% efficiency to around 90%. Near enough, as it turned out, really was good enough.

 

(Then there was [the mainframe script I built which gave my manager Fridays off](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/qub6v/how_i_got_fridays_off_for_my_manager/). But that's another story.)

It was summer vacation by now and I was happy to be able to work some more so I could save for my 2 week trip abroad in October. I was scheduled to work 4 or 5 shifts this week when Don called me into his office.

Don’s office wasn’t like the shop, it was worse. The walls were plastered with corny artwork, a lot of promotional posters and a number of diplomas. I did not care to read the credentials back then, but they were probably from online classes. His desk was one of the tables that had disappeared from the store.

“You know that Ron works as a system administrator at your school right?” Yes Don, I do. “Well the school is getting new systems this summer and I need you to help Ron with setting up the systems”. I did not know whether this was a good or bad thing. “So starting tomorrow you’ll be at your school helping Ron.” I did not know what to expect from this. Being locked up in an empty building with Ron wasn’t exactly on my bucket list. But it did not matter; I was the chosen one.

The next day I reported for duty at the entrance of my school. 9:00, nobody there. Don did say 9, didn’t he? It wasn’t until 9:30 that Ron came driving up to the entrance in an old blue van. Ron saw me sitting bored on the entrance stairs and said with a smile “Good, you are here, we can start unloading the new computers from the van.” 

He used the term new in the most extended sense of the word. The computers were at least 3 years old and most of them had visible damage. There were at least 16 different brands and types. At least they were better than the computers they had now.

We moved the computers into the main hall, and after the 406th computer being put down, I asked Ron, “What now?” Ron looked at me with wide eyes, “Now we eat!” It wasn’t even 11:30. He took out a rather large container and walked to the kitchen to put it in the microwave. Ron was the type of person that lived by the motto of “Let’s eat fast so we can eat again!”.

Though I knew better I asked what it was. He looked seriously at me and said “Its my Mystery Stew of course , you want some?” I did not. While he was munching down the mystery stew, I asked another question I did not want to know the answer to. “What is in the mystery stew?” I asked. He fortunately did not speak with his mouth full, “It’s got 20 secret ingredients”. I was glad he did not tell me what was in it; I’m not sure I could have stomached that.

After he was done eating his goo, we went to the server room. The school is a big old building with many classrooms and stairs. The building was in poor state but still deemed safe enough to house thousands of kids for hours each day. After climbing 4 flights of stairs, we finally reached the server room. Ron was out of breath. I have no idea how he managed this on a weekly basis without dying halfway up the stairs.

The office was a mess, even more so than the store and backroom. It was noisy from the servers that were running in this office: 6 of them in total in a poorly ventilated 19 inch rack. He had put in a few normal cooling fans on the servers and one on himself.

He looked through stacks of papers and old food containers and finally pulled out his plan for replacing 250 computers. I was to switch out all of the computers while he prepared the servers and created an image to install. Great; let a 16-year-old girl do all the heavy lifting. As an extra bonus, I had to tape an information form on each computer detailing where it had come from, what the name was and the basic hardware configuration .

He tossed me a ring of keys. They were master keys for each door in the building. He just gave me a free pass in an empty school. 

* * *

I started with the ground floor. First classroom; 8 computers to be switched. Alright, no problem. Second classroom; 20 PCs. No problem either! I switched the first computer out when I realized which classroom this was.



 **Classroom 1-C : Detention.**



Whenever somebody was send out of class or did something else that warranted a punishment we were sent directly to detention. I’d been there a couple of times myself.

The man who ran detention was in his late forties and not sociable. He would scream obscenities and threaten anyone with more detention that disturbed the peace. The process for detention was simple: you came in the room, signed your name, and spent the next hour or more there to work on pre-defined assignments or homework. He was always typing on his computer; nobody was ever allowed to even look at the screen. Everybody hated him.

Ron had given me an administrator account to make it easy to gain access to the computers. I booted the computer of the detention devil and logged in. Quickly I found a folder on the C-Drive which contained hundreds of word documents. I opened a few and quickly realized these were stories, long and short about all kinds of things. There were stories about alternate Star Wars universes, about all kinds of superheroes, about him being a slave master in the early 17th century and one about him having sex with a student. 

I knew the student he had written about, it was obvious to me. I did not believe it to be true because the last boy that accidentally touched her on her shoulder was expelled for 3 weeks because of sexual harassment.She considered herself the virgin Mary. If Mr. Detention as much as touched her he would have been publicly burned on the stake.

I was appalled by his writing, all of it, but did not want to ruin his life publishing any of it. He had not done anything wrong to be honest. He was a non likable person, sure, but I never would suspect him of actually living out his fan fiction. The student he wrote about was a horrible person herself. She did not deserve this kind of attention. She would wallow in it, destroying this man’s life for some crazed written fantasy. I copied the files to my usb memory key to hold on to, just in case. I shrugged it off and went on and continued with the rest of the classroom. 

A couple of classrooms down I came to 1-K. Just two computers to switch. It was the the classroom of my former math teacher. He was nice and considerate and back when I was 14 he had helped me out a great deal. I still regard him as one of the best teachers I ever had. He was, however, openly gay, in a school full of hormone raged underdeveloped teenagers. 

Once all the boys went into his classroom in only their boxer shorts. He could laugh about it and just pretended that nothing was out of the ordinary. This did garner him a lot of respect. He however was brought down to tears by two boys just before the summer vacation. His partner had died just a few months before from cancer and they had said some terrible things about this. They were suspended for 2 weeks but back in just a few days. Their parents were proud of them, devout god-fearing and gay-hating christians, and forced them both back into school early.

I felt sorry for my teacher and decided to make him feel welcome again. I colored the chalkboard in the rainbow colors and wrote a big welcome back message in the middle. I left his PC with a note attached; “I know our computers are pretty bad, but I gave you the best one I could find.”
* * *

Afterwards I still felt like I had not done enough for this teacher. The boys needed punishment. Capital punishment. I hated them so much for doing this to the teacher, my favorite teacher. I swung by work the next day, asking Frank &amp; Richard to find me the most depraved porn in existence. They were shocked by my request and Jeremy was just terrified. “What has this place done with her,” was all that I could read in the look he gave me. I told them what I wanted to do. They were in. 

A few weeks after school had started the boys were at it again, this time pushing other teachers to the edge of tears. It was time. I swung by the store the next day and picked up the hard drive. I still had the keys from Ron because he kept me on for 2-3 hours a week repairing some of the PCs that had problems. I went into his office. Great, he was not in! I looked up the students’ accounts and loaded their personal shares with as many videos as possible. Richard and Frank had even added e-books about devil worshipping. I threw them in for good measure.

I posted an anonymous note to the principal that the two boys had porn on their accounts and waited. The wait wasn’t very long. The very next day, everybody saw the boys’ walk of shame down the halls with their parents behind them. The fathers were raging and the mothers were holding in their tears.

Besides the fact that she thinks that Caps Lock is ""Cruise 
Control for Cool"", my colleagues and I had as much clue about what this meant as you, the reader, probably do now. It didn't get better. We tried telling her to explain her settings to us, to get a screenshot of the error, etc. We also advised her, upon finding that she uses Eudora, that she should probably try to use something newer. This was her response:

In short, she was a frustrating woman, obstinate and irresponsible. Many emails later, no progress was being made. Ugh. Well, at the very least, she was producing interesting emails and sending them to us:


&gt; I am going on three trips in 8 days---back to back---will be 
&gt;gone from Aug 1 - 17 with only  1 1/2 days home.  I DO NOT HAVE &gt;TIME TO

&gt;
&gt;YOU SEEM TO FORGET THAT MY E-MAIL STILL WORKS FINE WHEN IT &gt;WORKS.  WHICH 
&gt;TELLS ME I HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG.


One of my favorite parts about this email is her indignation with being told that her name was unavailable for use with gmail, and so she had to clear that wasted, terrible moment from her mind. 

The other part that was greatly amusing was ""YOU SEEM TO FORGET THAT MY E-MAIL STILL WORKS FINE WHEN IT WORKS."" I don't even know what to say about that, I'm just laughing at how loudly she seemed to emphasize this tautology.

Another great part is that she tends to include things she has to do in her day, and so we now know more about her laundry schedule than we do her computer issues.



Another email from later on:

&gt;MY Boyfriend came over and he was here when I got my internet &gt;back 
&gt;tonight.  He SAW how my e-mail does not work, then works again.  &gt;He does

I feel quite sorry for the boyfriend, if he does indeed exist, and very unfortunately for him, I can't say much about what he does know if he ""KNOWS EVEN MORE THAM ME"". 




So, after this very frustrating, albeit amusing, string of emails, I decided to look up past emails from her, and I found a bevy of emails with subject lines including ""[our company name] HELP!!!!!!!!"", ""I understand"", ""STUMPED"", ""File Zilla-trying to edit!!!!!!!"", and also featuring: ""GETTING MY E-MAIL ADDRESS REENTERED SO I CAN GET MY EMAIL"", ""RETELLING WHAT PASSWORD IS WANTED"", and ""WHERE is my mail?"".

[One of my favorite stories about getting it done.],570,85,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1ar5hy/when_ceos_collide_one_of_my_favorite_stories/,"This isn't strictly tech support, but I though y'all would appreciate it, and like I said, it is one of my favorite stories.

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

I worked for a Telcom Giant (henceforth TelecomGiant#1) that was selling IT outsourcing.  We would install a network onto multiple sites, then monitor that network, and if anything network-wide needed attention, you'd call us and we'd take care of it for you.  Basically for one large lump sum every month you no longer needed an IT department.

I was a Project Manager working in implementation.  That's the part where we rip out all your old networking gear and replace it with new sparkly gear that we manage remotely.  My job was to coordinate among the MANY stakeholders to make sure everything got done.  Among the parties I was dealing with were the *LEC* (local exchange carrier, a telecom company with monopolistic rights in the region they operate in; they install the circuit (""pipe"")), the *FOTS* (feet on the street technician; that's the guy who actually shows up on site and plugs in the cables and reads the error messages), and the *engineers* (these were the CCNA and CCIE guys in my building that designed the networks and told the FOTS what to do).

OK, enough background!  This particular project was for an international computer mega-corporation (henceforth known as CMC for computer mega corp).  Most of the sites were offices and labs, but one site was the personal home of the CEO of CMC.  Through the luck of the draw I was responsible for getting the network installed at the home of one of the most powerful CEOs in the world (you've heard of this guy).  So everything was set up: the LEC is scheduled to install the circuit on such-and-such day, the FOTS will be on call to plug everything in the same day, and our engineers are ready to troubleshoot.

Well it turns out that the wife of the CMC CEO wasn't going to be home until 3pm that day.  And she had to leave at 4pm for some charity event. She had some rare prize-wining tulips in her flowerbeds and she wanted to be there to make sure her flowerbeds weren't ripped up.  So CMC CEO has his people call our people and word comes down to me that the circuit has to be installed between 3 and 4 that afternoon.

Sure thing!  I call up the customer rep at the LEC and tell him, and he says ""No go.  We can guarantee an 8 hour window, but we cannot schedule a set time for anyone.""

Faaak.

Well, the usual procedure for getting shit done was escalation.  So I ask to talk to the rep's boss.  ""We can guarantee what day it will be installed, but not a scheduled time, sorry.""

If the LEC didn't show up between 3 and 4 the install was going to be refused, and then we'd have to start the order over, likely resulting in a 60 day delay.  Now, a two month delay from a vendor (us) on a multi-million dollar contract is likely to piss off Mr. CEO.  And when CEOs get pissed, off contracts get torn up and people get fired.  This is bad news.

So I kick this up to my boss, and he instantly decided its above his pay grade, and kicks it up to our VP.  So our VP calls up the rep's boss and applies the executive pressure!  But he just kicks it up to his VP who pushes back just as hard.  ""We can guarantee an 8 hour window, THAT IS ALL.""

This thing snowballs and the CEO of my company, TelecomGiant#1, sets up a call with the CEO of the LEC, TelecomGiant#2 to get this scheduled.  If you've spent any time watching CNBC I can assure you you've seen both these guys.

But the CEO of TelecomGiant#2 sticks to his guns!  ""Look, I'm not going to BS you.  We could do it at 3:00.  But our SLA specifies an 8 hour window for a reason, and if I made an exception for you, I'd have to make an exception for everyone.  Cats and dogs lying down together.  Anarchy.  Sorry, can't do it.""

Many meetings are had!  Basically we go forward with the 8-hour window and pray they show up between 3 and 4.  If they do, all is well with the world.  If they don't, we start collecting a paper trail of how its not out fault, how TelecomGiant#2 fucked us, and hopefully the blowback from CMC CEO won't land on us full force.

Well this sucks!

So I go to our engineers and ask to see the reports of any install done within a 50 mile radius of CMC CEO's house.  I go through them and notice that the majority are installed by one particular tech from the LEC, Joe.  One of the sites was a particularly nasty install and needed a lot of support before everything was OK.  And buried in the notes of that ticket was Joe's personal cellphone number.

What do we know about Joe?  Joe is a union guy who drives around in his truck all day laying cable for unappreciative sods.  There's probably no love lost between Joe and ""management"".  So I ring up Joe.

TOK: ""Hey Joe, this is TOK and I'm trying to get a T1 in stalled in whatchamacallit town.""

Joe: ""Ay-up.""

TOK: Do you get the tickets ahead of time or do they give them to you each morning?

Joe: Nah we get 'em ahead of time.

TOK: So this Friday you've got a T1 at 123 Anywhere St, right?

Joe: Yeah, I do.

TOK:  OK look.  I need a favor man.  The customer wants it installed at exactly 3pm but TelecomGiant#2 doesn't schedule installs.  My boss is breathing down my neck on this one.  If there's any possible way you could show up there at 3pm it would be a HUGE favor to me.  I'm really getting a lot of heat on this man.

Joe:  Ahhhh. Yeah.  No problem man.

TOK: Oh wow!  I would appreciate that so much!  If you can do that it would mean so much to me!

Joe:  Yeah.  No problem man.  I'll be there at 3.

So on the big day everyone is on the edge of their seats, ready for the fireworks when the install at the CEO's home gets buggered up.  But Joe shows up exactly at 3, Mr. CEO's wife shows him the flowers that can't be dug up, and everything goes smoothly.  Upper management at TelecomGiant#1 and TelecomGiant#2 think its just some freaky coincidence that it went off without a hitch.  And life moves on.

TL;DR Do not substitute vinegar for honey in your cookie recipe.  The cookies will suck.

IT support for a bank, we're a 3rd party vendor, poop always rolls downhill, and we're at the bottom of the hill.  Oh, and this is a long one.

About our banking software: it has two parts.  A UNIX mainframe with terminal emulators on each PC, a web based GUI which is easy to use, and has some functions that UNIX doesn't have.  The GUI feeds info into UNIX, and UNIX actually runs the transactions.   Each branch also has a unique number for lots of reasons.  However, not each branch number refers to an actual physical location.  We have ""shadow branches"" that are set up so employees can still do banking transactions, even if they aren't an actual branch.  This comes into play later.

Second bit of background info: each physical branch has a check printer.  They are named in such a way as to indicate which branch they are at i.e. CHKPRT12345.  When a branch opens, a print queue is created in 3 places.  There's one on the windows print server, one in UNIX, and one in GUI.  Our company has no access to the GUI or UNIX servers, we only have access to the windows print servers. The bank's internal IT department has to create the UNIX and GUI queues.  Some of you can probably guess what's coming.

A few months ago, a regional HQ in a city about 3 hours away was moving.  Along with the move, a ""shadow branch"" is upgraded to a full service branch. Meetings are had, plans are made, dates are decided on.  At this point, the bank's project manager, let's call her Retail Moron, or RM, has to submit assorted requests to various departments.  One request is to have the check printer be set up in UNIX and GUI because it's an upgrade from a shadow branch to the real thing. Any predictions about what happened yet?

Well, the big day rolls around, me and my boss spend all day Friday tagging and unhooking about 75 machines.  Movers then haul the stuff to the new building.  We spend Saturday hooking it all up and installing all the new equipment in the about-to-open new branch.  This included submitting the info for our new check printer; our server guys set up the windows queue like they're supposed to, and successfully print a test page. We left the building at 6 pm on Saturday, with me staying through to Monday to do day-1 support.

Surprisingly, there were no day-one issues except one lost mouse and one broken docking station.  I take care of those few things and I'm ready to leave, when the branch manager (BM) comes up to me.

BM: We can't print checks!
Me: OK, let me take a look.

Printer is pulling paper, NIC is working, the server team can print test pages.

Me: OK, whatever problem you're having is with UNIX or GUI.  The printer is working fine, but some part of the banking software isn't seeing it.  You'll have to call the help desk; they can send a ticket to these teams.
Her: OK

A week passes, then I get an e-mail from RM.  My boss has been CC'd, as well as his boss, the contract manager, BM, and our help desk supervisor. ""Branch 12345 (the one that was just upgraded) isn't able to print checks and no action has been taken.  This needs to be resolved immediately!""

I go through our ticket history and find out the user never called the help desk.  BM went straight to RM and started whining.  Because it's high priority, I have to load up a spare check printer and head out at 5am the next morning so that I can be at this branch at 8 am.

I show up, and the printer is in the same state it was in before.  The NIC is working, it pulls paper, and test pages from the server will print.  Our remote support team and myself know that it's a UNIX or GUI issue at this point.  I e-mail a person from each team explaining what's going on.  They ignored us almost all day, we put read receipts on our messages, and they weren't even looked at for 5 hours.  They don't want to mess with anything unless I replace the printer.  I replace the printer, our server team sets up the print queue on the server.  After all this, I'm back to where I started, with the new printer behaving just like the old one.  At this point, it's 6 pm, and all the UNIX and GUI support teams are gone.  I haul my exhausted self back to my home office.

Our teams spends the next three days trying to get a response from the UNIX and GUI programmers.  We're forwarding e-mail from retail moron to the programmers, but they just ignore us with the bravado of people who have too much job security.  On the third day, the GUI team coughs up some news.  The printer doesn't exist in GUI.  They'll create it, but it won't go live until their maintenance window, which is overnight between Wednesday and Thursday every other week. This is in 8 days. They're actually apologetic about the whole thing, but maintenance is maintenance and can't be rescheduled.

Throughout this whole ordeal, Retail Moron is getting more and more shrill and threatening. She's fairly new to the job, and has a HUGE chip on her shoulder because there was a lot of competition for her position when it opened up. Accusations of incompetence are being thrown around, mostly directed at our company.  We're not giving this enough attention, even though the bank internal IT is what's holding things up.

First thing Thursday morning after the maintenance window, I call the branch.  Still no check printing.  It has to be UNIX at this point. But no, they're forcing us to replace the printer AGAIN.  I then drag my extremely grumpy self back to the branch, replace the printer again, and get a repeat of the previous events.  The printer is physically sound, it's on the network, the windows print queue is working, and it exists in GUI.  At this point, we're all screaming at UNIX to check the programming.  Finally, we get a break.  The reason they won't do anything is because they site is still listed as a shadow branch.  Because of assorted regulations and policies, they need an official request before they can upgrade it from ""shadow branch"" to full-service. They also can't create the UNIX queue until the upgrade happens.

At this point, RM loses her head.    She starts accusing people of trying to make her look bad and get her fired.  Heads are going to roll.  If she gets her way, none of us will even be able to get a job involving any electronic device, since we are that incompetent (I'm paraphrasing from various e-mail and comments made during meetings)

We start going through project logs and find out that Retail Moron never requested anything to do with the check printer.  The submission form keeps a log of visits.  She never once even opened the website to submit the form.  The b**** wind went out of her sails in an instant.  She couldn't berate or lie her way out of a situation she had created. At this point, since the branch has been without check printing capabilities for over a month, the request is rushed, the UNIX group has to do an immediate programming change, execute their testing immediately, and push the changes into production as soon as testing is complete. All this mean a fair bit of overtime for some highly-paid UNIX guys.

We and the UNIX team billed Retail Moron's department for nearly 200 hours of project work, as well as travel expenses.  Last we heard, she was fired and is working as an entry-level teller at another bank.

When I took the job I had six years of experience in the education field. I thought ""Education... healthcare... It's all pretty much the same thing from an IT perspective.""

How very wrong I was.

I am constantly harassed for stupid problems in the middle of the night, namely password resets. Both the Hospital and LTCU have 24 hour staffing so when the nurses need to chart and they can't remember their password they call me. This happens at least twice a week, more so on the weekends (when they have agency nurses that don't work near as often as normal employees).

One particular incident a nurse called me 3 times in one night between 3:00-4:00am because she locked out her account, forgot her password once, and then forgot the new one that she just chose. After the third call I simply turned off my phone. I was tired of the shit and decided I'd deal with it the next day.

I wake up the next day with 4 voice mail messages from the same nurse sighing sarcastically into the phone.

* 4:18am
* 4:22am
* 5:36am
* 6:04am

The messages weren't constructive even though I knew who it was so I didn't do anything about it until she sent me an email the next day when I once again unlocked/reset her account and notified her.

------

Flash forward 2 weeks. Our HR manager gives me a copy of a sheet of paper that is this nurse issuing a formal complaint about my behavior. To summarize she states that I ""never answer the phone, never return calls, never check messages and never help."" she is very upset because she ""needs to do [her] job"" and she can't because I refuse to help her access the system.

I'm pretty fucking livid.

I go to our DON (Director of Nursing) and she recognizes the sheet of paper as I walk into the room and says ""I wondered when that would get back to you."" (our DON is awesome). Basically we have a short discussion to clarify if she knows what my job description entails, mostly the fact that:

1) I am never on call and I am always on call. I carry a work cell phone to respond to emergencies but I am not specifically 'on call'. IT is the only department that is not paid on-call pay to answer the phone and help people after hours.

2) I am not always by a computer nor am I always available to help at every conceivable moment. I have a life, I sometimes don't hear the phone ring, and even if I answer I may not be able to help depending on what is going on. I am not always going to be there even though I try to be.

3) 'Forgot a password"" is not an emergency which warrants waking me up multiple times at 3:00am after I've already had an 8-10 hour work day. Nurses remembering their passwords and knowing how to access our system without locking themselves out is part of their job. It is well withing my ability to require them to submit password resets in writing signed by their supervisor for HIPAA security reasons to make everyone's life a living hell. Nurses need to take personal responsibility to utilize the systems appropriately.

Through the whole conversation the DON completely agreed with me. She wasn't aware they had become as much of a nuisance as they had, and apologized that they were this much trouble. She assured me she would have a meeting with all of them and discuss their responsibilities and explain when it is and is not okay to call IT in the middle of the night. I was happy with the decision and sent an email to HR to let them know that we had come to a mutual decision about how to handle the complaint in case something escalated further.

Two weeks have passed and I haven't received a single late night password reset call. I would have loved to be a fly on the wall in the meeting to see the DON put the fear of god in her employees. Sometimes it's nice to have someone on your side, and I for one am glad to get a few good nights of sleep in a row without that sickening stomach turn I get everytime I awake to that phone ringing.

C : Sure!

He hangs up and I start working on other things as I await his email.  5 minutes later...

C : hey did you get my email?

M : no I have not.  Did you send it with the reply button or did you type my name out?

C : blast!  I don't have time for this now.  I have a meeting soon; can I call you back later?

So we hang up and I go about my day.

Fast forward to this morning.  I have a letter sitting on my desk with no return address.  Yup.  It's a printout of the email he tried to send.

When you call us to have your computer moved, be sure to leave it buried under half a ton of postcards, baby pictures, stuffed animals, dried flowers, bowling trophies and children's art. We don't have a life, and we find it deeply moving to catch a fleeting glimpse of yours. 

2. Don't write anything down. Ever. We can play back the error messages from here. 

3. When an I.T. person says he's coming right over, go for coffee. That way you won't be there when we need your password. It's nothing for us to remember 300 screen saver passwords. 

4. When you call the help desk, state what you want, not what's keeping you from getting it. We don't need to know that you can't get into your mail because your computer won't power on at all. 

6. When I.T. support sends you an E-Mail with high importance, delete it at once. We're just testing. 

7. When an I.T. person is eating lunch at his desk, walk right in and spill your guts right out. We exist only to serve. 

8. Send urgent email all in uppercase. The mail server picks it up and flags it as a rush delivery. 

9. When the photocopier doesn't work, call computer support. There's electronics in it. 

10. When you're getting a NO DIAL TONE message at home, call computer support. We can fix your telephone line from here. 

11. When you have a dozen old computer screens to get rid of, call computer support. We're collectors. 

12. When something's wrong with your home PC, dump it on an I.T. person's chair with no name, no phone number and no description of the problem. We love a puzzle. 

13. When an I.T. person tells you that computer screens don't have cartridges in them, argue. We love a good argument. 

14. When an I.T. person tells you that he'll be there shortly, reply in a scathing tone of voice : ""And just how many weeks do you mean by shortly?"". That motivates us. 

15. When the printer won't print, re-send the job at least 20 times. Print jobs frequently get sucked into black holes. 

16. When the printer still won't print after 20 tries, send the job to all 68 printers in the company. One of them is bound to work. 

17. Don't learn the proper name for anything technical. We know exactly what you mean by ""my thingy blew up"". 

18. Don't use on-line help. On-line help is for wimps. 

19. If the mouse cable keeps knocking down the framed picture of your dog, lift the computer and stuff the cable under it. Mouse cables were designed to have 20kg of computer sitting on top of them. 

20. If the space bar on your keyboard doesn't work, blame it on the mail upgrade. Keyboards are actually very happy with half a pound of muffin crumbs and nail clippings in them. 

21. When you get a message saying ""Are you sure?"" click on that Yes button as fast as you can. Hell, if you weren't sure, you wouldn't be doing it, would you ? 

22. When you find an I.T. person on the phone with his bank, sit uninvited on the corner of his desk and stare at him until he hangs up. We don't have any money to speak of anyway. 

23. Feel perfectly free to say things like ""I don't know nothing about that computer crap"". We don't mind at all hearing our area of professional expertise referred to as crap. 

24. When you need to change the toner cartridge in a printer, call I.T. support. Changing a toner cartridge is an extremely complex task, and Hewlett-Packard recommends that it be performed only by a professional engineer with a master's degree in nuclear physics. 

25. When you can't find someone in the government directory, call I.T. Support. 

26. When you have a lock to pick on an old file cabinet, call I.T. Support. We love to hack. 

27. When something's the matter with your computer, ask your secretary to call the help desk. We enjoy the challenge of having to deal with a third party who doesn't know anything about the problem. 

28. When you receive a 30mb (huge) movie file, send it to everyone as a mail attachment. We've got lots of disk space on that mail server. 

29. Don't even think of breaking large print jobs down into smaller chunks. Somebody else might get a chance to squeeze a memo into the queue. 

30. When an I.T. person gets on the elevator pushing $100,000 worth of computer equipment on a cart, ask in a very loud voice: ""Good grief, you take the elevator to go DOWN one floor?!?"" That's another one that cracks us up no end. 

31. When you lose your car keys, send an email to the entire company. People out in Birmingham like to keep abreast of what's going on. 

32. When you bump into an I.T. person at the grocery store on a Saturday, ask a computer question. We do weekends. 

33. Don't bother to tell us when you move computers around on your own. Computer names are just a cosmetic feature. 

34. When you bring your own personal home PC for repair at the office, leave the documentation at home. We'll find all the settings and drivers somewhere. 

35. In no way do we believe that end-users are ungrateful. It hurts our feelings that one could even think such a thing on the basis of the above statements. In truth we wish to express our deepest gratitude to the hundreds of wonderful end-users portrayed herein, without whom none of this would have been remotely possible.

It was a calm Friday at the local cable office when I noticed that it was time for lunch.  I retired to the empty conference room and began my daily ritual of browsing reddit.  Suddenly a cold wind cut me to the bones and I heard the plant manager mutter a single solitary word.  ""Crap"".

Quick as a flash he ran down the hall to the office server.  I had caught a glimpse of him when I noticed my phone had just dropped from [kinda fast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolved_HSPA) to [glacial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Data_Rates_for_GSM_Evolution).  I rushed to the server and found the manager confounded.  The office was cutoff the company network.  No one had internet access at all.  I then informed our master of all things wireless to our data issue.  The blood drained from his face.  The office phones were also down so we resorted to our cell phones.

Then the bat phone rang.  Turns out that Technician Scissorhands was splicing some fiber in the next town over and cut the blue wire instead of the red one.  All field staff were immediately sent to the assist and everyone else sat and waited.  Thankfully everything was fixed within 45 minutes and we were back online.  But the worst was yet to come.

Since the office phones were down as well as our computers all calls were redirected to the main office some 180 miles away.  Turns out that everyone for 50 miles in every direction and a small island had lost cable *everything*, all thanks to Technician Scissorhands.  We had 30 trouble calls scheduled for the next week because no one knew about the outage.  After running damage control, calling customers, and explaining that everything was fixed we thought we were in the clear.  Then the tide of angry customers who drove all the way to our office (some drove 15-20 miles) crashed against our doors.

First, a little background which is pretty cool on it's own too: Back in '86, she'd dropped out of vetenarian medicine and landed a typewriting job at the central adminstration of typewriting/secretary stuff in the government. The department had had Hermes Top Tronics for about a year, yet they preffered not to use them (despite the government having forked out 100000dkr/machine back then, which should be about $33200 today), because, well, they were technophobes. 

They were mainly using them to write standardized letters, but they hadn't cracked how to save something in multiple versions, so they would re-write them each time just to change name and date: My mothers first points as ""tech-savvy"" was scored on this account, when she was the first one to even bother to see if they could.

Every time a machine didn't turn on, they would throw their hands in the air, and call someone from way outside the city to come all the way into parliament, often just to plug the power back in. When my mom had witnessed this 3 times in one month, and saw that they bill each time was over 500dkr/$90, she told them to call her instead, just so she could check for these simple things she had seen to often be the problm. 

So, when the government bought it's first 2 computers in '87ish, Olivetti with double floppy disc, it was clear that my mother should be the one to do ""IT"" work (her boss got the other one) - so she bought some books on GroupWise, WordPerfect 4.1 etc and would teach her self to become the first IT-supporter in the government! 

Ok, on to the tale:

Fast forward to 2003ish, my mother is still the go-to-guy (woman?) for IT problems. A high profile civil servant and her secretary makes a frustrated call to my mom, saying that suddenly their computers weren't responsive to anything. Have they restarted, my mom asks. Yes, three times, nothing changes. My mom rushes to their office.

""Ok. Just to humour me, could you restart it once more?"" 

The secretary (since she was the tech-savvy one) proceeds to turn off the monitor, and turns it back on. 

""But... you have to restart it"" 

""I just did"", she says, with a look, as if saying 'aren't you keeping up?'

""Is that how you turn it off usually?""

""Yes, ever since we got these new machines""

My mother thinks back.... 3 years ago. For three years, these computers have never been shut off or anything. They were so impressed with my mom when it worked perfectly again, after she just pressed a button! A true feat for the advanced IT-supporter, surely!

As is often the case, the tech I replace jumped up and said, ""Oh thank God you're here!""  

As is often the case, I replied, ""I'm not actually here for another 20 minutes.""  I ~~can be~~ am pretty much always a smart ass.  I set my stuff down at my desk and noticed with more than a little amusement that he was still looking at me with puppy dog eyes.  ""So, what's up?"" I asked, tempted to hang the word ""doc"" on the end of the sentence.

""Herpington asked me to restart SERVER1.""

There was the tiniest of pauses while I tried to figure out if that was the end of the story or not.  It apparently was.

""Okay,"" I prompted.  Another irretrievable moment of my life slipped away.  I raised an eyebrow.  ""And?""

""Well, the thing is, it's not responding to anything.  I can't get into it,"" he elaborated.

*Sounds reasonable*, I thought.  *If he could restart the server remotely, he wouldn't need you.*  ""So go push the button,"" I suggested, hoping beyond hope that he had thought of that already.

""Well, that's the thing ... it's a blade,"" he stammers.

""So.. you took down a bunch of servers?"" I ask, slightly concerned.

""No!  I can't find the button,"" he says, clearly trying to keep a stiff upper lip.  

At this point, I almost feel bad for the guy, but there's something not really right about all of this.  Wait a minute.  ""If it's a blade, Herpington can power cycle that remotely.  Are you sure you have the right server?""

""Yes!"" he insists with every fiber of his being.  ""I pressed the button on the far left and nothing happened.""

""Wait, I thought you said you couldn’t find the button?  And the far left of what?  A blade is like an inch and a half thick.. there's no far left of a blade.  Did you try to power down the chassis?""

""No, the blue button.""

""What blue button?  There aren't any blue buttons in that whole rack, let alone in a blade or a bladecenter.""

""I um..""

""You'd better show me"" I said, finally willing to admit that something was definitely wrong with ... whatever the hell this was.  We walked up stairs together to the data center and he showed me the server he was asked to restart.

It's not a blade.  It's just ... a server.  If someone were to ask me for a generic example of every server ever made, I'd have pointed to this exact machine.

""I pressed the button,"" he began.  He reached over and pushed against a pin that mounted the rails to the rack.  ""But it didn't restart.""

To his credit, the mounting pin had blue paint ... about half an inch below it.

""Did you ... did you try this one?"" I asked, pushing the only actual button on the server.

""Oooooh, tha-"" He stopped in mid sentence because the server powered off.  I pressed the button again and it started powering back on.

""So, how long ago did Herpington ask you to do that?"" I asked.  In fairness, I asked the question mostly just to rub it in. 

""About half an hour ago!  Thank you so much!  I didn't see the other button!""

I had to bite back my next passive-aggressive bit of sarcasm.  As I stood there looking at him like he was a complete and total moron, I couldn't help but notice that he just seemed so *happy*.  I almost felt *bad* for the guy.  Did he want a participation trophy or something?  This is IT, not the special Olympics.. 

""Yeah, that's a mounting pin, not a button.  That one there is the only button on the front of the server.  It's the power button.""

""Well, now I know!"" he said, now in super excited mode.  He was gushing.  Literally, gushing.  I'm actually now, in retrospect, questioning whether or not he'd ever power cycled a computer before in his life.

He's been here 5 weeks.  According to his resume, he's worked in IT for years.  This is one of the guys who escalates problems to me.

**Act I: In which our Hero is ""laid-off""**

For the purposes of this story, we will refer to the manager of The Flying Tech as ""Steve"". I'll endeavor not to spend too much time on Steve, and share only the most pertinent information. To begin, it's important to note that Steve was a recovering heroin addict from a wealthy family. His family had, at great cost, sent him to rehab and they had provided him with pills containing fake opiates to be taken ""as needed"". While I'm sure these fake opiates ""did not provide the same rush as pure, clean, honest heroin"" it was enough to keep him from going back... I think.

It turned out that ""as needed"" was once immediately upon beginning his shift, and once again shortly after his lunch break. After taking one of these pills, he would be pretty spaced out for the majority of the next two hours. And I mean completely spaced out.

This worked to my benefit, as I was only working ""as needed"" while I was going to a nearby college (where, oddly enough, I shared a class with his surprisingly hot girlfriend). Once his work piled up sufficiently, he would call me in and I would knock out six or seven computers and get him back on track. He would spend the time lounging on the couch he had brought from home and shoved into the corner.

But one day, the calls stopped coming. I was confused, but getting quite upset that Steve never really seemed to be on the ball, and insisted on double checking everything I did, usually with disastrous results.

I assumed that I had been laid off, and no one had bothered to tell me. I sighed, opened up my resume, and added yet another 3-month entry.

**ACT II: Enter the Kung Fu Manager!**

Then, one day, my phone rang. I was in the hot tub with a cute girl at the time, and let it go to voicemail. But later, I picked it up and saw the call had come from The Flying Tech. Very well. I listened to the voice mail. A strange, obviously not high voice spoke from the other end.

""Um... hi. is this... *rustle rustle*... is this PolloMagnifico? My name is Kung Fu Manager, I'm replacing Steve, and we need to talk about your schedule.""

Cautiously, I returned the call. Kung Fu Manager made sure I still wanted to work there, and told me I would now be working full time. I was to work full days four times a week, and half days on two other days. I was elated, and showed up for work the following day.

KungFu Manager was, well... this guy was great. He had been training for years in a [Thai Martial Art](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVyfmeyO898) known for it's violence and awesomeness. He had been the manager of a video rental location before taking the fall for an employee and getting refered here by another employee he was friends with.

He had started with the parent company, but due to some issues (the details were never made clear to me) he had been removed from a contract and transferred here, where he was to split his time between managing the store and helping on another contract.

KungFu Manager became a close friend, was instrumental in getting me a raise so I wasn't working for *minimum wage* and was very patient with me as I crash-coursed my way through taking over phone support for his contract.

He remained a close ally within the company for the rest of my tenure there.

**Act III: In which the story reveals itself**

Flash forward a bit, a customer has entered into the store. I put on my friendliest smile (which was easy, because she was young and good looking) and asked her how I could help. Her computer wasn't working. She produced a laptop from her shoulder bag. Considering what she pulled out, I briefly considered the possibility that the bag was in fact a portal to 2001.

I looked at it, groaned internally, and began my bench diagnostics. Hit the power button, nothing happens. Replace the power chord with a known good one, yank the battery, hit the power button... nothing.

I grab a non-conductive plastic rod (read: back end of a BIC pen) and jiggle the AC contact. It's loose. I calmly explain to the woman that her AC jack had come loose. As this was an older model and we had a standing policy not to do MOBO soldering unless under the most dire of cicumstances, we would likely have to replace the entire motherboard. Again, due to the age, the motherboard may be very expensive, assuming we could find it at all, and most likely her best option was to replace the laptop.

I gave her a print out of the specs she needs to look for in her new laptop, and offered to pull her data from her HDD. I reminded her that I would not be able to pull her programs out, but she should be able to install them onto her new Windows 7 machine. She leaves, and I begin my work.

**Act IV: The Worst Possible Thing**

So I pulled her HDD. Always interested in providing the best customr service, I imagined how great it would be if I could load her HDD into her new machine and give her back everything she was worried she had lost. I quickly backed up her pertinent data with the USB bridge, and moved on to researching ways to get the propper drivers loaded. I did a test case, and found that I could in fact manage it, though it was tricky.

I spent the next week perfecting the use of MiniXP, safe mode, and various pre-boot tools to accomplish this herculean feat. Yes, it was slow that week, and honestly it was just to see if I *could*.

She finally returns, new laptop in hand. I had suggested a Dell to her (as her old one was a dell) or an Acer (I have a fondness for them). I was interested to see what she had, and asked her to place it on the counter.

""Well, I went to Worst Purchase, and talked to a guy there. He showed me a few Dells, then he told me about this really great sounding machine called a MacBook. He said that it never gets viruses, and it won't break down on me like this one did!""

The smile left my face. ""You... you bought a Mac?"" She placed the box on the counter. It hadn't even been opened yet. This woman had NO IDEA what she had purchased yet. I was to spend the next five hours explaining to her why the Mac was not in her best interest, including the fact that none of her programs would work, and yes, Mac's do get viruses.

I don't know if she didn't believe me. I don't know if she just didn't care. But the end result was me struggling to load all the NTFS formatted information onto the MacOS formatted drive. Silently cursing the man from Worst Purchase, that lying thieving scumbag. I don't know if he was my new arch nemesis, or if he had always been my arch nemesis and had only just now chosen this opportunity to reveal himself, but it was the beginning of a long and terrible war.

I told KungFu Manager about it the following day. He just laughed.

**TL;DR** Old manager bad, new manager awesome, a Mac is NOT a windows machine. It actually *is possible* to load a HDD from one computer to another with different specs... sometimes. Worst Purchase fires the first shot in the war.

Me: I don't hear it, did it stop?

Woman: Well, it flashes occasionally, and beeps occasionally. Maybe every 5 minutes or so?

Me: Ma'am, when was the last time you replaced the battery in that smoke detector?

Woman: I don't remember ever having to do it. I thought it was plugged into the house.

Me: (removing face from palm) Ma'am, if you are 100% sure there is no fire, please remove the smoke detector from your ceiling and replace the battery.

And so it came to be that after many months working on this federal government helpdesk, I had settled into something of a routine. There was not much, I thought, that I did not know about the network and the systems attached thereto, and this was indeed fairly true when it came to the official stuff. However, not everything to be found beneath the relatively bland facade was strictly on the up-and-up, as I was to discover.  
   
The day started like any other - like most of the team, I was out of the phone queues and dealing with the waves of tickets being generated by the poor bastards whose turn it was in the barrel. Our newest recruit, Youngster McGreenypants, was seated at the corner desk, studiously working through some of the simpler tickets to do with retrieving various misplaced files on network shares. All in all, as about as idyllic as Helpdesk work ever gets. When suddenly, there came - a silence.  
   
This may seem like a strange concept, but it was most definitely an absence of a sound which, to a tech's finely trained senses, should be there. It took me a moment to identify the source, and I wasn't the first - other ears had pricked up across the desks, and heads were turning. Towards the recruit. Who was frozen.  
   
The sound whose absence had caught our attention was his typing. And the reason for this abrupt cessation was all too clear from the way his hands were seemingly jammed in midair over his keyboard, his eyes locked on his screen, and his face an odd mixture of expressions from embarrassment to horror to apprehension.  

   

For behold! The Kid Wonder had stumbled across some enterprising public servant's porn folder. And not just any porn folder! This one was filled with a variety of interesting poses one could achieve with fruit, and there was an entire subarchive devoted to movies of ladies with *very* friendly pets. Alsatian dogs, to be precise. Woof.  

So, after the entire team had wandered over to look over the mortified newbie's shoulder, and then dealt with subsequent attacks of giggles, the obligatory red tape had to take over. A quiet word in the ear of HR resulted in *quite a few* auditors all gathering around the PC in the corner and making tut-tut noises, and it was eventually decided that according to policy, there needed to be hard-copy evidence produced of the, ah, offending items.  
   
Thus it was that Newguy McPornfinder found himself in the position of having to play through the pornos, sending screendumps of the more... *incriminating* scenes to the one color printer we had on the floor of the building, which was in the next section over. To make sure that no-one in that section would happen upon the printouts accidentally, a squad of unsmiling HR drones was sent to surround the printer and confiscate the prints as they slid salaciously out of the slot.  
  
   
  
Now, what happened next wasn't really the kid's fault. Red as a beet, and keying as if his keyboard was made of red-hot iron, he decided that he was going to get through this eye-searing duty as rapidly as possible. Thus, he set his default printer to the color queue, queued up the movies, clicked randomly to a couple of points in each one, hotkeyed a screendump to the printer, and moved onto the next file quicker'n a greased ferret. The result - several dozen shots of Fanny and Fido doing the horizontal mambo near-instantly stacked up in the print queue and started to be processed.  
   
It wasn't until he had dumped something like fifty full-page extra-magenta-ink images into the queue that one of the suits who had been standing around the color printer showed up and asked how long it was going to be before their porn factory started delivering the goods. Only then did Sparky McNevergonnaliveitdown think to double-check *which* color print queue he'd set as default.  
   
Hint: Not the one on our floor.  
   
Now, color printers, in that day and age, were still fairly rare beasts. Not many departmental sections had the clout to be able to request one and make that request stick. The entire IT department had one, half for 'testing' and half for the CIO's pie charts. The CFO had one outside his office for the national annual report. And way, way at the top of the building, where the walls were mainly glass and the chairs were leather, there was a color printer right smack dab in the middle of the executive...  
   
*...secretaries.*  
   
Guess which printer fifty megs of Debbie Does Doggies had gone to?  

   

Now, I've seen a lot of fast-moving things in my time, including IT staff hearing rumors of free breakroom sandwiches, and the time I replaced an internal modem in a powered-on PC and got blown across the room when I brushed the wrong piece of metal. But I have never before nor since seen public servants run up six flights of stairs without touching a single one, yet still have the energy to burst into the executive wing and launch themselves across the floor while yelling ""DON'T LOOK AT THE PRINTER!!!""  
   
The collection of young, polished, and slightly startled lasses they discovered there were, apparently, taken a little aback.  

   

Fortunately for the forces of ~~good~~ policy, the printer and its output were secured in time to prevent the sullying of impressionable young minds. Er... other than Derpy McWrongprinter's, of course. But that's a career in IT for you. The episode did lead me, in the following week, to construct the Deporninator...  
   

...but that's a story for another time.

Years ago, I had a co-worker who was complaining that her computer was running slow and wanted to know if I could look into it. Sure, why not? I love tinkering and fixing computers! So she brings in her desktop. Immediately I see why its so slow - its got an old Celeron processor, 128 MB of DDR ram, and a sticker on the front that says ""Made for Windows XP"". I mean the computer is one of those really really really really cheap ones that barely meet the hardware requirements for Windows XP. I can't remember the speed of the Celeron, but it was definitely below 1.8 GHz.

Well to make matters worse, the thing was also filled to the brim with so many viruses and spyware that it would make Batman cry. So I began the process of doing my thing and removing the bad stuff and optimizing the rest (cause the co-worker didn't want to have the drive wiped).

So it took two days of several hours each to remove all the viruses and spyware - some of which I had to actually go into the registry to remove - others I had to do carefully because they would just re-install after removal.

Despite it all, the damn thing was still pretty slow. Well, duh - 128 MB of RAM for Windows XP is absurd. Even our future office computer had 512 MB and it still had problems with more than one piece of software opening.

So I told her I did the best I could and how long it took me. Then I told her it was still slow and the only way to make it faster was more RAM. Now the thing was so old and cheap it couldn't take much more RAM. Matter of fact, max RAM was 512 MB. But hey, its still better than 128 MB and at the time even the old RAM was still buyable for not a lot of money. I told her if she bought the memory I would install it for her.

Well, she never got mean but she was a bit rude.

* Her: ""Why do I have to pay for it? You are the tech dude, you can buy it.""
* Me: ""What? I'm not spending my own money for a computer that isn't mine.""
* Her: ""Oh well, I can take it to my ex-husband, he'll do it for me for free because he loves me still. Probably should have done that to begin with, he could have fixed everything immediately.""

So yeah, not even a thank you. Seriously, she never once said thanks - just about how she will take it to her husband who is willing to do whatever she wants because he still loved her.

One of the problems with working IT in an underfunded team was that the Helpdesk area was just a group of desks in the corner of one of the floors of an office building, and a main thoroughfare ran right past us. Not all our screens were positioned in such a way as to be able to be turned away from the public gaze, which led to privacy issues. And honestly, I was sick of having people walk up behind me and watch whatever work I was doing as if it was free entertainment.  

So I sat down with a crude graphics editor and dreamed up an icon.  

It was a very simple icon, consisting of a black background, with a two-pixel-wide plain green line down the right side and along the base. Then I moved the right line two pixels to the left and the lower line two pixels up, and saved another icon. Then again, and again, and again, until I had sixteen very innocuous icons. Which I compiled into an animated GIF. All you'd see on this image was, apparently, a green crosshair drifting quite slowly from the bottom right to the top left, over and over.  

I proceeded to tile this across my entire desktop background. A bright green grid drifting eternally upwards and to the left...  
   
  
It took me a few hours to get used to, but eventually I could mentally filter it out from where it appeared around the edges of all my onscreen windows. Anyone standing behind me, though, started having their eyes tell them that everything in the center of their field of view was drifting *down* and to the *right*, yet the edges of their vision (the rest of the room) were sliding *up* and to the *left*. I had at least one voyeur turn green and stumble away, and another wannabe shoulder-surfer walk into a door after losing fine control of their legs.  

Of course, it was purely for the benefit of the users, you see. Now they wouldn't accidentally see anything confidential on a Helpdesk screen, and I'm sure there were health advantages to constantly power-walking past our area while resolutely (some might say desperately) focusing on the far wall. Not to mention monetary savings from all those skipped lunches.  

However, there was no time to rest on laurels, no matter how green and pulsating they might be. For I had identified one of the great sources of annoyances on our Win 3.11 network, and after running into the limitations of DOS batch files, had picked up a book on Perl for the very first time. I was going vampire hunting, with a script I would come to call Buffy...

Finally I get it into the system and I boot it up.  Comes into windows XP and all appears fine as windows begins loading up.  Then the command prompt pops up and goes away, and everything proceeds to go into shut down mode.  I watch as windows shuts down, the machine soft reboots, and windows begins to load again.  I call my boss over to watch it.  Finally we figure she has a virus.  

I get permission from her, and do a clean up on it.  A normal virus cleanup there took us about a half hour, we prided ourselves on speed.  It also handled 95% of all virus issues.  It did not fix this.  I went to run some of the older tools, more specialized to see if they helped.  Not a rootkit, nothing picking up in full scans on anything.  Everytime it boots, the thing works right up until command prompt comes up.

Finally I begin checking the startup lists on the machine and find an odd shortcut named ""mom"".  Ok....  I open the file location and it links to a .bat file.  Said .bat file had @echo off and then a command I didn't recognize.

I deleted the file and lo and behold, the PC works.  So I call the woman and when she picks it up explain what was going on then ask if she had a kid.  She apparently grounded her son from using the computer because he kept watching porn on it.  I guess he did this just to mess with her.

It's just labtech w/ an AV we chose.  We have a lot of things locked down for privacy concerns, such as screen shots, remote control w/o user permissions, etc.  

A customer called me today and notified me that her laptop was stolen last night.  I brought up my software and open the machine page.  I had to enable features which are otherwise blocked.  We actually have it to where we have to enter the case/incident report # for internal logs.

I get access to the machine... and it's online!!!  I get it's external IP and find it's provider.  I then start a script to obtain screen shots on 1 minute intervals.  During so I get screen shots of his facebook and email account.  Via his facebook I got his name and picture.  Via his email account, he had it set to where his ISP's landline voicemail notified him when he had voicemail.  The subject included the actual phone number!!

So, in a matter of 15 minutes I was able to get his name, photo, ip address, his phone number, and finally, via some helpful sites and what info I had, his physical address!!  I call the police department and gave them all the info I had!  I contacted my customer and told her what info I could get without being specific (legally I can not tell her is name or whereabouts.)

**UPDATE** - I can confirm that the guy was arrested.  My customer should receive her stolen property from the police.  It's good to know that the detective on the case took my info and promptly verified the address with the ISP's record by comparing the IP address.  Once that was done, they had a warrant. 

It's good to know that I can do this in the future.  We advertise that it's possible, only if the knucklehead who steals the equipment gets online with it.

It was a dark time for the Helpdesk...  

We were halfway through upgrading from Win3.11 to Win95, and it was the Helpdesk's job to rebuild any PC which managed to become completely knackered, virus-ridden, or otherwise too annoying to spend time on repairing. Only due to a number of technological limitations, we could only rebuild workstations which were equipped with an external (floppy) drive, and all the user workstation drives had been pulled out and trashed for security reasons.  

So the process for rebuilding a PC was - physically go out to the desk in whichever building (sometimes crossing major roads to do so), unplug the PC, bring it back to the Helpdesk, plug it into the LAN there, crack the case, attach a floppy drive to the motherboard, boot the PC, adjust the BIOS so it booted from A: drive, take the one single floppy disk that the Helpdesk was allowed to have on hand, trudge three flights upstairs to the server room, put the disk into a server drive, log on, reformat the disk, reload it with the script and files for the OS you needed, go back down the stairs to the Helpdesk, put the disk into the drive, start the reimaging process, wait for it to complete, reboot the PC, change the BIOS back to booting from hard disk first, shut down the PC, unplug the floppy drive, put the case back together, take it back to whichever building and desk it came from, reconnect all the cables, boot it and test the network connection, and inform the user that it could be used again.  

What with scheduling and everything else, this could take about a week. I'd complained about the ridiculous restrictions (one floppy disk for the entire IT Helpdesk? Have to rebuild it from a server? Not allowed to have floppy drives on our own workstations?) to the manager, but apparently these things had come down from On High some time ago and were writ in stone.  

Fuck.

 

So I got a bit annoyed at this, and looked at the contents of the two floppy boot disk images. It turned out that both images used about 800k of assorted files and scripts (most things were downloaded off the network), so I couldn't just put both images on the same disk.  

*However...* both images used many of the same files, as it was a DOS boot disk. The files, unfortunately, were not in the same places in the images - one had most of them in the root, one had most of them in an A:\DOS directory. So I couldn't simply merge the images, either.  

*However-however...* the sum total size of the files which were unique to each image, plus the ones which were used by both, was about 1300 kilobytes. Little cogs started ticking over in my head, and I sat down to write a new text file. Some sort of clue-bat, to toggle states...  

 

The result was TOGGLE.BAT. All it did was look at the structure of the files on the floppy, determine which configuration they were in, and move the files around (renaming some of them where there were clashes) to the other configuration. (It would also helpfully advise which format the disk was currently in before doing this, and ask to continue or not.) Thus, we didn't have to keep running up and down the stairs to the server room in order to reimage the single boot disk(!) we were allowed to have. Average rebuild times dropped from five working days to around 24 hours, deskside to deskside. And I had some time freed up to think about how to get around the entire floppy drive debacle...  

...but that's a story for another time.

So one day my step-dad starts complaining about the computer being too loud (this man still types with his index fingers, his arms like a T-Rex hen pecking the keyboard) and so I tell him to leave it and I'll deal with it when I get home from school. I had planned to get step-dad to drive me to the nearest computer store for a can of air, simple right?

However when I got home that day I found my step-dad in tears, he kept restarting the computer hoping that somehow it might magically fix the blue screen. When he saw me, he finally gave up and told me to **FIX IT**.

I start looking over the carnage, screws scattered about, side panel still off and a very clean looking fan and motherboard. So I had to ask him, did he pick up the can of air I had talked about? No, it was too bloody expensive for just some air, so he just decided that he'd go into the kitchen drawer and grab the [pastry brush](http://www.ayahfoods.com/products/_pics/Pastry%20Brush.jpg) to give it a wee wipe down.

I could see butter residue on the motherboard, big clumps where the butter had mixed with the dirt and created monster dust bunnies. I did what I could, I started laughing my arse off and called my mum to let her know that they'd have to start saving up for a new computer a little earlier than christmas (this thing was 7 years old anyway)

It wasn't til later in the year when he did the same thing to the CD player (because the laser needs to be cleaned doncha know) with the same damn pastry brush that we stopped him from dealing with ANYTHING mechanical.

No big deal, they don't use DVDs much, lets setup their Roku.  I go to unplug it... and it's stuck.  

I gently pull it to no avail.

I firmly tug it to no avail.

I look carefully in case there is some clip or something, there is not.

I apply constant firm pressure to no avail.

I give it one great heave and RIIIIIIIIIIIP. The cable is out, but the plug is still in the TV.

I ask them, ""how did you install this?""

They respond, ""Oh, I thought it was fitting a little loosely, so I forced it and put it in there so it doesn't fall out"".

When faced with a circular hole and a non-circular object, apply firm and constant force directly to said object in the direction of the hole.  For the best results, use a hammer.

Apparently she's been unable to get any work done for the last 2 days because of a serious problem with our software setup and it has to be fixed as a matter of utmost urgency! ... that said it'll be hard to be urgent about it at this point since it's a Friday and she's gone home early, so probably not going to get fixed until Monday.  

The problem presents as her being unable to access any email from any machine other than her own. This is totally unacceptable since she's on reception next week instead of at her desk and needs to be able to continue to do email from there. 

Most odd. 

We have a pretty comprehensive roaming setup here, and generally you log in anywhere, and you'll get the same desktop as you'd get anywhere else. A quick masquerade shows that her account is working fine, so I'm assuming this must be a problem with the pc... perhaps someone has pulled the network lead or something and she's unable to distinguish ""I can't log on"" from ""I can't send email"" (you never know with some people)

So, I go take a look at the machine... nope, that's just fine. I can log in, there's my profile, there's outlook, contacts, the lot. 

This one goes round the support team a few times, and the only thing we can find is that chrome under windows occasionally doesn't sync bookmarks. Not entirely sure why, but ok, that's definitely a problem, we'll get that fixed... not email related tho, right? 

Wrong. 

At some point in the past she decided that she didn't like the interface on the old web email system and bookmarked all the individual pages for ""new mail"" ""inbox"" ""important-work-folder"" ""pictures-of-cats-folder"" etc. 

Impressively the [mail system upgrade last week](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/12nuft/the_colours_children_the_colours/) actually maintained compatibility with these book marks, so she'd barely even noticed that things had changed... right up to the point where the bookmarks didn't sync one morning and she couldn't find anything. 

Ok. 

So we draft up the usual ""We're aware that there's a problem with the bookmark roaming in chrome on windows workstations, we'll look into getting that fixed asap, but in the mean time, you can still access your email either using the Outlook or Thunderbird email clients that are pre-configured and linked from the desktop on Windows workstations, or from the Thunderbird client on the Linux workstations. You can also access the web interface from any device by going to [address] and logging in with your normal departmental username and password.""

The answer that we got back was a single line and fairly enlightening as to the true nature of the problem...

I calmly ask him why he did that, and he said that I could have seriously messed something up, yadda yadda yadda, and only IT guys were allowed to fix computers. He picked up the laptop I was fixing, and opened up settings. You can imagine his surprise when everything was greyed out (Students are going to screw up our network by changing their mouse settings!

Up looked W from his desk and his headset, and said ""Not your job!""  

He was young, and he was wild, and his pride was inordinate: he pulled up some stats from the traffic on the servers, and he went to the Middle Boss Z. He went to Z at eleven in the morning, saying ""I can do something about all this porn by five this afternoon.""  

Up looked Z from seat and his paperwork, and said ""Not your job!""  

He was young, and he was wild, and his pride was inordinate: he pulled up some stats from the traffic on the network, and he went to the Big Boss A. He went to A at two after lunchtime, saying ""I can do something about all this porn by five this afternoon.""  

Up looked A from her desk and her red tape, and said ""Bet you can't!""  

So the tech took a PC -- a plain old PC -- and set it on the network scanning drives. It was scanning not for deep porn, or hidden or renamed porn, but simply for that media with extra-largish files.  

It scanned on!  

This was Windows 3.1 -- ancient Windows 3.1 -- and few of us there knew it had a limit on its search. But that would come much later, for when the search first kicked off, the scanner seemed to locate quite a lot of porn to start.  

It scanned on!  

Five hundred images. Ten thousand images. Fifty thousand images, and still it found yet more. Sixty thousand images. Eighty thousand images. It must be near the end quite soon, of that our tech was sure. And yet the clock kept ticking, and the number kept on rising, and it soon became quite clear that 3pm had moved to 4.  

It scanned on!  

Four PM rolled closer, then passed by, then faded. Thirty-minutes past the hour, and still the scans found more. Eventually, the sheepish tech, now wanting to be done by five, stopped the scan, and hit DEL, having first selected ""All"".  
   

So 5pm rolled 'round, and still the porn was being cleared off. And Big Boss A, when passing by and heading out the door, just rolled her eyes and quirked a smile, for she had seen techs try and try, and never had they cleaned the whole Department of its porn!  

The tech was slightly miffed, and swore there could not be much more. A hundred thousand porno GIFs had vanished just since 4! He'd run the scanner overnight to pick up crumbs and specks - then wipe them out, and prove that tech could always win o'er sex!  

At 9am, he smartly checked the anti-porn machine. And paused - another hundred thousand files were listed there onscreen! It shocked him to his core, but soon he shook it off and said: ""They must be those from older years! I've found those ones instead!"" So once more all the files were tagged, and once more they were cleared. And lunchtime rolled around, and inwardly our tech friend cheered. For surely one more run of the Deporninator, now, would clear the remnants from the LAN - the porn would die, and how!  
  
The hours passed. Then days. Then weeks. On ev'ry fresh-run scan: another hundred thousand files, another broken plan. The months rolled by: ten million porno files had met their grisly fate, yet ever seemed there more to which the user'd masturbate!  
   

And finally, the team was outsourced. Handovers were done. And all our methods documented; everything we'd run. The PC -- plain old PC -- still ran on, from dusk to morn. For all I know, it's still there now, forever killing porn.
  
   
  
And that, O readers and repairers, was the day I realised that I could not achieve everything on my own with limited resources. Which was just as well, because it was not long afterwards that the employer decided that a thousand staff and their workstations needed to be shuffled about inside the same building, and this had to be completed over a weekend.  
  
...but that's a story for another time.

Once upon a time, I'm working the night-shift helpdesk at a military base in Japan.  This is a sweet gig, as no one seems to work at night.  We're basically there for emergencies only, so lots of websurfing commences.

One night, around 2:00 AM, we get a rare phone call.  The conversation goes something like this:

**SMSgt:** ""This is Senior Master Sergeant ~~XXXXX~~.  I'm calling to let you know the Wing Commander's Internet service is out at his house.  I need you to send someone out there right away!""

The ""Wing Commander"" is basically the dude in charge of the entire base.  Problems don't get any more high-profile than this.  So we call up the on-call person (we're not allowed to leave the helpdesk unmanned) and tell him to go check on the ""Wing King"".

About 30 minutes later, the on-call guy calls us back, pissed off.  He said that the Wing Commander and his whole family was asleep and he accidentally woke them all up.  He got yelled at and given the boot.  So he's going back to bed.  We shrug it off and go back to our websurfing.

Another hour passes and we get a more irate phone call:

**SMSgt:** ""WHERE THE F*** ARE YOUR PEOPLE?!  THE WING COMMANDER IS STILL AWAKE AND HE HAS AN URGENT PROJECT THAT NEEDS COMPLETION TONIGHT!  GET OFF YOUR DAMN ASSES AND SEND EVERYONE YOU GOT, F***TARDS!""

**Me:** ""Sir, we sent our on-call guy over there.  The Wing Commander was asleep and pissed off that we bothered him.""

**SMSgt:** ""Oh, he's pissed all right.  Pissed that he's been sitting on his ass for hours without network support.  GET YOUR MAN BACK OUT THERE, IDIOT!""

So, we begrudgingly call up the on-call guy again.  Same thing happens.  Wing Commander and his family are even more pissed off.  They've never heard of this SMSgt before.  They threaten to write up paperwork on our whole shift for bothering them.  Even his civilian wife gets a chance to chew out the on-call guy.  He goes back to bed and we figure we're getting trolled hard by some prankster.

Half an hour later, the expected call comes in:

**SMSgt:** ""ARE YOU PEOPLE IDIOTS?! WHERE THE F*** ARE YOU?""

**Me:** ""Sir--""

**SMSgt:** ""THAT DOES IT, YOU'RE ALL GETTING WRITTEN UP.  I'M CALLING THE KOREAN HELPDESK.  MAYBE THEY'LL ACTUALLY SEND SOMEONE COMPETENT.""

**Me:** ""Korean... Sir, where are you stationed?""

**SMSgt:** ""WHERE THE F*** DO YOU THINK I'M STATIONED?  I'M IN F***ING KOREA, SAME AS YOUR DUMB ASS!!""

**Me:** ""Uhh... sir, we're in Japan.  At ~~XXXXX~~ Air Base.  You need to call your local helpdesk.""

**SMSgt:** ""I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I NEED. I NEED... Wait... Did you say Japan?  Oh f***."" &lt;click&gt;

We never heard from him again.  Oddly enough, to call our base, he would've had to dial long-distance every time.

After some years of unemployment, I got out of finance and changed my career to IT, now working in a fortune 500 company. ( IT seemed like a logical choice since I was the only IT person in my previous job). I've had my fair share of rude, angry and downright awful callers, but this one--well, she took the cake. 

Derpina called and immediately asked for my coworker. He had just gone to lunch, so I explained that and asked if there is anything I could do to help. In her most threatening voice she responds: ""No, you will get Coworker for me so he can do what I need him to do"" At this point I tell her again and she reluctantly allows me to remote into her computer, smugly telling me that she needed a file compressed for sending through e mail. No Problem. I begin the process of compressing the file (a M$FT powerpoint file). She then interrupts me 

**Derpina**: STOP. RIGHT. THERE. 

**Me**: Uh, sure...

**Derpina**: Do you even know what you are doing? I do NOT want you to Compress this file, I need you to Compress it to send through E mail. What is your problem? CAN'T YOU FOLLOW DIRECTIONS? JUST PUT COWORKER ON THE PHONE. HE IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO KNOWS ANYTHING IN YOUR DEPARTMENT!!!

At this point I am on mute and talking with a lead in my dept, telling him that I cannot help this person until she calms down and stops yelling and belittling me. My lead tells me to continue on, I was doign what she asked. I go back to the call and calmly ask what she expects that I do. This comes next: 

**Derpina**: (In a smug, know it all tone) Clearly, you have no idea what you are doing. I am asking you to compress this file--but you are NOT DOING IT RIGHT! you need to get your coworker on the phone because he knows what I want done. I have a 4pm meeting and this needs to go out RIGHT NOW. Now...put your little mouse here (points me to power point) and Compress this file!!!! 

at this point, I'm on mute again, about to lose my temper. I tell my lead I cannot resume this phone call. I can hear her on mute cackling with her friends--she DID NOT put her phone on mute and was unaware the calls are always recorded. I hear her saying this: 

**Derpina**: These IT people are so stupid! Yeah, They can't do a thing. And yeah--I'm a bitch! I treat them like crap because they should have gone to college in the first place. Doesn't this girl know I'm in HR? I could have her JOB! 

I transfer the call over to my lead and say, ""I' going to transfer you to my coworker (i lied) and perhaps he will be able to help you""  

**Derpina**: Well, you've wasted enough of my time! Do us all a favor and learn a thing or two! 

I hit transfer, put myself in break. I've had plenty of rude people. Not one made me feel like I felt after that call. All of my education, (yes, I did go to college for Fine Art) my subsequent experience and everything never prepared me for that. I looked her up--a smug 27 year old Administrative Assistant. Her issue was she wanted the IMAGES IN POWERPOINT compressed. 

I think the worse part was the fact that she never got spoken too or reprimanded about her unprofessional behavior. My boss never spoke to me about it. ( told him in an E mail)  She still occasionally calls and I have her name on a post it. If I ever get her again, She is immediately transferred to my boss. 

TL;DR: Clearly, I need to get out of Phone Support.

Previously, in Series Two, I [turned up dressed as a hobo](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/s68b1/chapter_2_in_which_i_make_a_first_impression/) and [bade there be light](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/svg0m/and_whatsoever_adam_documented_every_piece_of/). But on my very first day, I ran into a job I hadn't been expecting.  

---  

I showed up bright and early, washed and scrubbed, fake cheer firmly in place. We went through the usual routine - introductions with the co-workers, a rough run-down of the building layouts we'd be doing deskside support in, and so forth. And as the newbie, I of course got assigned the hazing ticket as my first job.  

The manager handed it to me, and mentioned that this was a server which belonged to another manager a couple of floors away, who was a *personal friend* of his, and that it wasn't booting. Could I have a look at it?  

 
Sure thing, boss!

 
So I take the ticket and trot up a couple of flights of stairs until I reach the designated area. Surprisingly, this didn't turn into one of the classic redirection hunts where I'd be pointed to locations all over the building for the next couple of hours. In fact, the team existed where I'd been told, the manager in question was even present, and the server itself was actually in existence. And sure enough, it had power but wasn't completing the boot process. And it was a LONG process.  

So I tried a bunch of things, and rapidly narrowed it down to a hardware fault. Unfortunately, the way the server's innards had been rigged up, there were five possible things which could be causing it by being plugged in the wrong way, and no keyed connectors. Added to this was the problem that the machine guts were so cramped that making a change to one of these connectors and then booting and testing the result took about a quarter hour per change. (Long boot process, remember?)  

Well... five things which could each be in one of two positions. That's a finite number of configurations. And if I assigned each connector to its own mutually orthogonal vector in connectorspace, I could construct a five-dimensional hypercube and then step through it maximally efficiently using Gray codes, right? That way I only ever have to change one connection at each step!  

 
Thus emboldened, I commenced. Configuration #1 of 32, test. Nope. Configuration #2 of 32, test. Nope. Configuration #3 of 32...

 
...  

 
...  

 
...configuration #30 of 32, you have got to be kidding me, NO. Configuration #31 of 32, there's gotta be a 50% chance, NO.  

Fuck it. Configuration #32 of 32, and I'm gonna throw this thing out the window...  

 
It boots.  

It goddamn boots. Passes all the cross-checks, loads the OS, and is generally a happy bunny.  

So I peel myself off the floor, wait for the dizziness to pass, and go find the manager who is a *personal friend* of my boss, and tell him that the machine no-one else has managed to get operational in six months is now up and running. There may have been a ""booyah""; I deny everything. And to finish off, I get to schlep myself back to the Helpdesk area and report back in.  

Only... remember how many configurations I had to step through, and how long each one took to test? Turns out my boss has been wondering where his new employee was. For the past EIGHT HOURS.  

 

...yeah. Not the most auspicious first day on the job. Particularly when I tell him that the Server Time Forgot, the one that, y'know, belonged to his *personal friend*, is now up and running, and the Boss says ""Oh, that wasn't actually important, no-one's been using it for six months after all.""

Recently, one of my family members asked me to help them with their PC. They told me that every time they used their computer, it made a rather quiet but noticeable squeaking noise. I figured it was a dying hard drive or the fan needed to be oiled, but I found something rather interesting.



They gave me the machine for the weekend to take a look at. Knowing that the last time they heard a squeak it was just a dying fan, I figured that I would be able to give it back to them within an hour.



Before I was going to take off the side of the case I heard the squeaking noise. The computer wasn't on nor was it plugged in so it couldn't have been what I had been thinking. Worried, I unscrewed the thumbscrews and found three baby mice inside the machine. Three, dark chocolate brown mice. I popped the side back on, went outside and dumped the mice into the grass. They must have gotten in through the empty 3.5in bay without a cover.

I told my family member what I found and he gave me the computer. He has a big fear of mice and couldn't imagine using something daily that was touched by his enemy.

I worked in the tech services phone center for a blood glucose manufacture. We were open 24/7 and would get calls from hospitals, labs, and home users.

One night I get a call and go through the normal introduction to figure out what the issue is.  The caller is insisting that her meter is making a beeping sound and it's driving her nuts. She is threatening to sue because this *bleeping* gadget is keeping her up.

I have her read me the serial number off the meter and immediately know there is nothing I can do for her, the meter she owns does not have a speaker in it.

I calmly try to explain this to her but she starts to cry, loud wailing sobs... She's been up for 2 days, the beep is driving her insane, she can't take it anymore.  I decided to see if I could help her figure out where it's coming from.  

I have her hold up her phone and I crank my ear piece to max and strain to hear anything. After a minute i hear a very very faint ""beep"".  She comes back on the line a bit after that and I tell her to move to a different room and repeat the process.  We're engaged in a cross country telephonic version of marco-polo at this point.  She'll hold up the phone, i will sometimes hear a beep, i'll have her move in a different direction.

This went on for a good 30 mins till I hear the LOUDEST beep yet. 

I ask her, ""Ma'am, what room are you in?""

She responds, ""The kitchen""

Thinking quickly I ask, ""Do you have any new appliances in your kitchen?""

""I did get a new microwave"", was her answer.

I ask her to go over to the microwave and I hear an even louder beep through the phone. I ask her what is the microwave doing. She says the door is open so the light stays on, she likes to use it as a night light.  I ask her to shut the door of the microwave.  She sighs, ""Well, now the light is off in the microwave and I can't see anything in the dark!""

I ask her to bear with me and give it a few minutes to see if we hear the beep.  5 minutes go by and no beep can be heard.  I'm smiling and kinda proud I went the extra mile to help and older customer out.  She the proceeds to harsh my mellow by stating how this is unacceptable, she uses that microwave as a nightlight and even though the beep has stopped she's still convinced it was the meter.

My teammate tries to get the older lady to unplug her receiver and plug it back in, which should have fixed the problem.  After 20 minutes she finally gets it powered back on but it still isn't working.  

The next step in the troubleshooting was to resend the authorizations to the receiver, essentially reprogramming the control card.  Here is where my teammate got creative.  He told the poor clueless user to get a potato from her kitchen.  Once she got a potato he had her place it on the receiver and give it a spin.  As she spun the potato on the receiver he resent the authorizations and her picture came back on.  The lady thanked him and ended the call.

What is worst about this is I imagine the poor lady having the same problem later and telling whoever was there with her she could fix it by spinning a potato on top of her receiver.

Up until 8 months ago, I worked from home out of a garage that had been built into a workshop...of sorts.  One of the mail weaknesses of this 400sq foot room was the bathroom.  The bathroom had a wide enough entry for three regular sized doors, for some reason...something about being built in the late 40's when everyone's major concern was surviving the world war currently at hand. 

To compensate for this opening, I had draped a large piece of fabric over it.  It was a place we had rented and the landlord had not yet acquired (cheapskate) a door to separate the rooms.  The entry to the 'shop' was right at the corner of where my fabric curtain ended.

On this particular day, I had locked the door, needing to answer the call of nature and possibly the end result of last nights binge on jalapeno pizza. Unknown to me my two year old had wandered down into the shop looking for me.  Suddenly there's a knock at the door, and to my dismay I HEAR IT OPEN.  I hear my kid loudly proclaim ""My daddy is right here"", AND PULLS THE CURTAIN WIDE OPEN REVEALING ME ON THE CAN.  Bless his heart, he HELD IT OPEN too, for a full 20 seconds until they finally realized the gravity of the situation and backed away.

I did what I had to do, cleaned up, washed my hands and went back to answer the door.

The store was quiet without Frank &amp; Richard. Though I’ve had my problems with them during the years I would be lying if I said that I did not miss them. I really did miss those idiots. Something else that was missing from the store at the time were customers.

The fact that Frank &amp; Richard had overcharged an elderly couple for their services had made rounds around the town by word of mouth and a front page article on the local paper. People were outraged - rightly so - and had stopped coming to the store.

I talked with Frank &amp; Richard again about two weeks after they had been fired and they had become personae non gratae in the town. They had applied to a number of jobs in town, but each company knew who they were and what they had done. Getting a honest job in my town wasn’t an option anymore for these guys. About a week and a half after that, they left for Berlin to start their own business

Ron &amp; Don were agitated and restless in weeks after the incident had taken place. They were angry that Frank &amp; Richard ruined their “at home repair” business and wanted everyone to know.

It wasn’t until 2 weeks later that they started noticing that the whole situation with Frank &amp; Richard had a bigger impact then they had expected. It seemed as if they finally understood that customers equals money and trust is a viable part of a business model.

There was now an urgency in their attempts to attract customers to the store again. They had placed a - by our standards - massive order of cheap Chinese notebooks a few weeks before and were now afraid there would be no customers that would buy them. 

Ron and Don locked themselves away in Don’s office to create a new plan to make people come to our store again. The control of day to day store operations was handed over to Marcel and Johan. Jeremy who ran the store before the two goons had come on board decided to keep his mouth shut and see what Johan and Marcel were worth when left to tend to the store.

Though Johan and Marcel were much alike in their personalities; arrogant, superficial, non-talkative and expressionless they did not seem to get along much at all. Neither did anyone else for that matter. What they did share was a contempt for people that were not interested in computers. This really became apparent whenever they had to help customers who were clueless about computers, but needed to use it regardless. Instead of being helped they would be tortured.

One day Marcel and Johan were in the store when a customer came into the store looking for a new notebook. She was the type of person that didn’t know much about computers and knew it. I loved helping these kinds of customers. Marcel and Johan had decided to double down on her and help her to find a new notebook.

According to Jeremy who followed the conversation from the back she asked a lot of questions that were trivial  for anyone knowledgeable with computers. But they were genuine questions, and she wanted to learn. Marcel and Johan didn’t answer any of the questions honestly or with any kind of care. Half of the time they interrupted each other to correct each other on trivial details until the point where they started becoming aggressive. The woman feeling uncomfortable left quickly without buying anything. 

A few days later another fine example of their customer knowledge was taking place in the store. This time around it was an elderly couple that was looking for a new notebook to use for chatting with their grandchildren in Canada. It didn’t took to long before Marcel and Johan starting having a discussion about CMOS and CCD image sensors. The elderly couple was completely ignored and when trying to interject were told to shut up.

So while Ron &amp; Don were scheming away, Marcel and Johan were chasing away the remaining customers and Jeremy starting to think about his future something else was going on.

* * *

We have never been the only computer store in town. There was a store about 2 block down that had opened years before Ron &amp; Don started their store. It was comparable to our store, but the owner didn’t have a diet consisting of only trans fat foods and the store looked more modern and trustable. Despite that it never gained much customers. The store felt off for some reason; you knew you were going to be ripped off but never quite how and when it would happen. Our store was different; you knew how and when you were getting ripped off.

The owner, Eric as he was called, once had worked together with Ron &amp; Don to secure a set of desktops and notebooks with an wholesaler. Ron &amp; Don had involved him to reach a number of systems needed to secure a discount. While Ron &amp; Don had gotten the promised  15% discount by the wholesaler they had told Eric from the start it would be 5%. Eric had already overpaid several thousands to Ron and Don when he found out. During the years after Ron &amp; Don always tried to undercut Eric in prices and even hired some of its staff away from him. He hated them with a reason.

Eric had always been a nuisance to the store as he’d placed fake orders from time to time on the more expensive and hard to sell items and whenever he had a customer that was troublesome he would always refer him to us.

His anger towards Ron &amp; Don had grown even more when the store became popular with the sale of Chinese knockoffs. It wasn’t until the story of Frank &amp; Richard broke that he had gotten the ammunition to annoy Ron &amp; Don even more. His ammo was to keep the story of Frank &amp; Richard alive.

It started innocently enough with pamphlets delivered in the dead of night to people’s houses in the near area. It featured the article from the local newspaper and the message to choose a store you trust. At this moment it could have been any of the other stores that were on the other side of the town. 

The pamphlets stopped being delivered to people’s houses but instead now ended up plastered to the shopwindow. I wish he hadn’t done that because it meant two things; Jeremy had to clean it up and Ron &amp; Don wanted to go to war; fueled by enthusiasm of Marcel and Johan. 

They had created their own pamphlets which focussed on their efforts taken after the incident, the new company policy and a 20% off everything coupon. It did show how serious Ron &amp; Don were at this moment, they had never given a discount to anyone.

When it came to distribution of the folders they had tried to get Jeremy and me to spread them around. Jeremy luckily for him had a few days off to visit his grandparents on the other side of Germany. And when I got called I had played the silence game and didn’t answer. I had 12 missed calls.

Marcel and Johan were the one’s that ended up delivering the folders from door to door.
To my surprise a rather large amount of people seemed more than willing to forget everything that happened for a 20% discount on overpriced hardware. The shop seemed to be nearing it’s usual traffic again a few days into the promotion. Ron &amp; Don where happy and putting real pressure on Jeremy, Marcel, Johan and Me to be as polite and helpful as possible.

Eric wasn’t happy with the fact that Ron and Don’s store started gaining customers again. He wanted the store to be closed down. He started playing dirty and launched another attack on the store; annoying customers.

I had a short holiday vacation and worked the friday with Johan and Marcel when they started coming in. Eric had paid a few first years at my school to mess around in the store; to break items and harass customers and employees. 

It began with them browsing around and asking Marcel and Johan for non-existent hardware and ridiculous questions about software packages. They moved on to the demo units of the Chinese tablets and started handling them rather hard handedly. Marcel and Johan freaked out and quickly went up to the kids ordering them to stop. They refused. 

Marcel quickly grabbed a tablet out of on of the kids hands and handed it over to Johan. The kid started shouting about Marcel stealing from him, the store at this point had without the kids about 5 customers. They had quickly gotten the attention of the customers and Ron and Don who emerged from the back. 

It was around now that one of the kids gave a kick to Johan’s leg causing him to fall to his knees, dropping the tablet. Ron &amp; Don started shouting at Johan who became mad as well and actually gave the kid a big slap in his face while shouting some rather obscene words.

Johan now was in a row with the kids, Ron &amp; Don and two customers who felt the need to interject in this situation. It became a rather big argument with everyone shouting at each other. I was the only one not involved and stood behind the door opening in the back, listing and hiding. Not wanting to become involved.

About two or three minutes into the argument Don finally understood that he could not have a fight with customers and his personnel in the store. It would bring everything that happened in the last couple of weeks back to the minds of people. It was then and there that he decided in the middle of the argument decided to utter the word “You are fired” to Johan.

It surprised me when Marcel interjected that Don could not do that and that he and Marcel were right! They were the one’s running the store after all! Ron and Don both became angry at this point and decided to fire Marcel as well.

Marcel and Johan grabbed their bags and jacket from the back, and walked out of the store. But not before they had let me know that I was a “Cowardly stupid c***” and said even worse things to Ron &amp; Don. 

The situation was way out of hand and Ron and Don fixed it the only way they knew how to. Money. They gave the kids a free mp3 player for their troubles and the customers an apology and rather big discount to never mention this again. They didn’t. The store was safe. But Eric was winning. The store was crumbling. ",,False,,t5_2sfg5,1354203389.0,,tftsflair,True,t3_13yd2g,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/13yd2g/chapter_13_the_competition/,

This may be kind of long, so there’s a nice TL;DR at the bottom.

So, this summer I spent 8 weeks working for a computer camp that provides workshops for kids 8-17. Per the job description and my contract, I was to be assisting the network administrator to perform maintenance on 60-150 workstations, teach a workshop or two, and that’d be it. Sure, okay, sounds great!

Sadly, this was not the whole story. When I got on campus for orientation, I basically found out on the spot that in addition to my duties stated above, I would also be supervising campers outside of workshops, during meals, etc. I would get two nights off a week (6pm until 8am next morning), and 4 weekend days for the whole 8 weeks which would be a full 24 hours off. The nights I was on duty? 7:15am start, 4pm break, 6pm end break, on duty all night, rinse and repeat. Oh and Thursdays are all staff days, so everybody’s on duty. Allegedly. (&lt;-- I’ll get to that later).

So here I am, setting up computers with my fellow network associate. But surprise, despite on my contract it saying “Network Associate,” I’m actually the admin, and my co-worker is the associate. That’s one thing I was not prepared for, but alright I can handle that.

We’re setting up the machines, which are all pre-imaged. The setup instructions we got from our boss, the IT Director for the company, said nothing of centralized management. No AD, no LDAP, nada. Remember, 60-150 machines. In cramped and crowded rooms, which are difficult to get to each workstation for an adult (desks were built into the rooms).

The only “central management” our boss had provided in the image? VNC servers, on every single computer.

My co-worker and I are sitting here just dumbfounded that our boss a) expects us to manage that many machines without a domain, and b) assumes that the kids aren’t going to hose the machines (and if they do, we have Norton Ghost on our server?).

Speaking of servers, our “server” is an IBM Standalone server, which proudly displays “AT Compatible” on the post screen. It then boots into Windows 2000 Server. I almost cried.

But wait, there’s more! Because there’s no AD set up, that means no accounts for each of our campers. Which means when they store their files on the server, they can freely screw around with each other’s work. Logging this activity? Nope. It’s 2000 Server. Logs are like nope.

My favorite part about this entire set up, is that every single workstation has a camper and staff account. The camper account? Complete administrative rights in Windows 7.

Fuck.

Over the next 7 weeks, my co-worker and I have dealt with various cables and headphones run through wheels on the rolly chairs, a few machines getting hosed with spyware, and campers installing Norton Internet Security or McAfee Security Scanner because “they thought it was safe.” All of the workstations have Security Essentials running on them.

**Disclaimer. I didn't learn much from my time spent in this role. As such, some of my terminology may be off. Mounting = the plastic construct, set into the wall, that contains multiple ports to plug into. Jack = the individual port that a cable plugs into.

**Act 1: The Rising Sun**

I knew i should feel bad about my unintentional betrayal. I really should. But I was excited. I was finally making progress in my life! Soon I would learn about those enigmas known as ""servers"". How do they work? How are they were set up? What does a patch panel look like? What about the main switch racks? What are these new and exciting things and how long would it take me to learn how to use them efficiently! Would I learn Unix? Scripting? Maybe I would be called to use my completely useless HTML knowledge to update the website. The possibilities were ENDLESS!

Boy was I wrong. Instead of stepping into a beautiful wonderland of magic and excitement, I crossed the threshold into The Place Where Dreams Go to Die.

Now, I must diverge from the story in order to divulge some pertinent information about myself. I am not a small man. I used to be a semi-professional football player, defensive tackle / defensive end (depending on whether we were running a 3-4 or a 4-3 defense). In the area I lived in, this was no small feat. People from our league were constantly recruited by the local pro team for their practice squad. And not a ""meh"" team like Kansas City or Detroit. This is a team with multiple Superbowl wins that consistently goes to the playoffs. Our league was essentially seen as the first step towards a *real* chance at a professional career. So to paraphrase, I'm above average height and used to be built like Lou Farigno's punching bag.

OK, back to the story. I walked into my office, and there stands Ned the Neanderthal, Head of IT. He looks up from his meal of recently killed pterodactyl, and stands to greet me. This man is massive. He stands a head taller than me with short, fine blonde hair. His chest is as wide as my shoulders, and his arms as big as my thighs. In another world, I might have called him... Dovahkiin.

His massive hand engulfs mine (Jesus, this man could have palmed my head and dribbled me like a basketball!) as he shakes it and introduces himself. He was to set me straight to work in the server room, where there was something that needed my immediate attention!

I perked up. What could it possibly be? I was personally being asked to assist in the SERVER ROOM by the HEAD OF IT! I must have made more of an impact than I thought! What could possibly be so important?

**Act II: Into the Labyrinth**

""I need you to organize the IT storage room.""

Ned the Neanderthal opens the door and points to a small room. I peek inside to see piles upon piles of Cat5, Power cables, DVI and VGA cables, adapters, USB extenders, monitors, printers, USB cables of various lengths and form factors, old Pcs, new PCs, frankensteins, pieces and parts and wires and phones and it was just too much to bear! I realized that three separate storage areas had been consolidated into one with nary a thought given to where it would all actually *go*. One storage area no bigger than the bedroom of a small apartment building. Recoiling in fear, I looked back at Ned the Neanderthal, ""There's no way this can all fit in here! It isn't natural!"" Ned the Neanderthal just smiles and tells me I'll find a way. I didn't need to worry because KungFu Manager was at the store and could man the phones and answer tickets from there, so I would have no distractions.

Still half believing I was the subject of some sick office prank, I rolled up my sleeves. Closing my eyes, I remembered when I was 8, playing Tetris on my Super Nintendo. I recalled when the bullies in my boyscout group had tied my rope into an almost incomprehensible knot. And I remembered the day I rearranged my room in the name of teenage rebellion, doubling the walking space even after I added the high-back chair for pretending I was smoking a pipe and reading by candle light. Opening my eyes, I knew I could do it.

It took three days, working for six hours at a time. But by the end, it was done. Every counter was cleared of debris, every cable and part placed in a meticulously labeled drawer. I had not only cleaned, but I had *organized*. video cables in one drawer, USB related cables in another. An entire section of drawers dedicated to packaged and unpackaged cat5 cables of various lengths and colors. Docking stations and printer supplies in the metal closet, right below the tape backups, organized by date. Software and registry keys in the filing cabinet, organized by software type and asset tag of the installed machine. My god, it was beautiful.

There was one loose end. One final thing bugging me. The office had a staff of 100 people. Each person had two monitors. Each monitor came with a VGA cable. And each VGA cable had been replaced with a DVI cable. I had 200 VGA cables, and about 50 additional VGA splitters that came with the docking stations. Far too many to put into a drawer. Far too many to hide. I had one option.

I piled them all in a box and labeled it as ""Abandon Hope All Ye Who Enter Here. Box of Forlorn Hope, Lost Purpose, and VGA Cables. DO NOT OPEN. Abandonar la esperanza todos los que entran aquí. Caja de esperanza desesperada, propósito Perdido y Cables VGA. NO ABRIR.""

I then shoved the box into the corner.

Finally, I had brought order to chaos. Of course it only lasted about a week and got trashed because nobody bothered to follow the rules of organization. Guess who got to clean up THAT mess?

**Act 3: In which a 1 becomes a 0**

Having exercised my god-like organizational prowess, I then settled into my normal routine. Answer the phone, check the tickets, read the news, play some flash games, walk the floor, etc etc. One day, I was approached with important information™. New hardware is coming in, and is expected to be here on my shift. I am to learn the inventory system, and correctly enter the new hardware.

These are the three things I was told about the inventory system: 1) The firewall uses MAC filtering and assigns static IP addresses based on the MAC. 2) Once an item has been entered into the inventory system you'll need to input it's MAC and allow the system to assign it an IP. 3) If it isn't in the inventory, it will not connect to the network.

This meant that everything, from laptops to desktops to tablets to cell phones to WAPS all needed to be activated, have their MAC address located, and set up to be allowed into both the wired network AND the wireless network (since each MAC address needs to be entered into the system)

This didn't seem so hard, and I set to work. About halfway through, my phone rings. ""I can't get internet access."" I start diagnosing, but then the phone rings again, and again. All calls are saying the same thing. I begin to tell people ""it's a known issue, we're working on it"" but the calls just keep coming. They're so numerous that they have bypassed me, filled up KungFu Managers phone, and started getting routed to the central office. Then my cellphone rings. It's KungFu Manager.

PM: ""Yeah boss?""

KFM: ""WHAT. DID. YOU. DO.""

PM: ""I didn't do ANYTHING! The new hardware showed up and I was entering everything into the system just like you showed me! Then, *schklt* the internet dies.""

KFM: ""Just like I... shit. I never taught you how to export the new DHCP table to the firewall. Oh man, this is bad.""

PM: ""What do you mean? How bad are we talking!? Did I BREAK the NETWORK!?""

KFM: ""Ok, ok... calm down. There's a small bug in the system we use. If you input too many things into the system without exporting the new DHCP list to the firewall it... kind of... um... corrupts the entire DHCP table.""

PM: ""Corrupts the... *entire*... table...""

Now, I still didn't know much about servers or even how the network was set up. But I knew what DHCP was, and I knew what it did. I also knew that if the entire table was corrupted, we were turbo-boned. Enter my savior, Ned the Neanderthal!

Ned: ""WHAT have you done to MY network!""

PM: ""Oh, it's just a small hiccup, we'll get it sorted out in a second.""

Ned: ""Okay, whats going on, and how long until we can get back to work?""

KFM: ""Is that Ned? Dammit, give him the phone, I'll handle this.""

PM: ""Here, KFM wants to talk to you.""

Ned: ""Thank god. Hey KFM, you working on this?... Whats DHCP?... I don't... I don't... so the firewall is blocking everything? Can't we just turn it off?... It's going to take HOW LONG? What about our backups? What do you MEAN we don't backup the firewall? Oh, ok... ok... ok... what am I supposed to do without internet, email, anything like that? Fine... fine... ok. Alright. Here, he wants to talk to you again.""

PM: ""So whats the plan?""

KFM: ""Hey man, don't worry. Every couple of days the system exports a script to our central office that we can use to restore most of the firewall. I've already talked to Company Owner, he'll be there in like an hour. Don't mention this to Ned, I told him we wouldn't have him back up for 24 hours.""

so when Company Owner shows up, he runs the script and restores the firewall to where it was before I FUBAR'D it. He then monitors my input into the inventory, making sure to remind me ""not to roll the dice with my precious firewall"".

The firewall had been manually programmed by company owner, and I'm torn on it. On the one hand, the firewall was obviously buggy software that gave us trouble no less than once a week and the inventory system (which had also been custom made by the same person) had the very odd ability to MURDER THE FIREWALL. Thus is was open to my scorn. On the other hand... nope, nope... I'm going with the scorn.

Also, this was not turbo-boned. I had yet to see what turbo-boned REALLY was.

**Act IV: Did you touch these?**

I was a week past my horrible learning experience involving the firewall, and had regained much of my confidence dealing with the more common issues around the office. I had just returned from trying to wrestle the *wrong* ink cartridge into one of the printers, when I noticed that there was a ticket open. The ticket reads simply as ""Please Help. No phone, No Network. Signed, Buzzcut. Sent from my iPhone.""

*Side Note - Our phones were run off of a PBX server, connected to a dedicated network. As such, the RJ45 jacks were color coded:* **white for network**, *and* **blue for phones**. *I had exactly zero access to the PBX server.*

Individually, these were both very common occurrences. Restarting the computer would usually fix that problem, and I had enough access to that network to be able to troubleshoot it if needed. As for the phone, I can only check for an IP address, cycle the power, and escalate it to the PBX admin: KungFu Manager. However, having BOTH of these happen at the same workstation simultaneously was something new. I walk to his desk praying this wouldn't end with me climbing through the ceiling looking for a cut line.

Phone is not getting an IP address. Computer is assigned an APIPA. Cant ping out, not even to the closest node. Hmmm. Time to check the cables, maybe they're... wait... where the hell are the cables?

After some searching I find them. The mounting has been COMPLETELY RIPPED out of the wall, and is now hanging over one of the desk support rails. I call Buzzcut down to my level.

PM: *pointing* ""Whats the deal with this?""

Buzz: ""I don't know, it's always been like that.""

PM: ""I... I helped set up all these work stations. In fact, I'm the one that set up this particular workstation. I remember *your* box of personal items that, for some reason, we were expected to unpack on your behalf. So I know two things. One, this has not 'always been like this' and two, you are the only person who has been assigned to this desk. So I'm going to ask you again, what is the deal with **this**?""

Buzz: ""I swear I didn't touch it, it's always been like that!""

PM: ""So you didn't touch these cables AT ALL?""

Buzz: ""Nope, I never look under the desk, I didn't even notice it was like that.""

I stare at Buzz for a second. Then look back down at the cables, then look back up at Buzz.

PM: ""Alright, I'm going to give KungFu Manager a call, and he'll start diagnosing it. I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

Buzz: ""How longs it gonna be?""

As I'm walking away, I call back over my should, ""Depends on how long it takes to find the problem!"" About an hour later, while Buzz was at lunch, I returned to his desk. Crouching down like some kind of Ninja Secret Agent Operative Spy, I disconnected the cables. I then plugged the phone into the BLUE jack, and the computer into the WHITE jack. Problem solved.

I contacted facilities and told them of a removed mounting. I notated the issue and closed the ticket. I found out later that after the mounting had been replaced, he pulled the same thing again. His reason for it was that he didn't like his phone being on the left side of his computer, and it wouldn't reach the right side. We once again returned the mounting to the wall, and provided him with a longer Cat5 cable.

**TL;DR** Our hero brings order to chaos, deletes the DHCP table, and gives a guy a longer cable so he stops ripping the mounting out of the wall.

Now, full disclosure, I wasn't tech support, more like Quality Assurance, part of my job when there was to find interface bugs, so you didn't have pilots hurtling around the world at a few hundred miles an hour being told they were higher/lower than they were and so on. 

For a 16 year old, a full mock cockpit (including HUD) is the most awesome thing ever, and you kind of play with it a little during your down time to see what is what. During one of my little play sessions (IE doing something not in a test plan) I manage to discover a fairly serious bug with the navigation interfaces, something that is comfortably within my level of clearance so I grab the guy who is supervising me and recreate the issue, at which point we call his boss down with the video camera so we can prove the issue to the guys responsible for final system integration.

So at this point in the story we have the plucky young work experience kid finding a bug that could potentially lead to a notable case of pilot disorientation in a military Jet, recording his own work to 'prove' the issue in case it just turns out to be one of the quirks of simulating some hardware. I finish up the recording and do the reasonable thing and hit the playback button...

At that moment I hear an almighty shriek from the supervisor we just called down, ""NO STOP! YOU CAN'T WATCH THAT FOOTAGE YOU DON'T HAVE CLEARANCE.""

My first post here.

So, here I go;  I work Tech Support in a very large company with over 800 Employees. It is me, and, 4 other Tech's from 7:00am to 9:00pm, so, to say we're busy is an understatement.

On a daily basis, we get our share of trouble tickets. Today, I received a ticket stating ""User logged into laptop and received a message stating that ""Explorer has stopped working and needs to close"". She closed it, but, was at her desktop background with no ICONS/Task bar and wasn't able to do anything.

Upon reading the ticket, I figured I would go to her desk and either restart explorer in the processes, and, if all else fails, do a hard boot (which i don't like to do, but, if it has to be done...)

Anyway, i get to her desk and had to do a hard boot (hold the power button in for about 5 seconds and power back on).

Her laptop booted back up and all was fine.

FFWD to the next hour when I close her ticket.

Her manager calls my boss and said ""I WANT THIS TICKET TO REMAIN OPEN UNTIL WE KNOW THE ROOT CAUSE OF WINDOWS LOCKING UP LIKE THAT"".

Keep in mind, that, this laptop runs fine. There are rarely issues with it. It is a Windows 7 Machine with 8Gig RAM, i7 processor Nvidia graphics card with a 500Gb HDD. Most of the work in our company is web based, so, this is overkill.

I just wanted to share this story because I HATE when someone that knows nothing about computers wants a root cause. how the F*&amp;k do i give a root cause of windows just locking up on a random day.

I love my job and hate it sometimes.

My previous employer basically had 2 major customers and 1 of those customers had a problem. CEO's wireless printer isn't printing anymore. There's lots of extremely important documents in the print queue that can't be wiped out.

First tech takes a stab and he tries to reinstall drivers and makes sure everything is wirelessly connected. He spent 10 minutes making sure the laptop he was connected to remotely was wirelessly connected. He couldn't find network and sharing center in XP. The documentation magically had the correct hostname(npi-2nd half of mac address) for the printer and that saved him lots of time trying to find that on the network. 2 hours later the CEO no longer wanted keep trying. He literally had the CEO doing stuff like, 'ok can you turn the printer off and on' and 'can you move the printer to somewhere else in the building maybe its not working where it is'

Next day the next tech is given a chance. The first tech was #2 guy and the next tech is the #3 guy. He changes drivers and he eventually gets CEO to plug the printer in USB and IT WORKS! Great success just use it THAT WAY.

Next day the #1 guy is given a chance. CEO obviously didnt want USB and none of the important documents have printed. Senior guy is now on the job. He asks what everyone had tried so far and he connects to the machine and instead of even attempting to fix it he misunderstands and just investigates if the printer was compatible with terminal server. Which sure that laptop does but wasn't the issue.

CEO was so mad now and my boss has a meeting. Situation gets explained and we need to make sure we fix this or we were going to get fired. Nobody has any ideas and nobody wants to go anywhere near trying to fix it. Meanwhile I was the new guy and hadn't been given a try so I volunteer. They then start giving me every little bit of info about everything that had been tried so far. I generally didn't pay much attention and asserted that I don't know what they did and I should try everything to make sure. 

My boss says, 'You're not taking this seriously. If you don't fix this, we are fired. If we get fired I need to fire you and someone else as we won't be able to afford your salaries. Just drive all the way there and don't leave until you fix it. I will call them and tell them you are on your way there.' So I drive all the way there, it was a long drive and I get paged 3 times before I even get there asking if I'd arrived yet. 

I get to this place and I walk in and introduce myself. I take a look at the computer and I was expecting it to be plugged in USB but I didn't see a printer. The CEO went and put everything back where it was. I see the print queue and there's no print error or restarting. I click off 'use printer offline' and it instantly starts printing wirelessly including about 40 test pages which most of them I managed to cancel. I apologized for the poor response time to fixing the issue and for wasting paper.

CEO asks why it took so long to get me on the case to fix it. I explained that I was new and didn't have much experience in IT and they don't really trust me yet. CEO replies, 'Well your boss just got off the phone saying you're the most experienced guy in the office and that you'll fix it in no time. You really shouldn't be so humble, good IT people are hard to come by and you should brag about how good you are.'

I say, ""Well I'm all the way out here anyway I might as well do a tuneup of your computer.' I cleaned up several things and a bunch of errors he had been dealing with were gone and he was ecstatic. I go back to my van and my pager was maxed out with pages the boss really wanted to know what was going on. I try to call the boss but it's lunch and they don't pick up. I drive back to the office. It's basically the end of the day at this point and during the drive back I tried to call a few times and nobody picked up at the office, though I tend not to call while I'm driving.

I get back to the office and explain everything that happened and that it could have been fixed remotely. I get in shit 'You should have called to tell us what happened' and I explain I tried to call several times. They say, 'You should have stayed out there until you got in contact with us in case there was other work to do.' I explain again that 'I had called several times and if I had stayed out there until basically now I would have still done no other work and it would have been night by the time I got home. Furthermore it's 4pm and I haven't had lunch so I'm going home'

I then notice he had written up my termination papers and they were on his desk. He sees me reading the paper and he doesn't say a thing. I walk out and go home for the day. All in all one of the better days of working at this job.

All went well and we didn't hear from them until the next day.

They forgot to get their customers to swipe their cards.... So they had hundreds of printed slips with signatures on them and not a single dollar to show for it.

Somehow they figured a signature was good enough and that our system would be able to infer the card details based off that information.

The result: this county is committing fraud.  It's not just the memory stick bouncing in and out, they're literally keeping two sets of books - duplicate copies of the central tabulator database file.

About 7 years ago, I was working as an agent for a well known collection of Buy More nerds in College Station, Texas.  A rather displeased gentleman, clad in flannel, overalls, boots, and a cowboy hat, walked up to my counter.  Upon the counter, he set an inexpensive Hewlett Packard printer.  He then made two trips back outside, returning once with a desktop PC and finally with a monitor.  He looked at me, points to the printer, and said, ""It don' print.""

""Ok, sir,"" I said, ""I'll be happy to help you.  Are you suggesting this machine doesn't print properly, doesn't print at all, doesn't turn on, or what, exactly?"" 

""It don' print.""

""...oooook.""

I connect everything, turn on the printer, turn on the PC, and open a new text document.  I type gibberish and ask notepad to Print.

A whirring cacophony of grinding gears and generally nasty sounds emanate from the printer.  I stare at it, somewhat confused, somewhat afraid.  I carefully lift the lid of the printer to examine its innards.

I stare inside the printer.

Stare at the client.

Stare back in the printer.

Stare at the client.

I then keep my eyes on the client as I slowly lift the printer and turn it upside-down before gently shaking it.  

Jelly beans.

Several *hundred* jelly beans poured from the printer, rattling all over the counter and falling to the floor.  I keep my eyes on the client, whose face shows no expression and remains wholly emotionless as I set the printer back on the counter.  Neither of us speak a word.  He picks up his equipment and leaves.

About 5 years back some phishing emails were sent to all of our clients offering them a link to a domain that was similar to ours saying ""**log in and confirm your email address and password or we'll turn your email accounts off**"", I'm sure many of you have seen these.

A few of our clients filled it out, realised it wasn't legit and informed us, so we quickly disabled all user accounts, changed login names and passwords and began to re-issue them.

Whilst I was on the phone to the ISP hosting the phishing site - to get it taken down - a client (we'll call him Englederp Herpadink) called to say his access was blocked. I heard my colleague clearly explain the situation and how his new login details would be faxed over in minutes. I also heard him ask and confirm that Englederp ""*has not seen the phishing email but don't worry, I always delete scams and viruses when they come in, i'm not daft*"" 

10 minutes later I received an email from Englederp. It was a forward of the phishing email saying ""**WHY ARE YOU SENDING ME THIS? I SHOULDNT NEED TO CONFIRM MY NEW DETAIS, YOU'VE ONLY JUST SENT THEM, AND I CAN'T AFFORD TO BE LOCKED OUT OF MY MAIL AGAIN. ANYWAY, I FILLED OUT THE FORM AND IT DOESN'T WORK!?!?!?**""

Thankfully, the ISP I'd been on the phone to had managed to sever the phishing site from it's database before Englederp could hand over his new details and send us back to square one.

Part of my job involves calling technicians out from other companies to service the ATMsof users who subscribe to my company's service.  I call the service company, tell them my user's problem, and the company gives me a ticket number which I then enter into the ticket system my company uses.  If customers pay an extra fee to us, we hound the service companies to make sure they service the user's ATM in a timely fashion. To clarify a point: the users are paying an extra amount that totals in the *millions* of USD.

One of my coworkers is specifically assigned to these expedited-care accounts. Her only job consists of opening tickets with service providers and checking back later for a service ETA.  She habitually sees the ETA states ""12:30 PM"" and enters into our ticketing system that the tech can be expected at midnight. 

* She's 22 and doesn't know that 12PM means noon, not midnight

* She hasn't figured out that banks are closed at midnight, as are the service companies, so it makes no sense to have an eta for midnight

* Our company uses the 24 hour military time format, so there's no excuse for getting this wrong

I read tfts all the time, but have never shared any of my stories as a small computer shop owner.  Here we go.

My last shop used to handle computer repairs for one of the rent to own franchises. We took care of repairs for 5 local franchises, and quickly discovered what a computer in a garbage bag meant.
The machines we repaired were normally returned or repossessed for non-payment. They would then turn around and sell them for a bit more than the repair cost. We were instructed that if the cost of the repair was more than what they could resell it for to just part it out to fix the other machines and return whatever was left.

Sometimes a machine would show up in a bag. They would just bring in a small truckload of machines anytime they had built up, with no discrimination on what was wrong with them. If it was in a bag, that usually meant it contained some fun surprises.

First time that one arrived in a bag no one had warned us of this, and one of my employees opened it up. The stench was horrendous. Dead cockroaches fell out all over the workstation and the floor, luckily this machine had been sitting in storage for a bit in a very tightly closed garbage bag and they were all dead.  The smell of cat piss emanating from the machine filled the air with a noxious odor.  We rushed to open the tiny window in the room and grab a new bag to shove the computer in.  The smell stuck around for a few days, even with a healthy dose of air fresheners.

From that point on if a machine came in a bag, it went into another bag just in case and went back in the same condition. At this point I think they just recycled those machines, or maybe even just threw them out (I wouldn't be surprised if they just tossed them in the dumpster most of the time.)

I had heard about these though Reddit (kudos) and thought that I would take a break from working to wind them up a little, so I played along with their game and was able to take down some of their details, which as I wasn’t able to record the call I thought I would put up here to help inform people.

They started the call by asking if my computer was having any difficulties as they were calling from The Cure Hub and Microsoft had told them that my computer was in need of repair.

Straightforward, as most people running will say that something is wrong with their computer in some way.
So they asked me what my keyboard looked like and what was next to the Ctrl key, I thought that I would play dumb so I said shift. Politely but with authority the caller, (an Indian woman in her 20’s by the sound of it) told me to look to the side, so I said the Windows key.

I was then told to press and hold Win whilst pressing R, bringing up the Run box. 

Whilst all of this was going on, I was constantly asking them to wait and put them on hold, whilst I got on with some work for a min or two. 

*I figure that if I can drag out the call then they aren’t able to scam someone else.* 

So with the run box up they ask me to type in Eventvwr to bring up the Event Viewer box, which with its usual list of warnings and reports looks scary to a lot of people. I guess that this is what help builds the con. 
After this I asked where their company was based, they said Florida, when pushed they said Florida, Clear Water and then tried to move on ASAP.

At this point the caller asked me how old my computer was and how many I had in the house, I lied and said 1 computer which was 4 years old. 

At this point she asked me to type w3{dot}thecurehub{dot}com into the run box. Showing the company website and again adding an air of professionalism. 

After being directed around the website I was then told to use the Run dialogue box to go to support{dot}me  and asked what I saw. 

At this point I was then handed over to a “the technical department” a 25-35 Indian sounding male, who stated asking me for my credit card maker, I said American Express, which caused him difficulty as apparently they can only take Visa or Mastercard. 

He explained that he needed my card details as my warrenty had expired and I needed a new one, this would be $120.

So after loading up on Google a fake American express number and giving a random expiry date I was then asked what company my savings account was. 

At this point I would hope that most people would have alarm bells ringing in their head but I once again told a little lie in the name of keeping the scammers away from potential victims.

Once I had given them the fake numbers and a random bank name I was told the support{dot}me code of 4 1 1 4 6 2 and asked to enter it into the website. 

At this point I decided to say that I had to go now, and the male caller asked me if I was going to heaven or hell, I explained I wasn’t planning on dyeing and just going to the shops, at which point I was told that I needed to sort this out now as otherwise they wouldn’t call again and I would still have all the virus and problems with my computer. I told them to wait.

I kept them on hold now for a good 5 minutes whilst I made myself a drink and came back to find them still on the line, although now back to the original woman. 

I kept pretending to have difficulty with entering the numbers in and when she demanded that I just enter the numbers and press the “Connect to technician” button I said I wasn’t, as I wasn’t in the mood to be scammed. 
At which point the woman caller started shouting “f%*!ing idiot” for about 20 seconds before slamming the phone down. 

Whilst she was shouting I did manage to ask if her parents were proud of her scamming people in between my laughs. 

All in the call lasted 25 minutes of which only about 10 minutes was actually me talking to them and the rest me asking them to wait whilst I got on with work. 

**So in short:**
Computer Virus scammer randomly  calls me, gets me to walk through everything and I get passed around the call centre and asked for bank details before I revel  that I do know what they are doing and they get hysterical and hang up. 

Now back to work.

*Velociraptor*: Yeah, you ... what's up?

*Beef MLH*: I can't fucking log in

*Velociraptor*: What?  Show me.

He pulls out his iPhone and proceeds to go to the myUniversity page, press sign in, and it doesn't work.  However, I noticed that it automatically filled out his password, and his password was the same length of his old one.

*Velociraptor*: Okay, just put in your new password this time and see what happens.

*Beef MLH*: Look I already put in my password, it does it for me

*Velociraptor*: Yeah, but it's putting in the old one.  Your iPhone doesn't know that you changed your password.

*Beef MLH*: It's a smartphone.  It knows the old password won't work.  I've got the password in.

I then spent five minutes convincing this guy to just **fucking type it in manually before I rip my own trachea out** before I have an idea.

*Velociraptor*: Okay, fine, let me sweep it for a virus.

He hands me the iPhone.  I type in his new password manually.  It works.

*Beef MLH*: uhh what just happened

*Velociraptor*: I changed your password manually, and set it to auto-login from there with the new password.

*Beef MLH*: but... okay

He promptly left without saying a word.  I promptly went to drown my sorrows in a bucket of fried chicken.

I'm in college to become a game programmer. Currently I'm doing an internship at my school and hopefully I will graduate next year. Every day I go to my tiny office to toil away at a simulation game to help disabled children.

And I do mean it's a *tiny* office. What the school did was basically take the end of a floor and cordon it off with cheap walls (you know, the type where you can't put a nail in because it might bring down the wall). It doesn't have airconditioning, it doesn't have a window that can be opened and there are four desktops + a bunch of laptops heating it up.

There are four of us here, but two (the art girls) are working on a different project, a virtual supermarket. For the past few weeks they've been building and labeling virtual products in Maya (ed: a professional 3D modeling tool). It's what we call ""monk's work"", because in the old days, monks would copy the entire Bible by hand.

But yesterday, one of the teachers came in in a bit of a panic. Turns out they needed all this stuff done today, preferably *yesterday* because they had to resort to doing simulations on screenshots instead of the real scene.

One of the problems, the girls complained, was that they had convert all the textures from PNG to DDS. I wasn't really listening, because this wasn't my project, but somehow those words bounced around in my head. And they connected to... AssetBuilder.exe! You see, for our own project, I had already solved this project. I was sick of loading times that ran into the minutes, so I wrote a tool (using some open source NVIDIA code) to convert PNG and TGA images to DDS textures.

I told them that I would tweak it for a bit and they were ecstatic! It worked very well, converting all images to textures automatically.

Then, the teacher came back with some new bad news: all the items had to be labeled. That meant loading the scene in Maya, selecting an object, clicking on a MEL script and entering ""product"" in the ""Node ID"" field. For 1700 products. The girls estimated it would take 10 hours to do that by hand.

Seeing my previous success with automation, the teacher turned to me. Couldn't I, you know, do some programming magic on the script to automate it? I told him I had never done MEL scripting (ed: Maya's scripting language) but I'd give it a shot.

I quickly realized I was in way over my head. Fixing the script would require understanding how it worked and it was *massive*. I abandoned it and focused instead on the end result. You see, the script was for a converter. And it would convert selected objects to an Ogre .scene file. Which is... XML!

So I glanced over it and it was full of definitions like this:

    &lt;node name=""awesomeProduct001"" id=""""&gt;
         &lt;mesh name=""AwesomeSpread"" /&gt;
    &lt;/node&gt;

Luckily, Notepad++ was installed, so I wrote a quick regex:

     From: &lt;node name=\""(.*?)\"" id=\""\""&gt;
     To: &lt;node name=""\1"" id=""product""&gt;

I ran it and saw those magic words on the screen, saving them 10 hours of work: 1739 items converted. 

I can't say I blame them for not trying to automate it, they're art people after all. But when you're a programmer, everything looks like an opportunity for automation. :)

We use a fingerprint biometric time clock and we have one employee out of 200 that just doesn't work. No matter what we tried she couldn't use the time clock (not her fault), so we came up with a simple solution that she could use the computer at the front desk to punch in and out rather than writing her hours down so her supervisor could enter them in manually. 


She is a nice lady, late 60's early 70's, but not the sharpest tool in the shed. Thinking I solved this pain in the ass problem so I run down stairs to tell her the great solution (writing her hours down had led to her being both under and over paid on different weeks, high five for great work to the assistant GM). I turn on the computer and a look of bewilderment comes over her face, I should have stopped there, but overeager me...

I log into the computer on my account and tell her that we will give her an account to use, she looked dumb founded. The rest of the conversation went like this:

MCwaffle89: Ok Niceoldlady so I am going to walk you through logging in to payderps website so you can punch in and out online. First click on Internet Explorer, the ""E"" looking think on the desktop.


Nice Old Lady: How? ::she points at the monitor::


MCwaffle89: Use the mouse to move over to it and double click on it.
::with this she picks up the mouse like she is moving a faberge egg and points it at the monitor like a magic wand or tv remote::
No niceoldlady just move it around on the desk and the cursor will move on the screen.

Niceoldlady: huh? ::puts mouse down and delicately moves it around still bewildered:: How do I click on things?!

MCwaffle89: Use the left click on the mouse.

niceoldlady: I don't understand.


At this point I just get her into payderp.com and make the final mistake...


Mcwaffle89: ok niceoldlady so just use the keyboard to type in your time in for this morning. ::slides out the keyboard::

at this point her face looks like I put a thermonuclear device in front of her and said ""disarm this now"".


At this I gave up and said just keep writing your hours down we will do our best to make sure you get paid! She has sat next to this computer for years and never once has she turned it on or used it for more than a paperweight...

I don't work in IT but I am a CIS student, so I'm generally the go-to guy for anyone in my family with some sort of technology issues. 

So, Enter my grandfather. The man is in his 70's and is so technologically illiterate that we had to explain to him what a DVD was in 2008. All he used his computer for was word, and outlook, which he'd figured out how to use competently enough. Through an unimportant process of events earlier in the year, he had purchased a pre-built machine and had me install it (essentially just plug it in, remove the bloatware that came with it, and install office). I had it set up so that at all he had on his desktop was word, outlook, and IE  ( I tried to switch him to chrome but the different look confused him and he didn't want to take the time to learn it, much to my chagrin) at this point all is good.

Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end as he approached me a few months later saying his internet wasn't working. No worries I figured, probably just a networking cable came loose or something. So i drove over to his house to take a look. I immediately found more bloatware on his desktop, I knew this wasn't going to be good. I tried to recreate whatever issues he was facing so i opened up IE and was immediately greeted by one of those ""super search now etc..."" add ons that pop out and take up half of your page, lovely. At this point I realize hes probably messed this machine up so bad that I'd rather fix it at my place, so I let him know that I was going to take it home and "" make it be like how it was when I set it up for him"". cue my deepest fear, "" oh no, don't do that"" he said ""I just paid somebody to fix it.""

YOU WHAT?

""yeah"" he explained ""a thing came up saying i had a bunch of errors but they could fix it, so i called the number they gave me and talked to a guy in Toronto and he said he fixed it after I paid him""

oh grandpa...

at this point I told him he'd been duped and had to go through the song and dance of cancelling his credit card and ordering a new one. I was a little over my head with fixing the machine, so I offloaded it to a buddy of mine and gave him a gift card to a coffee shop as payment.

Until recently (promotion, woo!), I was a Help Desk worker drone for a small hospital system. We are the the first line of defense for the hundred or so programmer analysts, networking techs, engineers, clinical IT educators, etc who work downstairs from us. We are in a small building behind one of the main hospitals in this system (there are four very large acute hospitals and dozens of smaller off-sites who we do IT support for). If a nurse/doctor/aide/finance analyst/janitor/delivery person/outside vendor or pretty much anyone at one of these sites has a computer issue, we receive the call and try to fix it or pass it along to the proper group for later resolution. Simple fixes such as password resets, local print server power-cycling, patient data resends... those are first call resolution and we have it done in minutes. Difficult issues, ones that require in-depth work, or systems we have no access to get sent off into the ticketing system void.

A few days ago I received a frantic call from a doctor... below is a fairly accurate transcript of the call (I recorded it with my call-taking program as he became belligerent right off the bat and listened to it later with my supervisor). I apologize for the block of text but it's burned into my head so I'll give the entire conversation rather than a summary. Feel free to skip to the bottom for a TL;DR.

Doc: I can't log in. You need to fix it for me.

Me: Okay, sir. What program are we having an issue with?

Doc: I can't view images. It's not letting me log in and I need to log in right now. I have a patient with me, I need to be able to view images.

Me: Images? Okay so are these [Clinical Program 1] documents?

Doc: No. No. It's not that. Xray images. You need to fix it so I can log in.

Me: Okay, so [Imaging Program 1]? Is that the program?

Doc: Yes. And this is ridiculous, I shouldn't have to be calling for this, it's not accepting my password.

Me: Right. Well we can reset it for you and...

Doc: I don't need a reset. You need to fix the program. There's something wrong, it won't accept my password. I've used this one for years.

Me: Well I apologize for any inconvenience but a reset should get you right in.

Doc: Fine but I want someone to look into why it won't take my password.

Me: [Wishing I could tell him it's because he doesn't *know* his password...] Definitely, sir. Let me just get some of your information.

He answers all my requests for his name, ~~username~~, department info, etc.

[Edit: I didn't get his username, sorry. I was just listing things that I usually grab. Anyway, even if I had gotten it, we don't have access or even accounts for that system so I have no idea what the standard format is nor the # of characters...]

Me: Alright well let me send this over to our [Imaging System] Analyst so they can reset that for you.

Doc: What? No, I need you to reset it for me right now.

Me: Right. Well I'm going to give this ticket to the team responsible for that system so that they can...

Doc: No, no no no. I need to log in *right now.* I have a patient.

Me: I understand, sir. So I'll send this over to the analysts and they can reset this for you immediately, it shouldn't take long.

Doc: I don't think you **understand.** I can't wait on this. Why won't you reset it for me now?

Me: Because I can't. I don't have that ability.

Doc: Why? Why can't you just reset it? You reset passwords all the time!

Me: We do but I don't have access for this system.

Doc: What, why?

Me: Because we administrate *hundreds* of programs in IT sir and the Help Desk does not work on them all. [Program] is one of the many which we don't even have a login for. So let me just send this over to the analysts...

Doc: No. That's not what you're going to do. *What you're going to do* is give me the phone number of the person who fixes this, right now, and *I'll* take care of this then.

Me: [Furious at being told that I should disregard multiple policies as well as go directly against our workflow *and* give out internal numbers so that an angry doctor can get priority because he forgot his password, I pause for a few seconds.] So if you'll let me get working on this the analyst can reset that right away.

Doc: [angry laugh] You obviously aren't listening to what I'm saying. I'm going to have to take this somewhere. I'm sure Dr. [Person] (the president of our IT group) would love to hear why you're refusing me service.

Me: [pausing again] I'm going to send this ticket on, would you like me to call the analyst right now? I can put you on hold for thirty seconds while I call them up directly.

Doc: Fine. That will work.

Me: Is that okay?

Doc: Yes.

At this point I am, of course, furious. My text above may not fully encapsulate the level of condescension in his voice when telling me that I didn't understand or while he told me how to do my job. I call out to both of the analysts responsible for the system and leave voicemails on both of their cell phones. I call both of their desk phones, hoping that they won't ignore those as well... and then I receive a call back. Analyst A has called me back, unhappy that I'm calling for a simple password reset. Doctor Anger has been on hold for a few minutes now and I see the light stop blinking as he hangs up the line. Analyst A gives me the doctor's username and a new provisional password; I thank him. Analyst B calls up and I explain that the situation is now fixed. Time to call back Dr. Hissyfit.

Doc: Yes?

Me: It's War_Whale from the Help Desk. I have your password.

Doc: You told me thirty seconds. I was on hold for five minutes.

Me: Yes, sir, I apologize. I had to make four calls and could not reach anyone at first.

Doc: What is it.

Me: Okay so the new password is ""Welcome1."" Capital double-you on that and the numeral one. Try that for me.

Doc: ..... no. [exasperated sigh] It doesn't *work.*

Me: Give it one more try for me.

Doc: But I'm telling you... no. It's **not working.** Did you even reset it?

Me: So we're typing ""Welcome1"" correct? Caps lock is off, number lock is on if you need it...

Doc: This is silly. Yes. Yes, I know all that.

**TL;DR A doctor asked me to ""fix"" a program because it wasn't taking the password he had been using for years (the program was obviously broken as there was no way he could have forgotten his password). Not having access to his username or password, I offer him a ticket, he freaks out and threatens my job if I don't connect him to an analyst immediately. After eventually contacting the admin for the program and resetting his password it turns out that... well... he didn't need a password reset! Because he forgot his username.**

I haven't gone from so angry to so happy that quickly in my 5 years doing Help Desk work. That poor bastard. Now the guy has been recorded harassing a Help Desk worker over an incredibly simple and fast ticket which 1) didn't warrant the level of service he was asking for and 2) was entirely his fault. Seeing as standard protocol for recorded issues like that is for my manager to call the caller's manager (mainly to head off any complaints that the caller may come up with about us), I think it might be interesting to see what the manager/director thinks about the doctor's threat to call up the President of IT.

It's a code issue!,533,95,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1j5tke/of_course_i_set_the_roles_its_a_code_issue/,"Good morning TFTS! This would be my first story to share here so a little background of me.

I'm not primarily a system administrator. I instead work as a developer that works on various ongoing projects when they approach their due dates to go out into the world and maintain them once they do. Part of this does entitle me to some sysadmin work when tickets for software float to my level though the only access I really get is to the source code (which entitles me to tell people that they're wrong about using the software when they are and they cannot do a thing about it).

So a few days back I'm working double time to meet some crazy deadlines for another project when my e-mail box gets one that reads ""Ticket for Software-X 9999999"" from the helpdesk e-mail provided to the tier above me. Normally I'd be happy to look at it but I was a bit stressed from doing other things and having QA teams pinging me every 5 minutes interrupting my work. I took a look at it and it read:

User is encountering a 403 error when accessing the application

Okay no big deal and an easy fix. That means they don't have the right access roles or their account is messed up. I told them to check the roles and if they set them right and to redo it if they need to.  Fast forward to yesterday and even more stressed out since the due date for new implementations on the other project was upon us and another e-mail comes in with the same ticket number.  This time it read:

We had the other support guys check and they swear they have the correct roles. They told the client having issues to check and compare her account with her coworkers (which was the wrong one to check BTW). The client had responded back stating that everything was right and that we're the ones wrong. The support desk told me they only checked the roles and asked for more troubleshooting help

Bit annoyed at the tone the e-mail was taking but it wasn't that bad. Knowing the source code, I knew there was only one check for a 403 error and it was specifically for their account roles. I told them this and CC'd someone who knew about the security setup that we had integrated with the application and he can check the databases more thoroughly than I.

About 10 minutes later the security guy responds back with this golden line:

""Account does not exist in the subsystem. Please create it with the right roles""

My mind back-flipped and landed on the desk. How could they even check and verify the correct roles on a non-existent account? Sounds to me the the front most tier isn't doing their job properly.

I used to work on front-end issues in 3rd line support for a software company based in the UK that sells trading software to all the big global Tier 1 investment banks. We have lots of smaller (investment funds) customers as well. 


You'd be suprised how many people working at those smaller investment companies don't know what version of Windows their running, where to find 'Program Files', or how to include attachements to emails, while making a lot more money than us. But one of my best Tales did not so much question his technical ability as his job competance in the financial sector! So here it goes... 


The user who had an issue was a remote user based in Dubai. Which means he was a customer of one of our customers (let's call our customer MoneyMakers plc.) Basically we allow MoneyMakers plc. to sell our software to their customers. This makes it a bit harder to trouble shoot as the ticket comes from MoneyMakers plc. and we can not pull log-files remotely etc.. 


The user was complaining that his '1 day chart', showing the daily evolution of the stock prize of that day, was not working (i.e. no datapoints). It seemed a peculiar issue, because his other charts (e.g. one week, one month), were working fine. The software, data request/replies and permissions for those work all the same, and we didn't find anything wrong with any of those on our test or live systems. 
Because the user was in Dubai and communication reached us through MoneyMakers plc., this issues was dragging on for a while without a resolution, mainly as well because the affected user was not getting back to us with answers and when he did he got back with a lot of anger but not so much information. At some point even a remote session was set up with the user in Dubai and a video recorded in order to verify the issue was actually happening. Indeed the video showed an empty chart when he clicked on the 'one day chart' tab. At this point our first and second line of support was baffled and had no idea what could be causing this malfunction so it ended up with me in 3rd line support.


When I was about to read the content of the ticket, MoneyMakers plc. called me up to tell me the user was seriously pissed of and wanted the issue fixed before the end of his working day in Dubai or he would cancel his subscription.  

I immediately phoned up the user around 17:26 his local time, to ask him everything I could think of and walk him through putting on higher logging levels and sending me those log files. The user was pretty unhelpful and I first had to listen to him ranting for a good 3 minutes about how much we suck before he would answer my questions and help me obtain the logging. 

I immediately replicated the steps to replicate the issue on one of our test systems with an arbirary UK stock to produce a similar log-file to compare for differences. When I was comparing the two, I didn't see any immediate differences in communication between the front-end and the server in my log and his, other than that mine was getting thousands of data-points back from the server while his got only a few. And then it struck me: The poor guy was looking at a US stock traded on NYSE which only opens at around 17:30 his local time.


I left it to MoneyMakers plc. to inform the remote user collegially about his stupidity. 


TL;DR: Trader based in Dubai trading on the US stock market doesn't know about time zones.

I was walking home from the library, which is this 18-year-old's most common hang-out. On my way, I over heard the sounds of frustration coming from a small office. I looked (Stealth-mode) through the window to see that a middle aged man was having issues with a computer. I'm currently attempting to get a degree in Computer Engineering, so I thought ""Eh... what the hell. The worst that will happen is that he sues me.""

So, I walk into the office, say hi to the lady closest to the door, and walk quickly to the man. 

I tell him I over heard his situation, and tell him about my WIP degree. He tells me this:

""I'd love to let you help, but I can't trust you with one of the office's systems. How do I know you're not some thief?""

So, I did what every self-respecting teenager would do when they really want to do something. I did the most irrational thing possible. I handed him both of my shoes and told him:

""I can't run away without shoes, now can I?""

He looks very shocked for a second and then presides to give me the deepest, most Santa-like laugh I have ever witnessed. Now that I had gained his trust, he explained the issue to me.

Every now and then, when he would start to run something slightly resource intensive, the system would blue screen. This wasn't possible, because the system was brand new and he looked over the parts list himself to make sure it could handle what he needed. This was a VERY high-end rig. (To much for what he needed, if you really want to know.) He showed this, and then let me do my thing.

First thing I did was check the system information, found the problem there. What should be 4GB of DDR3 RAM, was only 2GB, and it was running very slow.

* Step 1: Open case
* Step 2: Locate RAM
* Step 3: Push the RAM stick a little to make sure it's in all the way
* Step 4: Hear satisfying ""Click"" of RAM
* Step 5: Laugh at how small of a problem it was

I am now working for this small company making $10/hour. The guy I helped turned out to be the owner. He also bought me lunch as payment for finding the issue.

When he pulled off the heat sink, he saw the ""weird grey goo"". **So he wiped the melted processor off the bottom of the heatsink.** Yup. Apparently when a processor overheats, it melts and sticks to the bottom of the heatsink. Then he installed the new processor and *forgot to plug the fan back in*.

The case fans were enough, apparently, to let him use the computer for a couple hours at a time. Then one day, the system just stopped shutting off on him. This lasted for a bit, then the system started to bluescreen.

I'll admit my knowledge of processors and circuit boards aren't as in-depth as I would like. Basically it's ""Yup, thats fast"" or ""Yup, thats gotta be replaced"". My best guess is that the processor got damaged and the auto-shutoff failed. Then the case fans got clogged with gross. Then the CPU fan melted.

Either that or he left it out in the Texas sun in July.

One of the perks of my last job was my ability to do this.  Multiple times over the course of some years.  So, ladies and gentlemen, I give you Jenny.

Jenny is a mid-40's businesswoman.  She has no time for us, needs her stuff back yesterday type of person.  She always brings it in screaming it needs to be done NOW NOW NOW and when we call her to tell her its done she comes to pick it up a week later.  And she always nitpicks small stuff. 

Formatted her HDD and her icons aren't how she had em?  Phone call.  Did a virus cleanup and that shopathometoolbar vanished?  Phone call.
Replace her PSU and now she has to flip the power cord upside down?  You get the idea.  SOMETHING will always prompt her to call or bring it back.  But, she paid and it wasn't that big of a deal.

One day Jenny brings her computer in because it's making a loud thumping sound whenever she turns it on and won't do anything.  Her HDD had died.  Thankfully only some of her data was unrecoverable.  Freezer trick did nothing for the rest.  I explained to her that I could not get everything (Vista system, only My Documents and Downloads were inaccessible and a few stray pictures from My Pictures) but I could get something. 

I also, clearly, explained that I would not be able to make any guarantees on what we could or could not save for her.  Gave her a price, got an ok, saved what I could and swapped out her drive.

She picks it up the night we're going to a store meeting.  It was me, two other techs, the two owners and the secretary.  Typically these meetings were mostly to go over how the locations were doing (At this point we were three stores) and to share information we might have.  New cleanup tools, new methods of doing things.

During the meeting the closed sign is off, the door is locked, and the front lights of the store are off.  We are so obviously closed the only way to make it more apparent is to board up the windows.

Jenny walks up and yanks on the door so hard she actually slams herself against it.  She then proceeds to begin banging on it like she was being chased by the hounds of hell.  My boss looked at me and motioned for me to see what she wanted.

As I was walking to the door I could hear her cussing.  I opened it to a bombardment of screaming and cussing about her missing stuff.  Over the next ten minutes, with my boss coming to help figure out what was up, we determined that she was pissed off that she lost her quickbooks data.  

I reminded her of our phone conversation, and that I had made no promises to getting everything.  The quickbooks file is normally under My Documents, so if she would have asked specifically I could have told her.  She also went on about her contacts in Outlook 07 missing.

Her response, however,w as ""I know, but I didn't think that would be one of the things missing.""  I just stared at her blankly before telling her that yes, it was, now how can I help her?

""I want my money back.  I paid you because I thought you could save my quickbooks.""  After some serious threatening on her part, I finally told her to bring her PC back the next day and I would make sure she got her money back.

She brought the pc in, I swapped out the HDDs once more and handed her back her money.  An hour later she calls up screaming that her computer no longer worked.  I told her of course not, since she got a refund I took the new HDD back and put her old one back in there.  ""Why!?  I need this for work!""  
""Well, if you want it fixed it's going to cost money.""
""I already paid you!""
""And you got the money back.  Also we just sold that hard drive, we can order you a new one if you want it working though.""
""How much and how soon?""
""I think we can do it for about $500 and by next week.""  No, we did not charge that much or take that long.  I was just sick of dealing with this woman.  After her screaming she could buy a new PC for that cost, I told her it would be best if she did.  From Best Buy.  and hung up.

The email had been sent 7 minutes prior. 

Looking over the steps I get an idea.

Paraphrased, but pretty close:


Me: Okay, so you tried ALL of the steps?

Him: Yeah.

Me: Including the steps at the bottom?

Him: Yes.

Me: So you updated the router's firmware?

Him: Yup.

Me: And you unplugged the router and left it off for a full 10 minutes?

Him: Um, yeah.

Me: In 7 minutes?

Him: Uh... *pause* Yeah I'll go do that now. *hangs up.*


Far as I know he didn't call back.

TL;DR: Customer claimed to wait a full 10 minutes in 7 minutes.

And since I'm the only one in my entire family who has a modern computer-based education, I'm expected to fulfill the role of free family tech support. You can see where this is going.

So my mother is out on business trip to Chicago, and I receive a frantic phone call in the middle of a DnD session between my friends. 

Mom: ""Seioch! My phone's wifi isn't working, can you turn it on and connect it for me?""

Me: ""Sure, just go to-""

At this point, something hits me. Her phone has 4G capabilities, meaning that she should have enough data anywhere in a 4G enabled city to do basic email and internet works. And knowing that her hotel is in downtown Chicago I highly doubted that she would be out of a 4G network zone, much less outside a legacy data network. Also, those hotels charge you an arm and a leg to use their wifi.

Me: ""Waaaaaait a minute, don't you have data?""

Mom: ""Of course I do, but I have to pay for it to use it!""

Me: ""Uhh... yes, we pay for it every month so we can call and text each other. You should have a data connection...""

Mom: ""But I can't use it!""

Me: "" &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; Press the home button (She's on android ICS) and take a look, does the big black bar on top say 4G?""

Mom: ""Yes Yes YES. Seioch! But they're charging me to use data!""

I work at a WISP (If you don't know what that means, that's an internet provider which, instead of using phone cables, uses wireless towers and antennae attached to people's homes to distribute the internet) where I do mostly front desk support. 

I got a call from a gal named Pink. Pink had been having problems with her internet not working. She assured me she had re-started her computer and her router multiple times, but to no avail. A quick glance into the tower revealed that her antenna on her home was not connecting. 

Okay. I got this. Probably just no power getting to the antenna.

I have pink follow the cable from the router towards the wall where it comes in from the external antenna on the roof of her home. Halfway there she finds a little box which sends power to the antenna. (POE)

Sure enough, the normally green light is orange. I have her un-plug the box and plug it back in again. Still orange. 

I send a tech with a new POE. He installs it easily enough, but still can't get a signal. Weird. He goes to check the antenna outside. He stands below the house, looking up at the roof. There's a TV dish... but... There, dangling from the attic vent is a frayed cable.

""I don't see your antenna."" he says.

""Well where did you put it?"" Pink asks, belligerently. 

""It should be right there. What's with those cords hanging out of the attic vent?""

Anyway, where were we?  

Ah, yes. The tale of **Genesis and the X-Files**.

---  

So after I'd made [such a good impression on my boss](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/s68b1/chapter_2_in_which_i_make_a_first_impression/), I showed for work the next day and ran smack-bang into The Eight-Hour Server Fix.  

This is not that story.  

*This* story is about the documentation that the Helpdesk I'd just started working for had. Or, rather, hadn't. They had literally nothing - no cheat sheets, no wiki, no spreadsheets or databases of various equipment, no nothing. And their ticketing system was mainframe-based: information went in, but it was all plain text, non-searchable except by userID, and with no asset functions.  

So I started keeping notes.  

Eventually, the notes I kept grew large enough to be cumbersome, then unwieldy, then gargantuan. And they had started to attract the usual debris - useful EXE files, scripts I threw together to automate various things and check information for me, that sort of stuff. So I created a subfolder deep on a little-used server, off one of the near-root-level folders that users couldn't generally access, and dumped everything there. Then I took a step back, created a logical structure of references, populated the structure with the relevant information and files, wrote an index reference explaining what everything was and what it all did, and then put all of my support information and repair how-tos into a spreadsheet. Keep in mind this was around the turn of the century, and the Department I was in was still contemplating a move to Windows 95 on their desktops. A wiki might have broken their brains.  

   
Thus it was written, and thus it was done. And I did go to each tech on the Helpdesk, and I did map X: to this new folder and tell them to look there for useful things. And thus did this little subfolder became known as the X Drive, and the contents as the X-Files, mainly because if we encountered something bizarre, that's where we documented it. And by ""we"" I mean ""me"", as none of the rest of the techs ever contributed a damn thing.  

Anyway.  

The spreadsheet with all the quick fixes grew, and grew, and grew, and started getting referred to as the Support Bible. Which made my first iteration, of course, Genesis. Genesis expanded further, and eventually turned into version 2, then version 3, and eventually 3.04g (for gold version). 3.04g was... special. It was written to be the Ultra-Complete Maximegalon Dictionary of Every Fix Ever, and it was the first version not written for in-house techs. There would never be another version written, and the changes wrought upon it meant its name could no longer be Genesis.

   
The story of *Exodus*, however, lies at the very end of this particular job, more than a year into the future. After the Vampire Slayer, after the doggy porn pouring out of the executive printer, and after the mind-twisting horror of Cthulhu's Desktop.  

   

All those stories, and many others, came from this one job. Including, yes, That One Call. Which, of course, is a tale for another time...

The good thing about this job is a lot of our clients are courteous and at least somewhat competent. 

*Mostly.*

I received a phone call from an office tech one day a few years ago. He had a few basic questions about installing our software to a new sever and what our system requirements are. While I email him the documents I decided to ask him why they're changing servers; did the old one die or did they just want an upgrade?

He sighed and started to tell me the story of what happened to the server..

The office staff came in that morning and started to power on their computers to ready to start their business day. When they tried to open our software on their workstations they received an error stating the software couldn't make a network connection to the server.

At this point they called their tech to report their network was down
Their tech drove to their office to see what has happened. When he came in he went to the server, or rather, where the server should be. Because, you see, where there should have been a server was just an empty spot under a desk.

He asked them where that computer went. Their response? 

""Oh, it didn't turn on this morning, so we threw it away. We never use that computer anyway!""

***That's right. They threw their server into the trash.***

He went out to the dumpster to see if it was salvageable, but as fate is a cruel bitch, the garbage men had already picked it up.

God! I love my mute button, for I was trying my best not to laugh and failing horribly!

Not only did they toss out their server, but we then discover that the office has not been doing their regular backups (why it wasn't automated is a mystery to me). The last backup they had was from around a year before the incident. So, not only did they trash their server, they also trashed a years worth of patient records and financial information.

One call that sticks out all these years later started with a Mom asking me if I could talk to her daughter because she knew nothing about computers. I told her I gladly would, this is where it gets interesting

Daughter: When I try to connect it's telling me there is no dial tone

Me: Ok, lets start by taking a look at the phone cable plugged into the back and make sure it's seated in the wall and in the computer

Daughter: What do you mean phone line? I don't need a phone line to connect to ISP (keep in mind this was in 1997-98ish)

Me: In order to connect to the ISP you will either need a phone line or a T1 connection 

Daughter: (Who is screaming at this point) You're an idiot, I don't need a phone line or connection it should just work

I was fed up at this point because the daughter would not budge so I asked to speak to the mother again at this point.

Me: Mam, please take a look at the back of your computer, do you see any phone jacks on the back

Mom: Yes, I do, but there isn't anything in them

Me: You will need to connect to a phone line to connect to ISP

Mom: Oh, could you hold on for a moment?

This is a short story is about my mother. 

Anyway, while talking with her today on the phone, [we live several hours apart] she was telling me about a problem she was having with her laptop yesterday. It was apparently caught in some type of booting loop, and she couldn't get it to stop. She tried taking out the battery, and unplugging it and that didn't fix it. Obviously at this point she was frustrated and worried about having to pay to get it fixed if I couldn't fix it over the phone. 

She then proceeds to tell me that she decided to take it to work with her the next day so should could **google** the problem before calling me about it. She did, and she read that if you held down the power button for ten seconds to cut the computer off, and then turn it back on, that would fix it. *It did* 

I cannot describe how proud that made me of my mother, not only did she try taking out the battery, she then proceeds to google the problem and fix it herself. 

Even more to my amazement, while on this same phone conversation, I find out something else she recently did. They had been paying $30ish dollars a month for digital phone at the house. However, she had just found it easier to forward that number to her cell phone most of the time anyway, as they are often not at home. [They have had this number for over 20 years and she didn't want to get rid of it.] I had told her that there are companies that you can get to park your number and just have it forwarded to another number, and that they could probably save some money that way. 

So come to find out, that is exactly what she did. In her words: *""I went online and googled about companies that had that service, and then I googled to see if their were many complaints about the companies I was looking at, and looked at their facebook pages.""*

I worked for a company that we will call ""The Flying Tech"". The Flying Tech was primarily an IT contractor, but had recently decided to expand and open a retail service location. This is where our hero, PolloMagnifico, enters the scene.

I began working retail IT at a now-defunct store (I swear, back in those days that store seemed as big as a *city*) that has since been acquired by another company and gone to online-only sales. I saw my shares of emergencies. From the vista-era, the XP machines with 512 and 1024 memory that had been upgraded to vista to sell old units. The problems with dell and hp laptops becoming unbootable after losing power in hibernate mode. And, let us not forget, the constant customers upset that we had sold them a computer that they couldn't install old windows 95 software on.

Yes, it was a glorious time. And I was happy... for awhile. But soon my thoughts drifted towards more impressive things. What exactly was this SQL thing? How does Java fundamentally differentiate itself from JavaScript? What is POP3 and IMAP and DHCP and DNS and why should I care?

When my company decided to stop paying employees, I buckled down. I invested in myself. I earned my A+ thinking to myself *""This will help me land a job doing the REAL IT work!""*  

Wrong.

Instead it got me doing retail IT for *minimum wage* at The Flying Tech.

 

**Act II: Internet History Doesn't Lie. Neither Do Your Eyes**

My first week on the job, I had a customer come in. I was still nervous and squeaky working the register, and the shine hadn't come off the job yet. A nice looking woman comes in, and tells me that her sweet sweet little Jimmy's computer isn't working anymore, and she want's to know how much it's going to cost to fix it. Apparently, when someone logs into the internet, the first website that pops up is ""that dirty sinful pornography!"" And after about ten minutes of use the computer just shuts down.

I'm thinking virus. I tell her I can take the system in for our standard diagnostic fee, which will be refunded to her if she opts to get service done. I tell her it seems like it's a virus, but I would need to run some tests and confirm that. I tell her what the cost is for a virus removal, she says OK, and I tell her I'll call her back once I've confirmed.

I set the computer down, load up MBAM, and let it run. I continue work on some of the other systems I have, and when I return to that one the system is off. Odd.

So I power it back on again, and let it boot. Take a quick look at start up and services, run HijackThis, can't find anything. Then I open up internet explorer. Front page is MSN. I mentally facepalm, and find a Firefox link on the desktop.

Now, I'm an adult. I have seen ladybits in my time. And, well, I have the internet, so I've also seen some disturbing things. So right now, I am telling you that *what I saw was too disturbing to relate to people ON REDDIT*. No, it wasn't CP.

I open the bookmarks. Porn.
I look through some folders on the desktop. Porn.
This computer has close to 350gig of porn on it.

Then it clicks. This woman was on the younger side, around the age of 35. Her kid is probably between the ages of 12 and 17. I load up MBAM for another run, when the system suddenly shuts off again. How odd.

I hit the power button again, system posts, starts loading windows... and dies immediately before finishing boot. Ah-HAH! Heating problem. I pull off the side panel, preparing to check the fans, and see a big pile of roaches lying on the bottom of the case.

Remember that, because I'm going to come back to it. I set a fan to blow on the system, and power it on again. Confirm all the fans are running. Must be dust buildup. I remove the little green dell air-flow thing that's resting over the heat sink and find...

the thickest, nastiest, stickiest brownest goo I have ever seen.

I recognize it immediately. See, the roaches on the bottom of the case were not the kind that scurry around and live in dumpsters. They were the kind you smoke.

And that particular nasty buildup was a combination of dust, cigarette smoke, and cannabis resin.

This is not going to be fun. Pull the HDD, connect to USB bridge, run remote scan, scan comes back negative.

Pick up the phone.

**Act III: All the Boring Crap**

Now, usually, I'm pretty good at estimating the final cost of service. I don't like having to call my customers back and explain that the cost is going to be something different. It always results in alot of complaints and questions, despite the fact that this is *exactly why we do the diag, then give a quote*. Normally, we will happily blow out a computer for the cost of the diagnostics fee and hand it back to the customer. But this requires much much more than that. This requires a Q-tip, a bottle of alcohol, some thermal paste, and at least an hour. Since we have freedom on pricing for ""non-standard services"" I opt to tell my customer it's going to be $100.

Naturally, she wants to know whats going on. Hoo-boy. I don't want to throw her kid under the bus, so I tell her that the reason the computer is shutting off is because there's substantial dust build up and it requires an extensive cleaning.

""What, you're charging me $100 to go at it with a can of compressed air?""

*shitshitshit* ""Well no ma'am, the build up has gotten so bad that the dust is actually too thick to blow out. It's going to require a partial disassembly to ensure that we can get proper airflow through your system, so as to avoid any further heat-related damage.""

She accepts this, and I begin my work. It's nearing the end of the day at this point, so I don't manage to finish. She calls back the next day, asks me whats taking so long. I tell her I need to finish still, then run a complete hardware diag to ensure there isn't any heat damage then stress-test the system to ensure the overheating issue is completely resolved (because I'm thorough like that).

I get all that done, make a few changes to firefox, and call the lady back up. I ask if her kid can come with her so I can share some maintenance tips to make sure this doesn't happen again. She graciously agrees.

**Act IV: In which our Hero Saves the Day!**

The woman comes to pick up the computer, with her kid (I was right, he was about 15) following behind her looking like he was walking the green mile. Introductions are made, and I lean over the counter and stare right into the kids eyes.

""I opened your case...""

And I will never forget the look of COMPLETE HORROR that crossed his face.

""... it was pretty dirty in there, had to do a lot of work to get that clean for you.""

The kid takes a huge gulp and calms down a bit, and nods at me. I nod back.

I go through the standard talk... does it get good circulation, are you keeping it off the floor, make sure none of the intakes are covered, this is how you blow it out, how often you should, blah blah. I finished with this line.

""Soon as you get home and get set up, I left you a text file on your desktop. It will help you stay away from viruses and it has a little more info on it.""

The kid breathes a sigh of relief, and he gets ready to leave. Before they go, the mother says to me ""I'm so glad you got all that wicked porn off little Johnny's computer. I'm afraid he'll burn in eternal hellfire just for catching a glimpse of that thing. I'm going to make sure I get him to church and have him confess to that, just in case. Here, take this. If you ever need to find Jesus young man, thats where he is."" She hands me a pamphlet for her church. I just smile and say thank you.

My message to the young man was as followed.

*""I'm not going to rat you out this time. Be more careful, keep up with your maintenance, and don't put me in this kind of situation again. I set up a secondary account for you, so if your mother needs on she won't see evidence of any virus infection. But be smart anyway.*

*P.S. I stole one stash and deleted the other. I strongly suggest you invest in an external drive and hide that thing in a safe... at the bottom of the ocean.""*

**TL;DR** The second coming of jesus brings her sons computer in because it has a virus. Turns out it doesn't it's just full of porn and pot. Really... really upsetting porn. Gave the kid a new lease on life, because unless you actually are Jesus, YOLO.

**Note: The caller had a magnificent accent (I believe Scottish), feel free to read his parts in one for full effect.**

**Me:** [School's] Help desk this is [WindKalas].

**Customer:** Yes I just got a new Mac and I need to get Word for Macs installed on it. I called earlier and someone told me I could get the software disk from the library so I did but when I got home and opened the Mac there's *no bloody* disk drive!

**Me:** Alright, well we I can assist you in downloading it online, you can do so by accessing our network via vpn.

**Customer:** Okay but you're going to have to slowly walk me through that.

*From here begins a series of complications that we successfully tackled one after another.*

*Before he could connect to the vpn he needed the Java plugin, after finally getting Java downloaded it informed him the plugin wasn't enabled, and finally after enabling the plugin he had to download a juniper file because it was his first time on the vpn. Once that was done (took I think a half hour) I was able to get him to our software download page and he began the download. When it was time to install his Mac informed him the install came from a non-trusted location and couldn't run, had him go into his security preferences and sure enough it was default set to only allow applets from the Apple store. Fixed that, got everything installed, done. The whole process took at least what felt like an hour, realistically it was more in the forty-five minute range.*

Through the whole call the guy was really nice and funny, here are just a few of his quips which just made my day.

**Upon the subject of the length of the call:**
&gt; I feel like we're running a marathon.

**When I told him at this point most customers would be angry and he's been great:**

**During all the downtime waiting for things to download:**
&gt; I feel like I should get to know you we've been talking so long. 

**Upon the same subject of the length of the call:**
&gt; So I bet you guys have a bunch of stories about people that call who are complete bastards right?

All in all the guy was a trooper I must say, with all the set backs we kept hitting most costumers would just blow up. Truly made my day to say the least!

From them comes this story:

We've long had an awesome tech support lady. Let's call her ""Anne"". She's polite, helpful, calm, and amazingly good at her job. Enough so that as the company has grown -- and with it the help desk -- she's been made a sort of Team Lead. In that position, she's helped staff up the help desk; her best find to date is the newest: Let's call her ""Beth"".

During her ""training period"" (she knows the tech, but she's learning our product and our ticketing system), she gets handed a doozy -- a customer's results are not being saved. Sort of. They show up in some views, but not others, and aren't in the aggregate report. After a handful of frustrating e-mail exchanges, she figures she'd better get the customer on the phone to get to the bottom of exactly what's happening, so she can file a decent ticket with the engineering team.

Because this is her training period, Beth asks Anne to listen in on the call. You know, to answer any questions that Beth might not be able to, give feedback, etc.  As soon as Beth introduces herself and says she's from the company's tech support desk, the customer *cuts her off* and says ""I don't like being lied to.""

Anne steps in, explains that she's the manager, and asks about the problem.  Verbatim:

&gt; I don't need no PR girl hand-holding me. I just want to talk to a tech and get this resolved.

Followed by the usual exchange where Anne tries unsuccessfully to convince the customer that Beth is actually a very good tech.

Finally, Beth shows her awesome: she interrupts Anne and says ""I apologize, sir, you're absolutely right -- there's no excuse for deception. Let me put you on hold and get an engineer.""  (Anne is, of course, fuming at this point, thinking Beth just promised something she can't deliver.)

On hold it goes.  30s later, Beth comes back on the line, says ""Sir? Thanks for holding, I've got Mr. Vadir [vah-deer] on the line to help you.""  Then she dons a [Darth Vader Voice-Changer](http://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-Darth-Vader-Voice-Changer/dp/B000231FSQ) and continues the *entire remainder of the call as Darth Vader*.

She even manages to respond to a customer's ""no, that won't work"" with ""I find your lack of faith disturbing."" :)

The call ends with the customer happy, Anne laughing so hard (on mute, of course) that she can't talk, and the customer none the wiser. The exec who handles help desk even got a personal email from the customer praising ""Mr. Vadir"".

In honor of Beth, the priority queue ""assignee name"" is now ""D. Vadir"".

He goes, sits down at the machine and of course nothing happens.

So he asks her to sit down, do her normal daily routines and see what happens. 

Sure enough characters started showing up on the screen.

He immediately realizes exactly the problem.  The lady was busty and her keyboard was very close to the edge of her desk...I am sure you can picture the rest.

He very gently pushed the keyboard further up the desk, and the woman looked down and immediately realized what had happened.

He said she blushed, and he just walked away in silence.

She tried to throw it out the fucking window!

Luckily she couldn't unhook the VGA cable because it's screwed in so after struggling with it for a bit she said she gave up and set it back down.

So I go over thinking her monitor is dead and bring an extra monitor with me. I hook it up and turn it on and there's a system recovery message. She just got a blue screen for some reason and freaked out. To confirm this I asked if she had tried turning it back on after the screen changed colors. Nope. Option number one was just throw it out the window apparently. I hooked her old monitor up and sure enough, it works fine.

She was convinced her computer was dead and was already in the process of buying a laptop. I'm a bit concerned now because that will actually fit through the window.
