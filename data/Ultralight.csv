1344642241.0,37,self.Ultralight,y0uxw,Going ultralight:  Cost per ounce,46,9,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/y0uxw/going_ultralight_cost_per_ounce/,"There have been some threads both on BackpackingLight.com and here from people thinking of moving ultralight.  For some it is ignoring the stereotype that UL is cold, wet, and miserable in order to save weight.  For others, it is realizing less costs more.  I'm here to help some people understand that you need to establish a line or get caught up in a whirlpool of dollar signs.

The general practice of going ultralight begins with the least expensive equipment so you can sample the idea without committing outright.  I just submitted a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/y0tz5/losing_a_pound_is_simple_and_cheap_just_know/) giving an example 1.5lb savings for less than $20.  There is no immediate need to dive head-first into $500 debt - try first eliminating redundant or 'fear' items.  People will pack extra clothes for fear of being cold; rain gear even if no rain is in the forecast; and extra shoes in case one pair gets wet.  These are unnecessary and are driven by fear.  Understand your limits, understand the weather, understand your gear, and understand it's not the end of the world if you get moist.

Once you remove unnecessary items and begin replacing simple items like Nalgenes and stainless steel cookwear, you'll find moving to a lighter pack weight is more enjoyable.  Eventually you will want to continue the process... getting down to 20lbs, then 15, then 10.  You begin to realize the UL philosophy is not about comfort sacrifice... in fact, you've never been more comfortable lounging in a Hennesy Hammock all day at a scant 10% of the weight of your former 3-person tent!  But you need to draw the line soon.  Personally I spent over $5000 on equipment and I have but one spare piece to show for it (an windproof tech vest from MH).  Being very spartan, researching heavily before committing to purchase, and selling or trading old items have given me a thorough understanding of just how much UL can cost.  But many ULer's have not and have acquired over the years a pleathora of extra equipment at an outstanding cost.  I offer you the chance to prevent overpurchase and manage this transition using the 'cost per ounce' line in the sand.

How much is saving an ounce worth to you?  $1?  $10?  You are told every ounce adds up and that one ounce here and one ounce there will eventually equal a pound in savings.  But if each ounce costs $25 are you ready to pay $400 for a pound?  In the beginning it's simple: 7oz Nalgene replace by a 1oz Gatorade bottle - $0.14/ounce.  Trading your old equipment for something lighters - 18oz for free - $0/16ounce.  But then you begin to see you need a new pack.  Your existing one is 3.5lbs.  The one you want is 1.5lbs but costs $250.  $250/32oz, $7.8/ounce... not bad... but that means a deck of cards would cost $25.70!

When this line needs to be deep and set in stone is when the UL bug has bitten and bitten hard.  You have a 24oz sleeping bag but want a 17oz quilt for $350, because that will save nearly 1/2 pound!  $50/ounce?  Ouch.  Is that worth it?  Maybe...  maybe sell your Jetboil (+100) and make a free cat stove.  Now it's only $250 for 7 ounces... $35.7/ounce.  That's still steep but not as bad as before.  Let's buy i- wait, look at it from another perspective:  think back when you started... would you pay $1142 ($35.7*32) for a backpack weighing 2lbs less than your current?

Put it into perspective.  A lot of us have not.  Draw the line and find the cheaper solution.",,False,self,t5_2s7p2,1344643091.0,,,True,t3_y0uxw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/y0uxw/going_ultralight_cost_per_ounce/,

Rant/Story inside.",38,11,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/ub3d4/for_the_first_time_i_really_wish_i_had_added/,"Allow me to vent here as I know I am amongst like-minded individuals when it comes to gear.  

Over the last few years, I got back into hiking and invested a lot of money in new gear.  My stuff wasn't the best, wasn't the most expensive, but still set me back well over $1000.  I was careful with what I selected and after cutting my sleeping pad to fit my pack (ULA OHM - Awesome pack btw).  I finally felt like I had achieved a nice, compact kit that could serve me well on a 5 day hike without resupplying, in weather down to 0 degrees celsius.

I'm in Canada where UL isn't as popular.  I spent a lot of time finding lighter counterparts to the gear here and ordering them from the States, sometimes driving down to pick up from a friend to avoid custom and shipping fees.  My gear wasn't quite UL but I was intending on selling my nearly 5lb tent and getting one in the 2 - 3 lb range which likely would've made me ultralight officially.  

Anyhow, last week, a friend and I decided on a 2 day hike.  He's sort of new to hiking and camping other than car camping so I sent him a list of things.  I told him not to worry about water treatment, bear spray, rope for hanging a bear bag, tooth paste, compass, bug juice, soap, etc. etc. etc.  All the little things I already had covered.  I also suggest he try to pack as light as possible.  Asked him if he wanted me to bring an extra headlamp, extra utensils etc. to which he said yes.  

Low and behold on the day, after driving 4 hours to the trail head he starts putting on his pack and it's nuts.  He has probably a good 70L pack stuffed to capacity, in addition to that he jerry rigs a second pack to the outside of that, maybe a 30L.  He then has clothes and ground sheets and stuff hanging off of that pack.  It was insane.  I suggested he leave as much as possible but he insisted it wasn't too heavy.  I felt his pack and although it was considerably heavier than mine, it didn't strike me as insanely heavy.  Maybe around 40 - 50 lbs or so (amazing given it's volume). 

Anyhow, we have an amazing first day and end up at a beautiful lake to camp out.  No one was on the trail, some beautiful views, it was great.  That night I saw him rummaging through his pack looking for something, he said he was looking for his toothpaste.  I told him, ""Oh, I have some, remember I said I'd cover that"".  His response was ""It's okay, I brought 2 kinds"".  This gives you a sense of what I was dealing with. 

The next morning we're packing our gear, we don't hit the trail until 9 something despite getting up at 6:30.  The reason, he's packing his numerous packs of gear.

We're trudging along and then he starts to complain of a sore knee.  We stop, take breaks, I offer to carry some stuff, he insists on continuing.  Finally, after lunch, we take another break (after only a short distance of walking) and I realize he's not in good shape.  He's limping badly and looking exhausted.  We still had about 12 KM to go and I look at the map and realize that due to his breaks and slowness, we've only travelled about 2 Km in 4 hours.  We start trying to formulate a plan, which finally ends with him taking some asprin, putting a tenser bandage on, my filling my pack with his heaviest gear and my taking his smaller pack in my hands.  He gets 2 sticks to aid his walking and we plow forward.  Amazingly, we made it back to our car.  I was pretty pooped having carried a lot of his stuff, but we made it.

Fast forward an hour and we're driving out of the park.  It's pitch black and I see a someone waving a light on the side of the road.  We're in the middle of nowhere and there's this older guy with a cane.  We pull over, he wants a ride about 30K down the road.  We let him in and start talking.

Amazing fellow, making his was across Canada back to where he was originally from, St. John's NFLD.  Hasn't been there in 13 years.  He's clearly down and out, has been hitchhiking his way east.  Says he was robbed in Toronto and has blood stains and missing teeth that match his story.  Says he hasn't eaten all day.  He spent the whole trip talking about Karma.  How it's the one thing he's sure of in this world.  If you do good to others, good will come back, if you do bad.... blah blah blah.  

We reach the tiny town he's headed to which is completely dead, cause it's late.  We get out of the car, I give the guy $10, a pair of merino wool socks, we give him food, he sits down about 100 ft. away and starts devouring the snacks we gave him.  He's incredibly grateful, we wish him well, rearrange some stuff in the trunk and leave.

Finally I get home.  I'm exhausted.  I was exhausted when we finished the hike.

I go to the trunk to get my pack, with almost everything in it, and it's gone.

Either myself, or my friend, fucking left it on the side of the road when we dropped that guy off and rearranged things.  My good deed has caused me to lose my damn pack.  Years of saving up and buying very selectively, gone.  I think of that guy sitting there when we drove off.  He PROBABLY saw the pack and given the extent I've called places in that small town, it sounds like he made no attempt to return it, he likely took it.  He needed stuff, for sure.  He needed money to get home and I guess my gear may have helped him do that.

Anyhow, my point, the thing I wish I'd put in my pack that I never did was simple contact ID.  When I hike I take my Health Card, Credit Card, Debit Card and Driver's License and put it in a baggie with some $20 bills.  That goes in my tiny pocket on the hip belt of my pack.  Problem is, I had taken that out once the hike was over.

So, I've decided I love hiking far to much to not replace my gear and it was looking like I'd get to hike the West Highland Way in Scotland this August due to a family engagement (so, so excited).  So I'm going to bite the bullet and start looking for gear again.  I'm going to post on /r/GearTrade incase anyone is selling some stuff second hand but the moral of my story is that from now on, I am going to leave contact info in my bag and on some of my gear.

I (M21, located in Ithaca, NY, 6ft 135lbs) want to start camping and hiking. Also, being my age, I don't have a lot of 'general things' that aren't my parents' (like cooking stuff, tools, etc). Therefore, I'm pretty much starting from scratch.


Specifics: Let's not include food in the budget, and you can assume I have regular-person clothing (cotton shirts, boots that probably aren't real outdoor worthy, running shoes, etc). Lastly, I've done research on tent vs hammock vs tarp and I believe I want to get a tent. Finally, I'm very heavily leaning towards building the cat food stove, so that won't cost any money.

Also, the trips I'm going on will mostly likely be with my girlfriend, so if that affects any of your choices (specifically, a **2 person tent**), can you let me know both the solo and the 2 person options?

I want to learn the craft: live in the woods with a degree of minimalism that would impress a Green Beret, be it a weekend or a month. 

Gear posts have been helpful.

Gear reviews have been thorough and exact.

But all that is just gear! Sometimes I feel like a stranger could take someones pack and do the same trip. This isn't true, of course but this is how I feel the posts have been reflecting this sub lately. I am having a hard time rallying a couple of my closest friends from camping/car-camping into thru hiking lately, and I feel I don't have much else to teach them other than to use a tent tarp as a lean-to, or how to pack for nutrition.

I don't need another post on the benefits of a Cat stove over Whisperlite,  or how small your knife is.

Its not that I am ungrateful, because I learned a lot. There just seems to be a lot of dick measuring when it comes to gear. 

What makes your setup work in your area, or for your size, or for your companions? What has taking fewer things on the trail taught you about your life, both on the trail and at home? What are some mistakes or huge successes you'll never forget when you decided to take less on your adventure?

A few years ago, I participated in an interesting idea on a hiking forum that I thought might be pretty cool here. The guy who started it had a bunch of extra gear he really didn't need, so he gathered up a list of interested folks and mailed a box of gear to the first person on the list, then that person mailed it to the next person, and so on... Most of the gear consisted of neat little ditty bags, rope, firestarters, carabiners, stoves, all sorts of stuff. Not expensive stuff, but not junk either - useful things. When you got it, you went through and saw if you could use anything, take what you like, then add any extra gear you have that could get some use. All you needed to do was wait until the box came your way and pay the postage to send it to its next destination.

Well, I've now found myself with a bunch of extra gear that I need to find good homes for. Some of it's some pretty cool stuff, just doesn't find their way into my pack anymore and it ends up getting left home every time.

What are your thoughts? Any ideas on keeping any participants fairly private? I was thinking to receive PMs and create the list then only the people actively participating would see any identifiable info (addresses and such). Also, I thought we might limit it to the States, to keep shipping costs down. Any other thoughts?

He had a couple left over and after some arm twisting I got him to send me one. This may be my new favorite, bad weather, 1 person tent (you could squeeze 2 in there but it would be tight).

Most of my trips I do solo and am usually using a bivy sack for weight reasons. Having been stuck in one during bad weather on more than one occasion, I'm always on the look out for something just a step up without sacrificing too much weight.

Essentially it's a four season, single wall, waterproof-breathable, tent/bivi. It's big enough to sit up in and cook if you have to wait out a storm, but packs down to less than 3.5 lbs, just a few ounces more than some of the poled bivy sacks and 3-season tent options out there, but since it was designed as an alpine tent, it can withstand significant wind and snow. You have to keep the snow from building up on the foot box portion just like any bivy sack but the tent body is absolutely bomb proof.

NOTE: These are not available to the public unless you want to order 100 of them. I just thought that if anyone could appreciate this weirdly niche tent it's be you guys.

I really want to like bivy sacks. So, so, light, quick, and supposedly great for side sleepers like me. I have some questions:

-Where do you put your pack? I carry a trash compactor bag for a rain cover... you just use that?

-The bivy doesn't compress down bags or get them wet?

-Where does the sleeping pad go? Outside, inside?

-WHAT THE HELL DO PEOPLE USE FOR PILLOWS. I've never found a good solution, so I'm just throwing this in.

-A few things I've read have metioned bivies are better for quick excursions, not long ones. Why? Is this just marketing nonsense? I don't spend time in my tent other than to sleep.

...and any other information you want to offer. I like the idea of being to plop down just about anywhere to sleep. Sleeping at the top of a peak in whatever little nook I can find so I can wake up, make a photo, and get outta there is so tempting.

Or we *could* pick steel: it is certainly cheap and durable. It isn't very light, however.

I've come to realize, however, that SOME solutions do have all three attributes. I think that gatorade bottles are one (they are very light, very cheap and extremely durable). SuperCat stoves might be another (very light, very cheap and actually fairly durable--I stepped on a stove once (I'm a klutz) and after I bent it back into place it still worked pretty OK.

Other things might be trash compactor bags as pack liners, although they might not be the lightest solution. They are certainly cheap, though and they work great!

This might actually help me get to a true ultralight base weight as these are some of the heavier items in my pack.

At present I have the cheap, somewhat bulky and heavy suisse adventure sleeping bag that I bought for $25 or so.  It's close to 3 lbs and packs very tightly into a 9 Litre stuff-sack.  I would like to replace it with something lighter and smaller, rated somewhere in the 20 - 30 degree range.  I am open to quilts, but I toss and turn a lot at night and I don't know if a quilt would be ideal for me.

Secondly, at present I use a cheap pad, cut and duct taped together to make it fold like an accordion so that it fits inside my pack (ULA Ohm).  I cut it to 3/4 length and use my pack for my feet to keep my feet off the ground when sleeping.  I am interested in a 3/4 thermarest or similar, happy to use my pack the same way.

Ultimately, I am very excited about getting some nicer gear and lightening up my pack while opening up some more room inside it.  Just looking for something 3 season here.

I've really noticed the weight difference from using light gear, used the tarptent double rainbow from March this year, and also acquired a fairly light sleeping bag, and am therefore hooked on experimenting with lighter gear to lessen the load on my legs, open up more exciting path choices and all the other up-sides I don't have to mention.


My experience with the TT double rainbow so far has been pretty good when the weather is good (read: summer), but when camping in relatively high mountains, snow and fairly high winds, it feels like it just isn't shelter enough. The wind simply blows through, effectively lowering the temperature inside the tent and generally making the experience less enjoyable. Looking at other shelter options, such as the Zpacks hexamid, it seems to me many or most of them don't really give you a closed-off space or protection from whatever the wind throws at you, be it snow, sleet or rain.

So, my thought goes something like this: Are you mostly using your ultralight equipment on sunny days, is there some obvious trick I'm missing out on, or do I have to give in to the teasing of my fellow hikers and admit the ultralight thing doesn't really cut it in these conditions?
I'd be very excited to hear about some very light and strong and near-fully *sheltering* shelter, made from f.ex. cuben fiber, that could live up to my expectations.

About three months ago, I switched from running to the stationary bike... and haven't been doing any real hiking. The pain has significantly lessened, but it's still not gone. I want to hike the AT next summer, but I'm not headed to GA like this.

I've only recently begun experimenting with insoles. I have a pretty standard pair of gel inserts that have actually impressed me, but they've been (by no means) a magic bullet. 

Have any of you dealt with this on long hikes? Did you tough it out? did you have to leave the trail? What have you guys tried? 

I hear great things about superfeet... But I haven't needed a new set of insoles for a while.

But is there not a point where you need to asses whether actually conditioning your body better, would make more sense than cutting more and more weight?

Personally, i like the idea of getting by on the bare minimum, and feeling more at one with nature. But i also like to pride myself on my physical fitness, so accommodate some luxuries.

I can't afford most of it. 

I'm on a tight student budget, so I need to find a pack/sleeping bag/tent combo that is pretty cheap. Obviously I'd be sacrificing quality, but I have no choice.

Trip info: let's call it ""recreational homelessness"" even though it sounds kind of insufferable. Vagabonding. It'll be much heavier on hitchhiking and civilization than backwoods hiking and camping. E.g. I might be sleeping in a bushy area on the side of the road, or in a secluded urban area. However, I will be passing by close to a beautiful national park, so I want to keep my options open... 

- $150 is my ceiling for a backpack, 50-70 L as I'll be travelling for about a month
- max. $100 for a sleeping bag
- max. $150 for a tent, although I might skip it altogether and slum it

From what I've seen, the lighter it is, the more expensive it is. 
So I'm not looking for top-of-the-line stuff that weighs the least... I just want something that won't push me over 30 lbs. Is that even reasonable? 

I have a well-used, very hefty sleeping bag that is awesome for the cold-weather camping I've been doing so far, but there's no way I can bring the monster along this time. I could barely squish it into my 80 L pack (which is another beast I have to leave at home).

Any advice appreciated.

**[Updated Concern]**: How do you I compromise compressibility with good moisture resistance and price? Down bags are the lightest, but they shouldn't get wet. Synthetics are better in wet conditions, but they don't compress very well (from my experience anyway). And I still need to keep the sleeping bag below $170 (at the very most). Headache.

I am a college student, and like the title says, will be taking a 2 week summer course hiking through the backcountry of Yellowstone. I haven't done any serious camping in a few years, due to time and money restraints. I dont really have the gear to do this!

My school offers gear rentals, which I have looked into. For 2 weeks, a decent sleeping bag will run $63, which isn't awful, but if I'm going to spend that much, I would rather buy the bag outright. I've poked around online a little, and it seems like there are some good bags available for under $50. Any suggestions on brands, features, or specific bags to look into?

Secondly, I need a tent or some kind of shelter. I have a camp hammock I am bringing, but I have been informed that there won't always be trees to hang up on. The school rental price for a backpacking tent would be $98. Is there anything out there that can compete with this price?

The years prior I've been using the [SWAT Classic 9"" Side Zip](http://www.originalswat.com/products/115201/) which have served me well thanks to their athletic style, great material, and light weight. I can't think of any time I had a buildup of sand/dirt/etc in my boot.

SO! I have began looking for hybrids to give me the best of both worlds. The [Belleville MINI-MiL](http://www.bellevilleboot.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=98#prettyPhoto) is what I've come up with. The general reviews state comfort and quality.

I'm buying all new equipment and I really want to keep the weight down where possible. I'm not completely hellbent on being ultralight, rather I'm aiming to be as light as possible given my circumstances.

Here's what I have so far:

Bag: Gregory Savant 48 (3.5 lbs, I'm sorry)
Pot: Pinnacle Soloist
Stove: Pocket Rocket

I'm looking at either a Warbonnet Blackbird hammock or MAYBE a tarp tent, though I don't know much about them. Cuben fibre is out of my price range, fwiw. As far as quilts go, I'm open to suggestions. As inexpensive as possible with high quality is the goal for all of my gear. 3 seasons, bugs are a concern (deer and black flies in Northern Ontario are rough). I plan on being out in the rain, so a fly or tarp will be necessary.

Any suggestions on clothing brands/lines to look for? Light pants, shorts, outerwear in general? Something that can withstand bushwhacking, I go off the beaten trail quite often. I'm getting trail runners, I've read and agree from personal experience that boots are not necessary.

I've been searching for a while trying to come up with my ideal light and compact setup for backpacking and bike touring. I've been looking through recommendations from r/ultralight and r/campingandhiking to create my gear list.

So far I already own a pack, headlamp, and a few various backpacking items, but I need a bit of help on the other two portions of the big three.

now here's the catch. I work for an outdoors group who is a purchaser from the Liberty Mountain catalog seen here. http://www.libertymountain.com/onlinecatalog/lm2012/index.html#/I/zoomed

It does not have all of the best ultralight gear on the planet, but I am more than fine going for a heavier lightweight setup.

so far I'm looking at the Eureka Spitfire for the tent. The tent or tarp would ideally be fitted for 1+ because I want something light for solo trips, but spacious enough to house my other half and I when we take trips together.

Sleeping pad: I was actually thinking of straying from the catalog to getting http://www.amazon.com/Thermarest-Z-Lite-SOL-Sleeping-Pad/dp/B0075JUVAI/ref=pd_sim_sg_7 this bad boy because I don't know how I feel about inflattable pads. If anyone can sway me one way or the other feel free to give suggesstions!

Sleeping bag... well, I have no clue to be honest.

Stove/cooking unit: I'm definitely considering the optimus crux with the terra wekend cook system. may be overkill for me alone vs the terra solo cook system, but could come in handy for a group, or if boiling water for purification. LM has a few alcohol stove as well, but they don't host MSR, so I was thinking of getting a whisperlight instead, for I'm not too keen on the waste produced by cartridge stoves nor do I like the lack of control on alcohol burners.

Ultralighters, please help me on my quest to join you all on the trails be it solo or not! 

By the way, I'm a college student, so I'm mainly looking for solid base gear as in a) will last a while b) serves it function and well c) may not be the absolute lightest, but is affordable, and not a chore to use.

*  Arc'teryx Alpha LT shell jacket (approx 300 grams)
* Peak Performance midlayer fleece with hoodie
* Nike dry-fit running t-shirt
* Thermals (torso and legs)
* 2-3 pairs of socks

* Haglöfs leather skiinggloves

* Rainproof pants

**Shelter+Sleep**
* Luxe spider II 2 persons tent 2kg = 4lb =&gt; Can be split up, so it is only 2 lb/1 kg pr. person
* Haglöfs -3 degrees celsius down sleepingbag
* Hardfoam rollmat

**Food/Cooking**
* MSR pocket rocket
* 2-3 gas canisters
* Spork
* Mug
* Some sort of kettle
* Don't know what sort of food we are gonna bring yet. Perhaps a mix between mountain house and I want to try the morrocan delight as well. Plus a lot of bars and snacks.

* Toothbrush
* Toothpaste
* Moisturizer

Until now, I've used a [MSR Ceramic Filter](http://cascadedesigns.com/msr/water-treatment-and-hydration/expedition-water-treatment-and-hydration/miniworks-ex-microfilter/product) and to be honest I'm quite tired of lugging it around...  What are some of the best systems to cut down on weight but still stay safe?  I'm not necessarily looking for a pump system but something that will provide decent tasting water (read, not Iodine) for a total lower weight.

Some items that I have been looking at:

[Aquamira Frontier Filter](http://aquamira.com/consumer/aquamira-frontier-filter/) Lightweight but as far as I can tell you can only drink through it?

[Aquamira Drops](http://aquamira.com/consumer/aquamira-water-treatment-drops/product-description)  Does Aquamira and a coffee filter work just as well as a pump?

[Timberline Pump Filter](http://timberlinefilters.com/filters.html) Lightweight pump, but seems flimsy.

I am posting in here because I have become very interested in ultralight. I would be doing this with my family (Mother, 10yr Brother, 14yr Me), and I have lots of questions. Ill break it down into some specific topics and then go into more detail.


I: Gear.

II: Hiking/Camping Locations

III: Other




I: Gear. This seems most important. We have practically no supplies, so things like Backpacks, Hammocks, and other gear are needed. We plan to go for usually 2-3 nights, so appropriate sizes. I can carry most things, but some more child friendly gear for my younger brother would be awesome. I would also love some sort of master checklist, gear purchasing sites, and tips for good gear or food items. Money is not the biggest issue, but I would love some stuff that does not destroy the bank, especially for beginners.



II: Location. We live in northern New Jersey, and for the first couple of times, I would love to try and stay semi local (NY, Parks). I would love to know any sort of restrictions on location, and places to be worried of wild animals.



III: The last question I can think of now, it concerning my dog. He is 15 pound King Charles Cavaleir. Would you recommend bringing him?

If they made the KU2200 it would be perfect but they're expensive and hard to find used. All I need is a 3 day bag. The only option that's in there is the Highcamp but $500+ with the bikini frame, 4lbs, and 4500cu is just not doable. There's also the Spike Camp which is the right size but $400 and 4lbs.Their other gear is classified as ultralight IMO but they don't make an ultralight bag anymore. 

Is there anything out there that would get me 2200cu, for less than 4lbs(obviously) and $300? I'm just not finding any solid good color bags in that size for someone who needs a color preference.

I'm trying to transition to lighter gear and also leave things behind that I don't need. My base weight was easily 25+ pounds last year, so I'm making progress. What I'm noticing by looking at this list is that my clothes seem *really* heavy for what they are.

I really like the REI Rauk fleece, but I know it's very heavy. It's somewhat wind-resistant and has a form-fitting hood (unlike the current version on REI's website). If anyone knows a lighter fleece with a stretchy, form-fitting hood, please let me know.

The sleeping pad is also really heavy, but extremely comfortable. I used a foam pad until recently and the only reason I stopped using it is because I wore it out and started getting cold at night. I feel like I could do well with a 3/4 length pad using my pack for my feet and just take the Q-Core on relaxation-focused trips.

I plan on dropping the bag liner, or at least getting a silk one that's half the weight.

**EDIT:** I know what the problem items are for the most part, I'm just looking for suggestions for alternatives to things like my rain coat, fleece, sleeping pad, etc.

**EDIT2:** Here's a list I made for an upcoming trip, please critique:

http://www.geargrams.com/list?id=14838

I don't have time to pick out new clothes, but I'm taking much less since the lows aren't supposed to go below 50F. The RidgeRest and Sawyer Squeeze weights are based on the specs and I'll weigh them properly when they get here. I take more pictures than I read, so I left the camera in. I added my phone, since I'll be using it to wake up and get hiking early.

When I look closer though, I run into some math that doesn't add up and I'm hoping you can help.  

Lets assume that your base weight is between 7-15 lbs.  Lets also assume that your pack is comfortable up to 30 lbs.  That leaves 15-23 pounds free for food, fuel, and water right?  How many days worth of food do you pack, and how much water + fuel?

Food per day calculation: If I were to use pure sugar as an example of caloric density, I would get 1812 kcal per pound.  I've calculated the energy burned during a day of backpacking at between 5000-8000 kcal per day.  So at a minimum, it would take at least 2.5 lbs. of pure sugar per day just to keep up.  Some foods like snickers bars and combos are a little more calorie dense due to fat content, but you'd still need about 2.5 lbs. per day.  How much food do you carry per day on the trail?

Fuel calculation: When I use my alcohol stove, I typically use about an ounce per meal, so 4 ounces per day is enough for all of my needs plus a little extra just in case.  Fuel is fairly light, but how much do you typically carry?

Water requirement: I go through about a liter of water per mile in hot weather.  On my last hike, I carried a whopping 5 L of water but I was running on empty by the time I hit the next stream.  To be fair, my gear was extremely heavy and there was a lot of elevation gain involved.  How often do you refill your water containers?  What do you consider to be a 'safe' level of water to have with you at all times?

Clothing: I've noticed on a few gear lists that people aren't carrying any spare clothing at all.  Layers yes, but not one spare top, pants, or even underwear.  How do you keep it reasonably clean?

Although I'm often pretty indulgent with my gear, after several mid-stretch (&lt;8 weeks) backpacking trips, I'm planning on downsizing my pack and increasing the duration (&gt;3 months). As a consequence, I've got to cut down on weight by a lot. I'd appreciate any burning advice you've got for long-term self-sufficient travel, but my main issue at the moment is accommodation - I need a tent that will pack down small, stay in one piece, keep me warm and dry etc on the road for months at a time. 

Although I realise that this sub is more oriented towards hiking outside of urban areas, you guys have been really helpful in getting my gear sorted for my mixed backpacking trips, and I'd really appreciate experienced advice.

So, to summarise:

* Ultralight tent.

* Small packed size.

* Accommodate one small person, their stuff.

* Versatile environments - tropical rainforest, temperate plains, (small) mountains, rainy hills - obviously clothing can pick up the slack on a lot of these.

* Durability - on my last couple of trips my gear took a real beating - separated the men from the boys on a few items. 

If any of you can recommend a specific brand/model, that'd help my search immensely.

Does anyone have any experience with either of these two tents? The price on the GoLite Imogene is quite nice at only $250 while the Fly Creek will be either $320 or $370 depending on if I go with the UL1 or UL2.

- I literally don't have any equipment of my own. I can borrow things from my parents, but I would like to have my own setup. What should my budget be?

- Besides sleeping pack, tent, and bag (I'm expecting those), what are the next purchases I should make?

- Is there a 'cookie cutter build' for the best value lightweight tent/bag/pack?

- Can I use my Camelback Mule 100oz as a pack?

- I made a separate post for this, but can the tent or bag fit 2 people even if it's tight?

So I've got a decent amount of experience hiking, I grew up in Alaska, spent some time as an infantryman in the 10th Mountain. When I go hiking these days I normally go solo and my pack is 60-70 lbs for a week long trip. I'd be happy to take it down to 40-50 lbs. 

I'm looking to avoid making any more big purchases this season so things like UL tents and Sleeping bags are good suggestions for next year, but I'd also like to know what I can do this season.

Osprey Aether 70
Tadpole 23
Big Agnes Encampment
Katadyn Hiker Pro
Primus Yellowstone Stove
Mossberg 500
I carry 3-4 liters of water, I consume about 6 a day when hiking so I'd be reluctant to go below 3.

What I'm primarily considering at this point is dropping the tent and sleeping bag and going for a Poncho/Poncho liner combo with a sleeping mat.

A hammock and other alternatives to tents are feasible as long as they provide similar levels of protection against the elements, and they are similar in difficulty to set up (i.e., if it gets dark too soon, too fast, then tying a hammock up might be more difficult than pitching a tent?  not sure).

I usually go solo for a week and up (limited by how much food I can carry), and the plan is to run a lot of it and cover an obnoxious amount of miles (I'm a runner and endurance athlete). Here's the set up I have planned. Suggestions? Affirmation?

Backpack: Osprey Talon 22
I know I could go lighter than the Osprey Talon 22, but I don’t believe I could run with anything less secure in it’s volume category. I’ve hiked with the Talon 44 and love the design.

Sleeping bag: Zpacks 20 degree 6'2"" w/ water resistant down
I think the 1oz for the water resistant down is worth it.

Sleeping pad: Neoair Xlite size small
I’ll use my backpack for my feet. 

Shelter: North Face Simple Bivy
One of if not the lightest waterproof stand alone shelter I could find. I don’t want to use trekking poles so a waterproof bivy seems the way to go.

Down Jacket: Patagonia UL down Jacket with hood
I think the way the hood and waist sinch and it’s pockets make it the best option for me.

Rain Jacket: Montbell Minimus
Lighter rain jackets don’t have the adjustability at the cuffs and hood and waist I’m looking for to protect my down jacket if need be.

Knife: Bear Grylls Paracord fixed blade
Simple, light, and I’ll replace the paracord with some better paracord.

Firestarter: 2 Mini Bics
One’s for back up. I’m removing the child safety.

Food Protection: Zpacks bear bagging system
Not legal in the sierras so IDK if I’ll go ahead and break the law or what but the difference between this 3oz kit and a bear canister is huge.

Water Purification: iodine tablets
I have the sawyer squeeze filter. Worth it? If so, where can I buy bags that won’t break on me?

Flashlight: Inova Microlight
Simple.

Rope: Zpacks, 50' 1.4mm
Simple.
Map: The relevant Tom Harrison map
Love these things.

Compass: Haven't picked one

First Aid Kit: DIY
2' sport tape
small tube neosporin
2 x 3"" gauze pads
2 x safety pins
2 x alcohol wipes
2 x iodine capsules
All in a 4"" x 6"" ziplok

Whistle: Haven't picked one

Signal Mirror: Haven't picked one

Toothbrush: Zpacks or just saw the handle on mine.

Repair Tape: Zpacks Cuben Fiber Tape strip.
To be used for literally any gear that tears. Not sure how much of the yard roll I’ll need for week or 3 week outings.

Other Cloths: Smartwool wool socks, Montbell Dynamo wind pants.

This brings my base weight to approximately 7 pounds.

I’ll be wearing a longsleeve running shirt, running shorts, socks and running shoes.

Now for Food. I’d like to eat as simply as possible, probably all cold meals. Ideas? Convincing argument for the alcohol stove/titanium cup?

Problem is I have little extra cash to spend.

Basically is the Ray Jardine stuff any good? I couldn't find the weights of anything on the site.  I get that they vary somewhat because you sew it yourself but you gotta tell us what it weighs!

I have access to a sewing machine and have used it a couple times but am far from experienced with it.

Basically

quilt         $83
tarp         $63
net tent   $61    (lots of skeeters and no see ums where I backpack)
backpack  $60

total        $267
weight: unsure

If the ray way stuff isn't any good I would lean towards

g4 ul or smd swift      $110-125
golite ul800 quilt        $200
tarptent contrail or moment $200-240 (I'm not the biggest fan of trekking poles)

total              $510-575
weight   65 oz to 70 oz

Basically I'm gonna try and purchase the equipment based on how cheaply I can save weight.  Probably get the backpack later though when my base weight gets down some more.


Getting the ray way stuff would be a savings of around $300.  If the weight of the ray stuff was comparable and the quality was there I would seriously consider going that route.  Obviously quality depends somewhat on how well you sew but are the materials high quality? good instructions?

However, I haven't really been able to find much on ultralight (well, semi-light) synthetic sleeping bags or sleeping systems that include a synthetic sleeping bag. I am aware that down sleeping bags are particularly popular for their weight+warmth+compressibility, however I am vegan (this is an **entirely personal** decision and I am not trying to force any ideas on anyone, seriously).

I am currently carrying around a hotcore R-200 (http://hotcoresleepingbags.com/Products.html) at 3.9 lbs/ 1.8 kg and a temperature rating of -10C / 14F. I also have a MEC Reactor 2.5 (http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/SleepingBags/SleepingPadsInflating/PRD~5025-649/mec-reactor-2.5-sleeping-pad.jsp) which was a last minute purchase for a bike tour, though I also own a Thermarest Z-lite, which I was planning on using back support instead of the Reactor (lighter).

I am really just looking for a simple, flexible sleep system that I can use or change to fit early autumn to summer (or anything, really) that includes a synthetic sleeping bag/quilt. Cheaper options are preferred (read: student) but just throw them at me. Thanks!

It's been getting a fair amount of press these past few weeks, with writers from Gawker and Forbes giving the powder a spin and writing about their experiences. The writer from Forbes lived a week with almost nothing except coffee, vanilla, and soylent, with maybe one or two real meals.

I'm just thinking about the ultralight capabilities afforded by having an entire day's meals contained in a powder. Want a full breakfast for the day? Put some powder in a nalgene and you're off, total prep time 30 seconds for a complete breakfast with all of the nutrients you need. Want a solid lunch but you don't want to have to stop for it? Soylent. Roll into camp way after dark and you just want to collapse in your bag and not deal with dinner? Soylent's got you covered. Want to supplement your real food with some extra calories?


I know the last thing I'd want to eat after a long day's hike is a bready protein shake, so I'd probably stick to regular food. But why not pack a meal's worth of soylent on every trip as a lightweight emergency meal? If you drop your pot and spill your pasta everywhere, or you just don't make it to the next stop on the AT as quickly as you thought you would, having an easy, super lightweight, fully nutritive meal on hand could be extremely useful.

I don't know how many of you are into mountaineering, but this obviously has a lot of applications in that realm as well.

Oh, and I guess I'd better mention it's pretty cheap, too: $7.60 per day, which could be brought down to $5/day.

I've also heard great things about Cloud's Rest, but I've never done that either.

We would probably have no more than 5 days, and more likely are looking at 4. That would include the day for Half Dome. Any suggestions for good trail-heads to start our hike at? Also, if you know of any trail-heads that are easier to get permits for, that would be helpful. We'll still have to apply for the cable lottery, but I know high-country starts are easier to come by than going out of Curry Village.

I thought this Excel doc I made might interest some of you.  It essentially picks the cheapest combination of gear under a specified weight.  It's a linear program using the ""solver"" add-in, which comes with newer versions of Excel.  You just have to go to the preferences to install it, and then go to it under the ""Data"" tab to get to its dialog box.

The idea is that I want to plan for a three-day hiking trip in the Fall or Winter, but I:

a) need to buy some new stuff and 

b) want to go more lightweight.

Here's a download link: 

https://www.dropbox.com/s/8lnb2no25ao3ul2/ultralight-reddit.xlsx

If you look at the second-to-last column, I put a number down at the end of every category indicating quantity requirements for everything I'd have to bring (including underwear haha).  I inputted all of the gear I own, and scoured many different websites to find the best prices for replacements.  If you're going to use it, it might be best to re-enter some of them, especially if you're outside of the US.  However, I did get all of the weights down, which I have heard are sometimes incorrect (it's the best info I have now).  I tried to include shipping/tax costs on some of them, but I do have an REI membership and Amazon prime... so it's not perfect but close.

I am thinking of doing some more with this in the future, but for now, just enjoy it and insert your own information if you want to try it out.  You can make entirely new categories if you just follow the scheme.

Some other notes:

- The black box indicates items I have no choice but to bring, including water.

- I put capacities for bags on the side, though I don't utilize it (yet).

- It's quite subjective.  Maybe you won't like some of the choices I put in.  It was made for a guy, too.

- I am missing some important items, like first aid kit, bug spray, gps, *food* etc.  It's a WIP.

- It's focused on fall weather for now.

The final cost for me to get down to 20lbs (before food) is $909! It starts to get interesting once you go down to about 15lbs, but I forget what the lower limit is.  And yea in case you're wondering... my friend would bring the stove :)

I also want to thank the users in this subreddit for the many posts I was able to look at to get information on new items.  I think I included a link to a Google Doc that was especially helpful.

I am updating it every so often with more items, so check the link from time to time.",,False,self,t5_2s7p2,1356713959.0,,,True,t3_13bdgf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/13bdgf/ultralight_optimization_excel_doc/,

If you cut your Thermarest Z-Lite along a fold, so that one side is 8 sections, and the other is 6, you get two pads for the price of one. Granted, these are going to be Torso and 3/4 pads, which might not work for you. But if you're sleeping on just a Z-Lite as it is, chances are you will be fine. 

I'm just over 5'7"", which is shorter than a lot of guys, but my shoulder to mid-thigh fit great on an 8 section. My shoulders and hips fit great on the 6 section. I use a compressible pillow for my head, and my pack / extra clothes / quilt excess for my legs, and I barely notice it. Let's face it, that leg cushioning isn't doing much, it's just insulation.

---------------

Second option: Do this, and use your inflatable over it. You'll have extra insulation for your torso, and then the inflatable for the rest of you. You carry half the weight of the standard Z-lite which gives you more carry headroom for an inflatable. Even better, it is another layer between the ground and your fragile inflatable! ;)

---------------

For you Mariposa Plus users, both the six section OR eight section Z-Lite will fit perfectly in the pad-holder / back cushion of the pack, and be pretty damn comfortable to boot. I know there is concern that it will make the pack too puffy and away from your back, but in my experience that does not happen with the shorter pad. Considering the full Z-Lite is kind of bulky to pack, this is a great alternative, and I'm happy with the convenience of having my pad accessible for rest stops and naps!",,False,self,t5_2s7p2,True,,,True,t3_t0t2d,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/t0t2d/protip_cut_your_thermarest_zlite/,

LIST: http://www.geargrams.com/list?id=5571

I would like some feedback regarding quilt and backpack.  I have not purchased either.  My current backpack is an old Mountainsmith that weighs over 5 pounds.  I've also got an old slumberjack that weighs 3.5 pounds. Both pieces of gear are way too heavy and too worn out to really be of effective use, especially if I want to call myself a lightweight backpacker.

Should I get the GoLite? Sew my own quilt?  I'm not sure I'm willing to sew my only backpack as I just don't think I have the skills or time.  Other ideas for pack and insulation/quilt/sleeping bag.  Just to be clear here I'm not willing to sleep in my clothing with a space blanket or anything crazy like that.

Finally, what are your thoughts on the optional items? Should I consider the filter? (I don't like having to buy the replacement cartridges--they are expensive!)  How about the crocs?  I'm surprised how heavy they are.  Any ideas for a better camp shoe that won't break the bank?  What do flip-flops weight anyway?  Maybe I need to get some Tyvek booties...

You'll notice that my gear list doesn't include my shoes and the socks, shorts and t-shirt (non-cotton, of course) I'll be wearing all the time.

What would you change?  I know that I could go a little lighter for shelter, but I really want to give the Tarptent a shot.  Maye in the future I'll make own 24 ounce RayWay tent.

1317545394.0,9,self.Ultralight,ky8ad,"Travelers, what are the most important things you take with you when abroad? This is my cross post from /travel. ",13,4,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/ky8ad/travelers_what_are_the_most_important_things_you/,"I'm really looking for tricks, tips, cool things you've thought that help save weight, items you take everywhere you go. I'm going back to Central America and taking a different approach to it this time. This is not just a leisure trip, I'll also be working too. Here's the original post:

I just returned from an 8 month trip to Central America and learned a lot about what I should, should not, and what I need to take with. But I was wondering, what are some tricks or items you take or can't live with out when traveling(traveling anywhere for that matter). I'm headed back to Central America again and could use some new ideas. I'm scrapping my luggage plan and going back with a 75 liter pack that has a secondary compartment that is removable hip pack for quick travel and keeping my documents on me at all times, I imagine I'll be using this quite a bit. Bug repellents and sun block are so expensive down there that I prefer to take it with, but it consumes a lot of space, I wish there was an alternative to deet in a can. This post just reminded me of one thing I wished I had my entire trip...a hammock! I'm going to track down a small ""hammock in a bag"" type of item for my pack...and a compression pillow, YES! 

Cool tricks for packing, things you have to take when traveling, things that made travel easier, you get the idea, please share! 

EDIT: I'm also a fan of coral [reef safe sunblock](http://www.tropicalseas.com/). It requires more reapplying because it isn't waterproof or as water resistant as the normal stuff. The area I just returned from and headed back to again is part of the 2nd biggest reefs in the world so I try to help out where I can. 

This compression [pillow](http://www.backcountry.com/therm-a-rest-compressible-pillow) and [hammock](http://www.eaglesnestoutfittersinc.com/single-nest-hammock.html) are going with me on this trip. On work days I spent quite a bit of time an island and there was one hammock, one folding chair, and an industrial sized swing, and a couple splintered old wood benches on the entire island. People were in them about 99% of the time....I was usually in the other 1%. The aforementioned hammocks are very small, lightweight, and packs into itself for ease of storage and minimal space usage. The Therm-Rest compression pillows are awesome on planes, trains, and automobiles.....and for general sleeping and relaxing while on the road. 

Believe it or not I really like [field stripped MRE's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbhfHskOw68#t=00m05s). I usually get them shipped down after a couple of months in order to give my stomach a break. i like to take them out in my flight bag for when I get stuck somewhere and I need some calories.  

My Nalgene bottles, water purifier, and tablets were a life saver on many occasions, they'll be going again as well. I wouldn't mind a [steripen](http://www.steripen.com/) in place of my other items, I'll get one in the future. 

Anybody have any luck with all natural bug repellents? I go through quite a bit of Off because if I didn't have it I would look like [this](http://imgur.com/ds9ll) everyday. These bites are from tiny little flies, it hurts when they bite, but it's very painful the next few days to a week when healing from them. So deet has to be in the arsenal, but I use a lot of it.

Ziplock bags are a must, not the cheap ones either, I'll splurge for the real deal. I also recommend a waterproof map/accessory sleeve [like this](http://www.rei.com/product/814232/sea-to-summit-tpu-accessory-case-large), a dry storage [pouch/bags](http://www.rei.com/product/780949/outdoor-research-dry-ditty-sacks-set-of-3) and a smaller [case](http://www.rei.com/product/778218/pelican-1060-case-with-carabiner) for phones, documents, point and shoot camera e.g.  Thanks for the comment and happy trails.

I've got it down to a few (I think, I hope) but I'll give a little background info as to what I plan to do with it - as I'm sure this is necessary / helpful.

I'm planning to do a PCT thru-hike next year, but have a few week / weekend trips coming up before then. Up until now I haven't consistently used any pack, and haven't found one I love all that much. So whatever bag I choose it should hopefully double for both. I'm trying to go semi-light, but don't quite have the funds for an ultralight set up yet. Hopefully a pack no more that 4lbs, and hopefully less, and hopefully a total weight of no more than 35lbs. As for current big gear I'm packing:

[UltraLite 800 Fill 3-Season Quilt](http://www.golite.com/UltraLite-800-Fill-3-Season-Quilt-Regular-P46821.aspx)  - 23oz

[SMD Skyscape Trekker](http://www.sixmoondesigns.com/tents/Trekker.html) - 23oz


I should also mention that I don't really have much option in the way of trying these packs on, I'm generally stuck to online only shopping. I've got a little store in town, but the selection of light gear is kind of lacking.

I have a number of endurance hikes on the radar for 2012, and have been setting up my gear over the last few months. For me, finding the right pack has proven itself to be the most challenging part of this process. 

The issue I'm faced with is whether or not to go with a very light pack (i.e., sub 2.2lbs/1kg) to keep weight down, or to go with a heavier pack (I'm looking at the Black Diamond Infinity 50 - 4lbs/1.8kg) that has significantly better support. My base weight (without pack) is around 12lbs/5.5kg and shrinking.

I'm curious what the UL community thinks about allowing a little more pack weight to ultimately feel like you aren't carrying as much. 25lbs with a frameless pack has a tendency to feel like 25lbs, whereas 27lbs with a well-supported pack seems to feel more like 15lbs. 

I know this may sound sacrilegious to some, but isn't it really about the weight you feel on your back?

It even works in winter temperatures down to 20F!  The housing acts as a built-in windscreen and is a fully self-contained cooking system operable at the push of a button.  The standard fuel canister weighs in at 7oz (200g) for fuel + canister and boils 12L of water.

    Total Weight:  15.5oz (440g)
    Total Water Boiled:  50.7cups (12L) &lt;-- [lab conditions]*
    Total Water Boiled:  28cups (6.6L) &lt;--  [real world test]**

------------------------------

An alcohol stove weighs approximately 0.3oz (8.5g) and, with a .9L titanium cooking pot weighing approximately 3.4oz (96.4), brings the UL cooking system up to 3.7oz (104.9g) sans fuel.  Because the real world test of the Jetboil used the built-in windscreen I'm going to add an aluminum foil windscreen (.3oz, 8.5g) to keep the setup somewhat even.  Carrying roughly half of a standard 16oz water bottle (.5oz, 13g) with ethanol fuel (.79g/ml = 186.9g) narrows the weight difference with the Jetboil system to within a few ounces.  An alcohol stove burns approximately .6oz (a little over 1/16 of a cup) per 2cup boiling session meaning 8oz of fuel boils only 26.6cups (6.3L) of water.

    Total Weight:  11oz (312g)
    Total Water Boiled:  26.6cups (6.3L) &lt;-- [real world test]***

-----------------

So is the penny stove the best ultralight solution?  Well, other factors come into play such as ease of operation, cost, duration of trip, environmental temperature, availability of fuel, and empty fuel storage and recycling... but it actually looks like this new Jetboil titanium edition warrants some serious consideration in the UL community.

So I decided to take a leap into the DIY world and make my own sleeping quilt. I decided to go real easy with this first one and use primaloft insulation simply sandwiched between two layers of 1.1oz ripstop nylon, as shown here.

http://www.backpacking.net/makegear/make-quilt/index.html

Due to some misunderstandings of being a noob at this as I was ordering the nylon and insulation, I'm kind of worried about the project final dimensions 36""x 60"" being a tad too small but I figure it'll be good practice either way if I decide to continue making my own stuff. 

My question pertains to how much insulation should I be using of the primaloft for about 35 degrees. 

[The quest outfitter website](http://www.questoutfitters.com/insulations.htm#Insulation Fabrics) states, ""Customer feedback suggests many customers using 2 layers of 3 oz feel it is good to approximately 35 degrees."" So i ordered a quantity of 2. I got one piece 72"" x 60"" folded in two to make two layers of 36"" x 60"". Is this going to be enough. Or should I order more insulation?

There is silicone coating on the inside of the pack but I'm still going to use a pack cover--Maybe this will be my excuse to finally dabble in DIY cubin fiber!  

The lid has an outer packet and a pocket under the lid which is kinda neat.  There is also an inner pocket that looks like it's intended for a water bladder but it seems to short, wide, and low in the pack to really function this way.  I think I will put a piece of cardboard in a tyvek envelope and insert it in the pocket for back support/padding and use it as a sit pad.  The mesh water bottle pockets are a bit small but functional. This is probably a good thing cause it will force me to end my habit of carrying way to much water.

I'm considering two different products: the Marmot plasma 30 and a zPacks sleeping bag. 

Marmot: 900 fill down, 10.4 ounces of fill, 1.4 lbs, temp rating: 30 
Zpacks: 900 fill down, 8.5 ounces of fill, .9 lbs, temp rating: 30

So there is 22% more down of the same quality in the Marmot but the temperature ratings are the same. Additionally, the marmot is a full mummy style that covers the head which surely would make it warmer than the open style of the zpack. Is marmot rating on the safe side? is zpacks rating a little optimistic? am I missing something? 

The reason I'm even considering the marmot over the zpack is I really love the full mummy style bag. but the zpack is much lighter.

So I'm planning a NOBO thru of the AT in early March (pleeeeease good weather!). I want to go as light as possible, so that of course means light shoes. I've spent the last 4 months or so hiking in various Vibrams, but I want to be able to layer socks and possibly even wear wool socks if it gets really wet/cold, so I need to get rid of those silly toes. I just got a pair of [New Balance Minimus 20v2 Trail's](http://www.newbalance.com/Minimus-20v2-Trail/MT20-V2,default,pd.html?dwvar_MT20-V2_color=Red_with_Black&amp;start=6&amp;cgid=101200). They feel really, really comfortable. 

My question is, how much is my hiking speed suffering by wearing shoes with no heel drop? I can't tromp along all quick like most boot wearing hikers. This is especially true for downhill hiking. I find myself needing to distribute much more of the impact onto my muscles (calves, quads, hips), as opposed to just landing hard on cushioned heels and marching along. The no-heel way certainly seems healthier but it slows me down considerably. 

At first I figured the loss in speed would be made up for in less fatigue due to the weight of the shoes, but going downhill like that is actually pretty tiring on the muscles. It is a lot easier on my joints, which at the end of the day is well worth it. I'm just curious about the miles/day issue.

I believe it is a 20F bag or something like that.  I want to make a lighter quilt because the down bag is too warm most of the time.

Before I make a quilt, I need to try to fix some comfort problems.

The nylon material is very loud when I move around, especially when my whiskers rub against it.  It wakes me up sometimes, if I move in my sleep.   I have tried using a small fleece blanket over my shoulders and face, which works but it usually ends up underneath me by morning.

I am wondering if anyone else has this problem and how they fixed it.  

I am thinking about sewing some fleece on the quilt where my face rubs it.  Do you think this would work?

The other question is about a pillow.  I was using a nylon stuff sack filled with a down vest, but that was also loud and not very comfortable.  I switched to a canvas (?) stuff sack which is not as loud, but heavier.  The down vest crushes down to a size that is not high enough for me.  

What are ways of getting a lightweight but comfortable pillow?

Another comfort issue is that there tend to be cold drafts near my shoulders if I don't use a fleece blanket.  I know one solution is to wear something, like a long underwear top.  Is there another way to stop drafts?  I was thinking about sewing a piece of fleece so it hangs from the quilt to the ground as a draft stopper.  I would also like something to hide my head and face under, at least for a while to warm up and get comfortable until my bed warms up.

One crazy idea, cut the quilt long enough so it is a foot past my head so it hangs down to the ground forming a good seal from outside air, and cut an opening in the quilt that my face fits through.

*Things I am already aware of that you will probably call me out on:*

I know I don't need both the tent/pad and hammock. I always prefer the hammock and when it is cold I will use the pad in the hammock for insulation. Also, due to my travels I'll be with other people that will need shelter and will use my tent while I sleep in my hammock (this only relates to Europe travels). 

I have multiple fire starting options and I didn't even include the fire piston that is on it's way. This is because I am new to this and want to test out all of the methods and see which suits me the best and that means carrying a bit extra for now. I am OK with this.

The water filter. Hindsight I think I may regret getting that, however, I do go through a lot of water in a day when I'm not exerting myself and think it'll come in handy, but we will see. In Europe I doubt I'll have much need for it, but in NZ I wager I'll use it a fair bit.

Situation: 
You have N bottles (N is greater than 1), 1 AquaMira mix cap, and little patience to wait out N*5min to activate multiple batches of AM

Steps:

1. Drop N*7 drops of A and B into mixing cap.
2. Wait 5 min. While waiting, fill up one 1L bottle with water.
3. Mix the contents of the cap into the filled bottle (shake it up!).
4. Divide the high concentration AM water from that bottle into N other bottles.
5. Top off the N other bottles with untreated water, mix well.
6. ""Burp"" all N bottles to treat the threads.
7. Wipe off exterior water if you want, wait 15 minutes.

I'm posting this in ultralight because the husband and I have realized lately that if we want to continue our hiking/backpacking treks WITH the kids, we need to get as much of our gear weight &amp; bulk down so we can carry most of their stuff too. It's ridiculous the amount of food they go through...

On our last trip (just overnight, with a 4 hour kid-paced hike on each side), I slept in a two person tent with my younger two kids (ages 4 and 6). The older boy (11) slept under the stars on a small tarp with his friend, and my husband slept in a hammock.

Considering the number of ticks we picked off of us all (and the black widow I found in my pack the next day), letting my son sleep outside on a tarp probably isn't the best long term solution. Luckily it didn't rain!

The current 2 person tent is NOT an ultralight tent, so let's assuming I'm starting from scratch here.

 Do you think I could realistically fit myself and 3 kids into a tent like the [Big Agnes Fly Creek UL3 Tent](http://www.rei.com/product/807368/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul3-tent)? In the current 2-person setup, my 4 year old slept at our feet, which worked fine, since I'm only 5'6"" (but kids grow!). Or would I be better off with two 2-person tents? I would love to not have to set up two tents though! 

Feeling kind of overwhelmed and don't want to drop a thousand bucks on tents, but considering that my youngest two can't carry much more than their sleeping bags and some water, I know I need to be careful with the weight I carry.

Understandably none of these long-distance packs seem made for that. So what to do? 

I've looked through some of these ultralite manufacturers, MLD, Gossamer gear, GoLite, etc. The only ones that jump out are hyperlite mountain gear's ice packs, in 2400 and 3400 ci. They weigh in at 29.9oz (848g) 31.9oz (904g) and respectively and cost $260 and $305, but look great in many aspects.

GoLite's Quest 50L is also a challenger in the court, and it's pretty in orange too. But it's not close to ultralight.

Then I see MLD's 2900 ci Prophet, which might work, but doesn't seem optimal for this.

My gear is definitely not ultralight but is lighter than the average backpacker. I recently did a 6 day hike in the Canadians Rockies with a 30-35 pound backpack (including 6 days of food and about 2L of water). My backpack during this hike was the [Altra75](http://www.arcteryx.com/Product.aspx?EN/Mens/Packs/Altra-75#5-plus_day_expedition) from arc'teryx. A great backpack when you want to haul big loads but not the best when you want to go light since it weights (2.3 kg / 81 oz). So I ended up returning the bag and am now in the market for a new back that is significantly lighter but still offers good support. I looked at the exos pack from osprey that almost every light backpacker has and it seemed a bit a flimsy to me. The REI flash 62 did look a bit sturdier but the materials used did not seem as good as the arc'teryx one (which is understandable). Finally, boreas has a newish line of minimalist  backpacks called Buttermilks which look great but I never had the chance to try one out. Did any of you had any experience with the above models or have any recommendations for a backpack with good back support, superior materials and quite light (under 3.5lb/1.6kg) but not necessarily ultralight?

I like that this has a little bit of wind protection with the silny on either end. Also I could sit up. Seems like the roomiest and sturdiest.

[MLD Serenity Shelter](http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=35&amp;products_id=120)

I like the water resistent lower half of the bivy.

I'm leaning towards either of the Mountain Laurel options but it looks like its at least an 8 week wait before they're shipped... and I'm impatient. Anyone have any experience with any of these three or any other ideas? I value lightness and cheapness.

I pretty much understand the tradeoffs I am looking at here. The cal is lighter, warmer and more expensive, but both are excellent bags. What I am confused about however is the denier of the nylons these bags feature. The cal 13 has a 10d nylon and the zissou 23 uses a 30d. If I go with the more expensive cal 13, will it be likely to rip? Is 10d nylon durable enough?  What is the difference in durability between a 10d and a 30d bag. I am willing to spend the extra cash for the lighter bag if its going to be a durable one, otherwise it seems like I should just go with the zissou.. what do you guys think?

I have a 16"" torso, which fits into the Hornet's ""small"" size. However, at 32""-34"", my hips are solidly in the ""medium"" size range. Does anyone else have experience with this pack, or with pack sizing in general? I'm going to send this pack back if it doesn't fit, but I don't want to waste time having to ship multiple sizes if possible. Thanks for the input!  
  
[Here is the REI page for this pack](http://www.rei.com/product/828406/osprey-hornet-46-pack)

UPDATE: I received both the small and medium pack in the mail. The small was waaay too short- the load lifters were about level, or even down a bit. The hip belt was the right size though. The medium was better, though the load lifters were still not at a 45 degree angle...weird Osprey, I'm a 5'5"" woman, why would I need a size large? The hipbelt on the medium fits, but only if I cinch it alll the way down. Also, I was under the impression that women had proportionally larger hips vs. height, so why am I cinching down the hipbelt on this men's pack? 
  
I took it out for a 3 hour trek, loaded with 18 lbs (a little more than my usual load) and it felt great. Comfy, the load was nice and stable, and the hipbelt is quite comfortable. I love all the features on this pack- lots of ways to brace the load/ stow items without much bulk. Very streamlined and well thought out. I especially like the side compression straps- you can route them inside or outside the side pockets, which also happen to be accessible from the top or side. This is also my first pack where you put a hydration pack in between the framesheet and the main compartment. I tried it, and I think it's a nice feature, though hard to get the bladder in/out while the pack is loaded.  
  
If I had to complain about one thing (besides the somewhat weird sizing) it would be the roughness of the shoulder straps. I like to wear sleeveless shirts, and the mesh on the inside of the straps is quite scratchy. However, I like the airflow the design allows- a very cool pack.

Finally have the money this summer to get my own backpacking gear and I'm stoked (so are my friends and father)! I have a lot of what I need already. The following link will send you to the things I'm planning on buying. This summer. 

I would call myself a lightweight hiker, but definitely not ultralight. 
Will be backpacking primarily 2~4 days per week for this summer in the PNW. Once the school year rolls around I'll be near the AT and backpacking mostly weekends. Probably once or twice a year I'll squeeze in a long (10+ day) trip.

1336623755.0,1,self.Ultralight,tfyru,PROTIP: UL Alternative to 'Camp Shoes',1,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/tfyru/protip_ul_alternative_to_camp_shoes/,"For those of you who like to camp just as much as you like to hike, the idea of camp shoes is very appealing, since they can be airy and light and a nice break after being in your shoes all day. However, often at the cost of a half a pound or more, and with no other purpose beyond 'chillin in them'.

For those of you who use meshy trail runners, I had an idea last weekend. When you get to camp, set up your shelter, etc., take your socks off, let your feet air out, let your socks dry, whatever. Then when you have to start doing some errands around camp do this:

1. Loosen your laces down to the second or so eyelets. Enough that there's only a couple inches of ""tie-able"" lace left sticking out the top.

2. Pull the tongue up away from your foot, to loosen it up and help push the laces away from your feet.

3. Tie a loose knot in each string, to prevent them from slipping out, or...


4. Tie the laces together in a loose knot.

Basically, you're converting your shoes into a pair of slip-ons. At this point, socks are optional IMO. Especially if you have meshy shoes. And if your shoes are a little damp still, you won't be getting your socks wetter.

I find that this works great for pee breaks in the night, especially with the tongues of your shoes pulled up a bit. They basically become slippers.

Personally, I think my hiking shoes are really comfortable anyway, but I agree that it is constricting having them laced up all good for 12 hours a day, so I find this to be a good compromise without adding a single extra oz. Also, if your camp site allows it, try going barefoot... You'd be surprised what your feet can handle.

The maker of this product met and exceeded his goal of $20k within 3 days of starting the fundraising; this thing has a following. Right now there's around 400 backers to this thing, he's trying to get 1000 or so to take the product to ORSM (outdoor industry trade show) this summer where he can pitch the idea to the larger companies to produce (MSR, Brunton, etc.). I would love to see this him get this product to that level, as it is a true cottage industry item and it would be amazing to see it end up being picked up by a larger company and brought to a larger market.

If you have any interest in something like this, please check it out. It'd be great for hunting/camping/anything outdoors as it uses found fuel (dry twigs, pinecones, etcs) to boil water for your coffee, freezedried meals, water purification, etc. So far most of the support I've been seeing for it is from camping enthusiasts, but I think there is definitely untapped market potential with hunters and other outdoorsmen. Please pass this information along if you have friends that may be interested in it.

I'm not benefitting from people backing this item, just someone who would like to see it become something big!

My grandfather has been flying ultralights for many years and a few years ago he finished building his own.
He has been using the software that I've linked above for the whole time and he's recently run into a problem where the instrument software is crashing every time he tries to update the firmware it seems.
I don't know as much about it as he does or even you guys, but when the software is opened, it seems like the areas where you input the parameters are all greyed out and the only button you can click is to find and update the firmware. 
We have the newest firmware it seems, as per the website, but every time you try and run it, it crashes and asks us for the usual 'send' 'don't send' windows dialog.

But I would like to have a true 0 degree bag (or at least a 20 degree or something) for the winter.  I want to find one that is about the same stuff size as the bag I currently own, for backpacking purposes.

Is this just a pipe dream, or does anyone know of some pretty compact 0 degree bags out there?  

I'm not too sure about the F&amp;S bag's stuff size dimensions, sorry.",,False,self,t5_2s7p2,False,,,True,t3_14v46x,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/14v46x/compactlight_0_degree_bag/,

Might bring a few more clothes but right now I'm thinking of just bringing shorts (no shoes, shirt, etc)

The goal is to stay something like 3 nights in the rockies, probably near abraham lake in alberta.  Hardest part will probably be the cold nights, but I have a few ideas like sleeping during the day or might be able to get a fire going using old school techniques.  As for food I won't really need any, but I'd like to see if I can eat some vegetation/bugs w/e while I'm out there.

The other thing which could be troublesome is bears or other predators.  If I can get a group of 4 it wouldnt' be much of an issue I think, but if I have to solo I'd probably have to do some more research, come up with some plans.
