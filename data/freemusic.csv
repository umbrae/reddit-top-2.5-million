As long as it is *your* music, and as long as it is clean enough to go on the air, I'll give it a fair listen and get you hook up.

Listen in every tuesday from 2-5pm (EST) over at [WLSO](http://wlso.lssu.edu/), and keep your ears peeled for some of the coolest music reddit has managed to send my way.

We have so many talented friends (here in town and around the globe) that we decided to band together so that the world has a better chance of hearing our sounds. Currently our releases are available on our soundcloud page (soundcloud.com/sleepybeach) - a proper website will be made in the coming months.

The plan is to put out a free release every two weeks - so far we have three, with the fourth (Shelf Nunny's album - The World Around Me) scheduled to drop on the 30th. Our belief is that music is healing, and that good music - no matter the artist, record-label, or genre - will be heard, and loved via the endless possibilities of the internet. 

Our current line up includes:
Aeropsia 
Atlantic At Pacific 
AViDD 
BitToryn 
Ghost Ark__† 
The Cogito 
F.K.F.L. 
Forest Dream 
Heart-Tricks 
Holm. 
Kenja 
Mist Glider 
Old Arc 
PCP* 
SHELF NUNNY

It's all electronic music so far, but we plan on releasing bands n such in the future as well. So if you're a like minded artist or musician, then hit us up! We happily check out everything sent to us, and are very fond of collaborating. 

Thanks for taking the time to check us out - you can email me @ iseestatic (at) gmail (dot) com if you have any questions or submissions.

It's different from /r/Songwriters, /r/Songwriting, /r/WeAreTheMusicMakers, etc. because I've attempted to disable the ability to upvote/downvote posts (with a dash CSS), and there are only self-posts.

I'd like it to be a place musicians will go to for conversations and constructive criticism, instead of upvotes.

I realize that Reddit's all about downvoting/upvoting/karma, so you might wonder why I didn't just create a forum or something.  Well, Reddit has a huge audience, and I like the interface...so that is why.

Also, please don't take the creation of this as me being bitter about having some of my posts downvoted here.  That isn't the case at all.  Well, it sort of is I guess...I just think that is the wrong way to look at art, you know?  We shouldn't focus on the success of our creations, but rather, how to improve them, and discuss them.

If you have any interest in listening to my music, I would appreciate your support more than you know.

If you prefer Dubstep or Glitch music, go to www.soundcloud.com/projectrapid

Most of the songs are free to download. I'm signed to an Indie Australian label called 4House Digital, but they don't limit my rights, so I am allowed to give you my music and you are allowed to share it as long as you link back to me. If you DO enjoy my music, I encourage you to download, burn, share with friends, etc.

I'm also on Facebook, and I have 2 Twitter accounts, 1 for each project, but I don't have enough followers to remind me to post, so I'm not very active.

It is a demo and was released due to a computer failure leading to a loss of all my recorded tracks and a temporary disinterest in re-recording everything. Instead, I would much rather focus my attention on new things (though, I do intend to re-record a few songs on this demo again to a better standard). Without a doubt there are problems to be found on this album, however I hope you can find some enjoyment in the ideas being portrayed overall.

The Horizon of a Dream and themes present on this album were inspired by the nature sequences found in the film ""Avatar."" Beyond this, lyrical themes speak of atheism, nihilism, love, and death in general.

My personally recommended tracks are ""To Dream of You Awake (While I Watch You Sleep)"", ""In the Ocean on the Moon"", and ""When a Ghost Embraced the Dust.""

If you enjoy my music feel free to download and comment.

1353095671.0,2,self.freemusic,13bc8e,Video game podcast accepting all music submissions for its breaks!,5,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/freemusic/comments/13bc8e/video_game_podcast_accepting_all_music/,"Hi everyone! We're a four-man team of DIY podcasters out of upstate New York: Thumbstick Athletes.

For over a year we have been releasing weekly episodes covering video games news, reviews, trending topics, so on and so on. Our tagline is ""Temper your expectations,"" so nobody leaves disappointed.

That said, we're looking for music to play during our breaks. We generally have three 1 to 1.5 minute breaks per episode. You will absolutely get attribution, and anything else you want us to plug.

We try to keep the music upbeat, but that's not a requirement.

We're not trying to promote anything with this post, so I won't include links, but you can easily find us with a Google, iTunes, Stitcher, Facebook, Twitter, Zune etc. search. Our webpage URL is fairly straightforward too.

If you're unsure about us, feel free to sample a show, or ask any questions.

Thanks!",,False,,t5_2qinw,False,,,True,t3_13bc8e,http://www.reddit.com/r/freemusic/comments/13bc8e/video_game_podcast_accepting_all_music/,

Hey. I've been in a band for a while that didn't work out but me and two of the other members reformed to create something I'm pretty happy with so far. Let me know if you guys agree. You just have to like us on FaceBook and go to the band page to listen to our two songs up now. Two more should be up this week, theres a shitty cell phone video on there too. We're working on a band camp and other sites now.
Please give me feedback and let me know what you think.
