Does your post and comment history as well as your reddit demeanor affect how people vote your posts?",117,20,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/vr790/for_the_past_6_months_i_have_been_conducting_an/,"edit: Mentioned on dailydot.com :D ty to Georgelulu for bring [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/vr790/for_the_past_6_months_i_have_been_conducting_an/c57954s) to my attention.
*nother edit*  Thank you everyone for the support!  At this time, I will no longer respond to questions
or comments from this post.  I will see you all near the end of December!





Just shy of 6 months ago, I began an experiment on the population of reddit.  My goal is to determine with reasonable certainty, if what you have previously posted and commented on as well as how you interact with other redditors affects your account negatively, positively or at all.

I used 5 accounts.  Each of the accounts conveys a different personality: 

* Always agreeing and supportive

-Always goes with the most popular comment on a post.
-Makes posts relevant to current trending memes or topics.

* Always contradictory and demeaning

-Always goes against the most popular comment on a post.
-Complains about current memes and trending topics.

* Blissfully ignorant and careless

-Asks dumb questions or points out irrelevant things regarding a post or top comment within a post.

* The coattail 

-Makes useless contributions to posts or comments such as ""lol"" or ""wow that's cool.""

-Always comments about a similar situation he's been involved in as an attempt to garner karma from other redditors. 

-Posts many [fixed] posts.

* Myself

-I post and comment as I actually feel.


Three months into the experiment, I changed the personalities on the accounts to see how they performed.

Once per day, *edit - at varying times* I make a post and a few comments in the same subreddit.  I choose a different subreddit every day usually one of /r/aww, /r/askreddit, /r/adviceanimals, /r/funny and /r/wtf and occasionally in another well populated subreddit.   The posts are on topic according to the subreddit with different twists depending on the personality.  I never use one account to comment on another. 

Here are some mildly detailed results thus far:

* The agreeing personality has the highest upvote:downvote ratio of all the accounts.  Redditors responding to his comments and posts are about 95% respectful and intellectual.  He has made the default front page 4 times in 6 months.  After switching this account to a more contradictory personality, this account continued to perform well and maintaining the highest upvote:downvote ratio.

* My personal account has the second highest upvote:downvote ratio.  I tend to keep an open mind when conversing with others and do my best to understand where everyone I'm talking to is coming from.
I have never made the default front page.  Most of my comment responses are respectful and intellectual with about 15% being disrespectful or trolls.

* The contradictory and demeaning personality is the third in upvote:downvote ratio.  His account has actually gathered dedicated followers who comment on and correct nearly every post or comment he makes.  He has never made the default front page and is the only account to receive private messages from other users.
After switching this account to the more agreeing personality, his upvote:downvote ratio is slowly improving, but the negative followers who consistently downvote everything he posts are having a noticeable effect on his performance, even 3 months into becoming a nicer person.  No matter what he posts and what he replies to, he is always received negatively.

* The coattail account is fourth in upvote:downvote ratio.
He has made the default front page once in 6 months.  I switched his personality to one mimicking my personal account.  His upvote:downvote ratio is slowly but surely improving.

* The blissfully ignorant account is dead last in upvote:downvote ratio.  It seems that being a dick is better than being dumb on reddit.  This account has never received private messages, but the majority of his comments are (as expected) downvoted until they are not seen at all.  His posts are 85% likely to die at 0 votes.
After switching his personality to one more intelligent and informed, his upvote:downvote ratio has improved more than the formerly contradictory and demeaning account, I believe since he has not gathered followers who target him.  His highest upvoted post has 24 upvotes.

So what does all of this mean?  If my (surely) flawed experiment shows me anything, it's that the way you comment and post has a direct impact on how others react to your comments and posts.  Of course if you're an idiot or a dick, you are going to get downvoted anyway.  However, even if you change for the better, there are still likely to be residual effects from your past behavior.  I can't say with certainty that people actually run a quick check on your history to determine if you are worthy of upvote or not, but there is definitely a correlation between your attitude and your performance.

Three months from now, I am going to change the accounts back to their original personalities and continue the experiment until the end of December.  It will be then that I gather all of my information and compile it in a detailed manner.  I will also reveal the names of my dummy accounts so that you can see for yourselves the experiment in action.

I’m sending you a picture of what my office door used to look like. 

I arrived at my office today to the image of a penis drawn on one of my favorite quotes from one of my favorite social theorists. Then, I noticed that some items were taken from my door. The “Free Palestine End the Occupation” bumper sticker was given to me by one of the first students I mentored in the McNair program. He gave me that bumper sticker shortly before he left Corpus to pursue a PhD in History at the University of Wisconsin—Madison. On either side of that bumper sticker are/were two postcards of the Palestinian territory. The postcards provide a brief historical overview of Palestine, noting the UN Resolution affirming the rights of Palestinians to return to their homes and land, and the subsequent encroachments of Israeli settlements within that territory. The story of the Palestinians reminds me of the story of American Indians and their loss of their ancestral land and way of life. I bought these postcards when I took my first McNair student to a conference at UC Berkeley. All three of those items were taken from my door… On the left side of the door is/was a postcard of a Chicana in a Rosie the Riveter pose; this postcard is a rare gem and a gift from a graduating student. That postcard was taken, too. Finally, the Occupy Corpus Christi poster was another item taken from my door. A student who played a role in organizing the Occupy Corpus Christi group came by my office last fall. His wife drew that picture and created fliers to try to get people involved in Corpus’s Occupy Movement. He and his wife had a couple of posters made of her drawing and gave one of them to me.

I know that the material I teach can be challenging, and I know that examining systems of inequality can be an uncomfortable exercise. But, the university is supposed to be a space to interrogate ideas, explore assumptions, and think critically about what we believe, what we “know” to be true, and the community and spaces we inhabit. What happened to my door saddens me and distracted me, but it does not deter me. Intolerance is everywhere; resistance to new/different ideas will always occur. If you are uncomfortable, then, I’m doing my job. Complacency is the breeding ground of mediocrity. Whoever did this to my door must have really disliked the ideas those items represented. I wish that person had come to me to have a conversation with me about their ideas instead of taking items that other students gave me.

I hope you have a safe break, and learned something from my class.

I am very disappointed about this suberddit. Looking at others like r/psychology or r/economics, this one just makes me want to cry. There's little content, and the one that makes it through the spam filter is just bleh. I know we don't have as many users as these other subreddits but perhaps we could use that to our benefit. 

I was reading the description in the box to the right and it says:

&gt;We ask that posts **contain actual sociological content**. We are happy to talk Sociology with anyone, but we're not here to pad your reading list or do your homework for you. 

What is even meant by this? Anything can be sociological. 

My suggestion is that we change the rules of the subreddit and make it a serious place where we discuss sociological research. Why don't we just focus on actual studies published on journals instead of submitting every news article that we feel is ""outrageous"" or other opinion pieces that speak about how sociology is perceived as shit by lay people. 

That's my suggestion. Let's moderate heavily this subreddit and use it only for discussion on research. Linking to PDFs and journal articles. 

If you guys don't think that's appropriate for this subreddit then perhaps we could create a new one just for discussions on sociological research published in peer-reviewed journals.


**EDIT**

Good to read the comments, I am wondering what the moderators think about this. 

The middle ground would be to do what [cf0ed2aa-bdf5-4ef6-a](http://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/o97dz/injecting_life_into_this_subreddit/c3fe4l6) suggests, try to integrate more serious stuff without removing the other links and try to back up comments with sources, as [cosmo_demonic](http://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/o97dz/injecting_life_into_this_subreddit/c3fe6bq) mentions.

IMO we could achieve this by incorporating a few features, tagged accordingly:   
[Sociologist_of_the_Month]: posting/discussing the work of *four* sociologists per month, sort of one per week… and preferably, according to birthdates; for example, the first four could be: **Lester Frank Ward**, who was born on Friday, June 18, 1841, in Joliet and devoted himself to the sociology of religion in the United States; **Erving Goffman**, who was a Canadian-born sociologist and writer, born in June 11, 1922, and became the 73rd president of American Sociological Association, being his greatest contribution to social theory the study of symbolic interaction in the form of dramaturgical analysis, with his 1959 book The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life; **Norbert Elias** who was a German sociologist of Jewish descent, born in June 22, 1897, and focused on the relationship between power, behavior, emotion, and knowledge over time, significantly shaping what is called process or figurational sociology; and also **Fernando Cardoso**, who trained as a political sociologist and was born on June 18, 1931 in Rio de Janeiro, to become the first reelected president of Brazil, based on the effort he made in modernizing the nation;  

[On-Going Thesaurus/Dictionary]: **permanent** discussion of sociological concepts, in alphabetical order, featuring research supporting/supported by the different definitions; these concepts should remain open for discussion throughout the time;  
 
[InterACT]: for example, trading socio-books and relevant resources, **hiring/for hire announcements**, (own) investigation troubleshooting and research tips, and cloud-computing;  
 
[META]: anything related to sociology of sociology and to the sociology of /r/sociology;

I am looking for ways to improve my Intro to Sociology class.  I'd like to make it more interesting, engaging, and exciting.  So, I have some questions for you current and former undergrads about the intro course:

* 1.  What topics got you excited?
* 2.  Is class discussion useful? Or do you prefer lecture?
* 3.  What readings/books were the most engaging or interesting?
* 4.  What do you think is the most important thing that you learned in  intro?
* 5. What kinds of exercises or assignments did you find most helpful or fun?
* 6.  Are there any tips you would give to a new professor based on your experience as an undergraduate?
* 7. Thinking about your intro professor, what was the best/worst thing about the way they taught the course?

And if you have any questions about graduate school or academia in general please feel free to ask!  Thanks!

I've almost finished my BA in Sociology, woo hoo! However, now that I'm going to graduate in a semester in a half, I'm starting to realize, holy shit, I have to put this education to use. I love everything about sociology (well, except perhaps the quantitative number-crunching. Maths makes my head esplode), so I chose the major that I loved, but now I'm worried that I won't be able to find any employment without a Master's. 

So with a BA in Soc, what am I qualified for? I've seen a few criminal justice positions, do those require extensive knowledge of the law (for parole officers, social workers, etc)? Is teaching an option, or is a master's required in most areas? Would I have to take education courses? 

Any responses are appreciated, thank you so much for helping an idiot out!

(Also, if I'm posting this in the wrong place, please downvote it to hell and tell me where I should be posting)

*Edit:: So based on what I've learned from you all, I either have to go for my master's or be prepared to work for little money at a non-profit, HR or rehabilitation center? Yeesh, that's daunting.

They can help us in our understanding. So what is it? First we'd be wise to look at what preceded it, that being Modernism and Post-Modernism.

A really simplified way of thinking about it would be...

*Modernism:* Everything was absolute, empirically defined and discoverable. Science is king, everything is part of a big picture.

*Post-Modernism:* can be thought of as a reaction to Modernism. Things became relative, context driven and inventable. Culture is king, there was a de-construction of a big picture.

What's happening now is a growing awareness (particularly in the art world) that [""Postmodernism is dead.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/PostPoMo/comments/ysf41/postmodernism_is_dead_prospect_magazine/) - and we're beginning to see the glimpses of a new era emerging. It goes by various names depending on who you talk to and it's context - but can be broadly thought of as

*Post-Postmodernism:* which seems to a return (or atleast striving for) a big picture, a new sincerity that uses modernist notions, post-modernist sensibilities but exists beyond those two and creates something new.

Anyone have there own take on this?

Alan Kirby's take on it is ""digimodernism"" and his research focusses on the way in which digital culture is influencing and tearing down postmodernism.

I would argue that an emerging culture will become more apparent as Generation Y matures as environmental, economic and social crises rise in impact. Particularly as the Baby Boomer generation begin to retire en-masse.

I am a female sociology grad student and I am interested in doing a phenomenological pilot study for my qualitative reserach methods class about what it means to be an openly female commenter on Reddit. 

A phenomenology is a qualitative research method that seeks to understand the essence of an experience. As a woman and a Redditor, I thought it would be interesting to talk to other women about the essence of their experiences as female Redditors.

I am looking to conduct a few text-based interviews over Reddit's private messaging system to learn about your experiences. Questions are fairly open-ended and the interview should only take about 20 minutes of your time (we could set aside a time that works best with your schedule!) And you can even do them in your pjs!

Participants will remain anonymous (I will not ask any identifying information about you - I am strictly interested in your Reddit experience). Additionally, any quotes I use from you will be attributed to a made-up username to further maintain your anonymity. I am completing interviews this week and the study will be finished by May. I will post it back to r/Sociology when I am done so we can all enjoy the fruits of our labor!

Would anyone be interested in participating? Please let me know via PM or in the comments below! And please let me know if you have any further questions! :)

Thank you!

**Edit: Thank you all so much for the fantastic outpouring of support! I have had the pleasure of chatting with some wonderful people about their experiences as female commenters on Reddit. I'm sorry I didn't have the chance to talk to everyone; it is just a pilot study so I had to keep it limited in scope. I am finishing up my interviews this evening and then getting to work on the data.

If the norm was to work less than 40 hours a week would people still be productive [And how much of a difference does each field make]?
Would people get bored [And, again, what are the differences between each field of work]? How would less time ""on the clock"" influence society for health, education, and cultural stimulation [For example, people may be more inclined to take a night class, simply for enjoyment]?

I could certainly make such a list and match 75% of a collective top-ten, but I've learned from my own reading that the ""definitive"" texts may actually be obtuse and difficult compared to less-known works which say the same thing but much more understandably, or go highlight a different nuance.

My focus is in the sociology of religion and cultural sociology, though any general texts for the discipline as a whole would be greatly appreciated)

In a nutshell: My essay's focus will be on the perception of externalized/internalized selves. 

Please answer as many/as few questions as you'd like. Any responses will be greatly appreciated!

1) In an online community such as reddit, what do you feel is gained and/or lost by the lack of face-to-face interaction?

2) In what ways do people appear to be more/less ""genuine?"" In what ways are you more/less genuine?

3) Despite not being able to see what people look like, how can you determine what ""type"" of person a user is? If you had to generalize, how would you describe a ""typical"" reddit user?

4) In what ways does reddit point to the future of socializing/social ""formalities"" (or lack thereof)/information sharing (google as opposed to the library)?

5) Is the reddit phenomenon of ""non-experts"" acting as ""experts"" freeing us from the archaic, bias limitations of privileged, ""qualified"" opinions, or is having infinite information at our fingertips making us lazy know-it-alls?

6) How is socializing online like meeting people inside-out? Based on what you've observed online, what conclusions have you come to about the internal selves of other people? Are people generally more cruel, more intelligent, etc. than they appear to be in real life?

7) How are your online friendships the same/different than your RL friendships? Are there times when you feel closer to your online friends? Are there times when you feel like the people you associate with in RL don't know who you ""really"" are? Do you feel like you make a better impression on people in your online community than people in your RL community?

* We are evolving in the direction of a world dominated by science (Auguste Comte) 
* The world is moving in the direction of increasing order and harmony (Herbert Spencer)
* Capitalism is based on the exploitation of the workers by the capitalists (Karl Marx)
* The modern world offers less moral cohesion than earlier societies did (Emile Durkheim)
* The modern world is an iron cage of rational systems from which there is no escape (Max Weber)
* The city spawns a particular type of person (Georg Simmel)
* A ""veil"" rather than a wall separates African Americans and whites. (W. E. B. Du Bois)
* People engage in conspicuous consumption (Thorstein Veblen)
* Knowledge is shaped by the social world (Karl Mannheim)
* People's minds and their conceptions of themselves are shaped by their social experiences (George Herbert Mead)
* In their social relationships, people often rely on tried and trui ""recipes"" for how to handle such relationships (Alfred Schutz)
* Society is an integrated system of social structures and functions (Talcott Parsons)

Durkheim: I agree that there are positive aspects of the Glenelg tram however, many of those people on the tram exhibited anomie. They did not talk to anyone and many had their headphones plugged into their skulls. I also noticed that those who came from lower classes typically wore different clothes to those in the upper classes who were more smartly dressed. The only social interaction that took place was when people bought their tickets, without social interaction how can a society be cohesive? When you put your headphones in you separate yourself from any form of community and where are you supposed to obtain well rounded beliefs and values?

Me: What did you guys think of the stores at Glenelg that you saw while waiting for the tram?

Marx: I found them to be indicative of a problem that is masqueraded, almost like the tip of an iceberg. The consumerism of modernity simply was not present when I was alive. I find that the proletariat is now not only a slave to the bourgeois but now they worship consumer goods. The proletariat no longer dream of a better life they are simply content to have whatever the bourgeois allow them to have. The bourgeois stockpile all the wealth in the world and the proletariat simply want a nice house, a nice car, decent clothing and a significant other. What they don't understand is that all of their goods come at the price of exploited individuals in other countries or maybe they do understand but do not care. Mechanical solidarity has been obliterated. The division of labour is now so intense that there is now a salesperson for everything. Instead of people producing and being a part of society and equally being supported by others businesses must use marketing to convince consumers to keep purchasing to keep the economy good for benefit of everyone. However nobody actually needs the majority of what they purchase to survive and the majority of all the profits only touch the pockets of few. 

Durkheim: Marx, you say that the division of labour being less mechanical is a bad thing. However, with every brick doing it's part the pyramids were made for men to marvel at thousands of years later. Do you think that without the adequate division of labour this illustrious vehicle could have been created? I  see a society where many are fed, they are enslaved by consumerism because they have the money to purchase the things that they want. However, this is purely psychological and not out of necessity. Nobody is forced to work and is so desperate that they cannot fulfill their dreams. Thousands of workers lives have been enriched by their employment by manufacturing the tram and running it day to day and many more peoples lives have been enriched by the tram running.

Me: So guys, we've passed a bit of scenery now. Any opinions of what you've witnessed so far?

Durkheim: Adelaide in the year 2012 is like one large organism. So many houses, the urban sprawl is so large. But it has to be because where would the workers live if it didn't? Adelaide is a truly industrious society. The manufacture, repair and contents of all these houses was produced by someone, everyone has a purpose. I can see now that there is no need to feel anomie. Those in these large houses have achieved it because they have been rewarded as a result of demonstrating great merit.

Marx: Emile, you talk about how great this society is but you don't comment on what you don't see. For instance have you spoken about all the people who are not included within this society? Homosexuals and the indigenous peoples of Australia? I think those who exist who are purposefully not allocated a place within the 'Adelaide Organism' may feel severe anomie. Emile you talk about the contents of houses as if employees within an ethical company manufactured everything and were paid fairly. Adelaide in 2012 is part of a global society where capitalism reigns supreme. It is a lot harder to exploit workers in Australia so the supply to satiate the demand for cheap goods was located overseas. The luxuries of Adeladians come at the cost of the suffering of those who they don't see, those who are lower class and without adequate political representation.",,False,,t5_2qhbo,False,,,True,t3_ujt3u,http://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/ujt3u/chilling_with_marx_and_durkheim_on_a_tram/,

This criticism is primarily concerned with issues of race, gender, ethnicity and LGBT rights. As social issues these are obviously important, and I am not in any way opposed to highlighting these issues or activism against injustice but the form that these concerns come with is where I feel may be problematic.

A significant backlash to this trend on tumlbr has also formed, evident most notably in my experience on the subreddit [TumblrInAction](http://www.reddit.com/r/tumblrinaction). The backlash comes from in my opinion the form that these social critiques are taking, but at the same time worries me because the backlash may take the form of dissuading social critique of any form. Not to generalise, but I do feel as though the social criticism on Tumblr is often lacking in academic support and has the potential to be wildly inaccurate as somewhat pointed out by a user of the aforementioned subreddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/19h4uh/how_information_gets_around_on_tumblr/c8nzvsx

The social criticism also seem to skimp over the overarching effect of class on these socially excluded groups, and appears to be somewhat individualistic. It also comes across to me as aggressive rather than progressive, angrily pointing out those who appear to be ignorant and bigoted using abbreviated terms that often even my sociological knowledge or google can't help me to deduce. This creates an exclusivity within this group that is hard for those who may be uneducated in their language methods to penetrate, and often these are the people who the 'SJW's (social justice warriors, to use one of their own abbreviations I believe) in fact target. They see this isolation and shaming as a solution to the issues without addressing some of the important underlying structures of society or getting involved in organisations/other activism. At the same time, I find the backlash to the SJW phenomenon via places/people like TumblrInAction  to be equally unfounded.

I promise there's a lot of content in the course, which is to say, lots and lots of academic content in PDF format.

I'm taking the course right now and, though I'm new to sociology, as a layperson/humanities student I'm finding the course incredibly interesting. In particular, I like being exposed to academic content that I otherwise would not have gained access to. I've always wanted to learn more about sociology, and it's awesome to not have to pay to take a course where I can learn just as much, if not more, than I would have if I had taken it at my college.

It's proving itself to be an extremely good resource for those who want to dive into the field but need some structure and discussion/explication/analysis. It also seems to be an equally good resource for those who are already well-versed in the field and want access to academic readings, all in PDF format, that they would not be able to find as easily. (Though, to be fair, I'm not really sure because some of this might be the ""typical"" introductory content, but still). 

I've tuned in to some courses online before, but this one is different because *all* the readings are supplied online, and it's going on in real-time so you can use the discussion forums (and the professor keeps up with those). It's been really immersive so far, and I feel more ""accountable"" than if I had merely been watching taped lectures (which can be awesome in their own right).

Obviously, you're not really required to do anything after enrolling, but there are lectures, live weekly seminars (mostly with non-USA students who are taking the class) and, most importantly, readings. So yeah, pick and choose among the readings, or do the class if you're new to sociology and you've got the time. It's in its third week, and new material is added each week.

For example if you earn very little you can get food stamps, but if you earn a little more you cannot. So there is incentive to earn less, lest they lose their food stamps. Where this is true, I see it as a reason to improve our welfare systems rather than reject them entirely.

I found a wikipedia article on welfare programs that illustrates that poverty in first world countries substantially decreased during the 70s-90s when many of these programs were started, which seems to indicate that they've made a difference. So my response to people making the claim that they don't work is now something like:

If these programs DID work and you went and checked out the people they didn't help (i.e. those who are still in poverty), wouldn't you expect to find that social welfare didn't give them an incentive to better themselves? There's selection bias going on here, in that when you're looking at those in poverty you're not seeing the ones who are no longer there because of social welfare.

Is there a better way to approach this? I'd like some reading recommendations if there are any good books on the arguments and data surrounding welfare.

So, I’ve just been watching an episode of “[Panorama](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01c2y2b/Panorama_Poor_America/)” (UK documentary show) about “poor America”. The program is mainly about the problem of unemployment and homelessness since 2008, with tent villages springing up around the place and massive queues for touring free medical consultation charity events etc (worth a look if you’re in the UK).

However, whilst watching this, like most who have grown up in a country with a welfare state that has been influenced by labour movements gaining power, I could not help but experience a little bit of WTF as I watched a person when told they need to go to an emergency room or possibly die, reply that they won’t because they can’t afford it.

And so, forming to the shape of a courier-new question mark above my head, came the following words:

**Where have the labour movements been in the USA? Why have they not gained any clear political influence?**

Obviously I’m not looking for a comprehensive answer on this. And no, it is not for an essay/exam/theses, just interest. Also, I am not looking for any of the socio/economic arguments around welfare please, unless closely related.

I’m intending to get around to some real reading on this eventually, but any kind of very brief outline on the subject would be much appreciated, and who knows, maybe good for a little bit of Reddit discussion?

As such, I am very familiar with the data set, and have done lots of reading about working with this data. 

Well, I tried to replicate their results and a few things are not adding up correctly. For instance, at one point they say a DV has N=5578, but on the next page they do a logistic regression on this DV with an N of 5582. I was able to replicate the 5578 on my data, so it isn't just a typo.

Similarly, there is an index with a mean of 2.17 in their survey, but I tried constructing it myself with no luck. A little digging and all the items have means of over 2.6. Doesn't make any sense they would get such a low mean. Already checked for mathematical errors.

Another spot they said that 72.5% of respondents went to the internet for health information first. The code book and my analysis both say it is actually 58.1% on the item the specifically mention twice in the paper. 

The list continues- they do nothing to account for modality issues (it is a mixed mode survey), they don't use the weights. 

I have checked the paper to be sure they aren't using some sort of selection criteria. They aren't. There aren't any outliers that would throw things off. There is something odd here.

By the way, they cited the survey report accompanying the survey (has information on all methodologies, weighting, pilot studies, etc etc) wrong. The first author's name is Cantor, not Canton.

This class has changed who I am and how I perceive the world.  I ask that you take your time and look into each of these documents.  This entry level class has had my favorite readings in college thus far.  I feel that I couldn't have taken this class at a better time.  With the onset of the BP oil spill, the press demonizing Assange and the tax break issues I find that this will help all of you fellow redditors to understand the structure of society even better in turn, giving you a greater understanding as to why it's happening and what you can do to change it.

* McIntosh: Begins to flesh out why it is that whites (like males) have an inherent advantage in society by showing the importance of interlocking oppressions and examining the unseen dimensions that influence day to day interactions.

* Lipsitz:  Discusses the ""progressive investment in whiteness"".  Covers the unseen advantages that whites      are given and shows where they are derived from.  Perhaps my favorite of all the readings.  
* Robbins:  Analyzes the disparity discrimination.  How the judicial system weeds out the wealthy while furthering the poor even deeper into the system.

1258565936.0,18,self.sociology,a5pyr,I wish this sub-reddit was more active...share your undergrad soc projects here. ,23,5,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/a5pyr/i_wish_this_subreddit_was_more_activeshare_your/,"As I sit here in my final weeks of my first semester at law school, I can't help but think about how much more fun it was to be a soc major than to suffer as a law student. We had fun projects, interesting material that wasn't torture to read, challenging ideas, fellow students who don't seem like they'd cut your throat when given the chance, etc.  From here, it looks like paradise (though I did my fair share of suffering in my soc program too.)  

I miss the projects most.  Most of the soc classes I took had at least one or two open ended projects. I was ""that guy"" who tried to pick out the most outlandish topics he could find.  

I don't have time to do full stories right now, but I thought I'd list some of my favorites.  I'm hoping other people will share as well.  Maybe later tonight I can add better descriptions, if I have time to go through and re-read the papers I wrote. 

* I took soc 101 in my first semester of community college and the final project for the class was what hooked me into the major. We just had to pick a subculture (the prof said ""the stranger, the better, don't pick the Amish"") and write about their norms, mores, inner conflicts, how they stand out from society, etc.  On my friend's suggestion, I picked furries. I found out there was a furry convention coming to my town that semester and decided to go there and interview people.  I also hung out in furry IRC channels and chatted with people (not undercover.)  It was an odd experience to say the least.  There's a lot to say about this, but I don't have the time to write it out at the moment...but I will say the weirdest thing to happen to me at the convention had nothing to do with furries. 

* I transfered to UW-Madison eventually.  In my experimental sociology course, we had to do a mini-ethnography project.  I originally wanted to do something about internet forums, but the prof didn't go for it (this was 2007...maybe things would be different nowadays.)  I decided to go to a nearby casino instead and was going to write it on gamblers.  of course, about 5 minutes after I got there, I realized that you can't just walk up to people in casinos and start talking to them while they're playing.  Let alone on a weekday night when the people aren't there for the social atmosphere.  Realizing I had picked the wrong topic for a proper ethnography, I decided to chance it and write about the atmosphere of the casino instead--the graphic designs on the machines, that C-major-pitched ambient sound that the slots make, and the lighting, among other things. While staying as objective as possible, I somehow pulled this off and got an A.  The prof commented ""you wrote an ethnography about machines!"" in huge letters on my paper.  

* In my criminology course, we had to pick a TV show or movie and discuss how crime/justice are portrayed in it.  I chose to write about the 3rd season of the Wire.  Watched it a couple times while taking notes...as people who've seen the show know, it's thick.  And without spoiling anything, there was so much to write about in that season in particular for a criminology paper.  If I remember correctly, it was a 10 pager, and it was one of the worst papers I had written in undergrad...it was pretty much impossible to satisfactorily sum up the criminological aspects of a season of that show in 10 pages.",,False,,t5_2qhbo,True,,,True,t3_a5pyr,http://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/a5pyr/i_wish_this_subreddit_was_more_activeshare_your/,

 An example of this is honesty. We all lie daily but hold honesty as a positive character trait possibly only in principle and not practice. When you fill out an application and complete the personality survey you are put in a position of lying to prove that you know what the morality of the invisible majority is or you can be honest but are portrayed as amoral. This is only one example but there are many examples in which lying is justified such as lying by omission or ""white lies"" or to be kind.

Another example is integrity; we act different ways around different people beacuse of social pressures and expectations. The general response i have gotten to this question is that it is so we can get along with other people. i understand that we cant curse out everyone just beacuse we dont like the way they look or something. however it seems counterproductive to avoid conflict beacuse without difference of opinion we cannot improve our viewpoints and will continue to be misinformed and carry illogical points of view on forever.

i am aware that this answer may involve some history as well. it seems like there had to be a point in time where ""right and wrong"" were given to us by possibly a king or group of people to have this constant divergence over generations between this sort of morality of the invisible majority to what we as people do naturally.",,False,,t5_2qhbo,False,,,True,t3_1ekant,http://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/1ekant/why_are_cultural_expectations_not_aligned_with/,

1339309954.0,19,self.sociology,uub8l,"Weber and Anomie, or Durkheim and the Spirit of Capitalism",21,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/uub8l/weber_and_anomie_or_durkheim_and_the_spirit_of/,"I finished Suicide a few days ago, and am currently ~70 pages into The Protestant Ethic. I was struck by how similarly Durkheim and Weber describe what appears to be essentially the same mentality: the view of industry, money-making, profit, etc., as an end in itself, not a means to satisfying human needs. For instance, in the chapter titled ""Anomic Suicide,"" section III, Durkheim describes the contemporary sphere of economic life as being ""in a chronic state"" of anomy. He goes on to describe his view of religion and government as previously being superior to industry: ""[Religion] governed the [entrepreneur/master], recalling that worldly interests are not man's entire lot, that they must be subordinate to other and higher interests, and that they should therefore not be pursued without rule or measure. Temporal power, in turn, restrained the scope of economic functions by its supremacy over them and by the relatively subordinate role it assigned them."" Later: ""Actually, religion has lost most of its power. And government, instead of regulating economic life, has become its tool and servant. . . . [I]ndustry, instead of being still regarded as a means to an end transcending itself, has become the supreme end of individuals and societies alike.""

Weber describes the spirit of capitalism very similarly to the focus on industry: ""The peculiarity of this philosophy of avarice appears to be the ideal of the honest man of recognized credit, and above all the idea of a duty of the individual toward the increase of his capital, which is assumed as an end in itself."" Weber also discusses the need for workers to be adaptable to new conditions in a capitalist enterprise and for entrepreneurs to have a ""strong character"" in order to withstand the stresses of their position.

It is curious that Durkheim states that religion ""has lost most of its power,"" in light of Weber's thesis. The following quote by the latter seems relevant: ""One is tempted to think that these personal moral qualities have not the slightest relation to any . . . religious ideas. . . . The ability to free oneself from the common tradition . . . seems likely to be the most suitable basis for such a business man's success. And today that is generally precisely the case. . . . The people filled with the spirit of capitalism today tend to be indifferent, if not hostile, to the Church. . . . [The meaning of their activity is] that business with its continuous work has become a necessary part of their lives. That is in fact the only possible motivation, but it at the same time expresses what is, seen from the view-point of personal happiness, so irrational about this sort of life, where a man exists for the sake of his business, instead of the reverse.""

Obviously it isn't terribly difficult to discern the viewpoints these two describe, and the descriptions in their entirety are not identical, but I find the parallels of religion and economy to be interesting. Durkheim also states that politics/government have become subordinate to economy, but so far Weber hasn't explicitly touched on the role of government, though he seems to have hinted at it. On the one hand, Weber seems to offer a clearer description of the spirit itself and the history/structure surrounding it, while Durkheim's writing makes intriguing implications for the psychology of anomy and alienation vs. integration in capitalism as described by Weber.

Edit 3: Some of these I can’t find online. They’re for sale, of course, but I tried to find alternatives for people who don’t have a lot of money to purchase books.

Here’s what we have thus far in terms of historical beginnings:

[Presentation of Self in Everyday Life](http://www.clockwatching.net/~jimmy/eng101/articles/goffman_intro.pdf) by Erving Goffman. Important to provide a well-rounded view of sociology. He focused on behavioral interactions.


[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society](http://www.amazon.com/The-Structural-Transformation-Public-Sphere/dp/0262581086) by Jurgen Habermas. This is an Amazon link. According to Brickus he is important for his work on rationality and the public sphere. This is necessary for understanding the democratic societies.


[Jurgen Habermas](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/habermas/) from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. A big long article explaining Habermas and his work. May be good for those who can’t buy the book.


[Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison](http://www.amazon.com/Discipline-Punish-The-Birth-Prison/dp/0679752552) by Michel Foucault. Amazon link. Details the evolution of punishment from the 1700s to today. 

[Discipline and Punish](http://books.google.com/books?id=AVzuf-r22eoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) by Michel Foucault on Google Books. Most of his book is available online, but not all of it.

[Discipline and Punish](http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/disciplinepunish/) by Foucault, spark notes. I know it’s bad practice, but it might be good for those who can’t buy the book. Just a thought.

[The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge](http://www.amazon.com/The-Social-Construction-Reality-Sociology/dp/0385058985) by Peter. L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann. Amazon link. Govty says it’s a must. I read through the small portion I could find online [here](http://evans-experientialism.freewebspace.com/berger_luckmann.htm) and it did seem very interesting.

[Foundations of Sociology](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Foundations-Sociology-Towards-Better-Understanding/dp/0333960505) by Richard Jenkins. Govty says this is a good introductory text. I’ve never read it, so I can’t say either way.

Resources: 

[Introduction to Sociology](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Sociology) from Wikibooks. Good for those who really need a crash course in sociology.

[Transformations of the Public Sphere](http://publicsphere.ssrc.org/) from Public Sphere. A long list of articles related to the public sphere and how it is conceptualized. Looks like a very good resource for those sociologists interested in the public sphere. 

[The Society Pages](http://thesocietypages.org/) is very current resource for sociologists.

[Sociological Images](http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/) from the Society Pages is a good resource for teachers and professors. Presents sociology very visually.

[Sociology for Nerds](http://www.sociologyfornerds.com/) suggested by chekawa. Pretty must as the title says. In addition, I run this blog. I like to think it’s a good resource, but of course I’m still just an undergrad so that’s where my level of understanding is. 

[Contexts](http://contexts.org/) from the American Sociological Association. Quarterly magazine that “makes sociology interesting and relevant to anyone interested in how society operates” according to their website. Chekawa recommends it. 

[Thinking Allowed](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/ta) a podcast by Laurie Taylor.

Plus the other stuff I had listed above. Marx is important because he began one of the three main fields of sociology. Engels is important because of his work on gender and sexuality. I found his work to be extremely enlightening when understanding the historical roots for how our views on gender came to be. Mills coined the term ""sociological imagination"" and provided us with our basis for learning about how we as individuals fit into history and society. In addition, West and Zimmerman provide important information into how gender is/was taught in schools and, hence, how gender is perceived today.

So, this is going to be a work-in-progress.  Let me start by saying that this will not be written like a research paper.  I'm currently in college and have too much of that going on to have time to completely write an essay-style analysis. 

I’m going to make a point to keep it to the sociological view of thought, as I am not comfortably knowledgeable about the psychological end of crime, and biological theories tend to be kind of sketchy, at least in my admittedly limited experience.  I’m also going to assume that those reading this have at least a limited knowledge of the character of Walter White.

**THERE MAY OR MAY NOT BE SPOILERS, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK**

**Durkheim**

It is debatable as to whether Walter White honestly believes that his actions are truly evil.  On the one hand, in some episodes he seems to feel genuinely guilty about his decisions – especially when it comes to Jesse, Skyler and Walter, Jr.  This is because of his initial belief that his reason for doing what he has done is the only thing he could do in his situation. 
Walter reaffirms the idea that crime is a product of norms.  At the very beginning of the show, Walter is interested only in cooking, not the business end, and his goal is solely to provide his family the money needed for their survival.  The only thing he has done ‘wrong’ at this point was to pursue a profession deemed criminal by much of society.  Why is it criminal, however?  Originally, it was because of the government’s decision that methamphetamine should be consumed, bought, or sold.  While most people do agree with this viewpoint in modern society, meth was perfectly legal and thought of as a treatment for obesity, Parkinson’s, narcolepsy and alcoholism.  It was not until 1986 that methamphetamine was made illegal.  This means that in the dichotomy between mala in se (wrong or evil by itself) and mala prohibita (wrong because prohibited), the crime of synthesizing methamphetamine is itself mala prohibita.  However, in later episodes, Walter changes over to the business side of the operation.  In so doing, he must resort to violence and murder.  His actions at this point become mala in se.

**Merton**

Merton’s principal belief was that crime was normal, and that crime was a product of society’s need to change.  There is no direct evidence of this being the case within the show, but as one Redditor pointed out, the entire concept would have been completely invalid had the show occurred somewhere with unlimited nationalized healthcare.  Walt would have had no need to initially deviate.
However, another of Merton’s theories applies more directly to Walt.  This is the concept of modes versus goals.  Before the show begins, it can be said that Walter had been a conformist.  He was a brilliant chemist in graduate school with the goal of being a partner at Grey Matter.  His ultimate goal, it is assumed, is that he could apply his knowledge for a monetary payoff.  However, as we learn later on, Walter decided against continuing with Grey Matter, in favor of a life with Skyler.  This resulted in his becoming a high school chemistry teacher.  In my own personal opinion, this is an example of a life which is characterized either by ritualism or by rebellion.  Most teachers do not become teachers for the money, after all.  Their primary goal in becoming teachers is to educate children.  So, as Walter continued as a teacher, he exhibited ritualism in the sense that he did not feel in place at his job, and he continued it for the sole purpose of keeping his family afloat.  He understood that no monetary gain would come from his profession.  When Walter was diagnosed, however, he had to innovate.  He could no longer afford the lifestyle he had unless he did so.  He found a lifestyle which was lucrative and which would provide him with the money he needed.  Innovation really worked for Walt in terms of the goals/means typology, as he achieved the ultimate goal of American society: monetary wealth.

**Agnew (Strain Theory)**

Walter White experienced every type of strain proposed by Agnew.  Walt certainly did not achieve the goals he set for himself in the past, as explained in the previous section.  Walter also lost a source of stability.  Over the course of the show, his family more or less disintegrated and his professional life essentially ended.  The most obvious type of strain experienced is the development or presentation of negative stimuli.  Walt was faced with this from just about every angle, by way of constant fear, anger, envy and jealousy over Gray Matter, depression and frustration over his personal life and who he was personally, the realization that he would have to face up to what he had done after he was cured of cancer, and a myriad of other things.  It’s hard to enumerate the number of strain factors here, as it is probably the major sociological theme of the show.

Rewriting is very important for ""good"" papers and is a common practice for both students and teachers. This involves stripping text of fancy, academic-y styles.

Characteristic faults of sociological writing:   
1. passive constructions   
2. abstract nouns   
3. unwillingness (inability) to make causal statements   

Sociological writers do not develop a culture, so pluralistic ignorance ensues.   

When writing, its important to have people (former professors, colleagues, etc.) read your works in progress.

Academic writers adopt (sometimes) elitist styles of writing not functionally, but ceremonially.
   
Use of academic style might reflect writers' insecurities,attempt to project authority, or to draw distinctions between laypeople.   

Undergraduate students are usually more concerned (as a result of the structure of the grading system) with writing as a means to earn a grade, as opposed to developing as a writer.   

Writing and teaching is “decoupled”, which mystifies the process. Professors stand as unquestionable authorities in the eyes of student.   

There is no One Right Way   

Don’t begin papers with evasive maneuvers.  Especially at the beginning.   

It’s important to write drafts, and rewrite, and revise. Not to overly plan out paper. Embrace chaos.   

You don’t have to solve all the problems you find in your topic—instead you can write about why they are problems and how you’ve thought about them.   

Rules pertaining to writing are not automatic. There are matters of creativity and taste.   

Content is more important than style   

Writing should be succinct, interesting, and active.   

Active is preferred to passive verbs   

Reduce repetition. Usually on serves to obscure points.   

Use concrete words and sentences when possible.   

Use caution with metaphors   


students guard their egos against peers and other scholars by attaching their work to a reputable research tradition

the “classics” of sociology have important functions, but can also stifle intellectual creativity

there is an ongoing relationship with contemporary scholars and their predecessors – “normal science” – you are only a small part of a very large scientific community

effectively using literature involves piecing together arguments and insights from others and filling in gaps with your own scholarship

paying too much attention to literature can also deform your argument, making it conform to the dominant approach – better to learn how to identify the ideological component in theoretical modules and learn to approach the same subject in different ways..   

tips will do nothing unless you make them habits -- practice

In sociology classes you're taught the major different sociological views (functionalism, conflict theory, symbolic-interactionism, etc) as if they are separate views and conflict with each other.  I happen to be a huge fan of Marx and conflict theory, but also view society as it interacts as a whole through a functional perspective.

Have I just not gotten to the point where the two views contradict each other and are not able to coexist?  I'm not any sort of purist where I think things are a certain way and can not be convinced otherwise.  I like to study every view and perspective and try to take away something from it.


So what am I missing that would not allow conflict theory and functionalism to co-exist?  Aren't these conflicts just temporary structures in society?  Yes I think the ruling class have power over the other classes, and its unfair and I feel should change (I do separate how I feel about anything from my studies), but I also feel like these people in the ruling class are just units part of organic structures in society.

I'm a college senior majoring in Sociology. I have a 2.7 gpa. I've changed my major 3 times and I decided on Sociology because I love learning about society and people, which is what most sociology majors love to learn about as well. 

I do plan to get a Masters. I plan on going to my current college and doing masters there. I want to get into Market Research or Non-Profit/Social Marketing. I also have an interest in Women's Rights/Issues. 

Here is the problem. I have NO experience in my field at all. I only had one job in my life and that was dealing with food and coffee. Since I changed my major many times, I wasn't able to get an internship. So at the moment, I'm looking into that and volunteering.

Sadly, some of these places want experience and I have none. I don't know where to start. If I ultimately want a career in Market Research or Social Marketing, where could I start? If it helps, I live in NYC. 

So far, I applied for volunteer positions in Non-Profit organizations to at least get my foot in the door. I also have joined Meetup groups for non-profits and Women's Organizations/Human Rights such as NOW and Amnesty International. 

Any advice would be appreciated. And no, I will not change my major.

It seems to me that in Africa, with a long fallow period and chiefs handing out land to feed families, it's clearly in the best interest of the household head to maximize family size, isn't it? Children and women generally cultivate, and produce more than they earn doing it. More women and children means more land, means more wealth. It probably explains polygyny too.

I know it's long, but it's important to share with you guys- sign, send, and spread the word!",17,5,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/1dn92l/just_received_this_email_from_asc_regarding/,"Dear ASC member:

 

For the past few months, with the assistance of the Consortium of Social Science Associations, your Executive Board has been tracking developments in Congress that have the potential to seriously impact the independence of the National Science Foundation (NSF) and to reduce support for social science funding at NSF and other agencies.   In this message we want to briefly describe these developments and to encourage you to voice your opposition to them.

 

During the federal budget negotiations in March, Senator Coburn offered an amendment to the HR 933, the Fiscal Year 2013 Continuing Resolution.  This amendment would have transferred $10 million dollars from the NSF political science portfolio to the National Institutes of Health for cancer research.  This was motivated not by a desire to increase cancer funding or to enhance NIH funding, but rather to eliminate funding for political science research.  While this amendment was not adopted, a second amendment offered by Senator Coburn was adopted.  This required the Director of NSF to certify each political science grant with a justification of how it ""promotes national security or the economic interests of the United States"".  This is now a requirement at NSF and will continue to be so as long as the federal government is funded by a continuing resolution containing this provision.  Needless to say such a requirement will have a chilling effect on NSF funding and is a clear intrusion by Congress into the widely respected peer review process at NSF.

 

Congress is now considering budgets for next year.  In these discussions, some in the leadership of the House of Representatives have suggested the elimination of the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Directorate at NSF.  Needless to say this would be a major blow to the social sciences in the United States.  It is very likely that if Congress does this to our premier science agency, other agencies may face similar challenges.  As a result all of the major social science organizations and the organizations representing universities and science more generally have begun to urge the Congress to reject these attacks on social sciences.  We urge you to join these efforts. Specifically, we urge you to write your Senator and Congressperson to express concern about the adoption of the Coburn amendment and to urge Congress to stop the efforts to undermine the NSF and to reduce support for the social sciences.  If you want to help we suggest you send a version of the following letter to your members of Congress:

 

Hello, my name is ________ and I am a constituent of Senator/Congressman ___________.  I understand that the current Continuing Resolution to fund the federal government contains a provision offered by Senator Coburn that requires special certification by the Director of the National Science Foundation of all grants made in political science.  Furthermore, I understand that some in Congress have called for the elimination of the SBE Directorate at NSF.

As a scientist at the University of ___________, I am writing to express my concern about this amendment and any other efforts that seek to eliminate a focus on social sciences at NSF or other federal research agencies.   Having Congress determine what is worthwhile science and what isn't poses a serious threat to the independence and integrity of the NSF and, potentially, other research agencies.

 

Thank for considering our concerns.

I'm feeling pretty good about this but I think I should try and publish some work before applying to grad schools again. Is this hard to do as an undergrad? From what I was looking at on websites for journals it seemed that none of them were concerned with only publishing people with something more than a BA but do they prefer to publish work from PhDs more than others? Will they give me a fair chance?

Also, what do you guys think of this idea that I have for a paper to go in Celebrity Studies. I want to call it ""They tried to make me go to rehab, I said no (and they should have listened)"". What I want to write about is how celebrity culture (particularly celebrity news coverage about celebrities with addictions) may be one of the reasons for the persistent popularity of drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs despite knowledge among the medical community that they do not work well and are exorbitantly expensive to run.

Essentially, I want to say that knowledge of harm reductionist addiction care is still out of the mainstream culture. This makes celebrity news coverage on celebrities with addictions invoke the idea that the celebrity ""needs"" rehab and there are no other options, essentially shaming the celebrity until they go to rehab. This persistent idea in the news coverage of celebrities with addictions is what keeps rehabilitation programs popular among people that are not celebrities and this is problematic for both celebrities and regular folks because rehab programs typically don't work and can cause more harm than good. Basically what that doctor on Celebrity Rehab does is dangerous to people. And, we should have listened when Amy Winehouse said ""No"" specifically because ""I don't ever wanna drink again/ I just, ooh, I just need a friend (a proper relationship that is unlikely to be found in a rehab centre)/ I'm not gonna spend ten weeks/ Have everyone think I'm on the mend (because there is nothing that could be mended within just ten weeks)/ And it's not just my pride/ It's just 'til these tears have dried (I'm not done crying yet so I'm not done drinking)""

My first was written to explore the theories and social causes of deviance. My final paper is an argument, and I want to argue FOR deviant behavior in the context of social change. 

I'm not looking for anyone to write my paper, but I was wondering if I might be able to spark a discussion and get some opinions that will help me while exploring different topics.

I want to explore drug prohibition a bit, as I think it's interesting that our [capitalist driven] society basis so many of it's norms on productivity. We encourage the use of caffeine to make it through the work week, and the use of alcohol to promote adjustment to the status quo. On the other hand, most of the argument against hallucinogenics is based on irrational media hyped nonsense. My experimentation with hallucinogenics didn't harm anyone, but led to a personal growth and awareness through my experience. I was able to educate myself enough to decide not to mess with drugs that would be harmful to me, though my choices had nothing to do with caring that many people label all drug use as being deviant. If anything, I had moments of clarity in my life to the things I was unaware of as being harmful and have made positive changes for myself. 

Overall I want to examine social control and conformity, and the how deviance can lead to an expansion on societies moral boundaries, encouraging social change. I know there are a lot of other directions I could go, does anyone have any suggestions for topics to explore? Anything like book suggestions, journal topics, or general ideas would help tremendously. I have access to my schools academic search for different studies and journal publications, which I have found very helpful, but I am running out of relevant searches.

Some of my interest in them stems from their application to current US politics, so keep that in mind.

I borrowed a general sociology textbook the other day, and was reading about the distinction between caste systems and class systems. I feel like I've been raised with the assumption that we live in a class system, but the more I read and the more I reflect on this the more I see many aspects of both systems here.

Perhaps some of the aspects of 'caste' that I see (e.g. white children born into poverty being substantially more likely to escape poverty than black children) involve cultural differences and are not directly institutionalized, but historically that seems like a very blurry and difficult line to draw.

Further, it seems like any perfect meritocratic class system is unlikely to stay that way as successful people find ways to help their friends and relatives cheat the system through techniques that I'm sure you're all more familiar with than I am.

It's no secret that the income gap in America (and elsewhere?) has grown substantially in recent decades, and the standard conservative answer I've heard to this is something along the lines of the ""a rising tide lifts all boats"" argument. I'm sure that there is some truth to this, but it doesn't seem like all of the boats are rising or that we should reasonably expect free-market capitalism to eventually provide all of our solutions. They also complain that progressive taxation removes the incentive for social mobility, but this strikes me as highly unrealistic. I don't know that anyone with power is advocating strategies to *remove* the income gap, so the top 1% will still be the top 1%.

Anyway, that's where I'm at right now. I know I don't know much and I'm sure that much of what I think I do know is actually wrong, incomplete, or otherwise insufficiently nuanced, but I'm looking for reading recommendations that might help broaden my horizons on issues relevant to what I'm talking about. I don't know if a pure class system would be an ideal worth pursuing, but I do think that moving in that direction from where we currently are is. I want to understand the different approaches taken in and proposed to help move and keep societies closer to that end of the continuum, as well as any other perspectives on what direction societies might take in the goal of making the world a better place for all human children to be born into.

Often they seem very bizarre to me, even though I've been working in a professional setting for many years.  For example, in [this recent photo of British Labour Party leader Ed Milliband](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02288/mitt-miliband_2288622b.jpg), he looks like he's telling a dirty joke or something.  

I notice this same robotic gesturing in television commercials where a salesman in a suit is talking to the camera, in business meetings, or when any type of official is giving a speech.  I know these gestures are supposed to enhance the verbal message being given, but at least for me they are always a huge distraction.  

  I know oration was first developed as a formal practice in Ancient Greece and taken further in the Roman Empire, and in some sense the modern ritual of public speaking probably has its roots there, but the modern-day people of that part of the world (the Mediterranean) have a much more natural and subtly expressive way of using hand gestures while they speak, not only in formal settings but in day-to-day life as well.

I remember a while back reading an article in a journal about how kids who do very good at school will generally be treated worse by their immediate family than kids who have issues with school. 

It striked me as very interesting because it went beyond the basic ""if you do better at school more is expected of you"" explanation. It also showed how this unfair treatment of brighter kids extended to many different aspects of their lives in the family. If I recall correctly, there was a decrease of this phenomenon with teachers' kids, but the figures were about the same for almost every other demographic studied.

Anyway, now that I need this article to support an hypothesis, I can't for the life of me find it, or even remember where I first read it. I'd very much appreciate it if you knew of this article, or of something remotely similar. Sources, I need sources!

1. what careers are the most abundant in social science and which are the most sought after? I've been interested in a bunch of different areas from social policy to consulting and honestly it's better for me to have something in mind when choosing a degree rather than to have nothing. 

2. do you have a career in social science and if so, what is it like, do you wish you had done anything else? do you enjoy it? what steps did it take for you to get there?

3. any other advice? any would be appreciated. i'm really interested in anthropology the most, but i'm also keen on sociology, social policy, political science etc. but i think i'm beginning to see university as a path to reach employment rather than just to educate onesself. thoughts? am i being naive?",,False,,t5_2qhbo,False,,,True,t3_1e6i66,http://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/1e6i66/potential_sociology_major_looking_for_information/,
1364873206.0,11,self.sociology,1bhq1h,Same-sex marriage: what accounts for the dispute?,13,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/1bhq1h/samesex_marriage_what_accounts_for_the_dispute/,"(Forgive me if I fail to use proper terminology in what follows...I discovered sociology several months ago and studying it has become a hobby in my free time.  Pointers &amp; corrections welcome!)

The debate over same-sex marriage in the US is at fever pitch right now.  Honestly, though, the debates I've read are boring: focusing mostly on moral and legal issues, with just a bit of history thrown in and a few studies about child-rearing.

What seems far more interesting would be to look at the issue from a sociological perspective.  It seems to me that this is basically a fight over inclusion/exclusion from a social institution, and thus from society itself.  I don't have any numbers, but my guess is that most people who support same-sex marriage would also support other measures that would ensure LGBT Americans a 'full seat at the table'--anti-discrimination measures, for instance.

On the other side of the issue, I would hazard to guess most opponents of same-sex marriage would also be against anti-discrimination measures, positive portrayals of LGBT individuals in the media, and other signals of social inclusion.

If we look at the problem this way, the rapid shift in attitudes seems to make sense: as more LGBT people to come out, their friends and relatives increasingly want to extend the full benefits of society to their 'smaller groups' of friends and family.  This simply wasn't possible in earlier civil rights battles, where there was no disguising, say, your race or gender: a black woman in the antebellum South had zero chance of being accepted as an equal into a group of white male friends.  An LGBT person, on the other hand, may be accepted into a group prior to coming out--forming a common identity with the group that will make the group more likely to accept them when they come out.  (This of course relies on the current self-reinforcing cycle of greater acceptance leading to more people coming out leading to greater acceptance.)

But if this is a dispute over inclusion, what accounts for the split?  Do people who are against same-sex marriage just not know any LGBTs?  Or is there something bigger going on?  (Again without numbers, I would guess that there's more to it than simple exposure.)",,False,,t5_2qhbo,False,,,True,t3_1bhq1h,http://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/1bhq1h/samesex_marriage_what_accounts_for_the_dispute/,

I've listed some objective pros and cons below:

Pros:

- 3.95/4.0 GPA while working at least 20 hours a week

- Worked as a research assistant and performed undergraduate research. Co-authored two articles currently under review and presented research at multiple academic conferences

- Community service and student advocacy experience in student government and state-wide student association

- Currently interning with a US Senator; handled constituent casework, especially dealing with immigration cases

- GRE Scores: Verbal - 158 (77th %)Quant -154 (66th %) Analytical Writing - 5 (92%)

Cons:

- I'm from a relatively small, non-research university (Minnesota State University Moorhead)

- My professors either don't have connections at the universities I'm applying or have not told me about them, so I don't have established relationships

For example nowadays, teenage interactions happen mainly in the context of high schools, in a very specifically defined environment, with a low adult:teenage ratio. This was not the case in the European middle ages, when teenagers would help their parents with labor or go in apprenticeships.

**Authors' main points/criticisms**   

* A dominant interpretation has emerged in english sociology of education for cultural capital the hinges on two assumptions/premises: A.) cultural capital is assumed to denote knowledge of or competence with ""highbrow"" aesthetic culture (such as fine arts). B.) researchers have assumed that the effect of cultural capital is separate from educational skills, abilities, or achievements. The authors argue for a more broad conception that stresses micro-interactional level processes through which individuals comply with the evaluative standards of dominant educational institutions. (Pg. 568)   

* The ""highbrow"" interpretation is not essential to Bourdieus conceptualization of cultural capital. Also find little in Bourdieu's work to suggest that skill or ability needs to be partitioned from cultural capital.  (Pg. 568-69)   

* The conception of cultural capital is more abstract than the research tradition has examined.    

* Culture **can't be ignored** in the study of stratification.

I just read about Strauss and Howe's 1992 book ""Generations"" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generations_(book)) and it sounds really interesting. I'm going to check it out from the library today.

So I guess what I'm asking is what the general sociological consensus of generations is. It seems so nebulous, even if we do have general definitions for Millennials, Gen X, the Baby Boomers, and so on. What literature is out there that's worth reading?

I'm wondering if anyone's interested in using Eureqa to model complex sociological data, especially an issue as thorny as gun violence. Out of curiosity, I used Eureqa (http://creativemachines.cornell.edu/eureqa) to model gun deaths at the national level based on a handful of sociological variables: gun ownership, per capita income, GINI coefficient, racial homogeneity, deaths from drug use, and education index. I more or less picked these out of a hat, but they each represent some of the more popular hypotheses about gun violence. (E.g. ""more guns = more violence"" or ""gun deaths are linked to low educational attainment and the pervasiveness of hard drugs"".)

The top equation has an r^2 of .73 from gun ownership, racial homogeneity, education index, GINI, and deaths from drugs (i.e. it ignores income per capita). I'm worried about overfitting, though, since the model is ridiculously complex. But, there's a simpler equation that still has an r^2 of .57, and only uses three variables, education index, racial homogeneity, and gun ownership: deaths = 12.15*educ + 0.2984*race + 0.1268*guns - 153 - 0.002775*guns^2 - 0.241*educ^2. The correlation coefficient is .75. I think that's fairly impressive, just from three variables.

Caveats: The data are incomplete and only cover 70 countries or so. I've also removed the outliers for better or worse.

However, lets say I did the same question but without any quantitative research, and I relied purely on theorists/literature whose papers are basically their own opinions, I.e. One person may say all people are hetro, another could say most are homosexual etc...

*Abstract*   
      
In this paper we examine the relationship between conventional Christian and paranormal beliefs.
Conventional Christian beliefs are those such as belief in Heaven, Hell, and the existence of God.
Paranormal beliefs include belief in UFOs, astrology, haunting, communication with the dead, and
Bigfoot. We test three hypotheses (deviance) (marginalization, small step, and compatibility) about
the relationship between these two belief types with factor analysis and regression analysis. The
data we use are from the Baylor Religion Survey, a national random sample collected by the
Gallup Organization in fall 2005. The factor analysis results show that there are two well-defined
spheres of supernatural beliefs, one conventional Christian and one paranormal. We find a net
positive relationship between these two belief clusters. However, a test of the compatibility hypothesis
shows that church attendance and religious tradition moderate the effects of conventional
Christian beliefs on paranormal beliefs. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for
theory and research.",,False,,t5_2qhbo,False,,,True,t3_13i9tp,http://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/13i9tp/round_trip_to_hell_in_a_flying_saucer_the/,

Then another day the Orange people let the Blue people go to the same schools as the Orange people.  The Blue people are obviously still not happy, as they are lacking many other rights.  But the Orange people don't understand why.  They have given the Blue people these two rights, and they don't understand why the Blue people aren't thankful.

I'm curious since whenever I talk to a foreign student, it seems hard to find common authors beyond the Tocqueville-Marx-Durkheim-Weber quartet (for example, a German student evoked Luhmann as if it was an essential read, while I had never even heard about him before that moment). 

I suspect extensive studies of the classics are a French thing : other than the four, we focused on the whole Chicago school, Elias, Berger &amp; Luckman, and, of course Bourdieu, again and again. I skip the more specifically French authors, dealing with more local matters, but these are the names which were continuously brought up.

So, what is it in other places ?

[**edit**] Thanks for all the answers !

I get know why the postmodernism questions are so vivid in the anglosaxon universities, while they seem quite rare in France. I think that since the [Maffesolli issues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Maffesoli), French sociology tends to avoid authors who sound too cloudy. Foucault, Baudrillard, Derrida etc. are disappearing from the curriculum in order to appear more scientific (a stance a bit extreme sometimes, imho).

Self-segregation college campuses
segregation college campus

Is there any GPA that I need to get? I'm interested in Wisconsin and Michigan for grad school, and I currently have a 3.55 at Stanford.

How much math do I need?

This being said, there's an additional methods course in the undergraduate curriculum, and I'm more qualitative by nature, anyway.

What about the GRE? I know I should take it next year (sophomore now), and I think I'll go ahead and do tutoring with Kaplan this year. What score should I want as a minimum, and am I being too proactive?

That's about it.

Sociology also sees how we treat each other because of who we are on the outside—race, gender, sexuality, etc. 

I, unfortunately, am a white heterosexual male. I dislike how people keep telling suppressing my views or opinions for something I simply had no choice over: the sexuality, race and gender with which I was born with. Whether people would like to admit it or not, everyone is discriminated because of what society has engrained into our mindsets.

I am well aware of these factors and what I will be doing if I take sociology. But my question is this: to what extent does sociology in university put the blame on white heterosexual males for how we treat each other? If I take sociology, will I constantly be reminded of my innate uncontrollable demographics?

I found that analyzation of the Vietnam war very useful in understanding my place in the Iraq War.

On a personal level, I don't want the Iraq war repeated for my children. I don't know if such activism is appropriate, but that is only my personal motivation.

I *think* I have a decent thesis - it analyzes the power structures of the last three 'counter-insurgency' wars and how they influenced the outcomes of said wars, and why Iraq was different. (plus a few other ideas, but irrelevant to this post)

&gt;What's particularly interesting is that for the ""legging/pants = slut"" response, a fair fraction of the responders appear to be female (as far as one can tell).

Anyway, I was thinking about the concept of ""slut-shaming"" in regard to this, and I have mixed feelings about it. 

On the one hand, of course I don't think women should be made to feel guilty about having/displaying sexuality.

On the other hand, I think sociologically: there are formal rules (laws, regulations) and informal rules (norms, mores) that help society to run relatively smoothly. Society has good reasons to regulate individual behaviors through informal means. I'm not a knee-jerk functionalist by any means, but I believe this.

Sexual behaviors and displays cause immediate, visceral reactions in us, that can be very disruptive of social situations ([a favorite -NSFW- example](http://www.collegehumor.com/video/6420466/the-problem-with-jeggings)).

Despite the fact that we're probably all pretty liberally-minded people, I would guess most of us would agree that in some situations, normative disapproval (""shaming"") of other people's behaviors/dress intended to socially regulate their actions may be appropriate.

What do you think?

The first group I used to hold membership to. When my sister tried to get me to read the books, I was immediately repelled by the premise of children killing children. However, this reasoning proved to be part of why I was drawn into the books so strongly. If you are the type of person who does not like children in violent situations or the obsession with violence in the present culture, then your ideologies are probably aligned with Suzanne Collins. The second group of people who haven’t read the Hunger Games are just my friends who don’t like anything popular.

From a sociological perspective (and probably anthropological), the Hunger Games is everything that is not the problem with today’s climate in violence. Foremostly, a huge problem associated with media portrayal of violence is hypermasculinity. Women are 50% more likely to be a victim in media. When there are aggressors, they are mostly male and the pinnacle of manliness. Katniss is obviously a female, but she does “shatter stereotypes” mostly because she sometimes takes on the role of aggressors, and is the dominant in the majority of her relationships (see Peeta, Gale, her family, basically any interaction for reference). This turns a lot of the fear of hyper-violence on its head within the stories.

The moment violence transcends its context and becomes fun is when it becomes a desensitized and dangerous factor, for children or any and every hungry media consumer. By the end of elementary school, the average child has witnessed 8,000 fictional murders. In most modern circumstances, these acts of violence are fast and left un-elaborated. They are used for entertainment value, and because of the large quantity, more and more gore is needed for shock. This is part of what disgusts Katniss, and ultimately us. When we know it is real, that this is a televised event of real kids killing real kids, but have become detached from emotion, consequence, or reality, we have the capitol consumer. In dehumanizing the victims, they dehumanize humanity.

In addition, all the Hunger Games does is elaborate. Katniss is absolutely haunted by her own killings, and many of the victors feel likewise. We have trouble connecting to those who don’t. Some of the deaths were devastating to all of us. We are shown victims families, and even the effects of violence just in Katniss’s numerous preparations for death. Almost all of the serious emotional content is dealing with the aftermath of senseless tragedy, and the desire to escape the manipulation of a society that demands it.

By the way, here is where I think the movie did a disservice. I feel because the violence was more PG, it made it far less meaningful. The tributes at the end are supposed to be terrifying reminders of the powerful adverse effects of violence.

So if you were on the fence about reading the Hunger Games because of violent content, it’s probably what you’ve been looking for.

I would love to eventually teach - probably at the community college/small school level.

Knowing that others have gone down this road before me, I am humbly asking for advice on:

- What I can do to not fall behind between today and my re-entry into academic sociology (outside of keeping up with current research/work; I read Soc Images and Contexts as regularly as I can)
- What I can do to prepare myself for the grad school applications process
- What I can expect from PhD programs/how I can best navigate them

1344879442.0,8,self.sociology,y5jv6,My juvenile delinquency professor just brought up a really interesting point about the meaning of equal opportunity while discussing Merton's Means/Ends/Strain theory,13,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/y5jv6/my_juvenile_delinquency_professor_just_brought_up/,"He said that opportunity is simply about having the ability to compete with others for goals/ends. I think this is really interesting in terms of how society views equal opportunity today. I think we (myself included) often think of ""equal opportunity"" as having equal rights to what others have, which isn't the case. His example was equal opportunity doesn't mean that you deserve/have earned the wealth of Bill Gates just because you are also a human being living in America.

Anyway, I know this is a short/underdeveloped post, but I thought it was an interesting idea to shift our attitudes in relationship to what we ""deserve"".

EDIT: Sorry that was so short, here's a little more on what he was discussing. The Bill Gates example was an extreme example. Here's a better one.

Also here is a link to strain/means/ends theory: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deviance_(sociology)#Merton.27s_strain_theory

In the context of juvenile delinquency, not all youth are born to the same social class, therefore some youth will have easier access to the ends than others. However, all youth *should* be able to have the same opportunities as others, regardless of the families they were born into. This doesn't mean that all youth should have the same lives, but rather that they are equally competitive for the means. So our focus in helping underserved youth should be in preparing them to be competitive, not giving them. So for example in the case of the job market. Equal opportunity doesn't mean that all youth should be able to get the same jobs. It means that we should focus on teaching them the skills to make them eligible for the same jobs.

I'm pretty sure you have been asked the same. Hell, secretly, I have asked this to myself! Let me explain: I *know* what sociologists do and can do, I *know* what sociology is supposed to be and how it works... but I confess it wasn't always easy to explain to *others*, without having long (usually boring) conversations about how **everything** is social *ergo* subject to sociological scrutiny... to which I always got a variation of these answers, either:   
1- «when you say everything is social you are just *trying* to give sociology credit it doesn't deserve»... bringing us to an almost philosophical debate whether the DNA, for example, is a social/cultural object or not - when I just wanna have a calm beer and talk about whatever - or,   
2 - «but how does that relate to the practical stuff, like, if I was to employ you tomorrow (!), what would you actually *do*?»... as if sociologists would/should be able to adapt to every single kind of trade the specialization of labor has brought about, or something...    
well, after a lot of talking, I came up with a good way to explain what sociologists do... at least **without** having to quote Mills on sociological imagination or Goffman on social-interaction or Bourdieu on sociology being a martial art...   
here it goes: everyone more or less knows what psychologists do, right? with the [label of depression](http://web.mac.com/kristian.pfanzelter/iWeb/Project/Secondary%20sources_files/The%20Effects%20of%20Stigma%20on%20the%20Psychological%20Well-Being%20and%20Life%20Satisfaction%20of%20Persons%20with%20Mental%20Illness.pdf) being loosely thrown, and all... so when people, or students, or co-workers, ask me what do sociologists do I say they do what psychologists do... BUT... psychologists deal with one ""patient"" at a time... while sociologists, because of their super-powers (ahaha) can actually deal with more than one patient at a time... ranging from say families to corporations or prisons... and can even deal with whole societies or cultures... in the same way as the psychologist, the sociologist tries to ""diagnose"" what is ""wrong"" with his/hers ""patients"", that is, *groups of people*, with their language, symbols, values, practices, etc...  
**Albeit not really scientific jargon**, I found this was extremely useful in transmitting what we do, to those who have no clue about what sociology is, or even to those who have prejudiced views of the social-sciences. This example takes a better-known (and similar) branch of knowledge but then it transposes it to the sociological reality and it's object of study (in my mind... **everything** ahahaha again).  
SO... care to share any examples/metaphors you might use for what sociology is and what sociologists do?

I'm having some trouble with this. He says some individuals are lowered by self-interest, but mankind is raised by it. What does he mean by lowered and raised?

I just started it and it looks like a good read, so I'm just placing some excerpts for your delight. I especially liked the theoretical clarity of Castells, no complicated or convoluted language. Hopefully someone who has more knowledge about this can tell us what he thinks about the book or other similar reads.  

**Defining a network society**
&gt;A network society is a society whose social structure is made of networks powered by microelectronics-based information and communication technologies. By social structure, I understand the organizational arrangements of humans in relations of production, consumption, reproduction, experience, and power expressed in meaningful communication coded by culture. A network is a set of interconnected nodes. A node is the point where the curve intersects itself. A network has no center, just nodes.

**Why network society instead of information society**

&gt;The reason, very simply, is that, as far as we can trust the historical record, all known societies are based on information and knowledge as the source of power, wealth, and meaning (Mokyr, 1990; Mazlish, 1993).

[...]

&gt;So, what is actually new, both technologically and socially, is a society built around microelectronics-based information technologies.

**Globalization and network society**

&gt;Thus, the network society is a global society. However, this does not mean that people everywhere are included in these networks. In fact, for the time being, most are not. But everybody is affected by the processes that take place in the global networks of this dominant social structure. This is because the core activities that shape and control human life in every corner of the planet are organized in these global networks: financial markets; transnational production, management, and the distribution of goods and services; highly skilled labor; science and technology; communication media, culture, art, sports; international institutions managing the global economy and intergovernmental relations; religion; the criminal economy; and the transnational NGOs that assert the rights and values of a new, global civil society (Castells, 2000a, b; Held and McGrew, 1999; Volkmer, 1999; Stiglitz, 2002; Juris, 2004).",,False,,t5_2qhbo,False,,,True,t3_oj9oc,http://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/oj9oc/castells_the_network_society_a_crosscultural/,

A major focus of my research is the creation and formation of virtual communities and user identities in relation to the virtual world.

I've basically been ostracized by nearly all professors at my current school (and many others) for focusing on the field.  Anyone else run into a similar problem with their specialization?

I understand that the current generation of successful sociologists aren't really in tune with the Internet and its possibilities. Many professors that I've talked to are technophobes (don't even own a computer outside of their office). 

I'm going to give you a quick overview of my opinion:

Despite what many modern sociologists believe about the limitations of communication through the virtual space (Putnam, Turkle, etc.), I believe that people have been far too quick to judge a medium that's essentially in its infancy (comparatively to other mass mediums of communication).  While things may not be as ""revolutionary"" as the prognostications of Wired Magazine in the 1990s, I believe that the technology used to access the Internet, and not the Internet itself, is the only real limitation to realizing its full potential as a social landscape.

Am I missing the forest through the trees? I know that you guys might be a bit biased, but I'm feeling as if it is going to be really hard to pursue this specialization with the lack of support that I've experienced.

I was thinking about using Super Bowl playlists on YouTube, but those are not really generalizable to all commercials. However, they are the most watched, so it might offer some insight on to cultural ideology.

A friend of mine uses the term 'survival of the fittest' when arguing in favour of free market capitalism (or at least why it's control is impossible), describing the struggle for power between corporations that results in the perpetuation of some, and the destruction of others, from what I think is called a Darwinistic perspective.

""In order to avoid the bullshit, I look to nature"", to quote my friend, who suggests that the social behaviour of non-human species can be used to simplify the complicated decisions (sometimes deliberately obfuscating - hence ""avoid the bullshit"") made by businessman, and the reactions of consumers. My friend also uses natural selection to suggest that that the inequality that seems to be a common component of capitalist societies is an unfortunate, but inevitable product (For a cat to survive, a mouse must die).

Me? I'm not exactly sure about describing the free market in terms of natural selection. For starters, I can't decide whether or not those using Darwin's dangerous idea to describe the inevitability of Capitalist inequality are just adopting a rough metphor, or whether they see it as a concrete example (I've yet to ask my friend). I've also read the phrase ""Darwinists underplay the role of culture"" in criticisms of this naturalistic perspective, but I've not found any explanation beyond this title, and I've yet to consider whether or not culture is again a product of natural selection, rather than separate from it. Is anything separate from it?

I don't agree with the attitude ""It's in our nature, therefore we can't stop it"". At a push I'd suggest that there's a certain responsibility that comes with being human. We can't resign ourselves to 'just being animals' on the one hand, and indulge in the complexities of humanity on the other. Mind you, this responsibility my presumption, and to considering what it's origins might be I find extremely taxing.

So far I've read a few different Wikipedia pages including those on The Naturalistic Fallacy, Social Darwinism, Sociobiology, Evolutionary Psychology, and a bunch of other pages to which these refer. I've been able to find a reasonable amount of academic information on why free market capitalism isn't a literal example of natural selection; though little to suggest that it's not a fitting metaphor.

**I would like to ask Reddit what other topics I might want to read about, and what other criticisms there might be of viewing capitalism from a naturalistic perspective. What should I read, Reddit?**

Lastly, I'd like to apologise if none of this makes any sense. I had to stop editing it because it's taking up too much of my day, but I'm not convinced that it's coherent.

Confusing territory, this.

[crosspost],11,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/drczt/anybody_interested_in_a_research_project_i_need/,"I grew up in a very small Midwestern rural community (approx. 3000 in the 1990s, maybe 5000 today.) 

This town had very little local commerce.  Very sadly, an incredibly over-priced family owned grocery store was the main attraction.  In fact, it wasn't until 1999 when a McDonalds arrived.  It was like the episode of South Park when a Wal-Mart was built: ""Now we're a real town!"" 

Because there were no places to land a secure job (it took 30 mins. to drive to a community to buy a pair of underwear) and there were no amenities whatsoever, drugs and binge drinking were the only sources of recreation for teenage-mid 20s something year olds.  

I've been collecting as much data as I can from families, newspapers and friends.   In the last 20 years, nearly 50 students have overdosed on drugs or have committed suicide from depression. Though this may not seem like a shocking statistic, I must point out that graduating classes average 145 students.  

So, (20*145) = 2900 graduates (rough numbers) in 20 years. 50 deaths is nearly 2% of all students who have graduated in the last 20 years.  

Our town is notorious for meth labs, heroine, morphine and the finest pot.  It is the culture of the community. Please, the community is falling apart and I ask for Reddit's help to research the culture, isolate issues, promote awareness and implement interventions. 

I'd be more than happy to answer any questions.  ",,False,,t5_2qhbo,False,,,True,t3_drczt,http://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/drczt/anybody_interested_in_a_research_project_i_need/,

I say useless because  its not something that may have a more guaranteed future - such as accounting might for instance. I value sociology and I know its a good avenue into graduate school, but I really don't know if I will be doing that - I am not that much of an academic..

  Recently, I've been in this crazy loop about what college major i want to be in. I'm currently 17, a senior in high school, and college applications are now open. This is where i need the community's help since i just recently opened a reddit account and noticed how awesome the people can be here! 

Anyways, I've always been interested in Sociology/Philosophy/Psychology. My Parents never had my back on those majors because they claim it does not make enough money. I'm not about the paychecks and i am determined that i will find something to do with those degrees. They push me towards Business Management and Economics, but i am not enthusiastic about those subjects. It is an extreme cliche in the college majors at the moment and it seems so that everybody has that. I see that sociology is a very diverse ideological major. I even did many of my sister's philosophy homework at her college and i loved doing so.

I need help seeing if i should follow my major of choice or just hop on the Business Bandwagon?

When people have support networks they are simply happier. Well, what I'm curious about if this association is consistent across communities. In other words, does a strong sense of solidarity and community involvement provide the same benefits (if any) in different communities, or are there certain community level factors that influence overall well being.

I'm thinking about taking this on as a project for a graduate level Hierarchical Linear modeling class where basically:

Dependent variable= some sort of composite measures relating to overall health (mental or physical). This is vague, I know.

Level 1 of the model= individual characteristics (demographics, everything else that is relevant)

Level 2 of the model= Community level characteristics- e.g. we could have data on zip codes individuals are nested in. Using census data you could use different poverty and inequality measures to differentiate between different communities.

Right now I'm just putting the idea out there to try to see if this is a vaguely interesting idea, but I'm also working on trying to find data sets that might lend themselves to this sort of analysis.

I thought it was possible that /r/sociology might also help as another source of advice. I know that it is a bit early and I have time to decide (I'm giving myself a year off in New York to mull it over), but at the moment I feel like I should prepare anyway.

I always wanted to study the Internet's effects on us and likewise, and I have really come to be encapsulated by Social Network analysis. I already have taken a grad class related to that and thought it was more interesting way to look at things than standard Statistics. I also am a Communications major to bolster that knowledge of the Internet.

Does anyone know of any great schools to apply for, especially relevant to this? I've heard about some of the big schools like Berkeley or Northwestern, but I have no idea what it takes to get in there.

This if my first post (x/posted), but I've been lurking for a while. I am a Sociology Student at Brigham Young Unieristy - Provo and I have to do an interview. I was wondering to myself how I'd find such a person my boyfriend suggested that I ask Reddit. 

I'd love to interview (probably for about an hour each) 2 people that meet the following criteria. My class is doing some preliminary qualitative research about LDS mid-singles and dating. //EDIT: We're still in the early stages and haven't nailed down the questions we'll be asking. Currently we're leaning toward obviously questions about how they feel about dating and their religion, but since this is something like a small scale focus group I think we'll largely be following the interview. There have been very, very few studies done on this group (especially men, which the men in our class will be working on).// When we're done our data will be used to help direct a full scale study that our professor and one of his collegues are conducting. //Edit This is definitely a convenience sample, because the main point is the learn how to do the interviews. It's just fortunate that we'll hopefully be able to get some interesting information that will help them in the real study they'll be doing later//

1. Female (We're each interviewing people of the same sex, to try to control interviewer bias as much as we can)
2. Between 31 and 39 years old
3. LDS/Mormon
4. Never married (including annullments) 
5. Preferably in Utah Valley (interview settings change the research, and they're more effective in person)

Thanks so much for reading!

TLDR: I'd like to talk to two, single, LDS women in their thirties for a Sociology project.

Edit: We'll be solidifying the research questions in the next week or two, but I think I should go into

I took a Sociology course and Philosophy course my second semester and though i already was aware of my love with philosophy the sociology took me by complete surprise, i fell in love within the first few weeks of going to class. I had an amazing professor, he had ways of delivering concepts at a level that clicked instantly, not to mention he was absolutely batshit crazy. He drove a Harley, spent large amounts of time in places such as Mexico, Haiti, and South America. (yes that says Haiti, he had awesome videos of voodoo rituals he would attend and film). He totally inspired me to switch my major to sociology, pursue a teaching career in both soc and philosophy, and travel the world. 

There was just one thing that always erked me about the guy; ultimately all his teachings, all the theories we learned, and experiments we had watched made the whole of society feel kind of...well...pathetic in a way.

It still fascinated me deeply, but all the students would agree my professor had a certain disdain for most of society. In class he would often make fun of the majority of society. Which confused me as he has been all around the world, met more people than i can imagine, and had experiences with cultures of people that sounded incredible. He literally dedicated his life to studying and drenching his life in social human behavior and yet, his teachings, though amazing, left me feeling slightly...*raw*... at society. Things like the Asch conformity experiments, Durkheims' suicide studies, and most of all the Milgram studies; made me more disappointed in the social behavior of specific cultures.

I was just thinking about friends (not a fantastic sample size) saying things like ""that doesn't deserve to be art"" or ""yeah he was okay but he acts like a woman"", while if I were to mention how I think religion is a bad idea I'd instantly get accused of being insensitive, that I ""don't know for sure whether god exists"" or that ""it gives comfort to people"". 

I then thought their religious perspective may be a quasi-relativist thing, where we've been taught not to think our ethics are better than others. But why haven't relativist ideas of gender and art forms also caught on to the same degree?

I should maybe also cite as an example the repeated ""public opinion"" sections on current affairs shows that have people asked ""do you think X thing is art? Should the government fund things like this?""

I do apologise of the answer is something simple I'm missing or I'm just off track entirely with my thoughts. Thanks for any input.

Although they've seen a great deal and undoubtedly helped us along, perhaps they have helped as much as they can?  Wouldn't people younger be more in-tune with what affects Americans right now?  

On the opposite spectrum of that, is the younger generation ready to take over?  Have we learned from their mistakes?

Advice? ,9,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/i853p/im_struggling_with_the_local_cultureperspective/,"(I'm a relocated Midwesterner) The more I understand the local culture (TN) the more I think it is doing great harm to my soul. There is a tragic authoritarianism here. The South like Japan is hierarchical and emphasizes politeness and avoiding direct confrontation with authorities esp. But children are not protected from it here. They are often taught that they have original sin and punished in ways that would shock the Japanese. Here is a related comment I found: ""...""poisonous pedagogy"" that views child-rearing as a contest of wills, where children are often subject to personal violence then forced to express their ""love"" for the abuser.""

Now there will always be contests of wills with kids, but what I am talking about is framing the entire relationship in this way. When people see their children as nasty little beasts that must be controlled.

I suspect this belief is why so many of the students in my classes suggest that we can ""fix"" the school system by reintroducing spanking and the Bible in our Elem. schools.

I think this kind of upbringing also explains why so many of my peers are so very reluctant to question, or even openly express their thoughts and opinions to profs and others in positions of authority. As direct opposition to authority and even peers is discouraged, the natural recourse is to behind the scenes maneuvering. So gossip and turning others against the person you have a problem with are the norm. The idea that one might sit down and try to hash out the issues you have with someone directly, is quite shocking and abhorrent to many people.

It just seems as if the adults are more childish than the children. And so i find myself wishing to avoid most people as much as possible.

Thnx for listening. ;o)

The source book is [Institutional Ethnography a Sociology for People.](http://www.amazon.com/Institutional-Ethnography-Sociology-People-Gender/dp/0759105022).

The author Dorothy Smith mentions that it is borrowed from Althusser, and after reading his glossary at [Marxists.org](http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/glossary.htm) with reference to Foucault, I created the hypothesis that a problematic is 'a commonly occurring superstructure arising in relation to a shared institutional base from which IE investigation flows.'

After this research I emailed a professor who leads a graduate course in qualitative methods to see if I was at all close, and she said that you don't understand IE from reading non-IE authors, and that ""it is in a way the point of disjuncture, the contradiction from which the investigation flows, the thing that tells us that an investigation is necessary and what exactly it is that you need to find out about.""

Now this is very vague, in true professorial style, but it was to some extent enlightening. I then changed my hypothesis to state that a problematic cannot be defined except by its function within IE, otherwise the objective definition of this term challenges the subjective nature of the IE method. In fact, what the term problematic refers to does not in fact become a ""problematic"" until it fulfills its role in leading to further investigation, then it is no longer part of the subjective investigation and can be objectively defined post-hoc.

Please let me know how I am doing understanding this term.

For example: in a classroom setting one charismatic, popular child arbitrarily dislikes another child. There is no campaign to convince other children to dislike this child, the charismatic child simply does not hide his disdain for the disliked child. Slowly other children adopt the same disdain for the child as well, though they never had a problem to begin with. They see one member of the group (the disliked child) not through their own eyes, but through the eyes of the other child.

Is there a name for this phenomenon (if it actually exists as observable phenomenon) - where people take on the likes/dislikes of the people they are around, particularly towards members of their own group, rather than form and adhere to their own opinion?
