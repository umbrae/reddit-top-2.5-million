The gist of this post is asking for suggestions... hopefully someone could give some useful advice. 

I do not feel happy... I have almost never been happy or content with my life. It has always been a let down. I have always been a let down. It hurts to live another day. I hate doing anything. I want to disconnect from feelings. I don't want to take any medication, I just want to not exist.

I have felt this way for a year now. I constantly think about my death.  
I will respond to everyone reply as quickly as possible. Hopefully a golden answer will arise and I won't end up dead in the next few years.

Also, I'm posting here because I have no real friends/ only acquaintances.

Sob story: For those that pmed about it

I hope someone reads this. I am lonely. I feel broken inside. I cannot express myself by any physical action. I hope I can convey my feelings to someone out there. I go day through day doing the same thing over and over again. During my days I small talk with others, or do meaningless things. I have no friends. No one knows about my existence other than my family, who I hate because they care about me. I don't have a facebook, or any other means of communicating anyone. I feel excommunicated from society. I could come here and post anonymously, as a no one. I just feel so lonely and insignificant. I have no one to share my life with and it's passing before my eyes. I'm not achieving anything. I'm just another person in this world.

It seems like every time I return home from work, I am left in a depressive state. The responses to my thread merit more of an explanation to what problems I am facing. When I originally created the thread, I didn’t want to type at all. I was in some sort of pain. I want to avoid sounding pretentious or superficial when explaining my problems. Personally, I become annoyed at human problems that could be considered minute to others. To surmise my hardships, I would sum it up with me losing control of my own mind. Not being able to trust what my own judgment… I am not going to try and make major psychological evaluations on where my life went wrong.  I developed this bleak personality with a pessimistic spectrum to what reality is. I am now 18 and I have social anxiety issues, self-confidence issues, and am obviously shy. I have spent about a year of my life focusing on an ideal notion that I don’t even know to be true anymore. I have deceived myself to the point where I cannot make a logical rational thought concerning this matter. When I started my job, I began noticing that a girl was looking at me. Or at least I thought she was. This resulted into me taking an interest in her. The interest grew deeper over the months. I began staring at her a lot. I believe that she would look at me too. There’d be a lot of awkward glances and uncomfortable situations between us. I thought that she was just shy and really liked me. I became obsessed in my head about the idea of her. I didn’t even know a thing about her, but I became obsessed in my own thoughts. These hints or what I perceived as hints to her liking me continued on for about a year. I’m not going to explain more about what led me to believe that she liked me. There would be more than just the occasional locking stare. I am not going to try and convince anyone and mostly because I feel insane. Ultimately, I concluded that either my mind was truly deceiving me because I was so alone. I was over analyzing the situations and maybe she just wanted to avoid me. Or I was just rejecting the notion that someone could like me. At times I would try and ignore her because I thought I was inadequate and she didn’t like me. I have to unfortunately deal with this every day at work. It drives me insane. I have tried to stop thinking about her but when I see someone everyday it’s nearly impossible for my mind to suppress the thoughts. I presently don’t know what she thinks of me, it could be completely one way or the other. I believe that because I cannot clearly assess the situation means that I am somewhat insane. I must be incredibly stupid to not be able to evaluate the situation. I want to avoid being an absolute fool and mislead myself, but I don’t want to lose the possibility of what I had actually perceived to be her. I make a lot of judgments on things and for the most part I am generally right. I tend to analyze things with accuracy. I have never felt so confused before. I feel almost dysfunctional. I am too cowardly to say anything because of my fear of rejection. I wouldn't be able to work anymore if things went bad. I am truly lost.
This whole problem that I face every day is just the start of the long list of problems that I do have. One of my other major problems is the lack of socializing with other people. I’d explain more thoroughly about what troubles me, but my eyes are closing and I feel like shit.

We've really had a spike recently.  I wanted to have a brief chat with you all, and I know you may have an instant tl;dr reaction to this, and I apologize.

But please read this bit.


I am constantly chasing down people who think they are ""borderline J/P"" or something like that, or posting their ""test scores"", and trying to educate them.  I am making this thread to consolidate the stuff I keep writing.


**This is the key point I want to establish.**  Myers-Briggs is *based on Carl Jung's cognitive functions model*.  They took his work, created an acronym to shorten it (INTJ is analogous to Ni-Te-Fi-Se), and then wrote up **horoscope-like descriptions** to make it more relatable and redefined the meaning of the acronym to make it easier to explain and easier to ""grade"" in test form.

Why did they turn Carl Jung's cognitive model in to a horoscope?  Well, to sell it, of course.

Yet, **the model is fascinating and useful when you recognize what it actually is**.



* *Carl Jung's Cognitive Model*

MBTI is actually useful *because* it is a shortcut for Jung's model.  If you treat it that way, it becomes incredibly interesting.  But to do so, you have to throw away the ""horoscope"" descriptions and ignore the stuff the Myers-Briggs organization puts out (for example, defining I/E as introvert/extrovert and J/P as judging/perceiving), or at least treat them as suggestions/observations.

INTJ is just an acronym to shorten the function stack of Ni-Te-Fi-Se.  INFJ is a shortcut for Ni-Fe-Ti-Se.  Myers and Briggs chose to redefine the acronym to have a different meaning because they were testing for stereotypes by each letter and scoring according to that.  But tests are inaccurate.  **There is not a scale**.  **You are either INTJ or INFJ**, you are *not* in between.  That said, you don't have to line up to the horoscope-like descriptions exactly.

See, Carl Jung's model was for how we take in and process information (and actually lines up with modern EEG tests).  It had nothing to do with values and behavior.  It's true that INTJ's *tend* to find a lot of environmental input overwhelming (due to inferior Se), and thus tend to be more introverted, and you can thus use a test to ask people if they dislike crowds and make an educated guess that they are an INTJ, but this is not actually a definitive feature of an INTJ.

Similarly, you don't have to be antisocial or as emotionally reserved as predicted.


**Ok, explanation of Carl Jung's model below.**

Carl Jung viewed everyone has having four functions for processing information.

**Intuition** and **Sensing** as Perceiving functions for taking in data.

**Thinking** and **Feeling** for decision-making and judgements. (Judging functions)

He said that everyone used all four, but used each in one attitude or another (introverted or extroverted).

For example, **Intuition** is seeing connections between things and symbolism, in a non-linear and not easily explainable way. Developing a nonfactual ""understanding"" of a system.

You use **Intuition** either introvertedly (long term processing in your head) or extrovertedly (to judge your immediate environment). 

Extroverted Intuition users are seeing subtle connections in the things they observe, Introverted Intuition users are using their intuition as a long term hard drive to build a bigger picture and not necessarily using it on their environment as much.

[Introverted Intuition compared to Extroverted Intuition](http://personalityjunkie.com/10/extraverted-intuition-ne-vs-introverted-intuition-ni/)

Same deal goes for all of these. **Sensing** is concrete intake of information, factual, quantifiable. Facts and sensations.

**Thinking** is objective thought process. **Feeling** is valuation, value system judgements, right or wrong (not necessarily emotional).

Same deal goes for all of them. Introverted sensors base their mental picture heavily on their past and experience and a black/white knowledge of right/wrong or facts. Extrovert sensors take in their environment very factually, see details, not necessarily connections.

Introvert thinkers look IN to a concept, look for internal consistencies and inner workings. Extrovert thinkers compare concepts more to their bigger picture. Introvert thinkers (Ti) want to know why something works, extrovert thinkers (Te) if it can be applied and how, as a simplified rule.

Extrovert feelers apply valuation externally, they're very community oriented. Introvert feelers much more personal value driven.

So, everyone uses all four functions, but different combinations of priority (which is their dominant?) and attitudes.

Later on, people following Jung's work noticed patterns. The perceiving functions are always opposite- Introverted Intuition users (Ni) also used extroverted Sensing (Se). Same for Judging functions. And their priority is opposite (if Ni is your dominant, Se is your weakest, with the two judging functions in the middle). And your top two are always opposite attitudes. This works out to about sixteen different possible patterns assuming these rules are ubiquitous.

A number of psychologists and students of Jung's work noticed these patterns. Myers and Briggs developed an acronym to shorthand it. The middle two letters indicate your top two functions. The last letter (J or P) indicates if the Judging or Perceiving function is extroverted, and the first letter indicates ordering (whether the introverted or extroverted one is on top).

So for example, **INTJ** is Ni dominant, Te second. By established patterns, thus, Fi third, Se fourth (and weakest process).

Myers and Briggs went on to take this acronym, and change the definition to one they could test for better. Since introverted functions tend to be a little more in-their-head, they just labeled every introvert function dominant as ""Introverts"". I now means ""Introvert"". Now you can ask people stereotype questions to see if they look like ""Introverts"".
They redefined all of the functions this way, the most gregarious being the J/P (J becomes ""I prefer structure"", P becomes ""I prefer options""), which is a massive simplification of it.

Then they developed a test to test for each of the stereotypes of the letters.

Basically, there's not really a good way to test for cognitive functions, except maybe an EEG (there are correlations between dominant function and **EEG test**. Source [slideshow](http://www.slideshare.net/AnnholmMSCCC/identifying-neurocorrelates-in-psychological-type-ap-ti-tc-2011) and [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGfhQTbcqmA). The test is the best thing we have, but it's very unreliable. It's possible to be very extroverted in behavior or value (wanting interaction, to be social) and still be an INTJ (Ni dominant, Se inferior, probably overwhelmed by a lot of interaction but still wanting to be social anyway).

So while the test is accurate more times than not, it's frequently wrong, and the way Myers Briggs present it is a manner which is almost like astrology. They simplify the four letters and then write up these huge very self-serving descriptions of the type that almost anyone can put themselves in.

&gt; ""ENFPs are warm, enthusiastic people, typically very bright and full of potential.""

Tons of people can relate to this!

&gt;They value intelligence, knowledge, and competence, and typically have high standards in these regards, which they continuously strive to fulfill.

Tons of people relate to this too! ISTJs, INTPs.

The vague, horoscope-like descriptions that anyone can see themselves in is what makes Myers-Briggs dangerously subject to cognitive bias. You make yourself what you want to be and see yourself as what you want to be.

If you switch back to the Jungian model, it's far more concrete.


* *On introversion and extroversion.*

""I""'s have a dominant introverted function (Ni, Si, Ti, Fi).  ""E""'s have a dominant extroverted function.  *This is all*.  It's very possible to be introverted and love people and be very social.  It's simply that dominant introverted functions tend to find too much input overwhelming, while dominant extroverted functions tend to thrive on more data (Se absorb anything they can, Ne scans constantly for connections, Te tries to control everything, Fe is connecting with people).

But all of us ""introverts"" have a secondary function that is extroverted.  We can develop this and use this socially.  This is all based on the individual.  So if you are INTJ and social and don't really relate to how everyone on this board seems to hate being around people?  It's not just you.  I'm a very social INTJ, but I much prefer 1:1 interaction to, say, loud clubs, because I find all the loud noise very input-overwhelming.


* *The test scores are meaningless.*

Remember, Myers and Briggs redefined the letters (I = Introvert, E = Extrovert, J = Judger, P = Perceiver) so they could test for stereotypes.  J's are people with an extroverted judging function in their top two...so J's either use Te or Fe very strongly, and are thus big on organizing their external environment (Fe around community, Te around optimization), and so, *as a simple stereotype*, you can ask ""Are you organized?"" and then score points towards ""J"" in a test.  However, there are plenty of P's that value organization or are organized.  And plenty of J's that might be disorganized.  This is nothing but a stereotype.

The scores you get on a test are just an indication of how well the test finds you to line up to the stereotype.  Just because you get only 1% T preference doesn't mean you're on some borderline of T/F...it just means the test can't figure you out.  

Guess what?  **People aren't stereotypes**, and tests are frequently wrong.


INTJ and INTP, for example, have completely different functions.  Remember, J means Judging function is extroverted, so INTJs have Te (and thus Ni).  I means Introverted function is dominant, so INTJs are Ni and Te in that order.  But P means extroverted perceiving process, so INTPs have Ne (and thus Ti).  And since introverted function is still dominant, they are Ti dominant, then Ne.

INTJ: Ni &gt; Te &gt; Fi &gt; Se
INTP: Ti &gt; Ne &gt; Si &gt; Fe

In fact, ENTPs are more like INTJs in a way (both intuition dominant with inferior sensing).

Many of you will be mistyped because tests are so frequently inaccurate.

**tl;dr**:

*Type yourself on the functions*, and use tests and descriptive profiles as an educated guide at best, as they are just stereotypes Myers and Briggs wrote up based on common behaviors observed in people who line up to Jung's model.

We value logical argument and rational thought above all else right? What is logical or rational about thinking that 'the vast majority of people are idiots' (whatever that even means). I have seen other instances as well of people on this subreddit talking like they are just unarguably geniuses and everyone else is just stupid or incapable of thinking on the same level as them. I think it might have something to do with our personality type being labeled ""mastermind"". People take a couple of Myers-Briggs tests and suddenly think they are the shit. We are supposed to be introspective. We look at the world critically and skeptically, but turn that lens inward as well and critique our own thoughts and actions. Either something is wrong with that assessment of the INTJ, or most of the people on here are yet to reach a point where they can honestly and objectively look at themselves in the same critical way that they look at everyone else. I hope this changes soon, because where once I was happy to admit to being an INTJ and being associated with so many great minds who have shared the same world view as me, some of the things I have heard come from so called INTJs on this subreddit might make me think twice before associating myself with that attitude in the future.

These will frustrate and offend me.

But none of the voices (or so few as to be drowned out by the consensus roar) will suggest that we need to accept that these horrifying acts are an emergent feature of our current sociological structure - that if we wish to prevent them, we must fundamentally rethink the way we organize ourselves - that failing these changes (or until then) the best we can do is far less than what we want it to be - that for now, we can only comfort ourselves and each other, and work to support one another by sharing our fellows' sorrow and hardship, so as to spread and minimize its collective footprint.

It's a paradox that being as dispassionate as I am about emotional subjects is so emotionally difficult and frustrating.

There are two major streams of INTJ's, and one is a lot more common than the other.",171,22,125,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1e6jm9/ever_feel_mistyped_there_are_two_major_streams_of/,"One of the most interesting things I read in relation to personality theory was [Cognitive Styles](http://www.cognitivestyles.com/). It is completely separate personality profiling system, but it can be used in conjunction with MBTI. And when you combine the two, you find out that there are **two major types of INTJs**

- The ones that don't wear a 'social mask' (perceiver INTJs)
- The ones that do wear a social mask (contributor INTJs) 

There are other variations, but these are the most common. Out of the two, the perceiver INTJ's are the most common. Contributor INTJ's (I am one of these) often feel out-of-step within the community, because they are always wearing some form of public mask, and always playing the social game, whereas their INTJ perceiver peers denounce such things. 

**Perceiver INTJs** 

- Hate social games, and usual rebel when possible and do their best to not comply. 
- They don't respect authority at all unless its proven itself, and even *then*, they are forever skeptical. 
- They have a strong moral compass, and they follow it. They have a very, very strong sense of justice. Pretending to be someone else, i.e. wearing the ""social mask"" feels dirty, because it is deceptive and not who they really are. 
- While most like *things*, they are less concerned with material matters. 
- They do not care what society thinks of them. 

**Contributor INTJs**

- Contributor INTJ's *do* care about what society thinks of them. They wear lots of social masks, and they usually wear them well. They play the social game, and they usually do this without being bitter about it (even if it makes them tired). 
- They key to understand why they do this, is that they are inherently *pragmatic*. Socializing is often not natural for them but they learn the skills because it pragmatically assists them in achieving their abstract goals. They don't have an inherent drive to be liked for the sake of being liked, but they want to achieve their goals. 
- They care more about possessions because things help them get other things; contributor INTJ's do well in sales and business.    
- Respect authority more because they take-on social roles when it is necessary. 
- Because they are incredibly goal-based, their morals tend to be weaker. They are more likely to blur the lines. They will do things to get ahead. Unlike the perceiver INTJ who doesn't like to lie about who they are (even if it means achieving their goals will be harder), the contributor will ""wear the mask"".

If you play Magic the Gathering, think of it like this. A Perceiver INTJ would probably be UUW. A Contributor INTJ would probably be UUB. They are both strongly blue; but they use it with different goals and values in mind.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

[...]

**Q: My INTJ is trying to take over the world. Should I be concerned?**

A: Remember, he’s trying to take over the world for the betterment of everyone and everything. Just go ahead and let him. He’ll be happy and the world will be a more organized and efficient place.

**Q: My INTJ just told me I’m retarded. Should I take offense?**

A: You probably are retarded, by our standards. But don’t take offense. Our standards are so high that even we don’t meet them. We judge ourselves more harshly than we judge others.

**Q: My INTJ isn’t sensitive to my feelings. Should I take offense?**

A: We aren’t even sensitive to our own feelings. Why should we be expected to be sensitive to yours? We won’t even try to fake it. Insincerity is a pet peeve of ours, and anyway, it would ruin our reputation if we ever showed emotion.

**Q: Why doesn’t my INTJ ever show emotions or feelings?**

A: Because he doesn’t have any. Actually, that’s not strictly true; it’s just that we tend to get emotional about things you might not appreciate. INTJs have been known to cry during the liftoff scene in “Apollo 13″, for example, and there are also many touching moments in some of the Star Trek movies. An INTJ may also smile or laugh at random for no apparent reason; probably one of the voices in his head just made a good joke.

[...]

**Q: I have this REALLY good idea… should I tell an INTJ?**

A: Sleep on it… for a week or so. If it’s still so appealing, sleep on it for another week. Then maybe run it by one of us and we’ll pick it apart for you. Your idea is more likely to survive our scrutiny relatively unscathed if you have actual logical arguments and sound evidence with which to back it up.

**Q: Is it dangerous to annoy an INTJ?**

A: First we will ignore you, then we will launch a volley of extremely witty but esoteric insults that will probably go right over your head, and finally we will just engage the “nod-and-smile” autopilot and go back to ignoring you. Best to leave us alone at this point. If you push us too far we may blow up your head with our telekinetic abilities. So, yes, it can be dangerous to annoy an INTJ.

[...]

**Q: My INTJ keeps disappearing. Is this normal?**

A: Yes. We need our “alone time” to recharge, more so than any of the other introverted MBTI types. Being around people for very long sucks the life force out of us, and we sneak off to be by ourselves whenever our “low battery” warning light starts to flash. (And in those cases where we can’t disappear physically, we will retreat into our minds.) Consequently we have great stealth capability; we can sit in a corner, observing while being unobserved, and we can escape, unnoticed, when we’re ready to move on.

**Q: Why can’t my INTJ remember anything?**

A: This is normal. Most of us INTJs are very forgetful. We have too much going on in our heads at any time to remember a lot of new stuff. Also, we zone out and go into autopilot mode quite frequently. We often won’t remember where we put our car keys because we weren’t “there” when we did it.

[...]

**Q: My INTJ is very pedantic.**

A: Strictly speaking, that’s not a question.

**Q: Dammit, see what I mean?**

A: Yes, the irony was not lost on me as I typed the previous answer.

**Q: And sarcastic as hell, too.**

A: Sarcasm is a free public service we provide to those within earshot. No need to thank us. We also do irony, hyperbole, word-play and puns, one-liners, quick-witted observations and flippant remarks, and abstract and deep philosophical insights on nonsensical themes. Our sense of humor tends to be dry, warped, and morbid, and not everybody “gets” us.

**Q: Why does my INTJ just start nodding and smiling after we’ve been talking for a couple of minutes?**

A:

**Q: I said, WHY DOES MY INTJ START NODDING AND… Oh I get it, you’re being sarcastic again. Does it ever get old?**

A: [ hey, more Wayne Newton anagrams… We Want On Yen, Ant On New Yew, Way None Went… ]

**Q: Hello? Are you going to answer any more questions?**

A: [ … “Hair Salon For Stray Nerd Nuns”, “Larry Moe and Curly’s On”, “Karaoke’s Not That Fun”, “Harry Potter’s Gay Stepson”, … ]

**Q: Asshole. I’m outta here.**

A: [ works every time ;) ]

INTJ is simply a shorthand representation of one swiss psychotherapist's take on the human mind. Being an INTJ doesn't make you socially awkward, just as being ESFP doesn't make you a social butterfly. Being ESFP doesn't mean you can't think outside the box, or be amazingly intellegent, just an INTJ doesn't mean you *are* amazingly intelligent.


Your behavior is what causes people to think you are rude, or offensive. You might stastically be at a higher risk for being perceived as rude, being an INTJ, but that doesn't not mean you get a free pass or that you are destined to be a [FA](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/003/619/Untitled-1.jpg) [SAP](https://twimg0-a.akamaihd.net/profile_images/1619866208/socially-awkward-penguin.jpeg) [asshole](http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/31116601.jpg). Unless you had a major problem with your brain's development, you can learn to not be offensive to other people. Remember when you had to learn the names of all 50 states? Remember how much that sucked and how you knew it would never help you in life? Remember how you did it anyway and still got a passing grade? Same thing.


There seems to be a lot of ""DAE hate it when [insert stereotypical introvert problem]"" posts here lately, with little substance. This isn't /r/allcapsmotivation , or /r/offmychest , It's INTJ. Obviously if you truely think other INTJ's would benefit from what you have to say, or vice versa, post away. 



But most of these problems have to due with underdeveloped social skills. Not being INTJ. Introverted simply means you feel recharged when alone and can become exhausted when presented with *too much* social stimulation. It doesn't **make** you socially awkward, just as much as it doesn't make you smarter than the av-er-age bear.",,False,,t5_2qowo,False,,,True,t3_18p9lh,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/18p9lh/this_needs_to_be_said/,

In reading these more recent posts I've noticed how many of the readers on this subreddit are so Focused on how misunderstood their personality is that they don't realize how much they misunderstand the personalities of others. People don't understand you or your actions for the same reason you don't understand theirs! People are different, and they're not made to cater to your callous, NiTe looped personality. 

Honestly if you're still on this subreddit and you haven't read about your [cognitive functions](http://personalitycafe.com/intj-articles/91946-ni-te-fi-se.html) then you probably shouldn't be posting anything, especially discussion threads.

We have 2 auxiliary cognitive functions: Fi and Se.

Fi, or Introverted Feeling, is what saves us from turning into callous jerks who disregard others' feelings. It will help us control our impulse to say ""You're totally wrong"" and instead say ""There is a slight flaw in your logic."" An INTJ's Fi is often a far reaching, connecting logical perspective on one's role in their world. It'll help them feel more connected to the people around then, no matter their personality.

Se, Extraverted Sensing, is our weakest, but IMO most important function that we could develop. As INTJ's we are all too familiar with the constant mind-chatter that never stops, no matter where you are or what you are doing. Extraverted Sensing is a function that calls for a mute button for your thoughts. It's a wind-in-your-hair, eyes shut, quiet function that simply calls for you to stop thinking so hard and just take a leap of faith by not drawing logical conclusions all of the time. Se is the hardest function for an INTJ to develop because we often lack the tools to develop it, since our other 3 functions are at least slightly based in logic. 

To all of you out there complaining that you're misunderstood or that you're not made for this world, shut up. You're just complaining about how awfully rounded you are. Do yourself a favor and learn to adapt to the world around you.

5. Mistake: Preferred learning method of fools, in which one must first do something wrong in order to do it right in future attempts.

6. Sharing: The beautiful act of buying friendship.

I feel like I've been doing it since I was 5-6 and now I have many people in my life I've seen regularly for anywhere from 1-20 years that I have ongoing lies with, a few that if they found out they would never speak to me again. 

I'm usually very open and honest. But let's say someone asks me a direct question. If my honest answer to that question exposes me and my lying won't hurt anyone? I'll lie right to their face without second thought, even if it's someone I love. 

It started out as just something I did as a kid because I was constantly exploring boundaries, sometimes to a fault but it's how I learned and chased interests before the internet. Dissecting animals/insects, experimenting with different household chemicals, making homemade fireworks and explosives etc. I was always 100% cautious and thorough, but I realize now I still could have overstepped the line pretty easily, I guess it's somewhat lucky that I never hurt myself. 

I've always demanded that I have my alone time like I'm sure many of you do. But growing up this meant having to explain what I was doing, and this is where the lying started. I told the truth at first but I would get in trouble and told ""Don't do that again"". I didn't accept that, I needed my freedom to explore my interests.

So I lied. And I still lie, and what's scary is I always get away with it. But I'm realizing my whole life from other peoples point of view (if they truly knew me) is one giant complicated web of lies. I can handle remembering all that I need to remember in able to enforce the lies now, but I can't ignore the fact that I have many years of life ahead of me and that I might be hurting myself in the long run here. I'm just having trouble accepting the thought that my entire system might be flawed because it's all I really know. I've never been willing to sacrifice the weird things I do in my alone time to have completely honesty in a relationship, and I've learned that most people don't usually want to accept me if I do tell them.

My grades fell off, I put on 40 pounds, my parents stopped seeing me as a young adult, my younger brother stopped looking at me with respect, I lost my best friend, and broke up with the love of my life. 

I honeslty felt like a complete failure and attempted suicide three times. Each time I failed attempt lead me to believe I was even more of a failure (""I can't even kill myself!"" heh). It was at that moment, two summers ago, when I decided that I would pick up my life's pieces. I started by trying to drop all the weight I had accumulated over the past year (30 lb). I got on Starting Strength 5x5, fixed my diet, and added a rigorous cardio regiment. By the end of summer, I was 40 pounds lighter and sported a six-pack. I did this by reading hours and hours of fitness material. Here's a pic of a few months [ago.](http://f.cl.ly/items/3Y433t1o2w2e172o2K2m/Screen%20shot%202013-05-31%20at%207.50.34%20AM.png)


Now, school was restarting and it was time to bring this new form of motivation to the classroom. I literally dominated classroom discussions and scored a 3.9 GPA over the next year, netting me huge attention from the recruiters in my job area. I did this by analyzing what great students did and mimicking them, all the while fixing what I felt were flaws in their strategies.

Next, I had always been a shy guy, especially around women. I watched those around me who were great with women and people in general. I started copying them, feeling insecure in my mind that I was coming off as a creep of some sort. It wasn't until I had a talk with a lady friend that she said I was known as a very smooth and confident person. Now, I have no problems making friends with random people on the street. (This does not mean I go around talking to everyone, but if need be, I can make and guide great conversations.)

I only recently found out about my INTJ designation and it is comforting to hear of people who go through the same things I go through (especially when it comes to other people). As INTJs, we have a unique ability to change the world for we are able to analyze the world around us in a rational manner while still preserving a unique sense of imagination. USE IT. Start planning. Make moves. Let's make it happen, guys.

---


**#1. Stereotypes.** There are many INTJ stereotypes. DON'T pay attention to them. Most of these are created by those who are NOT INTJs, and it's more of how they try and make sense of how you think. 
  

**#2. Be Strategic.** Strategy is, in essence, the ability to make decisions about how to use limited resources to create relative advantages. That is, how to take not enough of something--time, energy, money, people--and use it for advantage in your current situation. If you've got to knock out Ali in the boxing ring it will require much different use of resources than to knock out the town drunk. 
  

**#3. Systems.** Not all INTJs are alike, but for many (me included) all I think about are systems. I'm connecting patters all around me all the time. It is the heart of the INTJ, in some ways. How are these things related? Where is this going? There is more going on here, but what? Where is this headed and how can I make it better? 
  

**#4. Since you know systems, you know VALUE.** This is critical. Since you have the ability to know how things work in reality, you have the ability to uncover what makes things valuable and in what contexts. 
  

**#5. If you don't know where to start, look for intersections.** Because INTJs are able to engage (and enjoy!) digging into very complex systems, we can also understand these systems when they INTERSECT. Most others start to break down at these points, and lose the thread, and get confused. 
  

**#6. Everything is a Case Study.** Don't waste a single opportunity. Everything around you can give you further and further insight on what MAY BE happening, what may be possible, and how to improve the world (it's systems, patterns, and interactions) all around you. Everything you do or see can help you in this. 
  

**#7. Yes, you have emotions.** One joke/stereotype of INTJs is that we don't have emotions. NOT TRUE. It's just that once we've understood how something works at a deep level, and what it means, we don't really care if some SF comes by and says it must not be right because it doesn't fit with some model they have. 
  

**#8. When Things Go Wrong.** When times get hard, it's easy to turn to things like heavy drinking or drugs to dampen the thinking in your head. Especially under stress and when you have no time alone all day, and even when exhausted, you may not be able to get your mind to turn off and go to sleep. 
 

Just be careful is all. Follow the pattern out in your head to see where it is going, and be brutally honest and objective if you have a problem.

What I came to understand was that the INTJ was not a robot, nor devoid of feeling or sensitivity, but they are in fact so sensitive to their environments that computing everything makes them seem robotic, as the wheels in their head are always turning and processing. Emotion just may not register visibly or until later on, after all the information has been sufficiently churned into the realm of disinterest. Or perhaps, as in my case, you're so immersed in your thoughts and ideas that you barely recognize what's going on around you, and have a slow response to your surroundings.


But when I'm coherent enough to listen to people ramble on about something, or pay attention to a presentation, I feel for them if they slip up or do something embarrassing, or somebody heckles them and they're not gutsy or witty enough to rebuke the insults thrown their way. I'm not gonna go up there and defend them, but the utter lack of finesse on the presenter's part, or the forgotten manners of the audience tend to stir me emotionally. It's awkward for everyone and it's a waste of time. It doesn't show but I'll be damned if I don't *feel* something, whether an impatient churning in my gut or a roll of my eyes, it's there.

Just because this type is supposed to be very systematic, logical, and practical doesn't mean they're a super computer or completely socially inept. I keep seeing this idea enforced everywhere though, and it's just as annoying as the ""my INTJ is acting up, need help"" posts, as if it's some kind of disease whose symptoms you need to treat.

This may come off ranty and a little self-absorbed but I have a perpetual problem that I don't see myself getting out of with my present mindset, looper is the best way to describe it. It's so counter-inuitive to the core that I can't move forward.

There are probably more of you who feel like this, but i'll break it down really easily.

I want to do great things I'm proud of, because of this... I am very picky with the things I want to do.... and because of that, I end up doing nothing.

Every idea that pops into my head of doing x or trying y usually just comes with a list of an infinite number of negatives and doubts to it... not the sort of doubt like ""Oh man.. im not good enough, I couldn't do that..."" more like ""I could so fucking do that, but is that really want I want to do?... what I want to spend my time doing?""

a lot of you will probably then say ""Well, it's not like what you're going to do is what it's going to be for the rest of your life..."" that is damn true, but every step forward will impact the further steps... it's natural that when I play a certain field, I will play similar fields. Baseball isn't played on a soccer field for a reason. 

I guess basically what I'm looking for is, how have you come to just accept not being able to do everything? Have you found something that really feeds that itch you have? 

I feel like we ALL want to do EVERYTHING... yet some of us end up doing nothing. I am being spoon fed life... and 100% of me is bored with life and seeks adventure... yet because I'm comfortable I still live the same simple life every day. School, work, procrastinate, school, work, procrastinate.

Life is boring when nothing is being achieved, and problems aren't being solved... and my biggest problem my whole life is my inner counter-intuitive battles.

I don't think this serves any purpose except to single yourself out as ignorant or obstinate.  Who makes you the referee for this community?  Get out of those threads.  This is about sharing your personality, not imposing it, or rejecting others' personality anecdotes.

The two groups I'm talking about here either believe they've ""met the standard"" for INTJ and are on a vigilante mission to purge the community of impurity, or they're critical to a fault of other threads.

Surely with a strength in contemplative thought we should be able to grasp the concept of what a community like ours should look like.  We don't need scrubbers brushing off people, who they alone decide to reject.  We don't need the copious negativity that stifles conversation.

- TL;DR - if you're an INTJ Nazi you're probably failing at your own personality type, and if you're a Negative Nancy, you need a different hobby, because this should be a place for progress.

When it turns out that I wasn't right on something I made explicit care to qualify, it doesn't bother me at any more than being off on one of those ""guess how many jelly beans are in the jar"" contests, or when I throw a dart and don't hit the bullseye. And here they go making statements of fact that are just objectively not true and they think it is the same thing.

You never see extroverts or sensors on Meyers-Briggs discussion sites, because they have great difficulty honestly evaluating their behavior (and would rather talk to ""real"" people anyway). Extroverts tend to look towards others for answers (or in the absence of people not give a shit about the test) and sensors look to their immediate environment. Neither of them put much value in written, self-administered tests. Feelers and perceivers on the other hand do, but I argue they tend to answer more inaccurately than us as well. Feelers answer what they WANT to hear, and perceivers give themselves the benefit of the doubt and do the same thing so they aren't judging themselves to harshly.

INTJs on the other hand love order, patterns, and practical knowledge based in reality. We are all too happy to sit alone at our computer, think realistically about our previous behavior, make judgments about it, and answer Yes/No questions.

The Meyers-Briggs typology system has been consistently disregarded in mainstream psychology literature. It is claimed that the number of people who consistently obtain the same test result is not statistically significant. I propose that the reason for this is the fact that the farther one gets away from the INTJ paradigm, the less likely it is that one will obtain accurate test results. An ESFP has a low chance of his Meyers-Briggs personality typing matching his actual personality. An ISFP would have a slightly higher one, an INFP, would have an even higher one, and an INTP would have an even higher one. But INTJs are the standard the APA should base it's results on before discrediting this incredibly helpful psychological tool.

As I'm growing older, I have developed an increasingly disturbing mood disorder. On certain days, I feel euphoric. These are the days that I have the urge to accomplish something monumental and actually do something with my short-lived life. Unfortunately for my situation, these periods of mania do not last long. It is usually surrounded by a cloud of depression. I feel as if I'm floating in the space-time fabric, bound for one direction in life. Without gravity and anyone else, I am alone with my thoughts, simply floating through space. These days are passing by faster than I can even fathom. I am absolutely alone, with no where to go, nothing to do, and no desire to do anything, including the act of sulking and contemplating my unhealthy mental state. I've set relatively high goals in my life, compared to the rest of my peers. I also partake in a part-time job while I attend college. None of this matters though, it does not change the realization that is engraved in my mentality. Nothing fucking matters. 


I feel absolutely sick when I think about my problems. In some sense, I am completely overwhelmed by the chaotic feeling that is accompanied with my perception of these problems. In retrospect, I create more problems by self-loathing my pathetic whining. These problems are fixable, and I should be more than happy to live my life. Then again, I feel like these problems are unique to my being and are practically impossible to overcome. 

Another growing problem that I have is becoming dis associative in some sense. The sensation of this issue is like being in a stranger's home with absolutely no clue of what to do. With me, I have all of these memories of what I did, but I don't feel like that person in those memories. I don't share the same feelings or ideologies as that person. I think differently now. Now I am lost and confused. Who am I? I don't feel special or unique, I don't even feel like a statistic of the world. I am completely fucking null. This feeling is beyond disturbing, it is numbing. 

I no longer have the willingness to live. I don't want to grow old, or experience certain milestones. I simply don't care. I can't care. I am in awe of the people that can delude themselves into thinking they have a purpose and that they'd become meaningful by engaging in the obligations of society. Everything exists in society to keep people busy from realizing what is going on. Of course, I am a genius. I've discovered a fucking anomaly. No. There are thousands, maybe millions of people who have contemplated these bizarre realms that I have. I have gone further to attain a level of individualism. I have studied science and mathematics. I have sculpted my body. I have attempted to master hobbies. All to distract myself from the increasing level of depression. Again, I could just shrug this disorder off as simply a chemical imbalance that exists in my brain. Then again, everything in life is controlled by chemical reactions. I could go on and on and attempt to fool myself into thinking that I am special, but for the sake of everyone who reads this, I am going to keep it short. 

So, once again. Here I am, with the strong urge to end my life. Cease to exist. End my pointless existence. Seems so simple. I can't fool myself any longer that anything matters. There is nothing anyone could say. Nothing anyone could do. I am not going to seek help and I probably won't even kill myself. I don't know what else to say, since I am just writing whatever comes to my head. In some sense, this may be therapeutic because I feel relieved.

To clarify now, I do not find the aforementioned facts disheartening. I have read a fair bit of existentialist literature including all of Albert Camus' works, the underlying theme being that we must embrace the meaningless and absurdity of the human condition. This idea makes perfect sense to me. My problem is that I am 17 years old and as a result of all the aforementioned though process, I expect myself to do something absolutely incredible with my life. Something truly worth my one existence on this earth. Yet I find myself wasting hours on Reddit and Facebook and hating myself for it, or questioning the entire merits and effectiveness of mass education and then hating myself for not doing better at school (I do quite well but not near what I believe my potential to be). And then I question if it is even worth it and if I would be better off playing video games all day and working at McDonalds.

I do not know what I want to do when I finish school, I find interest in too many things, it just seems incredibly boring spending 3-4 years studying one thing. In the end, as a result of following through this existential thought to its logical and real life conclusion, I end up essentially despising myself. I feel inherently compelled  to be someone 'great' (whatever that means) and do amazing things. That is the essential issue.

**TL;DR** Looking over that, I just sound like a rambling teenager. Which I am. Sorry. I'm just sure that others on this forum have had similar issues with existential depression and similar issues (and/or being young and ambitious), and I think a discussion would be worthwhile. If not, I found this somewhat cathartic nonetheless.

I think the main reason it annoys me is because I actually don't feel good about myself. I feel like a failure. My work is a poorly paid, low status, job and I know I should be able to achieve a lot more. I used to be a programmer but I did lots of stupid things—mostly because I thought too much of myself—and never managed to actually produce anything useful or hold down a job in that field. And so the only reason I'm any good at the job I'm doing now is because I actually have a good attitude and I work hard. The second I stop concentrating, double-checking, and questioning myself I become shit again. (And actually that happens way more often that I would like.)

I find it really annoying how some people have started to get this idea of me that I'm consistently great because I'm actually fucking up all the time and sometimes I don't have any energy and I can't be bothered so I really don't think I am that great.

Chapter 9: Descriptions of the Sixteen Types 
Page 109 

""**Introverted Intuitive Types 
INTJ and INFJ** (They describe them together) 

* Are driven by their inner vision of the possibilities 
* Are determined to the point of stubbornness
* Are intensely in individualistic, though this shows less in INFJ's who take more pains to harmonize their individualism with their environment 
* Are stimulated by difficulties, and most ingenious in solving them 
* Are willing to concede that the impossible takes a little longer-but not much 
*Are more interested in pioneering a new road than in anything to be found along the beaten path 
*Are motivated by inspiration, which they value above everything else and use confidently for their best achievements in any field they choose--science, engineering, invention, political, or industrial empire-building, social reform, teaching, writing, psychology, philosophy, or religion. 
* Are deeply discontented in a routine job that offers no scope for inspiration
* Are gifted, at their best, with a fine insight into the deeper meanings of things and with a great deal of love 
As with all introverts, the outward personality of introverted intuitives is strongly influenced by their auxiliary process. For example, two of the most outstanding officer candidates in a Naval training unit were both introverted inuitives. (Skipping extraneous information) A woman who knew them both well summed up the contrast by saying that if both were aboard a ship that was torpedoed, the INTJ would be primarily interested in controlling the damage, but the INFJ’s primary concern would be crew’s welfare. They agreed that she was right. 

Among the research scientists and design engineers, introverted intuitive stand at the top. INTJs are somewhat more likely than INFJs are to be interested in scientific and technical matters, but when INFJs are interested, they appear to be just as good. In an academic setting, INFJs may be even better, probably because feeling is more eager to meet a teacher’s demands, whereas thinking is likely to criticize the way a course in conducted and refuse to bother with items it considers irrelevant. 

Thinking or feeling judgment is vitally necessary, and introverted intuitive must develop it for themselves, because their utter conviction of their intuition’s validity makes them pervious to the influence of outside judgment. The importance to introverted to intuitive of cultivating a judging process to balance and support their intuition cannot be overemphasized. 

Their greatest gifts comes directly from their intuition—the flashes of inspiration, the insight into relationships of ideas and meaning of symbols, the imagination, the originality, the access to resources of the unconscious, the ingenuity, and the visions of what could be. These are all inner gifts on the perceptive side. Without a developed auxiliary judging process, they will have little or no development of an outer personality and equally limited use of the gifts (euphemism for functions). However, a good judging process in support will shape the intuitive perceptions into conclusions or actions that will have a sound impact on the outer world. 
Van der Hoop recognized this problem: 

There is a peculiar difficulty, where this inner knowledge is concerned, in finding even the approximate expression for what is perceived. It is extremely important, therefore, for people of this type to attain through their education a technique of expression…. 

(Van der Hoop continued) The development of this type is slower and more than arduous than that of most other people… Such children are not very amenable to influence from their environment. They may have periods of uncertainty and reserve, after which they suddenly become very determined, and if then they are opposed, they may manifest an astonishing self-will and obstinacy. As a result of the intensely spontaneous activity within, they are frequently moody, occasionally brilliant and original, then again reserved, stubborn and arrogant. 

(Still continued) In later life, also, it is a persistent characteristic of people of this type, that while on the one hand they possess great determination, on the other hand they find it very difficult to express what they want. Although they may have only a vague feeling about the way they want to go, and of the meaning of their life, they will nevertheless reject with great stubbornness anything that does not fit in with this. They fear lest external influences or circumstances should drive them in a wrong direction, and they resist on principle. (1939, p 48) 

It follows that these people cannot be successfully coerced. They will not even be told anything without their permission, but they will accept an offer of facts, opinions, or theories, for free consideration; the excellence of their understanding must be trusted to recognize what is true.” 

There are sections “Introverted Intuition Supported by Thinking” and “Introverted Intuition Supported by Feeling”, but I won’t post those unless there is a decent demand. 

On to the functions. 

Disclaimer. Peter and or Isabel Meyers do not provide the introverted and extroverted version of each function. I could have sworn they did, but apparently not.

My husband needed some funny stories, anecdotes, anything to get his mind off of his discomfort. I was so exhausted I couldn't come up with anything. Normally, I read him funny things off of Reddit, but yesterday during recovery, it didn't occur to me. I just couldn't think of anything to do for him. 

I became distressed because I could tell he really needed some joking around - his kind of joking around - and I just couldn't come up with anything. 

So, I went home and asked his best friend to call him.

I've been taking care of the logistics, every physical need he has, I have copious notes about after care and the things he is going to need to do for the rest of his life ... but I couldn't make him laugh. And, I couldn't find anything to distract him because I wasn't on my game.

I am seriously thinking that he deserves better. Any personal assistant can keep track of his shit. Not everyone can make him laugh. And, I can't seem to do that for him.

Just because your personality is best reflected by INTJ does not make you a genius. I personally do not see myself as an INTJ, but more so my personality is most like of an INTJ. It really irritates me that someone thinks just because he/she is one type makes him/her completely different from someone else as if they are another species. Or the opposite, just because my personality best reflects one type does not mean you and I have the same personality. 

I see a lot of ""DAE"" posts where a little quark is tied to one personality trait. I think that's a load of bullshit to even ask. Why would you even ask that? If you are remotely intelligent, you'd already come up with the conclusion. Perhaps it's just people trying to fit in, trying to find someone who understands. I can understand why someone might be asking in that circumstance, but actions and beliefs tend to be independent from personality types. 

Another thing that annoys me is people associate INTJ with genius. Unless you have credentials to back it up, don't act as if you are any superior to anyone else. That might irritate me the most. ""Oh,  think rationally and logically."" Emotions play a role in your decision making regardless if you know it or not. And people take the whole emotionless thing as if it's a superior trait. It's a crippling ailment for me. 

It also irritates me when people refer to other people by their personality type. It's like ""I'm trying to date a Scottish girl, what can I do""? Is there a good chance that she eats haggis? Sure, more than a Korean would. But it's just overgeneralized statements. You have to see everyone as a person, not some label that you put on them. 

I see some people get overly sentimental, or embraces a certain trait to a point that it defines them. I think that's a load of bullshit as well. I think it's more like a self fulfilling prophesy. You just perpetually pound that idea into your head, you eventually become it to a certain extent. I think many people on this board misses the big picture. The big picture is that you are you, I am I. We are all different. Do not overgeneralize people, ever.

So I’ve never done this before, I don’t look for solace of comfort with strangers on the internet, but If I had to choose a group to talk to. It would be you bastards. 

The theme might be a tad philosophical, but I think it sways more to psychology and anthropology. Ive broken it down to make it more digestible.




**Social Interactions and views on society as a whole.**

As I have known for a while I am an INTJ. Over the years I’ve been very social, people like and seem to flock to me. But the last 3 years I’ve seemed to distance myself somewhat from people. I stay away from parties, social events and other such things as a general rule. Now my arguments are not what you may expect, “I was shy” “I didn’t know anyone”. It is nothing like that. My reasons for not going to things like that are that people who normally tend to those functions are attention seeking dumb idiots ( I would like to swear , and I have in the past about it). I have developed a refined taste for not bothering to go to places like that. The more I think about it, the stupider it seems. 
Case in point: Nightclubs…..Now during Uni (chemistry grad) I went to a few, only because my friends wanted to go to them. (Mixed group). I HATED going to places like this, I thought they were just grounds to pick up girls/boys and nothing else. I find no real reason why they are as great as everyone else makes them out to be. It’s when I point out these issues they get annoyed or more likely just try to defend why they waste their time and money. I have found over the years, NO redeeming features going to places like that and I do not see the appeal at all, I cannot talk, even shout to other people, I cannot enjoy ANYTHING, as people are throwing up and fucking everywhere. It’s a madhouse and I don’t see why I would pay 10£/$/€ just to get in and listen to some shit “flavour of the month” music that has been pumped through the radio 56 times that morning. People do not seem to admit the real intentions for going to places like nightclubs. They say to “dance”. Well that’s all well and good, until you see them doing filthy shit to strangers, I can not even get into that right now. Not exactly a waltz IMO.

People seem to have this tendency to not acknowledge true intentions and just wing it, where everyone doesn’t address the true reasons and leave it at that. The whole economy is built just around Sex and denial. I find it hilarious. “Oh where did you meet your wife?” “Oh I met her at that club!” They just seem like animals for the slaughter, when I hear that.

Its funny most relationships that are sprung from places like that don’t last 10 years. My parents are prime examples of that. This can be correlated to those rubbish magazines you see in hairdressers. All that relationship rubbish. Total waste of time. The lot of it.
You see men and women dressed like sluts/Morons, and they are all buddy-buddy that night, then you “unfortunately” hear that those people had a big fight later on at 4am, because, X was sleeping with X and his friend X was with this other person and when someone tells me this the next day I have to look with INTEREST? And say, “oh yea poor them” etc. I cannot fully comprehend how stupid people really are. The whole drama tires me when I hear it.
It really put things into perspective, why I seem like I’m the odd one out. I fit in when I want to, but the problem is I don’t want to anymore and its getting less and less so. But I want to understand why, that is?




**Careers and the point of it all.**

When I hear some saying they have a job in Sales, Business, Reps and other such jobs, I want to die. They seem really enthusiastic when they say it, and I find it hard to take them seriously. I mean fuck, what they do all day; try to reach “sales” targets, come up with new marketing bullshit angles, another job type that just screw people out of money.  It just seems so pointless, why/ what is the point, So some fuck gets richer of your hard work. I understand the ladder system, you have to climb it to get to the top, so you can shit on everyone else that was you once. But that makes it seem so much worse. Everyone scrambling over each other for a 1$. Literally killing the other fella for it. So they can be something one day? So what then. You get that raise; get a nice car, pay of the mortgage on a house that could easily be taken away from them, if the government decided it so. Sacrifice your life for a company that doesn’t care. You don’t get to see your children or your SO as much as you want, but you don’t care as long as that you reach that sales goal by the end of the year! Then down the road you Play golf at 45 with some other dickheads that don’t really like you and only care about making money. But you don’t mind, since you’re in the same exact bracket. You eventually get some middle management job, people around you hate you, your family have given up on you and the only thing keeping you together is the fancy holidays you go on once a year. Now you spend the rest of the time that convincing people you’re some “big shot” with a half decent income and a nice car (probably leased). Your children growing up without any real role model/farther figure (except for john that lives across the street, in your very nice middle-upper-class estate) and secretly resenting you.  Now I ask that person this, where down your line in your life did you decide to give up on your dream?  But you find that mostly these are the same people you reluctantly met at that club all those years ago puking all over the shop, because its ""really cool"" and great ""fun"". Remember they conveniently forget what happened when it came to that drama earlier mentioned. Oh an the plot twist,  they usually are devout Christians, Jews Etc. I find the correlation (from my experience) Mind-blowing, but somewhat calming as-well. Now im not hitting at religion, but i do find the relation compelling. (Clearly not verifiable, unless i conducted a controlled study)

My real gripe is really when these people criticize me for X reasons. It’s very hard to hold back your tongue as your arguments, no matter how well you put them or how correct or coherent they are. They pull out the same dumb brain juice they use for everything else and everything you say becomes pointless and is in vain.



**Educational Views**

Now another side issue and more related to me is that I want to go back into education. (Study Theoretical/Astro physics). People just look at me thinking I’m crazy, half of them don’t even understand what I just said. They say,” by the time you reach 30 you’ll be qualified again and just starting your job, from the bottom.” But my argument is, “why not?” I mean they are just sitting there all day doing fuck all of a job, doing the same  thing day in day out (Relatively). Generally nothing interesting. Might get a promotion at some stage, but it stops eventually somewhere down the road. Where with me I might not make a lot of money (Infact I would be losing it) Working in some shitty shop or something just trying to makes ends meet during college again, but I would be doing something worthwhile. When I die (Unless I get involved with life extension or something in the future) I can’t take any of this rubbish with me. Money and possessions will not matter in the last few minutes of my life. But an amazing experience is what I’ll be left with and hopefully a loving family that I care about and all the memories I have of them. That is what I’ll be left with until draw my last breath. That will be my heaven.

Now, people do not need to do what i do, but i find as a general rule with people (Always exceptions, never absolutes) they 

Spending time, teaching them about the stars, life, science and history.  Not ignoring them and making them go to “Law” School  Because it’s a job that will make money. What a fucking waste of a life. Its unacceptable.

*This is only half of what I wanted to say and it’s not expressed as coherently as I had hoped, but I hope you smart bastards will be able to connect the dots.*

Oh I must mention that none of the examples are related to me, I’m 23 and have a girlfriend for many years who I love and is a great friend, I have great friends in general.
 I’m not bitter about life. I’m fairly happy, but the things that make me happy are so so removed from the general norm/Distractions on offer and people would just look in confusion at me if I told them! I’m just trying to understand why everything and everyone just seems so out of whack.

**TL;DR** why is the world full of dumb idiot people who just want to make money and fuck all the time. Why is there a lack of desire for a higher purpose/ambition in life? (Not God related)

Edit: I cleaned it up a little, but apologies for spelling mistakes, grammar and/or syntax errors you may find.

Edit: Amazing replies here, really exhilarating. I knew i could count on my INTJ/P and other types to bring some clarity. After reading my statement again this morning, i noticed some obvious mistakes and made adjustments to edit for consistency etc.. I wrote this late into last night, so i knew i had made mistakes, but knew you were mature enough not to criticize me for it.

I am a very logical and pragmatic person.  I am blunt and honest and straightforward.  So I find that I can be funny by saying some of the things that I am thinking.  The reason it's funny is because I have the balls to say things that everyone is thinking but are too afraid to say.   I find that if you can make people laugh sometimes, they are less likely to see you as awkward.  

I have also taught myself to be more outgoing - I find that life is easier that way.  I'm not an extrovert but I learned to fake it - I had to as I work in PR.

The world of dating is like a house of mirrors to me.  Frankly, the fact that I am extremely   pretty is the only reason I get dates.  I use my appearance to my advantage as I find  that it is easier to be liked in general if you are attractive.  Hopefully I can learn more social skills before my looks fade.  For example I find that I am ALWAYS out of the loop and the last to know stuff.  I finally figured out why and i'ts because I find gossip to be intolerable.

It seems like every description of this personality type includes a marked tendency toward not liking to flirt (or not understanding how it works or what the point is.) 

While I am definitely an INTJ-- other than this particular issue, the descriptions tend to be pretty dead-on-- I really do enjoy flirting. A lot. I don't like to go out often, but when I do, I love the banter. There's a certain amount of challenge to having to come up with witty responses on the fly, and it's possibly the most fun a fairly introverted person like me can have while surrounded by people.

Am I alone here? 

Let's be clear: I do not enjoy small talk. Unless I already know and like you, I don't care what you did today, what you do for fun, or what you think of the current meteorological trends, and hearing about it feels like a huge waste of time. And I have no idea what to do when vague flirting turns into concrete offers to hang out again sometime, get to know each other, exchange phone numbers, go find a dark corner, etc. The flirting itself, though-- the completely non-substantive stuff-- is like a sport.

Just wondering whether any other INTJs feel this way about it, or if I'm completely alone on this one.

&gt;INTJs are usually difficult to get to know well, and difficult to get close to. Those who are close to the INTJ will highly value them for their ideas and knowledge. Although INTJs are generally very serious-minded people, they also have been known to enjoy letting loose and having fun, if others pull them into it.

I have gotten better at making conversation and forming connections with new people, but I, and the other party, can still feel a distance separating us.

The thing is, I would like to be friends with certain people, but I would not like to go through the process of befriending them. Surely there must be a way to make myself enjoy it.

The reasons why the distance exists, and shows itself in my speech and behaviour is:

* I don't like to tell people my real feelings if I don't trust them
* I use sarcasm and honesty interchangeably, and with a 'poker face', which can make people feel uncomfortable when they don't understand me
* I don't really enjoy being around people until I get to know them...even if I really like them
* My self-esteem &amp; confidence levels are not very high, i.e. I am quite self-conscious

Finally, I need to change this because I've just gotten to know a bunch of people whom I'd really like to be friends with, but we don't have an extended period of structured interactions together. :( On a more long-term level, developing these flash relationships is going to be critical to what I want to do in life later on.",,False,,t5_2qowo,False,,,True,t3_1d7shz,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1d7shz/intjs_are_usually_difficult_to_get_to_know_well/,

Male INTJs, I (perhaps erroneously) have often assumed that the INTJ personality traits are more accepted for you guys in dating because culturally men are ""supposed to be"" the more rational, analytical, and introverted ones. Do you find this to be true?

For me, I feel like I have three main areas that are problematic:

* 1) I find it difficult to find people I really respect. I have many close friends, but (aside from my best friend) it's generally because I find them fascinating and am always engaged because I want to know how they think. However, the people who are most interesting are rarely those who think rationally or share similar values with me.

* 2) When I have found men I respect, I find that they are rarely interested in women who have INTJ personality traits. In fact, the only men I have met who have been able to see me as a potential dating partner *because* they like that side of me tend to be.. less intelligent (I know this is subjective, sorry) and ended every conversation with ""wow, I never thought of it that way!"" or think every discussion that I consider normal is mindblowing. This, of course, ends this discussion and bores me to tears.

* 3) I find the process of dating incredibly stressful. I don't know what the other person is thinking, feel a complete lack of control or comfort, and usually end up coming up with enough reasons as to why it's a bad fit (after only 2-3 dates) so that I can justify breaking it off.

I suck at friendships. I'm perfectly social and friendly with people I don't know at all (work in customer service) and can be charming when I want to be. But I suck at friendships. In a way I find it easier to relate to random people I've only just met then I do to 'friends' who I see every now and then...

Do I need to call them regularly, or text every now and then? It just doesn't make sense. How do you go from 'see you every now and then' to 'talk regularly' to 'see all the time' to 'besties'?

I also don't really care that much about maintaining friendships. Related to the above thought - how often do I need to contact someone in order to maintain the friendship? Do people get offended when I forget to answer their texts, or don't pick up their calls? I assume so, but I just don't really care - and if I was in their shoes, I wouldn't care either... but I suppose that's where my empathy fails.

I really messed up with my INTJ husband, and I don't know what to do :(. I'm ENFP. Due to a lot of stress, I was very rude to him while he was away on a mini day vacation that he truly deserved. He was put off by my tone and attitude, and immediately came all the way back home. (He'd just arrived there; only an hour away). I threw a huge fit (throwing things, screaming, crying, overreacted big time). Now that I'm in the right mind and stable again, he is furious at me since I ruined his one chance for a rest, just because I couldn't cope it with any better. (I'm usually very calm and collected, and I rarely get angry like that).

I apologized profusely and begged for him to forgive me, and he doesn't want anything to do with me for now. He has lost all motivation for work, and I know this will have an impact on his personal responsibilities, all because of me. He's just drained and now doesn't believe anything I say. I don't know what else to do to make it better, and I know the impact of this will really effect his trust towards me. So even if he does forgive me now, he's not going to be able to let this go. What should I do? How should I view the situation?

*edit/update:
This is my first time posting on reddit, and you guys all helped me out a lot! We're 100% completely fine now. Even better than before. Basically, he came home from some errands, and I was completely silent. Didn't say a word, but I did my normal routine (took his jacket off for him and hung it, lay out his home clothes, set his tea on the table, turn on his computer, etc.) I gave him a hug, but he shrugged me off, so I immediately left him alone. Eventually he started yelling about all the things I did wrong. So I just nodded to show I agreed, and eventually I just started sobbing (I know you guys said NOT to cry, but I cant help it..). I went into the next room so he could cool off and not see me cry, but he could still hear me. After 20 min, he told me to come back in. He hugged me said he loved me and would never want to lose/hurt me, then we had a very wonderful night after that. I finished it off by making a list of things to do in order to avoid it happening again. We both agreed it was just circumstantial and the stress that's been getting to me. He wasn't bothered by the day being disrupted anymore, and he decided it would have been better if I was there with him anyway. So all's good again. Thank you SOO much!! I learned so much more about how he thinks/operates. INTJs are the best :)

The first time I took the test I found out I was an INTJ. Not knowing what this meant, I then proceeded to read the description. It was an eerily accurate representation of my personality. It is probably not uncommon for us to be skeptical, so my first thought was that while impressive, it was probably working in the same way as a horoscope, with random generalizations that could apply to anyone and appealing to confirmation bias.

I decided to put it to the test. I made 3 categories: (1) Things that apply to me. (2) Things that could apply to anyone. (3) Things that don't apply to me.

Then I read every statement on the INTJ description, one by one, and put a point in whatever category it fitted best. To my amazement, most where on section (1) with only a few on section (2) and even less on (3). Of course, this proved nothing. To make it more solid I had to put other types to the test as well so I could compare the results. I tried ENTJ and INTP. Being two of the closest types, they had the best chance to match the results of INTJ. What I found was pretty interesting. A lot of the points from (1) shifted to (3), with (2) remaining about the same. There were still many traits that applied to me on section (1), which makes sense considering that the types are more of a balance, rather than a binary system.

Finally, I tested ESFP, being the complete opposite. The vast majority of the points started going into (3) with (2) remaining very close to the others. All the data was pointing towards pretty good accuracy on the test, and then it hit me: ""I'm fucking analyzing an online test and scrutinizing myself for confirmation bias. Of course I'm an INTJ.""

Now, I realize this wasn't entirely scientific, or maybe scientific at all. I was too lazy to check all 16 types but I can at least say that I was as honest as I could be when deciding where to put each statement and that I was consistent. Regardless, that's not really the point of the story.

Just most of them. ,58,13,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/whdry/im_not_annoyed_by_all_people_just_most_of_them/,"There are large parts of this country's population that flat out annoy the shit out of me. Working in the customer service industry for a decade I've dealt with enough people to recognize that most people fit into one category or another. Most of them are completely innocuous, and don't bother me in the slightest. Here is just the top three that really grind my gears. Feel free to add your own. 

1. O.P.K (Other People's Kids) - These little critters bring me to Defcon 2 with a quickness. I can't have a conversation with them. I don't do kid-speak. And while your parents let you tear apart my showroom without even batting an eye or making any attempt to discipline, my contempt for you now includes your parents as well. And while they talk AT me, I am screaming at them in my head to ""Control your fucking kids!"". 

2. Wal*Mart shoppers - Defcon 3 material. You no doubt have probably encountered the ever abundant Wal*Creature at one point or another. Probably wearing sweatpants, a stained sleeveless t-shirt bearing their favorite NASCAR drivers likeness and probably a nasty, faded, sweat-stained hat that should be burned for humanity's sake. Think Larry the Cable Guy, but even MORE annoying and without the piles of cash. Perpetually sweaty, loud, and smelling of what I can only HOPE is BO, these people are frequently in violation of my 3 foot bubble rule. ""Close talker"" just doesn't do justice to the hell you people put me through. And your incessant need to touch me makes me want to choke the life out of you. Their outside voice is the only one they posses as they clearly were not born with an inside one. They laugh at stupid things, loudly, and at length. Or perhaps you've spotted them in the parking lot of said establishment arguing, heatedly, with their baby-mama over 15 dollars while they try to cram that 50"" flat screen they just bought but couldn't afford into the back of their rust-bucket 1993 Ford Taurus amidst their 9 kids and a pile of Mickey D's wrappers. Yes, your kids are fat. Yes, your kids are lazy. They've had impeccable role models thus far.  These people are the epitome of ""poor life decisions"". 

3. Old people - Yeah, I said it. Old people are the bane of my existence. Why do you need to spend 15 fucking minutes telling me, in a roundabout way, what could have been said in 3, tops. No, I don't care what you did this morning. No, I don't care what you have to do after we part ways today. No, I don't care that the grocery store has canned peas 2 for a dollar. Get to the fucking point already! I empathize with your hearing impairment, but if you yell ""What?!"" into my face and make me repeat myself yet again, I might just be inclined to suggest getting hearing aids. Which I'm sure you've eschewed in favor of just being inconsiderate to those you choose to interact with. You're slow in every way imaginable. When you drive, you are a danger to yourself and others. Why are you doing 40 miles an hour in left goddamned lane? Why does it take you 10 minutes to make a right turn, yet you're freeway entrance ramp practices are akin to someone fleeing the police. Yes I WAS driving there, perhaps you should check your mirrors before you cross all three lanes of traffic.  Executing a u-turn should not be a workout. Maybe it's time to hang it up and call a cab.

An example:  I was stocking shelves and put an item in the incorrect place, and she pointed it out to me (this was the example she brought up when telling me I take criticism poorly).  To me, this is merely an observation of a mistake, I acknowledged it, corrected it, and moved on.  She claims that I frequently get ""defensive"" when criticized, but honestly I can't think of any examples of this, and beyond the example I just mentioned she couldn't provide any.

I can understand how sometimes I could potentially come across as defensive under criticism, but to me it's usually more accurate to say I'm trying to understand the exact nature of the criticism.  IMO, when my performance is criticized, there is a fundamental misunderstanding of my opinion of how something should be done, and others' opinions of how something should be done.  My ""defensive"" response is simply me trying to find and understand the disconnect between the two positions in an attempt to better comprehend the job that needs to be done.

….

**e.g 1**: Growing up, I was always annoyed by how often peoples' emotions affected their judgement and decision making, to the point of frustration. By consciously acknowledging and respecting peoples' emotions whilst not letting it annoy me, I have been able to ""insert"" these emotions into the equations I use to make decisions on what I say/do, allowing me a more effective communicator. 

**e.g. 2**: If the world worked the way I want it to, I could reach all my goals and dreams using 100% self sufficiently, without having to rely on anyone for anything. There have been instances where I have isolated myself to give 110% a goal, Howard Roark style. After experiencing some issues from trying to do this, i realized that myself and everyone else this world needs regular social interaction to maintain sanity and normalcy, as much as I wish I didn't have to put time and energy into socializing when I have my tunnel vision on a goal.

I very often feel angry in my day-to-day life. There are times where I'm more frustrated than normal and want to yell at someone, but more often than not I never really express my anger. I have what I call ""quiet anger"", though I've never met anyone who really understood what that meant. For me, it's just a quiet, pervasive anger that I would sometimes even call ""cold anger"". People who know me joke that I always look like I want to kill someone, and I nod along with the joke and say it's my neutral expression.

Anger gets you out of bed, into the gym, etc. Sadness gives me no energy.

""No, this is Caleb."" I say, fixing the broken assumption in her head.  What followed after that was what I perceive as an awkward silence.  I couldn't think of anything to say.  What did I possibly have to say to this other anonymous person? She had called me and asked a question, I had answered it.  I kept the silence going, waiting for her to make a move so I could react.

""Ok, bye.""  She said.  I hung up the phone, thought nothing of it, and went back to reddit.

The answer is, of course, yes.  But I was reading this article from one of my favorite tech bloggers and it provided a fantastic example of how intelligent people can end up as thick headed idiots convinced in their own rightness.

[Link.](http://daringfireball.net/2013/07/fitting_the_facts)

The issue with Ni is that we, as INTJs, form an intuitive picture in our head of how things work and fit together.  Sometimes, when we're wrong, we can start looking for evidence to fit it.  This is an easy trap for the INTJs.

I've debated with both INTJs and INTPs that were wrong in the past.  And I've been wrong before.  I feel like INTPs who find themselves in the wrong and can't accept it start trying to cloud the discussion, focusing on nitpicks, sometimes refusing to stick to a position. 

But INTJs who find themselves in the wrong and can't accept it start going in circles; they're so sure their giant Ni picture can't be wrong that any criticism of their Ni picture must be wrong because that criticism makes the whole picture fall apart and the whole picture is so complex it *must* be right.  Then they start grasping at anything that casts doubt on the criticism and then move on to something else that ""proves them right"" and go in circles and end up looking extremely thick.

I actually prefer debating with a stubborn INTJ to a stubborn INTP for this reason, because I can identify when they've lost.  I've actually heard NTP's express the opposite opinion that they hate debating with stubborn INTJ's because it feels like their words just bounce off.

Keep in mind this danger, because INTJs formulate a ""big picture"" that frequently ""fills in the gaps"", and on occasion, *we can get it wrong* and start fitting new information to the incorrect Ni picture we have.",,False,,t5_2qowo,1375386276.0,,,True,t3_1jiiu6,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1jiiu6/the_danger_of_ni_is_fitting_the_facts_to_a/,

As I was showering this morning I realized that I very often have 'emotional' speeches in the shower. I talk to people in my life and tell them everything I so dearly want to say to them in person. And get quite in touch with my feelings, and get pretty articulate about those feelings, and feel comfortable in expressing them.

But that's is usually where it stays; in the shower. And when I see my subjects in person, I never find the words, an go back in my stone-cold me-person. And it hurts me that I can't say the things I so gladly want them to know, how I feel about them, what they mean to me, etc. 

I guess it has something to do with a 'fear' of rejection of sorts, but even when I was with my ex-girlfriend, I would tell her how much she meant to me in the shower, but then when we would be together, I would once again shut down.

Does anyone else experience things similar to this?

And are there any tips, to prevent me from isolating myself. Because it is hurting me at times, and my relations with others.


**TLDR: Does anyone else have very articulate conversations about feelings etc while taking a shower? Any tips to put these 'experiences' in practice?**

*Disclaimer: I'm a 25 year old male university-student, living in Holland, self-diagnosed INTJ. I've been exploring my inferior 'feelings'-side for the past 4 months, ever since my girlfriend left me for being inaccessible. Please pardon any grammatical mistakes.* 

**Edit 1: Thank you all for your replies, didn't expect so many.**

I sense that we all seem to bottle things up inside ourselves, is this a true INTJ thing? I never considered being INTJ as an handicap, it is just the way it is. But I do find that this constant bottling up, and not adequately expressing myself is hurting me. My general consensus is that I like to think that people around me know how much I care for them, without me expressing that. I guess that is not an healthy way per se. 

Also I read couple of times, and felt that way myself, that we think that other people don't care about our opinions, because we ourselves aren't that needy for constant appreciation. But I do think that that view is flawed, but I say that purely on personal thoughts and experiences.

**It would be ideal if there was some sort of handbook that would help guide us in expressing ourselves in a way that isn't to scary or to troublesome, to at least release some of the pressure and stress bottling up causes.**

For instance, I'll make dozens of pros and cons lists comparing future careers, and develop algorithms to assign numerical values to certain qualities of the job, but when one of them is a ""winner"", I just think ""no, that doesn't feel right"". 

For the past year or so, I've been set on attending law school. I've blown my practice LSATs out of the water, and I know that I have the potential, with my INTJ nature, to be a phenomenal litigator. But there's a big problem, and it's preventing me from settling on law:

I've been thinking about the things that are most important to me in life, and I feel like a career in law directly contradicts many of them. If I were to rank my top priorities in a career, it'd look like (in no particular order):

- flexibility (in time and location, including the ability to work from home)
- intellectual stimulation
- autonomy
- work-life balance (vacation time, reasonable hours, etc)
- limited contact with other human beings 

I feel like, as a lawyer, I'd have the intellectual stimulation and MAYBE the autonomy (and that's a big 'maybe'), but none of the other qualifications.

It's mesmerizing. 

You're one person, no more than a speck of dust on this enormous planet, which itself is pathetically small compared to even our immediate neighboring planets in our solar system. Statistically speaking, the chances of you even being born is astronomically low. So low, in fact, that you could say impossible, yet here you are, defying all odds.

So you're born. You're raised, nurtured, and eventually fostered in an environment that will [hypothetically] give you the greatest amount of chance of succeeding in your future through means disposable by your caretakers; They prepare you for your future.

And before you know it, the future is now. You get a job. Perhaps you enjoy it, perhaps not. Regardless, you need to eat and survive, so you work. And work, and work, and work, for the next few decades, until you retire, where you wait until you die.

Maybe during that whole ordeal, you gained power, got rich, or maybe found love. If it's the last one, at the very least, you can be happy in knowing that you succeeded biologically (since you've made an offspring that passes on your legacy). 

But in the end, did any of it matter? No impact has been made. In universal-time, less than a second has passed. It's like blinking once, and boom, you're dead and gone. What was the point of it all?

I could at least take solace in death if I knew that Earth was one big reality TV show for some alien species. Maybe that's how I'll choose to live the rest of my life -- That no matter what I do, at least I've provided some entertainment. There's no God I worship, and living so I can earn money to buy things is a depressing thought.

Kind of going off on this, I think there is definitely too much of an emphasis on the DAE type model. While we're all the same type, we still have somewhat unique tastes, likes, dislikes, etc. There are a lot of questions about a specific taste or like that someone has, which really has nothing to do with being an INTJ.

Anyways, that's pretty much it. I view this sub as kind of a community forum of like-minded people that I can share and bounce ideas off of. Just some suggestions going forward.

I thought I was ""wrong"".  About 6 months ago, I decided to do find myself. It led me here. I lurked for a while to make sure this place wasn't too good to be true. I had taken MBTI tests before (and always come up INTJ), but never really looked into it until recently. 

Reading your insightful comments triggered something inside me. I started to not just be alright with my personality, but to be proud of it. It's even empowered me to open up to my wife about how I work and feel. If nothing else, that alone is worth all the money in the world. 

But on to the MIL. Before I found this place, all of the thoughts and emotions I've shared with you would have been bottled up. In my first post (asking for advice in dealing with company), you guys offered sound advice and showed an interest in how things went. If it were anyone else, I couldn't care less. But y'all are me. And if I am going to talk with someone about me, then why not with people who understand how I work better than anyone.  

So I saidn ""Screw it,"" and decided to go for it. With each subsequent post, interest has waned. But honestly, mine has as well. However, sticking with it has helped me to learn something about myself. 

I dwelled on the potential pitfalls of my MIL coming to the point that I *knew* something bad was going to happen. It didn't. But putting my fears to words here allowed y'all to persuade me that I was deftly capable of steering any dire situation in a direction that would be most beneficial to everyone. You were right. Thank you. You helped me realize that I am who I am, and I don't have to be shy about it. My wife and I both are grateful. My MIL was supposed to leave this morning, but she didn't. She couldn't, because she was sick yesterday and last night. Before /r/intj, I would have brooded and seethed myself into an internal rage that can't be healthy. But when I woke and my wife gave me the news, I reacted differently. I told my wife I wasn't happy about it, but that I understood her mom's reasoning and admitted that I agreed with her reasoning. I was a little tempermental for the rest of the day, but things went smoothly. 

Tonight, my wife came to me and apologized for her mom staying an extra day. She wasn't sarcastic. She wasnt resentful. With help from you, I've been able to communicate ""me"" to her. And it's working. 

She blew me away with her next statement. She said, ""*You* are *you*. And I love *all* of you. I know you expected her to be gone but she was up half of the night sick. But how could she expect to drive 7 hours on such little sleep?"" She actually used logic in her reasoning. That never happens.

It's because of you. Hell, you know how hard it was for me to put myself out there these last few days. But I feel a bit wiser now. And what else could an INTJ hope for.

I can't tell if it's a miscommunication of some kind, people that identify as INTJ's that aren't really INTJ's but for whatever reason they like the ""emotionless"" title, like they think that being emotionless means your more intelligent, or maybe it's a lot of immature INTJ's.  Maybe I'm just misreading a lot of stuff.  

One thing seems clear: INTJs definitely have emotions.  Being emotionless does not necessarily make someone more intelligent.  Being aware and in control of your emotions does not mean you suppress your emotions or pretend you don't have them. That's just diluting yourself.  Being (or pretending/aspiring to be) emotionless definitely isn't useful to the human species since we all have emotions and if you want to contribute to a species of emotional people, those emotions need to be taken into some kind of consideration.  Anyone else noticing this?

The ""something"" can be literally anything: games, math, cooking, or anything that it's possible to be better/worse than someone else in. 

The problem is, I can't seem to accurately judge my own proficiency in a lot of things. When asked ""are you good at X?"" my answer is either ""no"" or ""I'm decent"". When judging other people's proficiency, it's much easier to say Joe is amazing at X, or that John sucks at Y. 

Other people might say that I'm good at X, but I always think,
 
* I can improve in this area
* There are people much better than me, I'm average at best
* I'm not good, you're just worse, so it looks good to you

So, because I know how bad I am compared those, who I think are actually good at X, I rarely conclude that I really am good at something.

I fulfilled my good dutiful son duty, and left. I do not feel any attachment to either people/places/or things in my life.

I feel that my inability to get attached to people is weird... It does not really bother me but it makes me feel out of place. When seeing family that I have not seen in a long time I have to act like I missed them even though I did not. It is not like I hated them or anything, just yeah... Family members passing away does not draw any more reaction than an ""oh... ok"". Friends call and feel insulted/hurt that I have not kept contact.

**Edit:** (I chose to edit because many comments said really similar things and I wanted to respond to all of you guys.) ARGH! So I am getting two kinds of vibes in the comments. 


1- The first is get better friends/surround yourself with better people so that you may get attached. I just don't think that's the answer. The reason I would call some people ""good"" friends is that they were the only ones to talk to me after I had left any actual reason to talk to them, eg., left university/work/city. They like to speak their mind, and I like hearing different sides of the story in order to strengthen my argument for when it matters.

In other words they tolerate me without having any reason to... (Since I am usually told I am an asshole...) and I do not actively care to get/keep new friends...

2- The second which says don't care, is easier, But to those of you who say that. I just wonder if you have experienced close attachment to people and found it overrated, or were you just faking it like me... (although I have never faked a close relationship except to parents and even that makes me feel bad.) Kind of like the saying; ""Don't knock it till you tried it"".

As I'm sure none of you are aware, there is a Minecraft Server for INTPs (/r/INTPcraft). It's been going on for about 2.5 months and has been fairly active. /u/nostalgicBadger, the creator, is starting a new server based on the full spectrum of myer-briggs aptly named MBTIcraft.

This server isn't a typical Minecraft server ('vanilla'), as there have been a few modifications made to it. The biggest and most important change is the addition of groups. That's right, you can play with all your INTJ buddies! Keeping this in mind, /u/C4Redalert and I have spent roughly a week designing a Central City to accommodate the different 'factions'. The use of this city is completely optional (go off and make your own city... with blackjack! and hookers!), but the coolest thing about this city is that each faction has its own district within the city walls and only that faction can build there. I'm looking forward to seeing how each town differs, but that's just me. 

If you're not too keen on sharing a world with everyone, you can travel to a private world where only your faction can build. People might stop by to take a gander, but you don't have to worry about them touching your stuff. Chase them away with a stick or something! We will also be featuring a currency system as well as shop/lodging rentals. They are features that we hope will help encourage an economy and immersive sense of together-ness, but your experience will not be hindered if you choose not to use them; your experience is what you make of it. 

We're not open just yet, but we will be in a week (Friday, 10th@8PM EST) . We do have a subreddit open, /r/mbticraft, and /u/nostalgicBadger has a full-fledged website in the works so that we might be able to get our personalitycafe brethren on-board.

I was embarrassed, paid for my stuff, and left while they demanded to see the manager.

**Big**

I am the only person I am always with. Be nice.

A depression-free me exists. If I forget that, try to rediscover it.

Learn and follow my own rules.

These mental extremes should be avoided; others hurting my pride, planning orgasms.

Happiness can't be based on ""at least I'm not"" or ""at least I have"" comparisons.

Reread and rewatch my favorite movies or books.

Dated entries are shit compared to non-dated.

**Productivity**

Do not be all or nothing.

New Material motivates.

Do not underestimate preparing and planning.

Inspiration is fleeting. Do not focus on others' inspiration.

It's good to keep a lot of pokers in the fire.

Set things (interviews, things to do) up for the near future.


**Coping**

If you have to do something, choose to prefer it.

If I am stressed, there is a cause, even if I can't identify it.

Counter-intuitively, sometimes adding activities can decrease stress.

Rumination leads to depressions. Distractions can be good.

Exposure does not change. Acting / thinking differently during the exposure does.




**Hope**

Things will change

**Relating**

Individuals experience time differently. How does this effect others actions?

Some lay people are enlightened, some monks are not.

I am as susceptible to ""the good life"" falsity as those in third world countries.

Our large, mainstream society is an IC. I should give and get from it.

People basically act towards everyone the same way, my input matters little.

The best salesmen make people think they are doing them (the people) a favor.

Think of the people around the people who standout.


**Socializing**

Books are social

Close relationships are important for happiness, but not for sure physically close.

When I meet someone I like, I should try to spend more time with them.

All interactions are not beneficial to minimizing loneliness.


**Pain**

If you have pain, try to be as masochistic as possible











**Peace**

Avoid long-term obligations if possible. 

Don't fear quitting.

I am happiest when things are quiet, peaceful, or orderly.

Don't create unnecessary obstacles for yourself.

Recognize subtle anger.

Meditation can be done throughout the day.

Being able to think clearly is thanks to such fine-tuned calibrations.

Alone time is an oasis.


**Decisions**

Admiring an activity is not always the same as wanting to do it.

A test to know if I really want to do something is to ask ""would I start right now?"".

Commercials sell lifestyles. Will buying or doing this actually change my lifestyle?


**Mood**

If I don't like my mood...wait a while.

Moods are like weather or like waves, coming and going regardless of my input.

Continuing the analogy, to handle mood shifts better, become a better mood ""surfer"".

Large periods of time are remembered as a single mood. There are much more divisions.








**Happiness**

""The search for happiness is one of the chief sources of unhappiness."" - Eric Hoffer

I am a hedonist, disregard above?

A sad genius is an oxymoron - thought from Daniel Tammet?

Happiness is a skill that can be improved.

Memories are recreated each time they are recalled. Enhance them.


**Meaning**

All meanings are human invention. Ben Franklin's the beauty of being a creature of reason. Morality is subjective.

The ultimate purpose is death. Any passage of time is heading in the right direction.

We all know what its like to to think every minute detail to the core before making a decision. We all talk to ourselves when we are in deep contemplation. Some of us struggle in social situations because they haven't developed the introverted feeling that others have.

I am absolutely positive that almost everyone who reads this post is already thinking exactly what I am. This board is stale, something akin to what [/r/circlejerkintj](/r/circlejerkintj) would look like if it existsed. Most of the posts are things that we already know about each other but plenty of us still feel the need to ask anyway, as if it isn't already validated.

We are an extremely intelligent and high-minded group of people on this board and I have been ignoring the re-posts of the same idea with a different title as much as I can, but this board could be so much more than it is right now.

We have 4 total links in our sidebar, 3 of which are just about who we are. We have all read several, if not every, description we can find about our personality because once we learn about it we become excited and feel validated in our thinking. We do this all on our own.

So, now that I am done saying what every single other INTJ on this board has been thinking. Let me pose some real questions to you.

What should this board be for? Is it about us as a personality type? Should be only post things that we all do because its called /r/intj? Sure, the title says INTJ but we are very different from most other personality types. We do love to ponder ourselves and understand ourselves but at this point we really know most of what there is to know on the broad end of the spectrum correct?

Personally, I would rather come here seeing posts about interesting ideas about topics I have never heard about or that I am not very knowledgeable in. Things that we INTJ's have researched and want to share with each other to benefit mutually. Obviously, because it would be fun to try and tear down the whole idea and try to make it better while padding our egos back and forth as well haha.

Every one of us smiles a bit at ourselves when we read something that we relate to, we are being validated here. Like we have a community of people who are like us because likely you and I have felt very different for our entire lives and didn't know why. The majority of the posts on this board are questions that we have already answered. And what is really funny is how we make statements in the form of a question because we doubt ourselves around each other. That is quite a social dilemma.

I will now stop repeating myself in order to come to a conclusion. 

Everyone, and I do mean everyone. Go start your own topic in [/r/intj](/r/intj) about something you find exceedingly interesting. Try to keep it a bit abstract enough that it might a semi-niche topic because we are knowledge-hungry sponges. You don't have to be an expert at something to start a discussion about it. Just make it something that you are passionate enough about to want to learn more. INTJs pride themselves on talking about what they know. And we are very humble when speaking on subjects we do not know.

We are a group of powerful thinkers who love who we are, and all of us know that this subreddit's content, for the most part, is piss in the wind compared to what we are capable of.

Share something you know with me. I will share something I know with you. And then we will all collectively become a rabble of intellects discussing every topic that exists on the internet, save for our desire to go to a football game and get piss drunk or something.

I don't know how to end this post without making it cheesy. So just  go make a fucking post. What are you waiting for?

One last thing, that guy in the thread who asked if we over-think things. That's pretty much what we are good at. That's a normal thing dude.

Edit: A lot of great reaction and feedback from you guys. I can't say that I was surprised to be honest. I hope we can, if nothing else, get some better topics going in the immediate future on this board.

My social interactions on a weekly basis are as follow:

* I see the people I work with at work on a M-F basis - superficial interactions.
* Once a week, I go to a poetry club - discussion only of poetry, no personal conversations.
* Once every other week, I go to a book club - book discussion, no personal conversations.
* I see my long-distance boyfriend every other weekend - this is honestly my only deep, meaningful conversation opportunity IRL.

That's basically my routine, and I rarely deviate from it; sometimes the poetry people will ask me to get a drink with them, but I'll usually excuse myself early after an hour or so.

I always felt pressure as a teenager from my parents/roommates/acquaintances to socialize more. Now, I live by myself and am in a position to just sit at home on the weekends with myself. I hate 'going out' on the weekends, and happily sit at home alone Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. At the risk of sounding like a DAE echochamber, it's ok that I have no desire for more social simulation than my usual routine, right?

Perhaps a more accurate phrasing would be to say I want to make sure my level of social interaction is comparable with other introverts. I don't want to become too reclusive in an unhealthy manner. Thoughts?

For some time, I've been questioning myself about the neural/neurochemical basis for my personality. I'm not a neuroscientist, but I've made some crucial observations myself and recently began connecting the dots, so to speak.

**TL;DR:** I believe that my brain's dopamine-producing mechanisms are somehow deficient. If I had to guess, I would say my brain produces less of it than other people because of inherited genetic mutations.

My reasoning is as follows:

Dopamine is said to be the brain's ""pleasure chemical"". I seem incapable of experiencing strong positive emotions. Every once in a while I see people on TV screaming in joy (e.g.: because they won the lottery). I'm quite sure nothing could elicit that response in me. When my girlfriend bought me a trip to Paris, I thanked her and told her I was happy, but she said I showed almost no emotional response, that I was ""cold"".

I have a tendency for mild depression. Sometimes I feel like everything, including my favorite music and TV shows, is boring. When this happens, it feels like my brain's capability for happiness is temporarily depleted. I don't automatically feel sad, I just feel incapable of feeling happy, and the only way my mood can go is down. My theory is that when this happens, it's because my brain has become (temporarily) incapable of producing sufficient amounts of dopamine. When this happens, caffeine can sometimes provide a mood boost, quite possibly because [caffeine](http://www.livestrong.com/article/317519-dopamine-caffeine/) causes dopamine to be released, like many other stimulants.

Dopamine is associated with [extroversion](http://eprints.gold.ac.uk/5060/) and ""reward-seeking behavior"". Most of the time, I feel very much introverted. Interestingly, I've taken ecstasy on a few occasions (a drug which causes dopamine to be released in large amounts, quite possibly because of its amphetamine content). This was a revelation. I was in a loud nightclub once (something usually anxiety-inducing), and suddenly, I felt as comfortable as if I were lying on my couch at home in my pajamas. I could talk to anyone, without shyness or fear, and I enjoyed it. For a few hours, I was an extrovert.

I never seem to get ""crushes"" on anyone (get infatuated). In fact, I might simply be unable to experience what people typically call ""falling in love"". The feeling of euphoria associated with falling in love seems to have [an association](http://www.youramazingbrain.org/lovesex/sciencelove.htm) with dopamine as well.

I'm one of those people that tend to have difficulty reaching orgasm (takes a while). There is a strong tie between orgasm buildup and dopamine.

Finally, my mother is a paranoid schizophrenic. I haven't shown any symptoms of this myself, but I believe I inherited a few things from her: my creativity, my tendency for depression, and a [deficient dopamine mechanism](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Dopamine_and_schizophrenia) (hypothesized to be a possible cause for schizophrenia).",,False,,t5_2qowo,1352074787.0,,,True,t3_12mzwl,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/12mzwl/on_joy_introversion_and_dopamine/,

Yesterday I ended up in a small-ish group of people during [an event that typically attracts the geeky types](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humans_vs_Zombies), and I thought it would go well since I don't normally have any social anxiety in smaller groups. But it was awkward as hell between me and the others, and while I'm usually bad at reading social signs, it felt like I wasn't wanted. I was a lot quieter than usual, and I'm pretty sure I overheard someone say ""I forgot he was here"" in reference to me.

I don't think this is happening because extroverts just talk more so I have more chances to respond, since it's the general comfort level that concerns me, not the amount of talking. And I really don't think conversations between introverts always go this way, because in my lone-wolfing I've overheard a lot of discussions that I would do great in.

1347344061.0,36,self.intj,zp3kt,DAE dump,40,4,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/zp3kt/dae_dump/,"I made a list of things I noticed about my thought process and I want to know if other INTJs can relate or if they are more personal things. So, getting to the point, does anyone else

**1. Get distracted easily, forget, loose train of thought, have to take breaks to move.**
I'm not talking about complete ADHD, but sometimes I skip meals because I was busy with something and forgot, and I know this is probably common, but a lot of times I walk into a room, see something shiny, and leave, but then I remember what I was doing again. Also, when I'm working on something, even something I'm pretty passionate about, once in a while I have to put everything to a stop and just jump around, stretch, maybe hang upside down. Also, sometimes I forget what I was thinking about, even the simplest things. Today I was asked to to a simple division problem on the board, and I completely forgot for a couple seconds. Maybe it was the pressure of people watching, I don't know.

**2. Have trouble believing people's comments and praising**
As a kid, adults tell you all sorts of things that are purely to boost your self esteem, and I always knew that. Even as a small child, when my mom or a teacher would tell me things like 'you're very smart, I know it, you're just not living up to your full potential' in my head I would be like 'would you still be saying that if my feelings or your job didn't matter?' (I never said these things because I knew I wouldn't get a straight answer).

**3. Not always see people as 'people'**
This might be hard to explain, but I don't see people as my equal. Sometimes I feel more like the camera guy of a nature film, where I don't interact, I only observe their behavioral patterns. Sometimes it's different than that though. Sometimes in my head it's more like '*day 38. I am convinced that I have scouted out a potential suitable companion. Tomorrow I shall approach it slightly less subtly, and attempt interaction.*' And the first time we got our GPA rankings, I only saw people as their numbers (which they eagerly announced).

**4. Mentally see movement of numbers and objects**
This might be something specific to my brain, but I'll add it anyways. Whenever I'm on a road trip, driving through the country, when I look out into a field, I see planes(in the mathematical sense) and I wonder things like 'if this plane could pick out insects and only insects, and it shifted upwards through the ground, would there be millions and millions, or are there just a few solitary ones? A better example is probably the way I do mental math. I rarely show my work if I don't have to (even though I still forget to carry ones and such) because I can 'see' the numbers shift and turn and flip from positive to negative, less than to greater than.

**5. Whisper gibberish when concentrating**
If I wore a microphone while doing math that required a lot of multiplying and dividing, I would sound like a schizophrenic or something. Like I said, I do math in my head, but what I assume is my extroverted thinking makes me need to hear myself to get my thoughts clear. I don't always say everything I'm doing though, and sometimes I just repeat numbers until I know what to do with them. This is what I probably sound like during a math test: *eight twelve six one three three three thirty six fourteen fourteen fourteen fourteen negative six and a quarter divide... *

**6. Not like having people expect things of you**
I don't want people to always think I'll be right or get the highest test score. I'd rather people notice little things like a good point I made or something. Don't get me wrong, l love getting the highest test scores, but if one day I got a low B or just forgot to study, I don't want people to think something has gone terribly wrong in my life (a teacher actually asked me once if everything was going ok at home when I was in 5th grade and I was pretty shocked).

**7. Not want to get too cocky**
This probably goes a little with point 2, maybe point 6, but I don't want to think too high of myself because I'm probably not as great as I sometimes think, I don't always share these ideas and observations with people, so people probably aren't sharing theirs either. I know that INTJs have a reputation of being all elitist, considering themselves the 'master race', and to be honest, I find it fun to play along with that on the internet, but not in real life.

**8. Not actually act like a jerk all of the time**
I know a lot of you probably don't care what others think of you, but I’ve found that if people don't hate you, they're easier to cooperate with. Maybe I was mistyped, maybe my functions are more balanced, but even though I'm pretty straightforward, I try to avoid conflict. When working as a team, in my mind, we don't have to get along, we just have to cooperate.",,False,,t5_2qowo,1347505547.0,,,True,t3_zp3kt,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/zp3kt/dae_dump/,

You cannot force a better world on people. You have to make them earn it for themselves or they will never be able to keep it once you're gone. Alexander the Great taught us that. 

   The people living in the world have to want it, and want it badly enough to be willing to fight for it. To grow for it, as people, to change for it, to learn for it. Sweating and bleeding is easy. Learning, evolving, tuning down your baser instincts, your animal urges is another level of challenge all together. To always do the right thing, regardless of the self, regardless of desire or want or joy or happiness or pleasure. Only once people are evolved enough, mature enough, wise enough and disciplined enough to CHOOSE this path EVERY TIME even when... ESPECIALLY when it means a lack of pleasure or enjoyment for the self will they be ready to advance as a species.

We are ALL the universe experiencing itself. You are a spark of consciousness in a storm of thought. Could there ever be a more foolish act than putting yourself first?

I am shocked at how similar your thoughts and musings are to mine, and I hope to become more involved in this community.

What prompted me to post this was a surge of emotion that I experienced after randomly stumbling onto r/relationshipadvice. I became engulfed in the stories of infidelity and my blood started to boil; I then fell deep into thought. 

For most of my life, and by that I mean ever since I was 9-10 years old (I'm 25 now), I have convinced myself that I never want to get married. There are a myriad of reasons for this, and my justifications have evolved over time. First, I thought it was because my parents are a miserable ""couple"" who remain married to this day purely for financial reasons. I thought it was because their relationship left a bitter taste in my mouth. Then, I thought it was a negative reaction towards my low self esteem, i.e. I convinced myself that I didn't want anyone. I had ugly duckling syndrome all throughout high school, but ever since college I've found out that I'm very aesthetically pleasing to a lot of women...haha.  Again, there are a lot of reasons for my disdain towards marriage and long-term relationships, but I think I've gotten to the heart of it. For ME, long-lasting intimate relationships are simply irrational.

I was reading stories of infidelity, and I confirmed what I already knew: that human beings are promiscuous animals. To stay in a monogamous relationship for 5 years, 10 years, 20 years is defying the odds of nature. Biologically, it is in our self interests to have multiple partners (this is not only true of men). Also, if I'm not mistaken, we INTJs are very forward-looking, future oriented thinkers. To me, it is not a rational to invest yourself in somebody else when the likelihood that they will cheat on you and betray your trust in the future is very high. Perhaps I have a warped view, I don't know. Society's norm is that 1 is the loneliest number. But to me, 1 is the only stable number. Please understand (as I'm sure you do) that I am oversimplifying everything and that there are obviously holes in my argument that I am not mentioning. But you get the gist. 

The problem now, is that I do have the emotional, instinctual urges to find a mate. I do sometimes yearn to go out, pick up the pretty girl at the bar, and initiate that blissful honeymoon period of relationship. It feels so damn good to hold another girl in my arms. Sometimes I become upset but then, like today, my rational side kicks in and reminds me not to invest in the risky female stock. It's not hard to refrain from doing so, because I am genuinely happy being alone. Again, sometimes I just have that biological yearning that I need to fight through until my testosterone levels off. 

Please, please do not read this as a cry for help or advice. This is merely my public journal entry that outlines my thought process. Please try not to analyze my thoughts because I have oversimplified everything. I'm very interested to hear your thoughts on relationships. I have divulged this to friends before (who are definitely not INTJs) and they have shrugged me off as being naive and lost. But I don't feel lost. I am a pensive person, and I simply enjoy thinking about these things...this rant is not a means to an end.

edit:



Now that I’ve had some time to think about things, I believe that my head is a bit clearer. It seems like every time I return home from work, I am left in a depressive state. The responses to my thread merit more of an explanation to what problems I am facing. When I originally created the thread, I didn’t want to type at all. I was in some sort of pain. I want to avoid sounding pretentious or superficial when explaining my problems. Personally, I become annoyed at human problems that could be considered minute to others. To surmise my hardships, I would sum it up with me losing control of my own mind. Not being able to trust what my own judgment… I am not going to try and make major psychological evaluations on where my life went wrong. Basically I was verbally abused a lot as a child, either by my parents or peers at school. As a result of this I inevitably lost my self-confidence. I was also rejected once before when I was a lot younger. A combination of being excluded from everyone, verbally abused, and basically perceiving myself with negative connotations throughout my childhood gave me a negative outlook on life. I developed this bleak personality with a pessimistic spectrum to what reality is. I am now 18 and I have social anxiety issues, self-confidence issues, and am obviously shy. I have spent about a year of my life focusing on an ideal notion that I don’t even know to be true anymore. I have deceived myself to the point where I cannot make a logical rational thought concerning this matter. When I started my job, I began noticing that a girl was looking at me. Or at least I thought she was. This resulted into me taking an interest in her. The interest grew deeper over the months. I began staring at her a lot. I believe that she would look at me too. There’d be a lot of awkward glances and uncomfortable situations between us. I thought that she was just shy and really liked me. I became obsessed in my head about the idea of her. I didn’t even know a thing about her, but I became obsessed in my own thoughts. These hints or what I perceived as hints to her liking me continued on for about  a year. I’m not going to explain more about what led me to believe that she liked me. There would be more than just the occasional locking stare. I am not going to try and convince anyone and mostly because I feel insane. Ultimately, I concluded that either my mind was truly deceiving me because I was so alone. I was over analyzing the situations and maybe she just wanted to avoid me. Or I was just rejecting the notion that someone could like me. At times I would try and ignore her because I thought I was inadequate and she didn’t like me. I have to unfortunately deal with this every day at work. It drives me insane. I have tried to stop thinking about her but when I see someone everyday it’s nearly impossible for my mind to suppress the thoughts. I presently don’t know what she thinks of me, it could be completely one way or the other. I believe that because I cannot clearly assess the situation means that I am somewhat insane. I must be incredibly stupid to not be able to evaluate the situation. I want to avoid being an absolute fool and mislead myself, but I don’t want to lose the possibility of what I had actually perceived to be her. I make a lot of judgments on things and for the most part I am generally right. I tend to analyze things with accuracy. I have never felt so confused before. I feel almost dysfunctional. I am too cowardly to say anything because of my fear of rejection. I wouldn’t be able to work anymore if things went bad. I am truly lost.


This whole problem that I face every day is just the start of the long list of problems that I do have. One of my other major problems is the lack of socializing with other people. I’d explain more thoroughly about what troubles me, but my eyes are closing and I feel like shit. I feel depressed

(rant),54,21,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/11jsno/am_i_the_only_one_here_not_antisocial_rant/,"I always read how people claiming to be ""introverts"" hate people and just try to claim it is because they are an introvert, so it gives them a free pass almost.  I take the test maybe once every year and so far I'm still INTJ.

Personally, I don't completely HATE people. I like being social. Over-thinking and living inside my head makes it AWKWARD but I still do not hate being social. I am not arrogant either, I do like things to be a certain way but I'm not going to expect it from everyone obviously.

I'm not even sure where I'm going with this but everywhere I look it just seems because someone claims to be an INTJ or ""introvert"" they say ""oh yeah, well I'm in INTJ/introvert so I don't like being around people"" and I just think that is complete bs to use the introvert card like that. People use it along the same tone as ""oh I'm atheist/religious, I do/don't believe in whatever"" or ""oh I'm vegetarian so that means I can't eat meat sorry."" I don't think it is fair to use the ""introvert"" card the same way.

At worst MY experience has been complete awkwardness or maybe even low self esteem but I refuse to be *that guy* that never speaks or always at home posting how I hate people and life on Facebook all day. I actually DO want to be in charge in some social settings where I feel confident. I know this goes against a lot of what the INTJ description says but I like being the leader. 

I like for people to know I am able to do certain tasks or skills and I like being exposed to as much as I can. My motto is if you want things done right do them yourself and to lead by example. INTJ master race! If I'm good with computers, I have no problem with everyone knowing and asking me opposed to them poking around messing things up farther.

In my experience a lot of people give INTJs and introverts a bad reputation just because they themselves are socially lazy or other reasons due to them not putting in effort. Perhaps they *do* hate people for whatever reason but the longer I know them or read the reason the more I see it has nothing to do with being an introvert but some sort of anxiety issue or other life problem which we all do get.

Even I have low self esteem but I do not blame it on me being INTJ. I know the two are different issues. I think being arrogant and all of that goes along with other personality issues outside of INTJ. I'm not saying I am good at emotional expressions or a complete chatterbox with strangers but I just never understood the COMPLETE ""I hate people"" attitude. Can I ask why you guys feel this way? Do you never think it is a good idea to at least try to become more social, perhaps even to discover more INTJs? I seriously want to know!

When you look at the famous INTJs they are people with power and CONSTANTLY IN THE PUBLIC SPOTLIGHT. Lance Armstrong, Arthur Ashe, Augustus Caesar, Hannibal, Michelle Obama, General Colin Powell, Hillary Clinton, Arnold Schwarzenegger, JFK.. To get these positions, they could not have possibly been as anti social as people today claim that they too are.

I figure it kinda has to do with timing and mood. I'm not entirely positive where I fall 'cause I've seen parallel traits for myself in both. But I would like to know if other INTJ's are ever called non-committal by people they know. Friends, family, etc. I often times find myself not committing to things because I'm calculating the probabilities of something happening and what I'd rather do and what the circumstances would be. I'm constantly saying ""maybe"" and ""we'll see"" or ""I'll try."" 

Not only that, but I find I'm always the one who is measuring out the timing for events and calculating and assessing all the things that have to be done for it to play out. Like if I'm going on a trip and trying to leave by a certain time, I calculate all the things that have to be done in terms of packing so I can leave by the time I'm aiming for since I've already thought about the probable traffic patterns, where the traffic will be and what time it'll be there. I focus a lot on details and specifics and aim to be precise without declaring certainty. It's efficient but frustrating because people you're close to don't think of the things which seem obvious to you. 

I don't commit to things in case something comes up, whether it's from unforeseen circumstances or something better comes along. I never feel comfortable saying ""Yes, definitely. That's happening."" 

Anyhow, as INTJ's do any of you experience similar mindsets? Or is this trait not quite reminiscent of yourself?

I would describe myself as ""marijuana enthusiast"" (read Pot Head.) I've found that I just don't like alcohol that much (it makes me feel stupid, something that I don't like.) While I know some people think that pot makes you stupid, I haven’t found this to be the case. I find that smoking is a great way to release tension and relax after a long stressful week. Also, I find that it stimulates my brain and gives me a different perspective on things (which can be incredibly refreshing and eye-opening.) Another thing I have noticed is that smoking can sometimes make me more introverted than normal. I notice this even more when I go out and socialize after/during smoking. At a party while high, I tend to avoid social contact except with other close friends and others who are also high. 

Other than marijuana I have used psilocybin (magic mushrooms), MDMA, and want to try other powerful hallucinogens. I have found that I am particularly attracted to trying drugs like this because they open your mind to a whole new world of possibilities. While tripping, I have been able to completely let go of all my concerns and simply live in the moment. While this is possible without dosing, the experience is much more powerful while tripping.

Here's how the first 24 hours have gone. 

The MIL arrived Friday evening around 5pm. Luckily, I had more vacation time than initially anticipated, so I was able to mentally prepare all day. Last night went smoothly as the MIL was exhausted from her 8 hour drive. The peace ended at around 5AM this morning. MIL awoke and stirred the dogs, who decided to stage an homage to the running of the bulls. This woke my 6 year old who decided she wanted coffee and breakfast with the MIL. Trying to sleep became futile. I managed to senf the wife, daughter, and MIL to Waffle House around 10AM. That got me about 2 hours of tranquility. After they returned home, MIL was ""anxious"" (her term for fixing to freak the fuck out). This was brought on by a stop at Walmart after brunch.

In order to avoid the MIL drama, I convinced my wife that I needed to go to work to load up my daughter's new Kindle with stuff. Can't have her stepping in and seeing anything can we? That got me out of the house and used up a good 3 hours. So far, it's gone well. 

When I return home, I get some bad news. My sister-in-law is coming over with her baby, right now. Fuck me. She's her own kind of monster. The original plan was for her to join the women for brunch at Waffle House. She flaked. Then she was going to come to a early supper at the house. Then she might have to work and can't come at all.

Other times we can over think things and fall victim to ""paralysis by analysis.""  Even worse, we may become ""naysayers"" and actively discourage others in their endeavors.

I felt like someone with better leadership skills would be able to make them care more, it was really frustrating for me.

What I don't get is why society encourages and expects everyone to be a leader. Like on an application for a job or school, you're always supposed to put Leadership Experience. But organizations consist of a few leaders and a whole lot of people who are doing the work. It wouldn't work if everyone were a leader! Some people are good at being charismatic and motivating others but they aren't always good at figuring out the details of what steps the group should take to accomplish their broader goals; in my experience other, non-leader people are often better at that.

I know that cheating is an abhorrent act, and, as hypocritical as this is, I hate the pain that I have seen others endure from being cheated on, but I can't stop myself from chasing after this idealized future in my head that teases me day in and day out.

Am I the only INTJ who thinks this way, or am I an oddball?

Several people over the past few years have called me weird and I honestly don't really know why. It never really bothered me what others thought of me as I'm a nice and good person but lately... well it's starting to make me worry.

The first time was at boarding school when we were the top year (my fellow house students) and had to say something good and bad about each other. For me, almost all of them said ""you're weird, but it's a good weird"". They couldn't explain it and it shocked me.

Then recently a gf of one of my house mates said ""at first I thought you were weird but I realised you're actually quite funny"" but then there was a time I made a joke and she (and others) said ""oh wow you're normal.""
No, just kidding. 
They called me weird again.

Another time was after I made some photos and photoshopped myself in multiple places. Then the other night I was drinking with some friends and one of them (any guesses?) said ""oh, you're quite weird aren't you?""

That's when it hit me. In a different way. 

I know some fellow INTJs get this from my previous posts. I'm thinking it's to do with my sense of humour and possibly how we observe things and extend it to something else.

The events leading up to her finding out required that I comfort her and prepare her for whatever news was soon to come her way. I survived, but only barely.**

Around 9:30pm my roommate went to go buy some groceries. As soon as she got back home, she received a phone call from someone saying that her mom was on the way to pick her up. My roommate asked why and nobody would tel her. She asked about her dad, and nobody said anything. She started freaking out and begging for whoever was on the phone to tell her what happened, but nobody did. I caught on fairly quickly that something wasn't right so despite the fact that I had a paper due at midnight, I dropped what I was doing to find out what was going on.

She hung up and had no idea what was going on. She tried to pack a bag but she couldn't. She could sense that something was wrong and it was frustrating her that nobody would tell her. She wanted to know why her mom was driving over here so late to pick her up. I did feel that it was odd that nobody would tell her anything about her dad, but I kept my cool and took over the task with making sure she packed a bag. If it was bad, she definitely was going to be gone for a few days. 

After we packed, she showered and got dressed, then started pacing around our apartment. Crying and not knowing what to do, she just started saying over and over, ""I don't know what's going on. I don't know where my dad is. I hope it's not what I think it is. I HOPE IT'S NOT WHAT I THINK IT IS."" I feel bad that she is living with someone (me) who doesn't know how to handle people emotions easily, but I tried my best. 

I made sure she drank some water, and sat down. I explained to her that right now at this second, there was nothing she could do. There was absolutely nothing she could do except breathe and wait for her mom to show up. Someone texted her a message saying that they were sorry and that they were there for her. This sent my roommate into a crying fit so I snatched her phone up to make sure that anyone else who knew what was going on wouldn't text her. 

I figured that her boyfriend might need to know what was going on, so I texted him on her phone, but he didn't answer. Then her brother called and while he wouldn't tell her what was going on, he managed to distract her by asking what she did that day, and by making her tell him everything. I made the mental note that this is a good technique to use in the event that I have to deal with a friend who is going through the same thing again. (I really hope I never have to again, but if any of you do, REMEMBER. Take their mind off of what is going on and make them tell you every detail about their day. I feel so stupid that I didn't think of that before, but I guess now I know)

They talked for a while, and FINALLY her mom and her mom's friend showed up. I guess the look on her mom's face said it all because my roommate backed up into the kitchen and began yelling, ""NO. NO. NO! PLEASE NO."" My roommate crumpled to the floor, her mom squat down and tried to comfort her. The mom's friend came over to me, and I mouthed *what happened?!* and she quietly told me that her dad was killed. She didn't say died. She said KILLED. I asked how, and she told me that he was shot. I went into instant tear mode. Meanwhile, my roommate is begging for her mom to tell her what happened and the mom finally let it out. 

I hope none of you ever have to watch a mother tell her daughter that her father was murdered. That he was shot in the chest. Shot in the chest by her sister's HUSBAND. I hope you never have to watch as your friend and roommate cries out.

""HE SHOT MY DAD HE SHOT MY DAD""

""WHERE IS MY DAD?""

""NO NO IT WASN'T MY DAD! IT WASN'T MY DAD! WHERE IS DAD?""

I hope you never have to see it. 

I checked her phone to see if her boyfriend had texted or called, and he hadn't. I looked up his number and called him on my phone, but he didn't answer. I paced around as her mom and the friend held her down and comforted her. The boyfriend finally called me back and it just came right out. I told him that her father was gone. That he had been murdered and that he needed to come over here right now. He said ""What? I'm coming over RIGHT NOW.""

I continued to watch my roommate's struggle in understanding that this was really happening. I finished preparing her bags and set them by the door. I set my oscillating fan to blow in the three of them. I gave them tissue paper. And I waited what seemed forever for her boyfriend to show up. I ran outside when I saw he was here and told him that I didn't know if it was the right thing to tell him but that I did it anyways. He ran up the stairs and I watched as he comforted her and she cried to him. 

*As an aside: Despite the extreme tragedy of it all, it was really quite a beautiful picture to see them on the floor, him holding her sad face, their foreheads touching. Him trying to understand her and to be there for her.*

Anyways, up until my roommate's mom showed up, I had to display some sort of sympathy. As much as I really really wanted to do a good job, I just couldn't do it. I didn't know what to do. She's taller than me but I gave her hugs and rubbed her back. I did my best to comfort her.  But it was so hard to do. It made me realize that I need to seriously learn how to do that stuff. She had 3 other family members die this past summer. I haven't had a death in the family since 1995 when I was just 7 years old. I don't have any experience in people close to me dying. I was completely unprepared to help out, but I hope I did well. 

Even though he wasn't my dad and I only met him a couple of times, I still feel very saddened by it. The part that saddens me the most is having to watch the mother tell her daughter that her father is dead. To watch my friend be in such a state of sadness and anger. That's the part that is affecting me and I just...I don't know what to do.

Writing all this out has helped me chill out a bit, but the image of the mom taking on that task to tell her daughter what happened and my roommate completely breaking down will forever be in my memory.

I hope none of you have to witness it. Ever.

I did all this when an ESFJ claimed he was an INTJ, despite the fact that this mistake should be highly improbable to make).

&gt;1. The most common test I've found, Humanmetrics, gives almost 1 in 3 people an INTJ score, despite the fact that INTJ's are somewhere less than 3% (numbers vary by source. Information difficult due to rarity of person)

&gt;2. INTJs are listed as ""the smartest and most self confident"" without listing any of their disabilities (extreme frustration, even fear of social situations, occasional lack of motivation, etc). Thus, people read them as ""Masterminds are the best"" and go with that.

&gt;3. Most people take the tests with what they want to be in mind. For example, an extremely disorganized person might claim to be organized because they want to be, (though in cases of OCD this is understandable, so the example isn't great).

&gt;4. Type descriptions are rather complex. For example, to an ESFP, the differences between an INTJ and INTP are reletively small and meaningless, but in practice those differences lead to conflict between the two. Thus, reading a description and saying ""that's me"" or ""That's cool. I want to be that"" is a serious cause of bias.

&gt;5. INTJs are one of the rarest groups (right there with rationals in general.) Of the rationals, INTJs appear to be better. I suspect it's because of the name ""mastermind"", to be honest. In any case, people like to be unique, which, in great irony, leads almost everyone to list themselves as the same thing.

&gt;In my experience, the best thing to do is to give someone the test without them realizing they're taking it, in the same way the best interviews are when you don't realize they're taking place.

&gt;I still get the MBTI of all my friends, as it makes it easier to understand how/why they do things, but I don't give the test anymore, as the biases involved made it impossible to use.     
     
This is a post I put on the subreddit /r/dataisbeautiful some time ago.
I'd like to get some input on this (/r/dataisbeautiful seemed to be agreeable, but they aren't the group in question, though I'd suspect that there is a high carryover rate). If I am correct, could we possibly work out some solutions to this?
        
(I noticed that the "" Take a Jung Typology Test^TM "" link led to the humanmetrics test, which if I am correct, I suspect may be directing large numbers of people here who shouldn't be here).      
     
The large number of people in this subreddit, compared to the other MBTI subreddits, may possibly have a connection to this. (I also suspect it has to do more with the higher tendency of an INTJ to browse reddit, but that's a conversation for another day).

I feel that this is perpetuated further with INTJs in TV and media (e.g. Greg House).

However, I have always found myself to be somewhat of an optimist. This certainly doesn't mean I'm not a realist; I like to think that I always make an honest attempt to take in as much data as possible and evaluate something objectively. Even with this though, I see myself constantly seeing the best in situations and why things aren't necessarily as bad as they seem. I generally have a positive outlook on life, and like to give people chances even though my brain automatically calculates what would happen if they didn't come through, and I'm prepared for it.

The amount of ENTPs and INTPs that are mistyped as INTJ is very high.  Seriously.  Take a good hard look at what kind of bias you employ in your test-taking or even in your day to day decision making after learning about MBTI.  I began under the impression that I was an INTJ, most likely because my answers were according to what I strive to be.  I even somewhat modified my behavior to fit that perspective.  As an ENTP, being an individualistic thinker is still very important to me, as is the avoidance of dogma--it's just not as reflexive with my cognitive function set as it may be for an INTJ.  Eventually, as I became more educated in cognitive functions, I determined that I am a clear Ne-Ti combo.  This led me down the INTP path, which eventually led me down the ENTP path to where I am now, as I never could relate to the lack of external motivation or desire for excellence in INTPs.  I am quite a realistic person.  I like to see physical results.  That's not an INTP thing.  ENTPs are the *most likely* extraverted type to have introverted tendencies, be it due to a certain level of Ne alienation, or simply not fitting in.

So, what can I recommend?  

First thing's first, absolutely educate yourself in cognitive functions if you don't already know about them:  
[INTJ](http://www.personalitynation.com/intj/3480-intj-jungian-cognitive-function-analysis.html)  
[INTP](http://www.personalitynation.com/intp/3509-intp-jungian-cognitive-function-analysis.html)  
[ENTP](http://www.personalitynation.com/entp/5508-entp-jungian-cognitive-function-analysis.html)  
[Another good resource.](http://www.cognitiveprocesses.com/)

Once that's done, be aware of the intrinsic difference between Ni and Ne and Ti and Te.  The difference in Ni-Te and Ne-Ti is drastic.  As an Ne user, upon seeing something, I instantaneously shoot off into 10 different directions of seeking alternative perspectives or how it could be humorous.  Extraverted functions are self contained, requiring no internalized system to process information.  They are objectively focused.  Ti, on the other hand, is contemplative.  It requires an ""algorithm,"" if you will, to run the information through.  Ni is contemplative as well.  The ""aha moment"" thing is bullshit, and misleading.  Ni requires a similar book of operators and if, then arguments to run information through.  You have to run the information through that subjective and internalized system before it comes together and makes sense.  Te does not work the same way.  It springs off tangentially like Ne.  Ti-Ne-Si combinations are also much more the ""grammar nazi,"" ""fact-checker"" archetypes that we see much of on reddit.  *Not* Ni-Te, who most likely see things like that to be trivial endeavors.

Secondly, think about your behavior before you knew about MBTI.  Think as far back as you can, to when you were younger.  In elementary school, I was the kid that had stellar academic performance, but without failure was noted as being loud and disruptive on every report card.  That's the zaniness of Ne right there.  INTJs and INTPs, on the other hand, were most likely *least* outspoken when they were younger, not developing their hand with Te or Ne until their teen years.  Think about what direction you took as you hit age 11 or 12.  A Te auxiliary will typically become more focused on making sense of their somewhat incomprehensible Ni at around that age, where a Ti auxiliary will typically become more focused on themselves, and how things correlate with them, where it previously was all about the world around them.  An Ne auxiliary may become more zany, creative, or exploratory at that age.

Thirdly, absolutely take a look at enneagram.  It's very good at analyzing your drives and motives.  INTJs typically *aren't* 5w6s.  I see a lot of people who think they are 5w6 INTJs.  5w4, 1w9, and 4w5 are more typical INTJ types, but that's not to say that it's impossible.  I am 5w6, 1w9, 3w2, which is a very typical, yet more introverted ENTP type.  5w6 hints at xNTP, where 3wX is a very extraverted type, 1w9 is a somewhat introverted type, and 1w2 is a somewhat feely type.

**Edit:** A comment that I made here is something that I think contributes very much to this post, depending on your level of knowledge.

&gt;While MBTI is simply a deductive ""you do this, therefore you are this"" type test, Jungian cognitive functions focus more on ""you are this because you think like this"". It is far more boxed in. It's like the difference between saying ""I took a personality test and it said I was a girl, and the description pretty much reiterated how I answered the questions, so how could you possibly refute that?"" vs. ""I have a penis in between my legs, therefore I am a male."" ""MBTI testing"" is like the former, whereas Jungian cognitive function analysis is like the latter.  This is why it's important to look at your cognitive functions if you are really interested in getting down and dirty with the theory.",,False,,t5_2qowo,1346226068.0,,,True,t3_yzq0q,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/yzq0q/intj_mistyping_more_info_inside/,

After that a massive sensation of embarrassment, disappointment and fear of what I've just done came to me and I didn't know how to deal with it. It all became worst when people around me became to remind me what I've just done and I just wanted to vanish from there in the act. 

The stress attached to frustration can be sometimes difficult to handle and sometimes we need a lot of time and meditation to cool-down and go back to reality. Also the frustration can involve into full anger addressed to others or even to ourselves.

I know there's plenty of INTJ relationship questions/responses floating around out there - I just haven't had time to look through them all for similar responses!  

So I'll ask for your help directly, if it's not too much trouble.  

I am really, REALLY struggling to make my SO understand how important being alone actually is to me.  I use that time to read, think, jot down ideas, reddit, brainstorm, etc.  

What my SO doesn't understand is that I need this time to recharge my batteries.  I don't spend too many days consecutively with ANYONE, unless I have to.  

Some background:
* Relationship approaching 2.5 years
* Was a long distance relationship.  I moved to be with her.  
* I do love her very much
* We live apart, but only about a ten minute commute
* I see her several times a week on average.  Normally spend entire weekends with her.
* Unsure of my SO's personality type, but definitely an extrovert.  

This afternoon she wanted to hang out outside as it was a really nice day.  I am actually very outdoorsy closer to the summer, but today I wanted to stay in and read, alone.  She left, and began to text me later, complaining about how I ""expected her to disappear"" so I could have my alone time.  We had hung out I'd say for 90% of the prior week (she caught a cold and I just moved to the area and am looking for a job, so I was able to visit her), and she slept over on Saturday night, too.  

I very much need time to be by myself - I immensely enjoy it and I think I'd go off the deep end if I couldn't do that.  She, on the other hand, seems like she could hang out most of the time without issue.      

Any advice for me on how to help her understand that this is important to me?  Any more information you would need to help understand the situation?

Thanks in advance!  

EDIT: Formatting - fairly new to Reddit, and spelling.    

EDIT: Also, I should have mentioned: I have tried very very hard to meet my SO's emotional needs in terms of contact.  I have increased the amount of time we've spent together to an amount that I was actually very uncomfortable with (without having any breaks), and felt like we were a little out of balance.  
  
**UPDATE:** Thanks to one and all for the advice.  I have only had the chance to respond to one comment thus far, though I've read all of the responses.  I spoke with my SO this morning (in person) and explained to her, again, that I sometimes need to be by myself and that she shouldn't consider this as as sign of disinterest.  I further explained that I have been this way my entire life, and often prefer isolation to interaction, even with close friends and family.  She was very understanding and appreciative, especially when I mentioned that I was feeling as though I put forth a great deal of effort to understand her feelings and compromise and she did not.  She agreed with me that this was the case and wanted to know how we could re-balance our relationship.  I suggested that one type of compromise could be us silently spending time together, which we tried all day today while reading our books, and I must say, it went wonderfully!  We again spoke about each of our needs at the end of the day, and have agreed to each venture out of our comfort zones together and individually, her understanding my need for (sometimes) total solitude or staying away from a social event, and me understanding her need for contact and affection.  It ended with her taking the MBTI, which pegged her as an **ESFJ**.  We read a few ESFJ and INTJ articles together, and I plan on reading more about her type.

I am a synesthete and was curious if any of you are as well. It's somewhat difficult to explain if you don't have it, as it varies from person to person, but it is essentially illogical association between two unrelated concepts. When one section of the brain is stimulated, another unrelated area will ""light up"" as well. It most often occurs with colors, numbers, and music. For me:

Monday=yellow

Tuesday=light blue

Wednesday=red

Thursday=forest green

Friday=light blue

Saturday=grey/white

Sunday=purple


Numbers also have personalities. I don't like odd numbers because they are cold and unfeeling. Even numbers are warm and comforting. Though, I relate most to the number 19; she is strong, independent, and also forest green. Which leads to Thursday. Numbers also have positions in space. 10 is ""higher up"" in the plane than the number 3. But, the line bends at about a 45 degree angle and then goes down to 20. So, 1-10 looks like this: /  while 11-20 look like this: \ . 21-100 continue in a straight line into the distance.

Music is the strongest trigger for me and difficult to put into words. Each note has a personality, color and feeling associated with it. So hearing symphonies triggers something like the iTunes visualizer in my head complete with every spectrum of human emotion. It's pretty damn sweet.

So, this may sound insane if I'm in the minority here, but I am curious if others experience something similar and if there is any correlation between personality type and being a synesthete.",,False,,t5_2qowo,1356735974.0,,,True,t3_15jwxo,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/15jwxo/intjs_and_synesthesia/,

How is it that whenever I search about personality types on the internet, the one that I come across most is INTJ? I haven't checked for the accuracy of this, but it almost even seems like the subreddit INTJ is more popular than other personality types. I realize that is just one example, and maybe I'm just misinformed, but it seems like this many people shouldn't really be INTJ. 

My point is, I'm sure many people see the opportunity to label themselves as ""Genius"" or a ""rarity"", and go for it. They take a simple test and BOOM, they're a genius. Just like that. Nope, it doesn't matter that you don't read books, do drugs all day, don't analyse information intensely, don't strategically plan future things in your head, etc (and other INTJ characteristics). 

This is why I hate labels. Who knows, maybe I'm just another idiot who thinks he's smarter than he really is. It's self manipulation, and a lot of the time you don't realize you're doing it.

I think it indicates something but he's right in the sense that it is'nt conclusive. If you're interesed in this further look up ""flow"", and then imagine it's dark twin. ////

In my experience in this forum, INTJ's often complain of ""thinking too much"". Some of my more analytical friends do as well, though I don't know their types. You may know this as the ""vicious cycle"" or ""downward spiral"": you analyze yourself, and this seems to cause poor performance, which initiates deeper self-analysis, ad-infintum. As a corollary, I often experience a paradoxical sense of self consciousness: intensely present, but disconnected; and a primary feature of this state is very high mental verbalization. I came across this passage I thought you would all be interested in during my work.

&gt;A recent study by Wilson and Schooler (1991) provided further evidence that verbalization can increase the salience
of the verbalizable attributes of a stimulus and thereby overshadow
the nonverbalizable attributes. Wilson and Schooler
examined the effects of verbalizing affective judgments,
which is another domain for which subjects are unable to
fully articulate their thought processes (Nisbett &amp; Wilson,
1977). For example, in one study, subjects were asked to
evaluate different brands of strawberry jams. Control subjects
tasted the jams and then rated them, and verbalization
subjects tasted the jams and then wrote the reasons for their
preferences prior to rating them. When subjects' ratings were
compared with those of taste experts from Consumer Reports,
it was found that the control subjects agreed quite well
with the experts, whereas verbalization subjects showed little
agreement. Wilson and Schooler concluded that verbalization
causes subjects to base their evaluations on the reportable
aspects of their taste experience and to ignore those
aspects that cannot be adequately expressed in words. In
support of this hypothesis, it was observed that the attitudes
implied by subjects' written evaluations of the jams strongly
correlated with their ultimate ratings.

However, as I browse the Reddits in between coffee-fueled engineering sprints, I coudn't help but notice that general surveys are becoming frequent amongst this subreddit.

What music, pass-times, drinking habits, preference in partners, may very well be a function of being an INTJ, but I wish to advise against putting too much weight in these surveys. Many confounding factors exist. I enjoy drinking solo at a bar because as an INTJ I enjoy the solitude, but I also enjoy barhopping with friends because as a social animal, it is fun!

To the younger folks, rather than observe the characteristics/behaviors of older INTJ's as a guide, merely use it as a consideration because many factors influence why we do what we do. We enjoy certain music because it may remind us of a different time in our lives. We may enjoy reading a book vs. partying because we grew up as book worms. Please do not overlook the impact of socialization, culture, heritage, challenges, and the numerous other environmental factors which contribute to who we are and what we love.

The identification is a framework for better understanding who you are and why you react in certain situations so that you may be the most ideal ""you"" you want to be.

So, what Barby, what do you recommend? reduce the survey's and take a more case study approach. Tell a tale, and note the details. You have girlfriend problems? explain a little and maybe people can shed some light on possible perspectives and factors you may overlook.

Someone goes on to say that there are complications to the enzyme mentioned (telomerase) being used as a testing agent because it cause cancers. [&lt;--basic boring summary] 

After reading through this, I reflected on a book a read this past semester for a history class; it was called *Post Mortal* by Drew Magary. It depicts a world where a dystopia arises out of long term complications of a ""cure to aging"". Basically, too many people living, not enough death, so humans again play the roles of death makers to absolve the situation they got themselves in. My question throughout the book and afterwards has been centered around whether humanity should be seeking out these type of scientific discoveries (assuming it could be obtained one day). The controversy in my head comes from and ethical perspective and then one of science. 

As the nature of science goes, nothing truthfully should be off-limits to research; so the search for a fountain of youth should be fair game, and becomes another check-in-the-box for the long list of awesome human discoveries. However, given the principles of the physical laws we live by and observe today, I can only assume that such a drastic change to the human populous overall (eradicating our aging process, or even substantially increasing life-expectancy) would be devastating to the Earth's ecosystems and ability to support a multitude of species. In addition to the fact that this would be a luxury, and not a necessity in the context of health care, the number and demographic of people that would be able to afford such a treatment to extend life, I would say that it would be very skewed and unethical towards the least fortunate in society. 

Even if we were to say that the use of such a treatment as immortality would be 'illegal' to receive/administer, I have a feeling that it would not last. Someone out there with the authority will want to receive it out of curiosity (I know I would be tempted), and once that happens methods for reproduction leak and more people demand it, invest in it, and strive harder to replicate it that eventually it will become a common thing, much like new technology today. The world goes to shit and BOOM!--good bye 21st century civilization.

I'm not entirely sure if many truly understand what intelligence really is. I hear people claim they have, but they don't go into further detail on what characteristics are necessary to procure it. By the definition of the word it [states](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intelligence) a multitude of things. It is quite arbitrary in the end, don't you think? 

How is it quantified without bringing in the obscurity of IQs? And if it is so obscure, I would think that to say one has (more) intelligence in comparison to another would be fairly ambiguous as we all (as humans) have the ability to reason, think, create, and conceive. Sure these actions may be observed in our external world but, if intelligence is a cerebral process, and many things we think are not externalized, it would be a foolish thing to rely on it to prove superiority as we don't know the full picture.

So has intelligence become one of those pervasive misused words in our culture in an attempt to segregate ourselves from one another?

Here I am, 24 years old. I live in a 2br/2bth apartment, but my roommate is never here due to her dealing with her father's murder in September. The kitchen, living room, and my room are messy because I can't muster up the motivation to clean. Nobody comes over anyways so what's the point? I'm in the process of finding somewhere else to live, and I have settled on a room in a 6 bedroom house where 5 other college students live. This place is super huge and the upstairs has the largest living area I have ever seen and 5 of the 6 bedrooms are upstairs, and 2 bathrooms, and a laundry room. I am moving because my lease is up, and because despite how introverted I am, it WOULD be nice to have a place to go home to and to have other human beings there. 

Anyways, I'm sitting here, thinking about my dating life and EVERYTHING, and I'm thinking about all the ""normal"" dating things people do and realizing that I haven't experienced them. I've never really been taken out on a date...sometimes a girl really does want to get all dressed and wear a nice dress and heels and be taken out. I kind of went out on a date somewhere around 16 months ago, but it ended up with me not being interested in the guy. I've never been given flowers. Now, I'm not a super materialistic girl at all, but it would be nice to experience a few things. 

Every once in a while I'll go on Facebook and I'll end up looking through the photos of people I used to know. They have photos of them with an SO dating back a few years and they look so damn happy in all of them. They've gone overseas with this person, gone to get-togethers, celebrated holidays...everything. I have done none of these things with someone and I am beginning to feel one of two things:

A. What if I COULD be making those kinds of memories but I'm not because I'm always at home doing the same thing every night?

OR

B. What if there really is nobody out there for me and I'm not meant to have those kinds of memories? What if I'm just not going to get to travel with an SO, or take pictures with them where they look completely happy to be with me?

Then I start to think, is it my personality? Am I just completely boring? Am I ugly? Could I stand to lose 10 lbs? Am I too smart to attract someone? 

I go out to a favorite bar with one of my girl friends and every time we go, a guy or guys always talk to her, but never to me. We went out a couple weeks ago and she swapped numbers with a cute guy. When we went out this past weekend, he showed up but brought a friend. I'm not stupid. That friend was brought along to keep me company while the guy talked with my friend. It made me feel shittier than I would have felt if he had brought no friend for me. This wingman that was designated to me was cute, but kind of douchey, but I tried talking with him anyways. It didn't really work out once he figured out that I'm not some dumb airhead chick, and I could see him begin to struggle with how he was going to keep talking to me.

I want a genuine date. I want flowers and memories and travel, but I seriously feel like I've just accepted my fate and now I have to live with it.

I'm not depressed by any means. I'm actually enjoying my beer and listening to some good music and having fun crocheting, but at the same time, feeling close to someone, and having someone worthy of my time around and feeling like I'm worthy of someone's time is something that I want too.

A little bit of backstory -- A couple of years ago, I left my Big Ten university after one semester. It just wasn't a good fit for me -- I'll spare you the details. For financial reasons, as well as the inability to make up my damn mind, I spent the next two years at a community college, doing the bare minimum to get by, but still managing to pull down decent grades in nearly every general education course under the sun. I recently transferred to a local four-year private school to pursue a BS in computer science. 

Now, more then ever before, it's become difficult for me to focus on my schoolwork. I chose this college because of its trimester system (three 10-week terms per year vs. the traditional  two 16-week semesters). Having completed all of my general education courses at community college,  I'm free to focus on my major, and all should be good, right? Therein lies the rub. Firstly, I **love** programming. I am so fascinated by the capabilities of computation and writing software. My classes, though, are incredibly easy, and feel so slow. I thought that the 10-week terms would be a welcome improvement in pacing, but I really don't notice a difference. I eagerly devour everything my professors have to say, and often ask questions to further explore concepts (often well outside the scope of the course). When it comes time for a project, however, I just can't get focused. I'm ready to move on to new concepts and ideas. 

I'm so sick of jumping through college hoops. Getting a good grade just isn't motivation for me, as it feels entirely arbitrary (and won't matter after I get my first 'real' job). I spend a significant amount of time outside of the classroom learning new concepts/languages/stuffs on my own, which I find infinitely more valuable then completing a silly project. I have a really hard time sitting down to work projects and homework as a result. They're not difficult assignments at all -- they just require a considerable amount of time which I *could* be devoting to something that I feel is more enriching. 

I've struggled with time management and procrastination for my entire life, but up until now it hasn't really been a huge issue. Perhaps this is just one of those ""suck it up and do it"" situations. I'm just wondering if anyone has gone through a similar situation, and what tips you may have learned from it. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

Those are two pillars that has been there when growing up, and I was a very balanced, well liked kid with a healthy amount of self-confidence. During my first year of university both these habits were down-prioritized for a number of reasons and well, internal chaos assumed. Lack of reading and exercising certainly wasn't the only reasons this happened, but I think it made me lose an earlier stability I had. 

So this might not be an INTJ-thing, but I can't help to analyze it from a function perspective. I think reading novels is linked to Fi, I read to see other peoples/characters perspectives and to learn about their feelings and motivations. Maybe this is
because I felt it difficult to read persons feelings in real life, so reading in a book about it gave me an opportunity to develop Fi. I also needed other perspectives to not take myself so seriously, which I think helped a lot during the teenage years. 

But the real reason I wrote this post was to hear about your opinion on exercising in relation to Se and Ni. I think I NEED to use Se, otherwise I float away in my head, loose self-discipline, start prioritizing weirdly and in the end achieve less. But even though I know this it is difficult for me to get some routine in it. It is difficult to find time, and I don't particularly like exercising even though I love the feeling afterward. I have tried a couple of times to plan it out using Te, and if I have a gradually increasing schedule for running I feel much more motivated to do it, and I'm likely to keep it up for a longer time too.

Well, I don't really *hate* them, but I don't get what all of the fuss is about. Today, I turned 30. 

I woke up and felt like there was a 20 lbs weight on my chest. Yay, a chest cold, just what I need. For the 2nd day in a row, the wife and MIL are gone to town. Because of the cold, I can't enjoy it. Oh well. 

My mom calls and we do the happy birthday requirements before she switches to the plans for my big day. Apparently, my wife never tod anyone of my wishes to not do anything. After some serious haggling with Mom, I talk her into steaks at their house with them and my sister. I consider it to be a win because free steak. 

I was in a funk today. I'm normally a ""glass half full"" guy, but I was depressed all afternoon. I laid down to ""take a nap"", but I just wanted to wallow in self pity for a while and figure out what the hell was wrong with me. About the time I did, my wife came and laid down with me. 
She asked me what was wrong, and I told her. 

I haven't been able to truly relax, since the MIL got here. Her presence has thrown off my routine, and I am most definitely a creature of habit. My sanctuary has been become infested. The bad thing is (other than a couple of *minor* instances) my MIL has been an angel. I wish she was a bitch, because then my feelings would be justified. But no, she's done dishes and laundry and even made dinner last night. My wife has kept her happy, so her crazy hasn't even reared its ugly head. I feel like an asshole.

My question is, is it different for personal problems? You are rarely moved by stories you hear, but are you equally lacking in emotions when something happens to you? Do you ~~cry~~ feel emotional less than normal when facing personal problems, things that you care about in your life?

Thanks.

**TL;DR**: Do you find yourself indifferent only to problems that other people face, or to your own as well? Are you less likely to ~~cry~~ feel emotional (than others) when something sad happens even if it is a very personal problem of your own, something you care about?

Edit: I have a feeling people are a little offended by the implication that they have no emotions (ironic how I unwillingly offended people with this as well). I didn't mean that, not in a negative way anyway. Maybe a better way to put it would be ""how much do emotions affect your behaviour"" instead of ""how emotional are you"", but somehow I tend to think the way emotions affect your life must be correlated somehow with the strength of the emotion...This is coming from someone who has been accused of being insensitive, by the way, if that confession helps.

I tried not to get angry it was an innocent question but she could clearly see I wasn't doing that at all. She then proceeds to hover about uncomfortably while I try to get back into the groove. I think she finally got it and left. A few minutes later she's back full of conversation (what she has to do today and that the kids want to go swimming.

This makes me feel terrible, she tells the kids to leave me alone and finally realizes that I'm having one of my ""moments"". I've been on since Tuesday after all.

This game would include making highly complex systems while not being horribly obnoxious to use graphically, and would have some kind of purpose for the systems being created (Minecraft computers thus don't count). So far I have completely failed to find this game. Dwarf Fortress came close, but it was unappealing to look at with no goal and was more about managing than system building. Minecraft redstone simply has no point, and is very obnoxious to work with (I'd still use it if I knew how computers really worked...). Has anyone else found something closer to the ideal, and can anyone else improve on my idea of the ideal?

EDIT: Thank you all for your replies, but I think I should clarify my search a little more. I'm looking for a game about making complex machine-like systems, where I can tell things how to interact with each other and how to react to outside things and stuff like that. Not managing people or strategizing or puzzle solving, but making complex systems. Things like Tekkit assembly lines and Minecraft redstone, but with visuals more like The Space Game (which is a little flash game on sites like Kongregate). Does this game exist yet?

1367507914.0,25,self.intj,1djzd0,A question for the INTJs out there. An ENFP here is madly in love with an INTJ.,31,6,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1djzd0/a_question_for_the_intjs_out_there_an_enfp_here/,"So I've been just getting into reading about MBTI types and it's fascinating. I've taken the test many times through my life, but have not delved further into understanding it all until recently.

I am an ENFP to the core. I've taken the tests many times throughout my life and that is always my result. When I read about that type it describes me in a way that's uncanny.

I asked my boyfriend the other day if he'd take the test because I was curious what type he was. He obliged and found he is an INTJ. Reading about that type also really seems like it fits who he is.

So my question is what is it like for INTJ's to fall in love?

You can read my past posts if you are interested in the details of me telling my INTJ that I loved him for the first time if you are interested in the backstory.

But what it boils down to is my INTJ is almost 30 years old, has never been in love, has never really had a relationship before and then he met me. I've never felt a connection this strong with anyone before. There is off the charts chemistry and we work so well together. We are so very different from each other in so many ways, but those differences only seem to make us both become better versions of ourselves. He absolutely fascinates me. The way he lives his life, the way he interacts with the world is so different than me that it draws me in. I don't know how to explain it, but upon reading about ENFP-INTJ pairs it is sort of starting to make sense.

So I am madly in love with this man. And from everything I've ever known of love, he's madly in love with me. But he can't say it. He says he doesn't know what love is. He has a hard time even saying it to his parents. And we've talked about what we both think it means to love someone and he typically ends up with he just doesn't know. I know this sounds arrogant, but I know he loves me. I can feel it.

Can some INTJs chime in and let me know what love is like for them? Is it something you feel easily? Or can even feel at all? Is it hard for you to come to that place? Why?

One of my best friends growing up is an INTJ, and he came to college with me. We became friends with a third INTJ through a club and shared interests in science and music. Early this year, I started dating an INTJ in one of my physics classes. Her roommate is dating an INTJ as well. 

Our group is typically eight people (four couples), give or take a few others. So, with five of us being INTJs (curiously all four males are INTJ), we're quite overrepresented, but I love the social dynamic. The level of interaction is fairly balanced, because the other friends are all extroverts. Even at a laid-back get-together, our conversational topics get deep quickly because 5/8 of us have little use or aptitude for small talk. The INTJs are all science students. I study physics, my SO studies astrophysics, and the other three INTJs study chemistry, computer science, and psychology. We're also all redditors, and 4/5 of us are atheists (I think I'm the only theist in the whole group, actually). Meanwhile the extraverts study writing, history, anthropology, etc. But, none of us isolate ourselves within a field, so discussions range from black holes to feminism. It's really amazing, because everyone has something to offer. 

There are downsides, however. Sometimes the INTJs are overbearing if the conversation turns into a debate. Occasionally there will be ""drama"" of sorts which the four INTJ males and my SO aren't equipped to handle because it just seems really petty (and at the end of the day, we're all SAPs anyway).

I'm an 18 year old male from Brisbane, Australia and events in my life of late have not been particularly happy for me. After graduating from High School, where I was a lively part of the social scene. I've always been able to tell what people find ""cool"" and I had (and still don't) have any trouble putting up a façade which makes me seem interesting to most people. Although, I found life in the school yard somewhat rudimentary, I was interested in far different things. 

After graduation however, social interactions became ever more boring and tiring for me. It seemed to be the same thing over and over again, drink -&gt; talk shit -&gt; wake up, rinse and repeat. I was the only one feeling this way though, my friends seemed completely happy continuing their seemingly meaningless and unfulfilled lives. I was far more interested in how societal structures work, politics and researching mathematics and physics. Whenever I brought up topics that I found insightful and inspiring I could tell that my friends were feigning interest. I couldn't handle the repetitiveness of their lifestyle and I became more secluded and introspective. 

I slowly lost contact with most of my high school friends, catching up briefly here and there over a year or so. In this time I grew much closer to my girlfriend who I was able to hold conversations with, she inspired me and I was completely happy to talk to her about anything that I found interesting, even if she didn't understand it entirely. As we grew closer we spent almost every day together, never tiring of each other's company for a second. She began to crave more and more social attention, which I was finding hard to keep up with as I had become very introverted by this stage. She wanted to take a break from seeing each other, stating that she wanted to things to be more like how they were in the beginning, and that we need to work on a more developed social life.

And that brings us to now, I've just stumbled across this subreddit and am in awe of how extremely similar our thought processes are.

Because I don't.

I try to wear clothes and shoes and get haircuts that look just good enough that nobody will mention them.

EDIT: I'm loving all these responses and seeing a lot of familiar answers.  If I can take the liberty of generalizing what may be sort of the evolution of INTJ style:

* Phase one: If it were just us by ourselves, we would not care at all how we looked, and prioritize comfort, utility, and durability in our clothes, hair etc.  

* Phase two: We understand that we need to shave and get a haircut from time to time, and maybe wear something besides that old sweatshirt and cargo pants (so useful!) or people won't take us seriously.  We develop a safe wardrobe of subdued style, camouflage to go unnoticed in public.

* Phase three: After careful study we learn to adopt a style that will have a desired effect on others.  Dressed to impress, maybe even more formal than an occasion calls for, but always erring on the side of elegance, rather than being gaudy.  Also most of us during this phase are acutely aware that this is a costume, used to boost our confidence and manipulate people's perceptions, that doesn't feel like the real ""us""",,False,,t5_2qowo,True,,,True,t3_rvybi,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/rvybi/do_you_have_style/,

You never bare grudges. [Like basketballs.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCt-HUn0AAU)

""I like your shirt, it's a cool shirt"").

While a lot of people argue about the existence of god, the purpose of life and other questions of that nature that are difficult to answer and discuss, I feel most people commonly agree that the primary goal of life is to look for and attain happiness.

I've always more or less taken this approach towards life without deeply questioning its premise as it always seemed almost self-evident. Throughout my (relatively short, 23/M) life so far, I've striven more or less to put myself in positions that either make me happy, or position myself to be happy in the future. Currently, I have a great job that I love, I have hobbies that I pursue regularly, I have a trusted group of friends, I'm going to grad school part-time, etc. I feel like I have less things to strive for in life as things sort of level out, and I feel that on some levels that I've ""made it"". 

I understand that there are a whole slew of challenges that I'll face in the future, but recently I've been thinking about the idea of what's really important in life: happiness, or meaning? At my current position in life, I feel like I've met all the necessities of fundamental happiness such as food, shelter, social interaction, etc. Being in this position has also made me realize that the same things that used to make me happy before don't anymore. For example, something trivial like buying a gadget doesn't give me the same kind of joy or thrill that it used to.

I realize that I now value meaning in life a lot more than I value ""happiness"". Seeking meaning may require sacrificing or not being ""happy"" in the short term to make a contribution or impact that is felt throughout the world. For me, an example of finding meaning in life would be working hard to create a solo musical project on the side. While I love making music, it's still a difficult undertaking, and requires dedication and sticking to it even when I'd rather be more momentarily ""happy"" by zoning out and watching more Scrubs on Netflix. I think in the end, meaning is what gives that deep seated happiness that stays with you permanently and shapes who you are.

I'm sorry if this was blindingly obvious to all of you, but I thought it could be interesting to discuss.

My girlfriend broke up with me yesterday and told me she still loved me and wants to be friends. All the stuff you normally hear in breakups.  The main reason of the split she said was that our personalities didn't work together (she is an entp). I told her I thought we worked great together and I asked her why she thought that and she said that she wanted to live from city to city when we were older and I didn't (we're in college and 20yrs old). I found this to be a bullshit excuse of a reason to end a 2 year completely committed relationship from day one. Especially since I told her I would be willing to travel if our future jobs took us to different places. So I took the break up from her as I'm tired of our relationship and I want something different and me taking it this way really hurt.

I'm always completely able to judge myself and my behavior.
I never step about any kind of boundaries I wouldn't cross when sober.
I never become aggressive, walk around screaming, or anything the like.

basically I find it amazing how many... lies most people maintain in their lives to avoid hurting other peoples feelings. Especially if it is something really minor that wouldn't even directly effect another person. 

example: I wouldn't waste the money on a pet to have it euthanized or like treated to a day of amazing-ness before it is put down. I would just take care of it myself. I tried to avoid the topic but they (ppl i work with) eventually put me in a position where i would have to either lie and say that i would do these things, or tell the truth and say i would take care of it myself.

Every time a person creates a new lie like this they have to maintain it... sometimes for years. All to avoid offending/hurting someones feelings. Over the years there would be so many of these lies that the little lies they tell would eventually control them.

My visual of this is having a puppeteer continually adding strings in all directions. Eventually he becomes limited and eventually controlled by the pull of those strings.
a good visual representation is the scene in the new wolverine movie (spoiler) where he is shot with a crap-ton of arrows with rope. at first its no big deal but eventually he just can't take it and is controlled",,False,,t5_2qowo,False,,,True,t3_1jhkwy,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1jhkwy/how_the_puppeteer_becomes_the_puppet/,

I started asking girls out (guy here) as a freshman in high school and continued to do so half way through college. They all plain out said no, no half-hearted excuses such as ""I have to wash my hair"" et al. They just said no.

After 10 years of nothing but rejections, I started asking myself ""how many times does a guy have to hear no before he gives up?"" For the next two years I continued to ask but no change. When I realized the question changed to ""how many years of no's..."" I stepped back and analyzed the situation like all good Rationals do.

Every guy...EVERYONE, I knew had had a date by the time they made it to college, some were ""worse guys"" than me (or so I had been told). So, I had to come to the conclusion that women just don't find me attractive. The few women that I stupidly asked why they wouldn't go out with me gave some clues. My INTJ-ness was a turn-off. I ""thought too much, read too much, hardly ever talked, and when I did talk I use those big words no one else knows to talk about stuff no one understands or even cares about"" sums up what was ""wrong"" with me.
This realization lead to a dark time in my life, but I threw myself into my studies of...well, everything and after about 6 months just accepted that women don't find me attractive.

About a year after that I got interested in personality typing and came across MBTI and found out that I tested INTJ and what that supposedly means. [Note: I don't agree with MBTI in everything it says, it's just the first system that made sense to me and I usually think along its lines] Not knowing any other INTJs, or NTs for that matter, in real life I assumed male INTJs just weren't desirable.

Nine years later, I found Reddit and this sub-reddit and see that quite a few male NTs have girlfriends/wives. I had to wonder if my conclusion was wrong. In the last 2 years, I think their might be two women who have shown interest in me, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm seeing this interest just because I *want* it to be there, not because it *is* there, just like I did back in high school and college. Being alone for the rest of my life is starting to bug me a little, I'm fine if it happens but rather it didn't.

How do other INTJs un-convince yourself of a conclusion that you yourself have made and has at least 12 years of evidence supporting it?

TL;DR How do other INTJs un-convince them self of a conclusion of a primal nature that they have thought about and made with ample evidence?

1372191391.0,23,self.intj,1h26bm,I don't know what the F I am,31,8,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1h26bm/i_dont_know_what_the_f_i_am/,"I test consistently with INTJ; after 3 days of reading post after post that what matters are your functions, I am left more confused, because I frankly can't appreciate meaningful differences between introverted intuition and introverted thinking; it's not clear how you can tell which is your primary, secondary, etc.  Frankly, it all smells like bullshit to me, so I am hoping someone can convince me otherwise.

I did an Enneagram and got Type 3, and that rang more true than anything I read in the MTB1 stuff.  

In short: I care about work and only my work.  I evaluate people only by how good they are at their work.  The purpose of fun is to recharge you to do your work better than you would without it.  Despite this viewpoint, I am extremely comfortable at social gatherings.  I read people very quickly, know what to say to them (what they want to hear), and use these events to make generate social capital.  This has always been true; the only thing that changed as I got older is that I got better at being perceived as a sexual mate instead of just a friend.   I took me about the age of 22 to figure that out (27 now), and I have nothing but sheer contempt for guys my age that still bitch about it because it frankly wasn't that hard to figure out, and I detest whiny people. 
  I am asked to come out with friends frequently, and don't like to make too many appearances because then my attendance is not considered special.  

You're probably reading this and thinking I'm a douche.  That's fine; I readily acknowledge that I have an overblown ego.  What you might not appreciate is that if you  knew me in person, you would invariably think I'm a really great guy who understands you (because I would). As you can imagine from reading this, I really don't give a flying fuck about most people.  If you're in my inner circle, I will happily die for you, but that's 2-3 people at a time, and just because you enjoyed that status once doesn't mean you enjoy it now.  That I sincerely love someone for a brief period of time (a year at most), and then leave without a regret is what I believe makes me somewhat weird.  I believe this ties in my early childhood of moving around a lot because my father was in the Army.  I really do care for people for a short period of time, and then when I stop caring, move on to a new group of friends while maintaining loose contact with old friends.   Most people have told me that they feel very comfortable around me, and that has always been true. 

I am most comfortable around strangers that I can talk to about their personal life.  I like knowing why people made the choices they made, what they regret, etc.  I clearly get off on the idea that I somehow have this super-power to get people to tell me their shit without actually becoming emotionally attached to them.  I hate concerts or going to bars because it's generally loud and I am not able to get these stories out of people. 

My moods are extremely high when I'm feeling competent at my work, and extremely low when I'm not.  When I'm feeling high because I have accomplished something at work, I like hanging out with my friends, and am quite extroverted, though to be honest, I would rather be hanging out with strangers. When I'm  feeling shitty, I don't want to talk to anyone, and during one particularly rough time, I went a full year without hanging out with anyone except my significant other.     

I am athletic and good-looking (and clearly vain)  I think what matters about a person are their ideas, beliefs, experiences, but I can't ignore that so much of the world is affected by completely arbitrary bullshit like how tall you are and what clothes you wear.  Consequently, I made sure to become extremely fit and extremely polished.  I am superficial not because I want to be, but because that's how you get ahead in the world; and I am not so presumptuous to think that the world should operate on the terms that I think are important. 

I have many to-do lists and those kinds of things, but only because I fear I would get nothing done without them.  I would meander and get distracted otherwise.  This is a recent development.  I did not always use to-do lists, and now I wonder how the fuck I ever got anything done.  For those who struggle with getting shit done, I suggest habitrpg and workflowy.  These two things have changed my life. 

  I get very angry with myself when I procrastinate (as I am doing now) or don't do things extremely well.  I often get depressed with how I sabotage myself, either by taking too long or waiting to the last minute because I can't get it to be good enough, and need an externally imposed deadline to make me turn it in.  I got a 1430/1600 on my SAT, 34 on my MCAT, and while good, I have always been disappointed that they weren't higher.  I fantasize constantly about a day when I have enough time to study on the side and retake them because I am not happy with those scores.  I know; it's weird. 

I like science fiction and books like Freakonomics. Dune is my favorite Science fiction book.  East of Eden is the most beautiful book I have read, and I can't put into words why I like it so much.  My favorite movie is Cinderella Man, because I like the idea of a man not just fighting for himself, but fighting to keep other's hopes alive. 

I grew up in a very religious environment in Georgia, and consequently have an extremely high distrust when someone tells me that I should be living for other people.  I am slowly coming back to the idea of spirituality, but it's mostly been because of weird shit like the delayed observer effect being consistent with the idea of destiny or causality being in the future (ideas that have been present in mythology/religion since forever). Rejecting Christianity also meant that I became much more ""morally gray"" as I got older, since I associate ""black-and-white"" morality with evil institutions. 

And I'm done.  I know some of this was toolish and kinda weird to state directly, but a lot of you have a much stronger understanding of Jung's theory, so I figured if I wanted any kind of meaningful input, I had to be pretty honest. I've also posted some argumentative type responses in other threads so you could see how I argue/think to see if that would be helpful.

(Enjoying life, the little things, socializing, staying organized: these are all learned skills that do not come naturally to us. All the same, with intelligence you can learn anything quickly and easily. At least I can.)

A Self-Analysis,28,4,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1c3crq/intj_these_are_some_personal_traits_that_i_find/,"**My ideal form of communication is direct, open, and unfiltered with the allowance to correct previous statements without second-guessing of intent. I find it difficult to word how I feel or think about things correctly the first, second, and even third time I try to say it.**


•	Most people are better at formulating their ideas and opinions into words and are better able to recognize the multiple ways such a statement could be taken. As such, a failure by myself to correctly say something right the first time can result in an accusation of “Well, then why did you say it that way the first time?” and an accusation of hidden or subconscious intent. Because of this, when someone asks me a question, I can be more worried about why they asked the question and all of the possible ways I could answer the question incorrectly. I do this because when I say the first thing that comes to mind, I usually offend.

**I have no standard of perfection on others or myself. I assume that we are all faulty in one way or another and that we are all failures in one sense or another. As such I do not fear failure, and criticism is not hurtful but rather merely a statement of observation. I prefer this because I can then develop in areas of my weaknesses without guilt or shame, and depend on others where I find myself weak and lacking.**


•	I often fail to realize that others do not see the world from this paradigm. I think that many believe that perfection is expected. Therefore they cope with their own failures by not looking at them, by believing they are not there, or that they are not important. Criticism and failure will be especially dangerous to these paradigms for they recognize failures as an indicator of a lack of intrinsic worth.


•	This is not to say that I will not have emotional turmoil if a new fault or failure is revealed to me that I previously was not aware of. Such a reaction is expected. However, I greatly value this sort of self-understanding and have a deep desire to know of each of my faults intimately without putting a standard of perfection on myself.

**My personal decisions are often based off of critical judgment, information, and a logical assessment of the pros and cons.**


•	I recognize that many people make their decision off of their “gut feeling”. This is very valuable for those whose perceptions are correct, but can be frustrating to me in situations where they make poor decisions based off of misguided emotions.


•	I recognize that others often will not be receptive to my opinions/judgments if I merely give the reasons for them. This can be hurtful to me, therefore I realize that I must express how something “feels right” or how I would “feel bad” if certain circumstances came about. 


**I wish to approach everyone in personal relationships as equals. I prefer an open forum of opinions where multiple desires can be expressed and then accepted or rejected without the loss of friendship.**


•	I have noticed that this can strain my relationships with others because many people want to be either a leader or a follower (either wanting to tell me what to do or wanting for me to tell them what to do). I am generally not willing to do either in a personal relationship setting. 


•	This can result in me expressing opinions that others view as critical and hurtful, not realizing that I am pointing out faults or failures because of the fact that I view them as an equal.


•	This paradigm may be faulty as everyone is, in fact, different. I have noticed that when I do try to treat others as equals they often react with anger, hostility, or sadness. I am resistant to change this paradigm however, for when I try to shift from it I tend to view others as inferior, censor my true viewpoints around them, keep relationships shallow, and desire to not rely on others for anything that really matters. This allows me to have more ‘friends’, but causes loneliness.


**If confronted with a request for emotional input on the spot, I typically am only able to respond with very basic emotions before I have time to process the landscape of events as a whole. I am a deeply emotional person, but it takes a high amount of stress for those emotions to involuntarily show themselves and it takes a high amount of energy to try to understand how I feel about something and to accurately express it in a way that others will understand and be receptive to.**


•	This leads to many misunderstandings with people for if I feel comfortable with someone or trust them to assume what my heart really is, I will save my energy and often be less expressive around them. However, very few actually do make such an assumption(which is understandable) and I mistakenly cause them to believe they are not important to me. They will see my emotional state as being “cold” and “sterile”. I appreciate when people ask me how I feel about something and then give me a few days before I give my answer.


**I often prefer to be independent, however I realize that no matter how much I may desire to be self-sufficient, I cannot psychologically function well without a level of interpersonal dependence and interaction. Concerning interdependence, this is one instance where I tend to have a higher standard of others and will tend to only desire interdependence with those that I can expect to reliably give me the benefit of the doubt concerning my intentions. It should be noted that I do not equate interdependence with love, care, preference, or friendship. Rather I see it as having someone who I can go to who is a shelter for my own emotional state when I am in turmoil. Concerning interaction, I recognize that all individuals have different strengths and weaknesses and those that are different than me will have strengths where I would otherwise fail. I need these individuals as friends and brothers, and I am comfortable relying on these individuals in situations where I might otherwise be lacking. On a lighter interactional level, I realize that a number of relationships are necessary that are considered to be more “shallow”. These relationships connect me to and help me see the big picture of the outside world, increase my desire to care for others, and help me find those individuals that will care for me deeply.**


**I treasure individualism greatly. I want to be accepting of everyone’s differences and I want others to be accepting of mine. I want everyone to give each other the benefit of the doubt until negative intent is directly expressed. In a sense, I even enjoy being different from myself, and I resist whenever someone comes to a conclusion that in a specific situation I will always act a certain way.**


•	I have sometimes offended others because when they tried to state that, “oh, so you like things this way don’t you?” or “you did it this way last time, why are you different this time?” I have responded bluntly with “no” or “because this is just how I feel right now”, respectively. Others seem to assume some hidden intent behind my change in actions that isn’t present. I sometimes become stressed trying to be consistent around others who might look for said hidden intent, trying to remember what it was that I did last time. Though I prefer not to, if others want to put me in a box it is sometimes necessary to sit in that box for a time until they come to be able to give me the benefit of a doubt.

1364698782.0,22,self.intj,1bc7qr,Function is beautiful! [Graphic Designer],25,3,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1bc7qr/function_is_beautiful_graphic_designer/,"I have been analyzing myself for years. I want to know how I work. I want to know myself inside and out on a deeper level; so I've been taking a look at the way that I do things to try and realize things about myself that I didn't really know before. 

Here's my latest discovery: 

I can not, for the life of me, make unnecessary things. That is, I can not make something if that thing is unnecessary, superfluous, extraneous, etc.

How I came to this discovery: 

I am a graphic designer and as I am graduating soon I need to make a self promotional piece. I had an idea to make it look like a classical map. I loved the looks of designs with floral patterning and border molding and the colors and the textures and all of the loveliness.

Cue myself trying to replicate it, and I couldn't. I tried to make a floral patterning and I couldn't. The borders, the textures, I couldn't get it to come out (and I tried. For hours. HOURS). I complained to a peer something along the lines of, ""I can't do this! I have never done ANYTHING like this before, and it's so difficult!"" 

And she said: ""Then... if it's not your style, why are you trying to force it?"" 

It made a lot of sense. I have always been the kind of person to try different styles and different approaches, but it made me realize that the reason I couldn't do this particular style was because the moldings, patterns, textures, etc., though BEAUTIFUL, were superfluous. The only reason they are there is to look nice. There is no function. There is no NEED for them to be there, so I could not do it.

This isn't to say that everything I make is boring or unexciting. It's just that everything I do, everything I put into a design has such a specific purpose that even the attractive things have a very important purpose. Everything is functionally beautiful, and beautifully functional.

--- 

That turned out a little longer than I expected it to. I just wanted to share that with people who are more likely to have a mathematical thought process. I'm not sure what kind of responses I'm expecting (similar experiences, etc.) but I'll leave this here for your consideration, anyways.

We are creatures of logic. We prefer to believe in what we see, rather than what some vaunted church official tells us is the Absolute Truth. 

Myself, I was raised to be Christian. My mother spent my childhood ascribing to the worst parody of the Christian faith, that infamous network of money-hungry televangelists known as TBN. And though I always hated TBN, I admittedly believed in that aloof Father-figure On High. Later, I came to realize that my ""faith"" was not ""religious faith"" in the context of the typical American Bible-thumpers; rather, it was my hope for something beyond this life intermingled with my natural enthusiasm for philosophy in general.

This led me to differentiate between ""religion"" and ""faith."" To me, ""religion"" was the flawed, human answer to the divine. It was a system of categorization that created more problems than it solved. Meanwhile, ""faith"" was simply my spirituality in its most general sense. It was my way of worship to a god, who I was taught to refer to as THE GOD and the father of Jesus. Furthermore, I decided that each individual's faith (or lack of faith) was his/her own; and, accordingly, that I had no authority to render any kind of judgement on anyone.

Now, as an adult, my faith has become even more diluted. In my mind, my ""faith"" has turned into a ""philosophy"" that I am supportive of in only the most general sense; and I find myself trying to resist what I see as a degradation into total faithlessness. Logically, this is gradual loss is because I recognize that the world cannot be justified by the mythology of the ONE TRUE GOD I was raised to believe in. This explanation satisfies me. But, for whatever reason, I find myself like a child who is unwilling to dispense with his/her ""blankee,"" so to speak.

And so the mental game of semantics continues...

I was simply curious as to what any or all of you thought about such things as religion, faith, and philosophy. Have any of you played word games with yourself as I continue to do? Do you think my approach is childish? Do any of you wish to submit your own spiritual journey (or lack thereof)?

I lurk around gleaning wisdom from more self-aware INTJ's about how they deal with certain social circumstances. By and large, I've always been able to find answers for my questions by approaching things that way, however, I've felt it was necessary to come out of hiding for this particular unfamiliarity. That said, hopefully my request isn't something that's too mundane or annoying. And if it is, my apologies.

So, to begin, I've always struggled with relationships. Not sure why, things just never seem to work out for one reason or another. Could be residual childhood problems, or it could just be a lack of social sensitivity. I don't really know. Currently I'm single, in graduate school, and not really seeking a relationship. For a plethora of reasons. Most are out of fear that it'll just be another waste of my time, and that I'll get too involved. Which, could distract me from my education. The difficult part is that I often wish I could be in a healthy relationship with someone who really *wants* to support and help me in the same capacity as I do them. This often leads to misinterpreting my interactions with the opposite gender, or, not picking up on when someone is actually trying to flirt at all. Suffice it to say, I don't at all know how to read the situation correctly when it comes to women. As an added measure of difficulty, social media has made it even harder to discern when a girl is just being nice versus actually flirting.

In addition to the above, I tend to have a lack of confidence around women because I'm not linguistically suave. That is to say, I think too much when speaking and it often makes it hard to hold good fluid conversation. Which, I've gathered is important in the wooing process. The sad part is, I know I have a lot going for me I just lack the ability (or perhaps the will) to flaunt it.

This brings me to my current quandary. I'm in my brother's wedding this summer and their photographer, lets say, for the sake of reservedness: that she's absolutely my type. What I know about her is mostly from what my brother and his fiancee have told me. The important item being that she's single. She has many of the same interests as I do, but it seems like she's definitely an extrovert. We've had some interaction over facebook, but nothing of substance. I'm mostly just trying to make sure I stay on the radar but not so much so that it seems weird or overbearing. I don't want to be some weird facebook creep. 

Now with all that laid out, I'm wondering (read: hoping), can you INTJ sages help me develop some tactics to make a good run at winning this lady over? I need help in not being a facebook creep, I think, as a first priority. Considering that if I reach that status, my chances will likely be zero come the day of the wedding when I actually get to meet her. Then, perhaps some suggestions on how to play to my strengths as an INTJ in social situations where flirting may be involved? I'm not exactly sure what to ask for in that regard I guess. Hopefully some of you can make sense of this poorly drafted plea.

**EDIT:**
Can I just say that I am deeply grateful for each of you? I was only expecting a couple of responses as I didn't think anyone would consider my request all that important. I want to respond to each of you in order to further the conversation and hopefully glean a little more insight. I will say that, by and large, many of you have confirmed assumptions and/or notions I already thought were the case. So, it's awesome that you've been such a helpful sounding board on this issue.

* I am American in my 20s.

* I am basically first gen in college in my family. My mother went to college but that was to be a nurse so she didn't go full scale uni or anything. 

* I dropped out of hs because it was just a joke. I got my GED and ""graduated"" only a 1-2 years after my original class.

* I *DO love to learn CONSTANTLY typically on my own though.  I just watched a documentary on the rules of  ancient Celtic jousting for goodness sake.

* I am currently at a community college and I'm not sure if it's me being lazy, crappy teaching or just the INTJ but I am not enjoying it. I have a 3. something GPA but still I am not sure how long I can float above water here at this rate.

For me it just seems like college is not what I expected in terms of work. I often get professors that I don't feel like they really *teach* me anything, it's all copy and paste IRL basically. We get the books, professors *gives* us notes, we study/memorize notes, fill in blanks on test. 

The atmosphere is never as *serious* as I imagine either. Some of our worksheets are printouts from workbooks just like in grade school for example.  I don't feel like I'm learning anything new in college, just memorization that I quickly forget.

Should I be going into this as a ""it's not the destination but the journey"" kind of thing? I think my problem has to do with my INTJ ways. I can work if I am given directions, the source of work and material. I can not work as comfortable when the professors deviates and things get murky, like I have to rely on others for group assignments or if answers are NOT in the sources we are provided with. 

I am told this means I am lazy so I figured I'd ask my INTJ brethren if this does indeed all read lazy to you or INTJ symptoms? What are some good things to do? My school has a shitty student educational department.. I just feel like no one is taking school seriously maybe it is because it is a community college? I feel like in life everyone just *knows* how to do these subjects and I'm honestly the only one in these classes uneducated and unable to ""know"" how to do something just because the professor puts up 3 examples.

**tldr**: [is this typical in your college experience](http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/im-not-going-to-teach-this-youll-learn-it-next-year.jpg) and how do you deal with unorganized directions/professors?

**edit** also I just talked to my family about this and they told me in (my city) the community colleges are in transition and are being bought up to actually compete with universities.  They said at one point ccs used to help transition from grade school to a uni but now they just rather compete directly.

This, I would imagine, would place many INTJs into exclusive, long-term relationships. The stability is nice, and it's often rare to find someone who we connect with, so why jeopardize that?

Many other MBTI types are very good at quickly and easily connecting with people, and desire to connect with as many people as possible. It is those types who tend to seek out casual dating more than us.

I do not know what kind of person I am, and I feel rather shitty about looking for sex in a relationship.

Not only do people seem not to care about anything else besides their social life, it makes me feel like a creep when I offer a bit of input which displays my skills of observation (as I assume many INTJs do, I nitpick every social interaction/relationship to an insane degree), like I've been paying a little too much attention.

Anyway, a little background:  Here's a [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/nmenr/im_not_sure_if_im_depressed/) by me that kind of explains my situation.  

A little more detail:  

I've read that INTJs are intrinsically motivated, but over the past year or so I have found it harder and harder to get my school work done.  I'm a 3rd year student in the pure sciences and I love my major, I really do.  But, even though I know how important good grades are, I just can hardly bring myself to do my work sometimes.  And when I do, it's often half-assed or straight-up copied.  I feel like I have little to no intrinsic motivation to do my schoolwork.  And the same goes for the one major hobby I concentrate on too:  I just can't motivate myself to work on it.

I don't want to talk to my friends about this for various reasons.  I was kind of hoping that thoughts and opinions of other INTJs may do me some good.

The feeling function is based more on *values* rather than *emotions*.  For example, if conclusion X contradicts a belief, ideology, or tradition that a person values very highly, then a person with a dominant F function is more likely to reject the conclusion.  Regardless of the logic or reasoning that led to conclusion X.  Because it contradicts something that is highly valued, it is rejected.  

On the other hand, someone with a more dominant T function is more inclined to accept the conclusion based on the logic behind it.  Even if it goes against something that they value highly.  That doesn't mean that a person with a more dominant T doesn't value anything or has weaker values. It just means that they are more likely to accept the logic and let go of that which they value because it's not supported.  Letting go of those values in favor of reason can still be painful to someone with a dominant T. 

A lot times, these values equate to emotions, but not always. An example of where value may not necessarily mean emotion can be found certain religions.  For example, many  monks will deprive themselves of ""earthly pleasures"".  The earthly pleasures will bring them just as much happiness and emotional satisfaction as anyone else.  But the value they place on rejecting those pleasures and what it signifies to them is much higher than the emotional satisfaction that they would get in indulging those emotions.    They are rejecting the *emotional* in favor of something that is highly valued and still not necessarily logical.

So I've known this INTJ  guy for four years, right? We're exactly the same as far as being stubborn, arrogant, abrasive, heartless, apathetic, and incredibly attractive goes. But we both have opposite opinions about everything. Politics, religion, philosophy, all that jazz, we cannot agree on anything.

But regardless of how much we argue, we're always there for each other. If someone gangs up on either one, the other one is there in a heartbeat to defend the other, even if we agree with the other party. Why? I dunno. I guess we're hopelessly loyal to each other.

We've both been through our fair share of trials in life. No matter what happened, and no matter how many people abandoned us, we were there for each other. 

But there's a catch: we're not very close. We're not vulnerable with each other. When I say ""we're there for each other,"" I mean we sit next to each other in silence and just think. I mean, to the rest of the world, that sounds dumb! But I know for me, whenever I get in a bad mood, I don't want to talk. I want to sit in silence. But I don't want to sit in silence alone. I want someone sitting next to me. Just hearing someone else breathing is comforting when I have one of those ""I hate everything and everything hates me so I'm going to go plan world domination by myself in a dark room with an angry look on my face"" phases is comforting.

But oh well. Enough of that. Life continues. uhg

Over the past few months I've been slowly developing feelings for him. And. it. freaking. sucks. He's a flirt, right? So in public situations, unless one of us is being ganged up on, we completely ignore each other. Which was okay for three and a half years with me! But now that I'm like, ""you treat me like crap in public but are so logical and far from perfect in every way but think you're perfect which makes me think you're perfect and ohmygosh I just want to be with you for the rest of my life"" with him, I'm kind of hurt.

I wouldn't mind if he gave me attention sometime in public and acknowledged me.

Now that I think about it, we're really not friends. We're just a mini-INTJ support group when things go wrong.

I don't know. You know when you feel for someone but know that nothing could ever happen but don't care because you're just so caught up in how you feel and you have no idea how to rationalize anything and then complain on reddit in run-on sentences? Yup. I'm in one of those moods.

Anyways. That's my rant. This sucks. So I'm going to go sit in a dark room and try to think this through. Alone. Because that one friend is on the other side of the state visiting his dying mother.

There may be a lack of coherence to the following points since they are just some thoughts I've had for awhile. One theme is about conveying genuineness and being accurate.

-Strongly feeling/vehement support for things that you like/dislike, morals, ideas, etc. Typically, I do not (or try not to) become so fixated upon certain things, and have a ""mild inclination"" towards supporting or disliking it. This also makes me uncomfortable with forms of snobbery or elitism that arises in pretty much anything, since some people have such a strong set of beliefs that leads to some form of exclusivity. For example, I am cautious in saying what music I'm interested in since it is possible that the other person may subtly be condescending to what I have interest in. It is kind of paradoxical, because if I only had some mild inclination towards something, then it shouldn't be an issue if the other person puts it down or not.

-""I don't know"". Particularly, on multiple accounts, when someone has asked me about what I think about something or want some description/verification of something, I respond ""I don't know"" since I feel that I cannot adequately and accurately respond to the inquiry. As a result, the other person sometimes says ""How could you not know?"" So are people generally supposed to be able to articulate something that they are ""supposed"" to be familiar with?

-Feeling fake. I find it difficult to express emotions since I do not want to convey that I am feeling one way when I'm really not. Particularly, it is very difficult to show excitement or affection to someone since I feel that I would be exaggerating enormously my feeling about the other person.
EDIT (Clarification from my response): 
&gt;I think it is more that if I am not completely invested in an emotion, then I do not want to convey/express more than I am actually feeling. This is what I interpret as feeling fake. I do not necessarily fake an emotion (feeling mad when expressing happiness). I think the uncertainty or complexity of emotions makes it difficult for me to ""decide"" on which one to express, and I think I irrationally worry how conveying one emotion at this moment in time will bite me back in the future (essentially I change my mind).

-Taking things for granted. It runs through my head sometimes that ""oh why am I doing X activity? I am subjecting myself to"" whatever idea that is discussed in, say, a philosophy class. Like for example, I understand the pragmatic social reasons for using facebook, but then it comes through my mind ""why am I subjecting myself to something that will violate privacy concerns or data-mining issues?"" and people get really hyped up and angry over these issues, and I feel that I am being too apathetic, but if I become more intense about the issue, then I will be a hypocrite since I am not following the ideas that I would argue for.

Talking to women is basically out of the question because I can't. I really cannot do it. I feel weak and irrelevant when I even think about trying. Why would anyone ever pick me? I do not know if this conundrum is what I would have to deal with my entire life, or that eventually I can accept being alone.

Something that I thought was an interesting test, post your results here and lets see if there are any patterns within INTJ's!



**Edit: Results!**

Love:

Average numbers (based off the 9 who gave numbers for all 5)

* 8.67 Physical Touch
* 9.2 Quality Time
* 5.56 Words of Affirmation
* 5 Acts of Service
* 1.56 Receiving Gifts

It seems like most of us scored high on quality time and physical touch on average, and I counted up 14 first- or second-highest on Physical Touch, and 19 for Quality Time.

Apology:

Average numbers (based off of the 7 who gave numbers for all 5)

* 5.29 Accept Responsibility
* 3.86 Make Restitution
* 4.71 Genuinely Repent
* 5.57 Expressing Regret
* 0.57 Request Forgiveness

I wasn't so sure about this test, I don't really like the idea of someone apologizing through a structured format, and it doesn't seem right that way. Of course, that's just my opinion.

Anyways, it seems like we're all fine with people if we can tell that they're truly apologetic and regretful about the situation and understand that they are responsible. It also seems like they should *not* go and ask for us to forgive them. Forgiveness is only earned when we decide, of course.

How would you describe yours?,28,9,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/13tu5t/intjs_and_their_sex_life_how_would_you_describe/,"I'm curious... There are a lot of dating questions in this sub but I haven't (recently) found any questions about sex or sexuality. How do most of you feel about your own?

I would say, for the most part, my dating/sex life is what keeps me single. Just recently I've become more comfortable in social settings and meeting people so I don't want to give up this new found skill so easily (hah, ""skill""). It's interesting to see how each person is different, whether we sleep together or not. Besides, I'd rather have my freedom to do what I want and come and go as I please than settle for someone who I'm not completely happy with- which I feel like SO many people that I know do. (You'd think that would seem obvious but a lot of my friends think it's strange I'm still single.)

I haven't actually slept with a lot of people compared to most others I know but I do tend to swing both ways. That usually seems to confuses most people and I don't think I'll ever understand that lack of open mindedness. I like apples and oranges. Usually I like oranges more but sometimes an apple sounds great too. Even then, both at the same time have happened- but it's better in theory than in practice... I've also surprised myself in my discovery of how much easier a one night stand is. No obligations, being able to go home and be completely alone, AND not take any calls after? Fucking amazing. I like my space and I like my lifestyle. It seems sort of masculine compared to most other girls that way but it is what it is. 

So... How do you view your sex life? Would you rather be dating someone or do you like having your freedom as well? What have you learned during any of your socializing or, as most of us INTJ's are familiar with, lack thereof? If it's not what you want it to be, how would you change it?
(Sorry for the rant and for any grammar/spelling errors. I typed this out pretty quick and kinda just word-vomited all over you, ha...)

**Edit1: TL;DR** Tell me about your sexuality, sex life (or lack thereof), preferences, and everything in between. 

**Edit2:** Well, damn. You guys have been awesome. I appreciate everyone being so open and honest about the topic. It really gave me a different perspective on my own development and INTJ's as a whole. I still feel like I connect a lot with these functions but I can tell I've made a lot of ground in the past few months on mimicking other people in social settings. Because really... I'm not any better than the rest of you at talking to people. I *still* can't find a balance between being myself without coming across as a snarky bitch or being a complete dumbass/ditz when I try to sugar coat my tone. However, it definitely seems that I'm progressing in my extroverted ways so I can only hope things keep getting better. And hopefully that gives a little hope for the rest of you as well! It is actually possible to teach an old dog new tricks, so to speak...

I rarely notice emotions, and I can just think without much distraction. I'm coming to realize now, though, that my emotions are there, whether I notice them or not. When I have a big emotional reaction to something, I usually attribute what's happening to some logical reason in the moment, and, only later, I realize ""wait, I was freaking out back there, that wasn't normal."" 

This situation happened to me recently, and I did something I know I wouldn't have done if I hadn't been so affected by my emotions at the time. Looking back, it's like I was drunk. I'm not trying to get rid of or stuff down my emotions, but I need to learn how to recognize and deal with them better *before* I start losing control. 

How do the rest of you thinkers process and deal with intense emotions?

**EDIT: For anybody who stumbles across this later, I'm going to list some of the best suggestions from the comments up here. Also, because I like making lists... Thanks for all the advice.**

* **Write honestly** in a journal about emotional or other significant experiences.
* **Talk to a trusted confidante**. Just talking it through with someone can help, even if they don't have advice for you. (Make sure you're available when that person needs you as well, so you're not just dumping on them).
* **Talk out loud to yourself** about it. This can be more helpful than just thinking about it. 
* **Practice controlling your emotions preemptively**. Geminii27's strategy is to enter into controlled situations that provoke an emotional reaction and practice 'snapping back to emotionlessness'. I'm sure individual INTJs (or other rational types) could come up with similar tactics that allow you a measure of control when emotions feel overwhelming.
* If you feel strongly about an issue or argument, just **use the emotion as jet fuel** and let the INTJ ""I'm right and here's why"" beast loose (in appropriate situations, of course).
* Or you could just **break things** ;)",,False,,t5_2qowo,1353955539.0,,,True,t3_13qvii,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/13qvii/how_do_you_process_emotion/,

When I am in a store and I see an object that nobody wants, I can't shake the feeling that it feels lonely and sad and it even feels like it's calling out for me to give it a home. Now, this did not just happen with stuffed animals, which most people would consider normal to have feelings for. It happens with tools, trash, food, plants, and even rocks. It's almost like there's a mental ""bond"" between me and the object. It feels like I can ""talk"" to them using my mind, and they would respond. Now I'm certain this happens to many people and it doesn't affect their lives much. But for me it's much worse. I'm starting to worry that I'm becoming a hoarder, because I can't stand throwing out old, un-useful items that other people would chuck in the trash without blinking.

How do other intjs feel about their sexuality? I'm coming tof terms with the fact I may not be the vanilla clone society wished me to be.

I've always been attracted to women, for as long as I can remember. But lately, I've found that I'm somewhat attracted to some men. Not in a sexual way as much as it would be an infatuation. 

I'm not ashamed of this, the reason I'm on a throwaway is more along the lines of how an artist doesn't reveal his work until its finished.

The second part of this is that I'm currently in a 2.5 year relationship with my current girlfriend. I'm really not that interested in sex, its strange. We'll be intimate every once in a while, but its much less than most other 21 year old men. I also don't have much 'pride' in what I do. My friends tell stories about their conquests with their respective girlfriends, bragging about how she couldn't walk straight and other cliché 'men' *things*. I have no urge to be that guy, nor can I relate to being put on airs for achieving this.

I don't feel I'm a bisexual, I just don't have a preference, nor a real urge to do anything sexual.

About 3 months ago things ended (very complicatedly) with a girl who was about as feeling and extroverted as anyone I've met (ENFJ, big underscore on the E and F).  She introduced me to Myers-Briggs.

Now, I feel completely awed by how empathetic she is, how interested she is in everyone she meets, how she makes people feel special, seems to know how people are feeling, how they want to be communicated with, and how strongly she creates bonds with people in a short amount of time.

I want that!  For a couple months after things ended, when I was feeling HORRIBLE (I still do sometimes, but not like before) I felt a very deep yearning to learn the social skills that she had, and I often felt like I was not ""clued in"" to some things that she was, because she would notice so much that I didn't, like who is flirting with who at a party, or what other people think about something.  

Even before I met her, I often have felt that I do not have a level of intimacy that I would like with the people around me.  Several of my best friends, people that I feel I am closest to in my life, say that they often feel I don't understand them, and don't take into account how they feel.

And today I read this in an INTJ description ""Unless their Feeling side is developed, they may have problems giving other people the level of intimacy that is needed.""

I know this is mainly talking about relationships, but I feel that others just don't think I get them.  I'm trying to get better at this... I read a book on listening, and another on body language, to try and understand these better.

But... I also need to learn to accept who I am.  The ENFJ girl... she has all kinds of problems from her ability to influence people emotionally so greatly, and she often doesn't know how to handle the strong emotions that come from other people.  

Can anyone help me out on how to perfect these intimacy problems?  And also, any help in learning to accept (but still strengthen) my weaknesses?

I mentioned World domination, and enough people agreed with me to make me want to go for it.    
    
 So, on to the question: What would be the best way to take over the world? This is a completely serious debate.    
    
My plan starts with the acquisition of a small company, preferably one dealing in standalone technology. Targeting the ideal populations (and not making the dumb decisions many businesses make), I would use the money to ""purchase"" a small, failing country. The country and corporation then become one, and the company expands into other technology related fields (the Constellation Project from Nasa would be expensive to implement, but would essentially provide a monopoly on the energy-market).    
    
Human Resources and R&amp;D would be given priority, as you need skill to advance. The pattern continues until I use this to (through a number of proxies) take control of another country. 

Around this time I would purchase a media outlet (news, specifically) of some sort. Using the power over the general population this would grant me, I would be able to repeat the process of taking over smaller, poorer countries.

Likelihood places these countries in either the Middle East, South America, or Africa (due to their instability). Ideally, countries in the Middle East would be acquired (the large oil reserves would lend additional resources). The process is repeated, again and again.

Using the power over the media, I would (again through proxies) sell out of the oil to buy out a second media outlet (still news). Effectively controlling both the left and the right of the media, I could force a [Xanatos Gamit](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit) in politics, ensuring that regardless of if people vote right or left, my puppets remain in power. With the power of the media at my control, anyone attempting to stop me at this point would be publicly branded as a fraud, a nut, a criminal- you get the idea.    
    
At this point, having taken over the United States and UK, I would proceed with the other major Nations of NATO. Japan and South Korea would be invited to join NATO (by yours truly, since I would control NATO) in exchange for guaranteed protection against *anything* North Korea would pull off (I might rile up the NK a little bit too, just to ensure that the Japanese and South Koreans are eager to get in NATO.)    
    
However, this is where things start to become difficult. Africa and South America would be easily enough fixed with enough humanitarian aid and lifestyle improvements, as well as legalization of the majority of drugs (and pretty much everything else. I can't stop it, so I may as well let them and maintain their respect for the law). However, China and Russia are both superpowers (Russia not so much anymore, but they're still formidable). Even with the might of the rest of the world at my disposal, neither country would ever submit voluntarily, and their governments are very closed loop (China), which would make it difficult to infiltrate via the media.    
    
At this point, I would begin consolidation of my power. Put every group to its most ideal task- Finland would run schools, etc. In order to gain power over China, I would ignore them completely. Focus on R&amp;D developments (grab a few asteroids to study, land a colony on Mars, develop a vaccine for cancer, you get the idea). The economic blockade would severely limit China's ability to function (we'd still give them food and such, but if I could get it out of any other country, the one coming out of China will be tariff-ed to hell. We wouldn't want them getting concerned now would we?)    
    
After a long enough period of time has passed, China will either be democratic (media takeover), outdated (military takeover, as would probably be necessary with a few others. However, China is an actual threat, and victory wouldn't be cheap), broken up into smaller countries (corporate takeover), or at the very least something I can use to terrify the people under my... persuasion, to keep them in fear and easily controlled.
    
Feel free to compare thoughts, ideas, complain, etc. This is meant to be a rough draft. Any actual application would have to be done differently due to the unpredictability of the real world.

For those of you who have read the Prince, this is where we will discuss the book! Here are a few topics of discussion:


* Machiavelli seems to place a lot of importance on making war. He even says that a prince should have no other thoughts or occupations except those of making war. Is this still relevant today? How relevant for the leader of your country of origin?

* If President Obama were a prince, members of congress barons and lords, and the people, well the people, what lessons do they embody, and which should they learn? (If you cite news articles please link them.)
* Machiavelli writes with great civility, yet encourages cruelty so casually. What is your opinion of him? Of the world he lived in? Of his worldview?

This not-problem is that I'm somewhat capable of erasing any emotional connection that I may have with people on demand.

My logical side is telling me that this is a problem, because of the inherent value placed in the individual, and the growth potential that both sides can get out of a relationship.

Please note that I am not restricting this to gender or type of emotional connection. I am not talking about or asking for what could be construed as ""love or relationship advice"" here, although in some aspects all of this could absolutely apply to such a situation.

If I greatly detest someone, I can instantly reverse my emotions towards them, typically given the appropriate circumstances (respect is earned, but note that I can work with just about anyone, even if I consider them inept beyond reason). Conversely, and this is where my logical side starts to take issue with myself, is that I can and sometimes do erase all emotional connection with people that I quite like and generally respect. 

Part of this is because, like many of you, I'm sure, maintaining real emotional connections with other people is incredibly draining. There are several people now that I would like to simply ""be a better friend to"" (as I do value their input and unique characteristics) but it is quite simply draining.

Part of this is because these other people don't entertain me on the needed levels. Not because they're stupid, but because the way that they operate and bond does not match that closely with me. I still see huge value in these people and know full well that I could better myself (and ideally, they could better themselves in turn -- symbiotic, not parasitic!) in multiple ways by getting to know them better.

No, no one has brought this up to me. But I've seen me do it, almost like watching the freight train just plow right through the car stuck on the tracks, but for some reason the car is just kinda chilling there going ""sup train, yeah I see you coming, whateves.""

I just simply stop trying, hit the erase button, and forget.

I didn't come across a similar thread through the search bar or reading the previous pages of this subreddit, so I thought I would ask.

It seems INTJ's in general have a bit of trouble with relationships. That having been said, have any of you been in a romantic relationship with another INTJ? What does the relationship dynamic resemble? Furthermore, how do you think dating would turn out between two INTJ's ? Akward, or to the point? 

On a related note, how do you think affection is best expressed between two INTJ's ? Having never experienced such a relationship myself, I am under a weak impression that the members of an INTJ - INTJ couple would be much more keen on expressing verbal/physical affection with each other than if they were in a relationship with people harbouring different personality types, given the inherent similarities in thought processes and better general understanding of such a person. On the other hand, I also imagine a contrasting relationship could take place - one with little everyday physical affection, with extremely independent members of the couple.

Of course, this is mostly unfounded speculation. I know of one other INTJ in my entourage, so my real-life sample size is miniscule. I have also yet to meet any female or Bi/Gay male INTJ's .

I would really appreciate advice, even though it is a long post.",27,8,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1da6kb/enfp_feeling_neglected_by_intj_best_friend_i/,"Throwaway here... Sorry for the long text. Again, I would really appreciate any advice. 

I am en enfp with an intj best friend [both 21]. We have never had problems before. Sometimes we get on each others nerves, but it's never anything big at all. For the past few weeks, however, I have been really hurt, and I don't know if/how/what I should tell her.

The story as I see it: 
I started dating someone when her and her bf of 9 mo had just broken up. Break ups are hard, so we spent a lot of time together. Even as she was starting to feel better, I tried really hard to include her in my life, either one-on-one or act like we were three friends if she and my bf (now ex) and I were hanging out. This is because 1) I like hanging out with her, and 2) I know keeping a best friend while having a boyfriend is something that should take a little effort. Granted, I spent *a lot* of time with my bf at the time, but I really tried to keep my friendship with her strong. It got to the point where my ex said he second to my best friend (but he was a huge jerk, so fuck'm!). 

Anyway, my bf and I break up, and my best friend had already started kind of seeing someone. My ex and I have been broken up for a few months now, and my best friend and her guy are now officially together. My problem is, I feel like she makes no time for me anymore. She never offers to hang out with just me. She only asks me to hang out with me and her bf. And when I do, I always feel super third-wheeled. I try to act like we are three friends, but she acts like it is her and her bf with an extra friend--instead of her and her boyfriend + her and her best friend all hanging out. Sorry, that's a little convoluted. She doesn't act like we're best friends anymore. I feel like now that she has a boyfriend, she doesn't need me. And in many ways, I guess she doesn't.

Furthermore, I have been going through a rough time in my life. I haven't talked to anyone about it, because I am picky with whom I share my feelings. I feel like she hasn't bothered to ask me about how I am feeling. I think my behavior has changed quite a bit, but I understand not everyone picks up on that, so I have tried to start the conversation, but she never seems interested. I feel like I need her as a friend right now, but since she doesn't need me, she can do more fun things with her time.

I am to blame, too, however. Since I have all these feelings, and I am so uncertain about how to approach the situation, I have pulled away from her. I don't act like her best friend either, anymore. Every time we interact at the house, she is always bubbling and talking so much, and I barely say anything back. I am a little jeal-y of how happy she is, when I am so unhappy. (I don't want to be unhappy *at all*, I just wish we were both happy!) I don't invite her places either. I am very much to blame. I wished she would at least reach out just a little bit. I feel like this is not a good path, however, because people are different and our friendship is more important than who reaches out to whom. So I decided I should talk to her about my feelings as the first step.  

I tried writing an email to her, but I felt like I was being an annoying boyfriend. I thought she would just get irritated with me. I really feel it is important for me to talk to her, though, because I will be graduating in a few weeks, and she will not (neither will her bf). I feel like our friendship is falling apart, which sometimes happens, but we have always had a fulfilling friendship. I can't accept that one little trip-up would lead to our falling out. That seems silly! Plus, I have never brought up these issues, so she doesn't know how I feel. I don't think she is doing these things on purpose. I just want to be able to talk to her about my feelings in a productive way. 

So how would you want your best friend to approach you on a matter like this? How should I approach this so I don't seem so clingy and emotional (basically enfp). 

Thank you so much. 

TL;DR: Feeling neglected by best friend who is intj, but not sure how to bring it up to her in a productive way instead of being an annoying enfp. 

Edit: Advice in terms of content (what would be productive to include, what not to bother) or wording would be helpful. It's not that I have never had a conflict I have needed to deal with. I do this stuff all the time, but I just want to make sure I do this right, because I really care about our friendship. 

Edit 2: I sent her an email. Thank you for insight into the INTJ brain. I think my email is a lot better now than when I first tried writing it, because of you all. Thanks again. Now that I have sent the email, I just have to wait and see. I will try not to take the response personally, because she probably really does care a lot about me, not like how I feel forgotten. 

Edit 3: She wrote a really nice, long email back! We ended up talking last night, and it was interesting cos some of what she said, I understood much better because of the things I read here. It was definitely helpful for me to see how different people are--I am so egocentric, if I have one logic, I stupidly assume everyone does. (I've really been trying to stop that!). She is a great friend, and I love her very much. I am so glad I got this opportunity to learn more about her.

Background: I am a 24 M USAF Officer, computer engineer.
I think in terms of strategic goals and value my day-to-day life; if I find myself not liking a single thing about my day, I change at my earliest conveniance. I make contracts with myself all the time.

My long-term strategic contract: sacrifice social circles for a career. back in high school, I recognized that my end goal of becoming an Air Force pilot will be exclusive of my social circle, but I recognized the need to develop my social skills. I made a plan which involved going to the Air force academy, sacrificing my social circles, and essntially becoming a cold, calculating individual steered by few values: do my job as an engineering student, cadet, and runner.

The Crisis: Fast forward to age 22, I fail Air force pilot training. My entire 'plan A' failed. on paper, it shouldn't have bothered me. I became an engineer because I enjoyed it and knew that it was a solid back up plan...any time my energies and efforts serve a singular purpose is a failure to plan in my mind. However, it didn't matter...the pain of losing a prize I fought so successfully for over 6 years being taken away from me had left me depressed and afraid of committment...

The soul-searching: rocking my foundations, I began questioning every energy and effort expelled and contemplated...was I working toward a goal I truly wanted?

The fall-out: Life ownership. I have always been a successful 'mastermind' and i have undervalued this gift. I have found it liberating. As I mindlessly grind away at my desk job, I am balancing grad school, moonlighting indie game developer, and tech consulting.

The advice? DO NOT SELL YOURSELF SHORT! the ability to assess situations and identify requirements is the foundation of INTJ strength in the business world (from my perspective). You know you have 4 years to develop yourself for industry when you become a college freshman, so identify what skills you need, your deficiencies, and resolve them in a low intensity format. You have public speaking fears? take up stand-up comedy and refine it to a science. You don't know what you want to do with your life? prioritize what you value and determine what is easier (money is easier to acquire than finding true love, apparently). roadmapping your life according to who you are, and not to the economy, is powerful, and masterminds are good at this. So many engineers I've met told me, ""I made my money early"" and it makes sense in hindsight...do you really know what you want at the ripe old age of 17? 

Before I rant more, I want to emphasize the core of my crisis...my plan A failed, and my contingencies helped me realign my life. ",,False,,t5_2qowo,False,,,True,t3_1d5nj2,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1d5nj2/existential_crisis_and_why_contingency_is/,

I've known about my MBTI personality type for a few years, but haven't really bothered exploring it as part of who I am like so many of you seem to have. I've taken several personality tests based off the MBTI and I always pop up INTJ.  I've even went back and changed some of my answers slightly if I felt torn about the questions; but I still always show up as INTJ.

One of the things I'm having difficulty with is accepting the introverted aspect of my personality.

I feel as though I really do have a strong desire for human interaction, but I seem to have a lot of difficulty with relationships.  I currently have no friends and &lt;maybe&gt; a couple of acquaintances....  When I do have friends, it's always a select few that are very close to me for a number of years, but then we typically just grow apart or something happens and I lose touch... But I always appreciate when I have a few good friends.

I do enjoy meeting new people, but have no ability to small talk and even when I try REALLY hard and fight through it, it's almost as if they can see right through me and reject me - like I'm some sort of alien being unfamiliar with their rituals.  And other times I find that I throw myself into a social setting and suddenly find myself disinterested or incredibly uncomfortable...

It's incredibly frustrating, because I enjoy the benefits that would come with being an extrovert - but it seems like it would be exhausting even attempting to nourish those kinds of relationships, let alone begin them... which might not even pay off in the end as it seems like I just can't fake it well enough.

So I was wondering if this is a typical attribute a lot of you have struggled with and how have you learned to cope with it?

One more thing: I hope this post doesn't come off as some sort of pity party - I'm not the most miserable person without friends and I do have a girlfriend who is also an introvert, but I would like more friends to hang out with/talk to about stuff, etc...

tl;dr: Might be an INTJ, long for human interaction, can't seem to come to grips with that.",,False,,t5_2qowo,False,,,True,t3_16n7r5,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/16n7r5/do_you_have_trouble_coping_with_your_introversion/,

I am an INFJ, and often because of this, I can irritate my wife when I take the non optimal routes to accomplish things. She is/has been very patient with me and I try to adapt my behavior to better match the more optimal routes she sees so clearly.

When I mess up I try to disengage myself from her since I know she needs her time alone to get over whatever I've done or forgotten to do. This works to some degree and we often reconcile after but lately its been less effective. It seems as though every time I stop doing one thing that annoys her it gives her time to focus on another thing that annoys her and I just end up annoying her by proximity.

Today for example, she didn't sleep well, citing my apparent tossing and turning at night as the cause. I apologized and said I'd sleep farther away so as to not disturb her (I'm usually a cuddle sleeper). The rest of the day she appeared irritated at me. We were watching a show and when it ended out of the blue she began talking about how I had not done enough research on a particular topic I was helping investigate for her. The point while valid was not something that made all of my research invalid but merely meant we would have to do a bit more research to figure out what the proper approach for our unique situation was. At this point she was obviously upset at me so in order to keep the peace I did not fight her on the subject but instead began to do the additional research needed. 

I know you guys hold high standards for yourself's and for everyone you are involved with but it seems as though if someone falls short, no matter how close they may be it doesn't matter.

For example, when something terrible happens to me, I can justify it and quell my negative emotions by informing myself that it would have been funny had it happened to someone else, and it will likely be funny in retrospect. It also often prevents me from making poor decisions when especially upset or intoxicated, as the ""super-ego"" voice steps up to a higher volume, reminding me that I am not in the state of mind to make certain decisions, and should maintain my dignity accordingly.

I'm wondering if any of you have experience with long distance relationships. I'm dealing with one and need advice.

I wasn't asked if I wanted to hear anything in particular, just that I shouldn't want to hear from them (with a very implied ""at all"").

My reasoning for wanting to hear from them slightly more often is purely so that I know if I should head out to look for them. Plus, you know, that whole pesky ""relationship"" thing; which last I checked required that magic word: communication.

For the record my side of the equation is:

 * Until recently I've sent a hello daily after logging out from work and before I hit the elevator (I've only stopped doing so because of burnout and a feeling of futility)
 * If *if* I get a response at all, it's typically a one message response with little content
 * I get that their end is busy (school teacher, end of year work and what not) but so is mine, and I was still going out of my way to make contact

With **E--Js and E--Ps** the rule is to pick the function that corresponds to the J (judging letter) or P (perceiving letter) and it will be introverted or extroverted depending on the first letter of the code.

e.g. If we use ENTJ, the judging function (Te, Ti, Fe, Fi) in the letter code is thinking and the first letter is extroversion so the dominant function is Te.

**I--Js &amp; I--Ps** use the opposite function of the last letter but the dominant function's introversion or extroversion is still determined by the first letter.

e.g. An INTJ's first function will be perceiving (Ni, Ne, Si, Se) and because of the N and the I, the dominant function is Ni.

...

The **secondary** function is determined by the other perceiving or judging letter that has not been used. The introversion or extroversion will be the opposite of the dominant (the letter in the letter code) function 

e.g. INTJ goes Ni then Te

...

The **tertiary** function is the opposite of the secondary function but is still within the same perceiving or judging group. *Also note that the introversion and extroversion of the functions will flip-flop every other one.

e.g. Te is a judging function so my choices are Te, Ti, Fe, Fi. The opposite function is F and because the secondary function is E the third will be I. So the third function for an INTJ is Fi.

...

The **inferior** function is the opposite of the dominant function as the secondary function was different to the tertiary function.

e.g. Ni goes to Se.

To which extent do they take you out of your head?,19,4,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/191fzg/which_physical_activities_do_you_choose_to_engage/,"I tend to avoid activities that require physicality. I'm curious about how the rest of you roll.

I exercise regularly, but my workout routine at the gym is totally repetitive so I can tune everything out and just let my mind wander.

I meditate, which I suppose in a way hardly counts as a physical activity, but it does involve [focusing on my breath and posture](http://www.mro.org/zmm/teachings/meditation.php) and that actually makes me more aware of my body and surroundings which is nice. When I go for a walk after meditating for a long time, I find myself noticing things like nature and architecture, colors, how the air smells, etc. and actually enjoying these sensory impressions. The contrast to how oblivious I usually am is striking.

Sex can take me out of my head too. (No further comment.)

When I was younger, I used to go clubbing and would actually dance, but even when drunk I rarely felt that immersion in the music that I think many clubbers feel. I was generally pretty self-conscious; it was an act of will that brought me to the dance floor rather than the desire to dance.

I like cooking, but my cooking is like my exercise: I tend to make the same dishes over and over and thus I can let my mind wander while cooking because I'm just going through the well-known motions.

I'm having trouble coming up with another activity I choose that involves any kind of physicality. My life is in my head pretty much, with the few exceptions mentioned above.

Does anyone else voluntarily engage in more physical activities? To which extent do they take you out of your head?

In an attempt to improve the situation, I asked her to take an MBTI test and then we traded descriptions of our types.

Although she's a good worker, I'm not sure how much more I can take. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to break this escalating cycle?

UPDATE: Thanks to everyone for your comments and suggestions. I confronted her about it in as nice a way as possible and she understood.

Ever since middle school I began to realize that I had trouble feeling bad with or for people. I'm not sure about before because my memory gets fuzzy back in elementary school. However during it was during high school in which I realized that I couldn't really sympathize, or even empathize for others (they're two different things). 

I was never really bothered that I couldn't feel bad for others, and when people came to talk to me I just said some cliche things that I've seen in movies/shows (they work) to get them to shut up. However today was different. 
Today my mother came to me crying and started talking about depression and all the things in her life, but during all that I couldn't feel anything for her. All I could do was literally just stand there and hug her. Even my facial expression couldn't change. I tried to cry with her and tell her everything would be okay but all I could manage was a grunt. During it all I was just asking myself, practically yelling at myself inside my head ""Why don't you feel sad? Why can't I feel anything?!?"". And I spent the whole time thinking why I wasn't feeling anything rather than consoling her.

And well it actually kind of hurt me that I wasn't able to sympathize for her. Basically I'm feeling bad that I can't feel bad. Quite ironic right? I really don't know what to do about this. Am I missing something in my brain or hormones? Because right now I'm imagining this situation happening later on in my life but with someone else I love and I wouldn't be able to help them or even feel bad. And it honestly is scary. 

I really want to talk to someone about this but I don't think any of my friends would understand.. Also I only think this is tangentially related to INTJ but this is the only place I could find anonymous opinions.

As INTJs we optimally begin using our dominant perceiving function (Ni) to give us great insight into whatever it is we see in our minds eye and eventually move into a more convergent judging process (Te) then back into an open and relaxed perceiving state (Se). What I read over on personalityjunkie.com is that, and I will paraphrase the text from the website for brevity and clarity:

*INTJs can struggle when it comes to starting tasks or projects. It can be hard for INTJs to intentionally initiate their Judging process (Te). This is because the most natural way for them to Judge is to Perceive first (Ni) and allow the Judging process to occur naturally. Nonetheless, INTJs commonly experience “dry spells,” periods where they lack the motivation or inspiration to start work on a project. For this reason, they may at times envy IPs’ and EJs’ ability to actively initiate work. (I live with an ENTJ and often marvel at his sheer capacity for taking action) While INTJs love to Perceive, there are times when they would love to get something done, but end up feeling frustrated because the world seems to be depriving them of the necessary motivation or circumstances to authentically apply their Judging process.*

**Anyone have tips for jump-starting extroverted thinking (Te) long after our introverted intuition (Ni) has faded?**

additionally there is a ton of great material covering the inferior function (Se) here:

Call me a hippy, but I never really found inner happiness until I started examining Nature for analogies (super-imposable patterns) that overlapped with physics/chem/bio and later on psychology, and that's when I truly started to understand the observations that seemingly-corny-songs-like-this utilize.  (For clarity: I no longer think they're corny)

That being said, if you're ever bored, a fun exercise I found to do is looking at nature (literally, outside at a tree for example) and looking for super-imposable patterns.

**ex:** 

* Notice 2 leaves look alike?  That's just like twins!  
* Notice 3 leaves look alike?  Triplets!  
* Notice the leaves are chewed and distorted-looking?  Much like a person who just got into a fist fight and looks all roughed up!  
* Notice a bird sitting alone on a branch during spring, making a specific repetitious call, then it flying away after a period of time?  Much like a human trying to find a mate and no one within range of said human responds, so the human moves on and tries in a different place (more fish in the sea amirite? l0l0l0l -.-).

I've found that it keeps me mentally sharp, makes life interesting, and reveals things I never truly knew I didn't know (l0l0l0l, ""but if walked the footsteps of a stranger"").  Basically it's abstract pattern recognition that kind of forces you to think ""outside the box"", which we can sometimes find ourselves unknowingly placed in (thank you public education).  

So if you're ever bored, well there's something to do.  Also, it keeps life interesting and can seemingly catalyze self-realization/self-growth =P.",,False,,t5_2qowo,False,,,True,t3_z53br,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/z53br/patterns_within_nature/,
1345603189.0,15,self.intj,ym76z,What are your thoughts on drinking and those who get / are drunk?,20,5,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/ym76z/what_are_your_thoughts_on_drinking_and_those_who/,"I saw this posted in 2x and figured I'd ask the general intj population the same thing. Basically, what do you think about drinking? Despise it? Adore it? Somewhere inbetween? And what about those drunk people, just can't stand them or have a blast when they are drunk? Lastly, what do you feel about alcohol altering ones personality? 

So I'll begin, I enjoy drinking. Typically I just have a few beers to get a nice buzz. I really enjoy the buzz why I'm not to sure but after 3 beers the buzz usually sets in and I feel more relaxed and at ease. Though every few months I like going to a college party and just getting shitfaced, so to speak. Not entirely sure why but I enjoy getting drunk. My friends who witness the transformation say I get quite a bit louder and more talkative but become overly blunt/to-the-point. For that reason they enjoy asking me random questions to see what my blunt response would be, and I enjoy giving them the, sometimes harsh, answers.

As for drunks as long as they aren't overly obnoxious I never really have a problem with them though I find most people's personalities don't change quite as much as they think it does so if I don't like them sober I almost certainly won't like them drunk.

As for personality change, I think your personality doesn't ""change"" per say but alcohol allows you to do what you otherwise would if fear or other factors didn't play a role. So when my friends first asked why I was so talkative and overly blunt I looked at him and wondered if I truly acted differently when I'm sober. Which afterwards I thought on it and realized that hey I'm a shy guy.

Well, your turn. Hate alcohol? Love it? Is it really wrong to love/hate it? Yea too many questions, I'll just stop here.",,False,,t5_2qowo,False,,,True,t3_ym76z,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/ym76z/what_are_your_thoughts_on_drinking_and_those_who/,
1345544064.0,17,self.intj,ykogv,Questioning whether or not I am INTJ,17,0,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/ykogv/questioning_whether_or_not_i_am_intj/,"First off, I would like to say, the past 2 days have been very, very interesting and reflective for me. I found the Myers-Briggs personality test and this subreddit, and discovered, supposedly, that I am INTJ.

I've been up burning the midnight oil for the past 2 days reading through this subreddit and various sites, fascinated by people so seemingly similar to me. I became more aware of my strengths and my weaknesses.

But I am not sure if I am truly an INTJ. I took the personality test 3 times, trying to be as honest and unbiased as I could. I scored INTJ every time.

Here is precisely what I got:

    You have moderate preference of Introversion over Extraversion (56%)
    You have strong preference of Intuition over Sensing (100%)
    You have distinctive preference of Thinking over Feeling (62%)
    You have slight preference of Judging over Perceiving (22%)

A lot of the stuff I hear about INTJ's I relate to very much. In fact it was fascinating and exciting to basically see people read my mind. I can come off as distant or rude without realizing it. I try to block out my emotions when making decisions. I am quite argumentative and willing to debate about ideas. I excel at science and math and am fascinated by things in that field. My ""achilles heel"" is relationships.

I'll stop there. You all know what I mean, you are all INTJs after all. 

But sometimes I feel as though I am not quite as... Not sure what the word is. Quiet? Reserved? I do not have a problem voicing my opinions and explaining not only what I think but how I feel about something.

I am not intimidated by public speaking - at the risk of sounding arrogant, I am the best presenter and most articulate speaker in my class. My powerpoints are well received (After giving a presentation about nuclear fusion even the non science oriented individuals in my class said that I actually made it an interesting and understandable subject),  I am popular with the judges at the science fair for my convincing arguments and confidence in my presentations. I participate in class discussions, sometimes heatedly, to my teacher's annoyance.

I was giving presentations on a weekly basis since I ran the school astronomy club. (Yep, stereotypical nerd, but I do like teaching and debating so I didn't mind the responsibility.)



I think my point has been made here. I am introverted - I have a small circle of friends, enjoy my time alone, and spend most of my time reading and reflecting. I don't like large social gatherings like parties and prefer spending time with only a few closes friends. Even then, after a few hours, I feel the need to get away.

Despite this, I don't seem to be as emotionally distant as other INTJ's, from what I have seen. I can be relateable and expressive in tone when the situation calls for it. When it comes to small talk and being a conversationalist, I suck, of course. But debating, arguing, presenting? It isn't draining to me at all.

Am I perhaps another personality type, or am I just borderline?

I am 15 and in 10th grade for what it is worth, so I guess I am not fully developped.


This post was alot longer than I intended, and in hindsight seems quite self-indulgent and long-winded. I apologize. But the past few days have been a time of self discovery, and I am curious to learn more about my own nature. After hours and hours of browsing I felt the need to post this.

Thank you for any input.

I'm a fairly young INTJ (16 years old), and I've noticed that being genuinely happy in my life is kind of difficult. I have a great life, great parents, and do very well in school, but something just doesn't click. I just have not been able to find happiness lately. I think that as an INTJ, my perfectionist attitude and analytical mind is limiting the joy that comes with accomplishing something or enjoying a specific moment. Because of that lack of satisfaction, I'm becoming extremely unmotivated and losing that INTJ-esque sharp, clear, and confident mind that I thrive in.
