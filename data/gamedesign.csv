As of today, I've been made a moderator of this little subreddit, after making the [following post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1ag48p/new_rgamedesign_moderator/c8x3jas) on another moderator's post.

As a result of that post, and of the other mods agreeing, the sidebar has been changed and updated.  Please check it out and let us know if you have any suggestions.

I wanted to introduce myself as a moderator, but more importantly, I wanted to make a call to action for getting some fire under this subreddit, which I think reddit has really been in need of for some time.

There are many game development subreddits, but so far, none that are focused entirely on the process of designing rules.  Designing a ruleset, however, is just as much of a discipline as programming, or visual art, or music composition.  There's a ton of information for us to share with each other, and there's a vastly greater amount that is still waiting to be discovered.

Game design is historically speaking, a new discipline.  That's not to say that people haven't been doing it for thousands of years - they have.  But what I mean is that there have not been a specialist class of person whose entire job it is to design good rules for more than 50 years.

So, all I'm saying is that we have a lot to do, without ever really talking about programming, technical issues, sales/marketing, or culture.  **We can have an entire subreddit devoted entirely to the creation of good rule-sets.**

**Call to action!**

What we will need if we want to get some traction is for all of us to tell some friends about the subreddit and ask them to subscribe.  I think that once we get to a certain threshold, it will become self-sustaining, but as it is right now, I know that there are thousands of people who would subscribe, but they simply haven't heard of it and don't know what it is.

I've purchased a domain and set it up with DokuWiki. Pretty simple to use, and even has built-in syntax highlighting.

Which brings me to the main point of this post. Everyone seemed to be in favor of a public discussion to sort through the details, so I ask you this: How do we separate game *design* from game *development*?

At times, the design and development portions overlap, but a lot of the time this is not the case. Can we use one website for both concepts? Articles could be broken into Design and Development segments when necessary, though this may prove difficult to manage or just plain ugly at times.

~~The word 'gamedev' is present in the domain I purchased, but I could easily create an identical 'design' version if we feel a separate site is needed.~~ Done.

What are your thoughts on the 'dev' vs 'design' issue? On the wiki in general?

And we should probably try to do an initial population of data from some currently existing source, yes? Where are good places to look?

I'm a little surprised a resource like this doesn't already exist... we have a chance to make something truly useful, let's do it right!

**Edit1**: Of the responses so far, all in favor of a *strictly* design-based wiki. Major question now is exactly what information do we put here and how do we organize it? If you want to be a part of the initial info dump, let me know and I'll get you set up with a wiki account.

**Edit2**: For the moment - it looks like we're wanting to use this wiki to focus strictly on Design, maybe sprinkle in some pseudo-code, and link to external resources for specific implementations. *If you would like to contribute!!* Please visit [GameDesignWiki.com](http://gamedesignwiki.com) and register for an account. 

We still need to have a discussion on organization of content.

1364148065.0,44,self.gamedesign,1ax8qh,"Difficulty Adjusting Solutions, a list of subjects and methods(with explanations) to adjust difficulty in your game.",51,7,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1ax8qh/difficulty_adjusting_solutions_a_list_of_subjects/,"In light of recent posts on /r/GameDesign, here is a list of some methodologies you can use to make your game challenging to multiple sets of audiences. Here's some basic taxonomy of difficulty adjustment solutions.

-----------------------------------
**Subjects to Adjust**

- **Numeric, or Slider/Knob Balance**

Slider/Knob Balance is about balancing in-game attributes or numbers to change the difficulty of the game. This is about making enemies or obstacles stronger, faster, or more numerous without other adjustments.

While effective up to certain degrees, slider/knob balance can be taken too far. The idea is to make the game more difficult, not more tedious. More durable or more numerous enemies doesn't challenge a well supplied player. Stronger enemies do not challenge a player that cannot be reached. Faster enemies do not challenge a sufficiently strong player.

Slider/Knob balance can also be applied to procedural generation of levels or areas by making them more dense, or have more traps or terrain hazards.

- **Enhanced AI**

An effective means of challenging a player is making your enemies smarter or more aggressive. While AI isn't easily incorporated into every type of game or genre, many games can benefit from having multiple tiers of enemy AI that instruct them to either be more aggressive, or use various strategies against players.

A good example of this type of difficulty scaling can be see in a generic tactical shooter. Basic enemy AI may have the instruction to shoot at the player on sight, while aggressive AI will force the enemy to pursue the player, and further advanced AI may use cover, call for reinforcements, use grenades to force players out of cover, and do various combinations of those to keep the pressure on the player.

- **Special Treatment/Home Field Advantage**

Treating enemies as if they're above the rules applied to your player is another way of being able to adjust difficulty. When your player is injured, do they heal over time? Do they regenerate ammo? Do they need to reload? Your player has to live by certain rules, but that doesn't mean enemies in your game have to follow the same ones.

A good example of this is leash back(read: anti-kite) mechanics used in A-RPGs/MMORPGs. Players may often try to exploit movement or combat mechanics to get an edge of enemies. While they're right to do so, a way to make it less effective, or completely ineffective, would be to limit how far an enemy will pursue a player, while rapidly restoring their health if they were damaged during one of these exploit attempts.

- **Resource Deprivation/Away Field Disadvantage**

Similarly, adjusting the level of access the player has to resources(equipment, health, ammo, etc) can provide more challenge to players by forcing them to rely on strategies they may not have needed to use in different difficulty settings, or by forcing them to make decisions about their resource usage.

A good example of this can be found in survival horror games. Harder modes of Resident Evil include a lower number of ammunition and health restoration items, often in addition to more numerous and more durable zombies.

- **Randomization**

Randomization can throw a wrench into the plans of players. While randomization is present in many games in some form or another, making it a core component(such as randomized loot drops, or random enemy encounters) can be a double-edged sword.

Commonly randomized things in game involve player attributes(popular among D&amp;D style games), random loot and random loot attributes, random enemies, enemy properties, and enemy attributes, and areas and enemies procedural generated areas and enemies

When considering adding randomization to your game as some core component, be sure to ask yourself if you *really* need it.

-------------------------------
**Ways to Change, Or Let the Player Change Difficulty**

In addition to these types, here are some methods of adjusting the difficulty along these lines:

- **In-The-Box** or Static Balance.

Also potentially named ""Don't actually offer dynamic difficulty.""

This methodology largely relies on *not* balancing the game beyond initial play tests. While this is an obvious option, it doesn't give your audience many options beyond what you give them 'In the Box.' This is the assumptive 'default' mode if you don't adjust, or provide adjustments for anything.

- **Progressive Difficulty**

The game becomes harder the further the player is along in the game, or based on how long they've played.

This is common in many games, as enemies become higher level, better equipped, or otherwise smarter and as terrain becomes more perilous towards the end of a game.

However, my favorite example of this type of change in difficulty comes from Tetris. The more blocks that drop, the faster the game goes. The faster the blocks drop, the harder it is for the player to make full lines.

Nearly all other difficulty modes work exceptionally well with this concept.

- **Difficulty Settings, or ""Pick your (Pre-made)Poison""**

Allowing the player to select their difficulty settings. These are usually preset to the traditional Easy/Normal/Hard, but can be expanded as much as a designer could want to incorporate different types of challenges.

A good example of this is the difficulty settings for Fallout New Vegas. While you could choose different, but still basic modes of difficulty, you could also add Hardcore Mode, which added an entirely new set of rules and resources to the already existing game.

- **Flexible Difficulty, or ""Dig your Own Grave""**

Players are in full, or near full control to how hard the game is. The designer sets up the default settings on how they think the game should play, but the players have access, or somehow gain access to change these later.

One of the best examples of this type of system is from Bastion. Bastion incorporated flexible difficulty settings as not only part of the game, but as part of the world's lore. The gods of the Shrine would allow players to toggle certain effects or powers on enemies that made them much more challenging to defeat, even for a player who had already finished the game before.

- **Performance Scaling**

The challenge of the scale changes depends on how well(or poorly) a player does. The more complete the player's mastery of your game is, the harder the game becomes in response. This type of difficulty adjustment method ensures that, with enough preparation, every player is adequately challenged without them expressly needing to select a challenge mode.

Be careful with offering alternative game content based on performance, as that could lead to frustration if the player does to well and locks themselves out of content designated for players that cannot perform as well.

Basically someone posts a name (i.e. monkey muscles), or a very vague premise (outdoors in a park, with a hooked-handed man, yada yada), and it's everyone's job to use that vague concept or name and think of ways it could be implemented into a game. You can either come up with the whole game concept (setting, style, mechanics, etc), or just add to the existing posts. 

Always found it to be a fun way to think outside the box and help get the juices flowing a bit. Anyone interested?

The concept is abstract, I know, but I brought it to the attention of this thread because it sparked up a new delicious design problem, and that is **how to get a player to hate something in a game.** 
Games are easily the best way to create an emotional response from an experiencer; we've all played games that have done amazing things in the realms of excitement, joy, loss, awe, fear, sometimes even love. But as far as I know, there hasn't been a game that has ever tried to get a player to feel hatred. We may hate another player who is totally griefing us, have a protagonist or antagonist who is a little on the annoying side, or perhaps a character from a group of people society generally hates such as the Nazis that show up in almost every shooter. We may even hate a game designer for designing a level that is ridiculously, unfairly difficult (I'm looking at you, Meat Circus). 

**I want to know if anyone has played a game in which you are introduced to a brand new element, and over the course of play, you gradually begin to loathe it.** Having just the sight of that thing on the screen makes your blood boil and your lips curl in disgust. I'd like to discuss the psychology of hatred, and think about ways to put it into a game.

**The closest idea I have are escort missions,** having to drag someone around who is an [absolute nuisance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raIrRERM9OU) and gets in the way of everything you do. Maybe as you play along, the person you are escorting develops from a burden to someone who can actually aid you from time to time. What are your thoughts?

PS: Ethically, I realize that if something like this were ever attempted, It would absolutely be playing with fire. It would definitely be stepping on some toes. After all, a game is essentially teaching a player to hate something--that kind of design could easily be abused. But I also think in getting to that point, a game could really teach a player a lot about him or herself, and I believe there's worth in exploring it.",,False,self,t5_2qimq,False,,,True,t3_1gdxi0,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1gdxi0/creating_hatred_as_a_game_element_has_it_been/,

On the other hand, if you implement this in a fight with a battle where you're forced to lose, the player might feel like it's a waste - or they might reset every time before losing and miss the point.

For example, there is an open world to explore, with characters and a plot and so on, but a key part of the game would be the ability to burst into song, and perhaps react with the environment with music.

I felt it was a rather inspired idea at the time, but in attempting to design game mechanics around it I ran into rather vexatious problem, in that I could not for the life of me recall any sort of game that *did not have a rhythm-based mechanic* that dealt with music so fluidly. The best examples I could look to were an Aquaria-type game, in which music is used as a sort of spell-casting device (but I didn't care for going in this direction) and Journey, in which music blends seamlessly with player experience, but was not technically used as a game mechanic.

It's gotten to the point where I am more interested in making a mechanic that solves this problem than the game itself. Does anyone know of games that attempt to tackle this, or have any suggestions for how to go about it? Ever since the night I had that dream, I haven't had a wink of sleep over it!

**EDIT:** I've been asked to define what I meant by rhythm game, and my response is any game in which player actions are dictated by timing. I want the player to influence the music, not the other way around. apparently this is called ""aleatoric music"". TIL.

**EDIT 2:** I've been recommended the following games, which I have already played, or played since the recommendation: Child of Eden, Rez, Flower, Audiosurf, and Proteus. Of all of them I found Proteus to be the most helpful.

1365694132.0,22,self.gamedesign,1c50vf,"Damaged Goods, a Taxonomy of 'Element' systems with take-aways.",23,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1c50vf/damaged_goods_a_taxonomy_of_element_systems_with/,"[Inspired by this question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1c1ld2/what_are_some_of_the_most_interesting_damage/)

Element systems are useful for game designers who intend on adding a familiar, but still challenging layer of depth to their game.  Element systems force players to build specific strategies around a very concrete set of rules, which helps game makers predict players actions and design their games accordingly.

Many element systems are attributed to classic RPGs, but they can be used in a large variety of games with other mechanics.    Here are a few ways games use element systems, with a take-away at the bottom.    

------------------------------------
**List of Basic Element Systems**

- **Binary/Polarized:** [Silhouette Mirage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette_Mirage) &amp; [Ikagura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikaruga)

Or, the 'Two' system.  If a game features primarily two opposing forces, it is a binary/polarized system.  This system is very simple and requires very little for the player to understand it, making it great for faster paced games.  Many games that use this system actually have three or four effectual elements, but the other two are usually not spoken of, or are implied.  

As an example: Hot, Cold, Neither(Inferior), Both(Superior).

Some systems use this as a literal 'Off' and 'On' type of effect, limiting the element system to truly two types, though it's disputable whether or not it could even be called an element system at that point.


- **Trio/Rock-Paper-Scissors:**  [Azure Dreams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azure_Dreams)

Systems of 3 are popular in Action RPGs and classic RPGs, since they're simple enough to be quickly interpreted by players, but complex enough to force a player to form strategies around elemental obstacles.
 
These systems usually follow the balance trio of Fire, Water, and Air and form a Rock-Paper-Scissors system(Water beats Fire, Fire beats Air, Air beats Water.  Some games allow the combination of two or all of the elements to create a 'super' element superior to the rest, and most include the absence of any element(physical or non-elemental.)

These systems encourage a player to possess or command at least two of the three elements when possible, meaning they would never be at a disadvantage, and will most often have an advantage.

Naturally, your system doesn't need to follow the Fire, Water, Air trend to use a RPS style opposition.


- **Classic(Greek) Elements**

By classic elements, I'm referring to the **[classical Greek notion of elements.]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Element#Greece)**  These systems feature four, often equally opposing or cancelling elements, though some games do venture into the Hot/Cold/Wet/Dry territory and focus on combination.

Classic element systems use cancellation/nullification rather than certain elements being somehow superior to others.  Some games follow Aristotle's version of this and incorporate aether/ether/spirit as an additional, superior element. 


- **Natural(Chinese) Elements:** Dungeons and Dragons, and many derivatives of the game.

Some games adapt nature or material into their element systems, adding things such as 'Wood, and 'Metal.'  This type of system opens up all materials to be used as a type of element, though Chinese elements only focus on Wood and Metal.

Many games opt to add things such as silver(werewolves) and iron(fae/undead) as elements


- **Element Wheel/Cube:** [Star Ocean 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Ocean:_The_Second_Story)

Pushing further, some games, especially RPGs, use a large number(7+) of elements, often needing to split classical ones(Water into Water and Ice, Fire into Fire and Heat, Air into Air and Lightning, etc), or include more abstract(Holy/Unholy) elements to increase the complexity of their system.  Element Wheels and Cubes tend to follow either nullification or RPS opposition, but on a much larger scale.

- **Element Matrix** [PokeMon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokemon)

The Element Matrix is worth mentioning on its own, since it is one of the most used types of element systems in RPGs.   The element matrix does not strictly follow nullification or RPS opposition, and instead uses a linking web of vulnerabilities that may result in a single element being either inferior or superior to multiple elements, but rarely supreme over all.  

These complex systems are used to force the player to understand other mechanics in the game in addition to memorizing, or partially memorizing how elements interact with each other in that universe.   This effectively creates a knowledge barrier between the skilled and unskilled players of a game.


----------------------------

**What I hope you take away from this:**

In short, different systems of interaction between 'elements' in a game, and some basic abstractions.

Interaction:

- **Polarized: Direct and singular opposition.**  Like elements are resisted/harmless/beneficial, opposing elements are not.
- **RPS/Cyclic Opposition.** Like elements are resisted/harmless/beneficial, an element will always be superior and inferior to another.
- **Nullification: Equal Opposing Forces.**  No elements are superior, opposing forces cancel.

Abstraction:

- **Material Inclusion: Objects and materials as elements.**  Elements can be more than the basal things and...
- **Elemental Influence: Elements can interact with more than just other elements,**  such as types of creatures(Werewolves), and other non-elemental objects(like oil-spills.)
- **Wheel/Cube Design, or up-scaled element systems** Either RPS or Nullification scaled beyond 3/4 elements. 
- **Matrix Design.** Elements have multiple types of interaction with other elements.

There are tons of ways to abstract from element systems, and this is just a few ways of how it has been done in the past.

-------------------------


Also, I realize most of my examples are from the PlayStation era of games.  If anyone would like to share examples of these types of systems used in modern games, that would be great.   I'm afraid I don't have quite as much time as I used to have when the original PlayStation was relevant.

Also, the only games that I could think of from the Classical(Greek) system were from the SNES/Genesis generation.  If I recall a more modern one, I'll edit to include it.

It's somewhat relevant, though really only illustrates what I'm going to talk about here.  

Let me start by defining some key terms we'll need along the way:

-------------------------
- **Confidence:** *Noun*

1: The feeling or belief that one can rely on someone or something; firm trust: ""we had every confidence in the staff"".

2: The state of feeling certain about the truth of something.


- **Ego:** *Noun*

1: A person's sense of self-esteem or self-importance: ""a boost to my ego"".

2: The part of the mind that mediates between the conscious and the unconscious and is responsible for reality testing and a sense of self.


-------------------------

**Confidence, Ego, and Their Importance to Creative Industries**

People may notice that there is a significant amount of high levels of self-esteem(ego) among successful, or up-and-coming content creators.    If you need examples of this in the game design industry, you can take a look at Tommy Refenes of Team Meat fame, and Richard Garriott from the example I provided above.

These two men, while I'm sure they have much in common outside of this, share a rather significant amount of ego.  They believe that they are good designers, saying (Tommy) ""I don't make shit games,"" or ""Other game designers suck.""

Are they right?  Are they inspirational or legendary game designers? Does everyone else 'suck' in the light of their majesty? 

**That's *really* not important, and not the point.**

They design games.  Actual games.  Games that exist, as opposed to games that *don't* exist.  While modesty and humility are both socially desired traits in people, confidence is key in creative industries and the belief that success is inevitable instills an insatiable drive ***to*** succeed.  

Although Tom and Dick might have the social graces of belligerent penguins, they're both committed to their industry and the quality of their work.  This means that their work gets done, and gets done well(as far as they're concerned, at least.)

The confidence that they have allow them to skip the fear and overcome vices that comes with being associated with a creative industry.  Fears like like [Impostor syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome), failure and rejection.  Their desire to maintain or realize their ego helps them power through things like procrastination, 'creative' blocks, and general laziness.   

In short: **They're manic, narcissistic workaholics**, and that's good for their work, although may be incredibly stressful for both them and those they associate with.

When I see a particularly arrogant person in a creative role(rappers and writers more than most), I liken their self-confidence with a fire hose's water pressure.   Too little water pressure will not put out the fire.  Too much water pressure will still put out a fire, but it may cause additional damage along the way.   Too much pressure can still *get the job done.*

**Now, does this mean you need to be arrogant or emotionally toxic to be a great game designer?**  Absolutely not.  But confidence and a high self-esteem will only help you achieve your career goals.  For this reason, when I see an outwardly arrogant or self-loving artist/designer/content creator, I don't hate them, dislike them, or even think poorly of them.   I *respect* them, because I know that they're going to try, and are willing to suffer as they try.  

I also *pity* them, because I've been there before, and I know what it's like to believe in yourself when no one else does, and I also know what it's like to believe in yourself, and have other people think less of you for it.  Showing some humility does help with the latter, though behaving in a socially acceptable way doesn't make you the topic of conversation as often.


-------------------



By the way, I desperately wanted to make a Tom, Dick, and Harry joke in here.   If anyone can find an arrogant game designer named Harold, I'd appreciate it if you let me know.


This article specifically refers to game designers, but the same can be attributed to any type of content creation, from movies, to writing. 

If you're interested in psychology, or how confidence and self-esteem contribute to an individual's success, concepts revolving around [Self-Actualization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-actualization) is a good place to start.

They're fast paced, exciting, and often draw us into fantastic scenarios filled with adrenaline and urgency.  They come in a huge variety of styles, from locked and loaded FPS games, intense Action Real-Time Strategies,  Vs Fighting games, all the way to epic action RPGs.  At their heart is fast and accessible fun.

As game designers, it is our job to make sure games are more than just fun.   Our audience also deeply desires to be enriched, and told a story they can both relate to and learn from.  This has often showed to be a challenge for many game designers, and sometimes a key component to a game's success in the eyes of its audience.

But how can you tell a meaningful story in this energy-charged genre?  Here, I will discuss...


**Methods of Story Delivery in Fast-Paced Games.**

------------------------

- **Classic Method #1: Visual**

Many classic action games tell parts of their story visually.  A quick and easy to understand example of this concept is Ryu, from **Street Fighter.**   [Without much more than a quick look at his character](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d4/Ryu-tatsunoko.jpg), you can probably infer that he practices karate, or some other form of martial arts.   With just basic understanding of martial arts(even movie/TV knowledge of it), you can quickly tell that he is not only a practitioner of martial arts, but a master(black belt) and possibly a competitive one(padded gloves.)   An [intelligent design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryu_\(Street_Fighter\)#Character_design) can quickly fill in blanks about a character without needing to explicitly say it.   This also extends to more subtle details, such as [posing](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e1/DDragon_Leebros.jpg) or props.

A higher level example of visual story telling is scene and environment design.  In **Mega Man X4's** introduction level, there are many visual cues to tell you what's going on.  Go ahead. [Take a look at this picture real quick.](http://ianglidewell.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mega-man-x4intro.jpg)

You can probably quickly tell me what's going on.   You can see from the background that it is a city.  There are spotlights running in the background, and broken glass in the foreground.   Something big and bad is probably happening, likely having something to do with the big guy in the center.

Now, if you had never been told that the city was under attack(You are, by Iris/Double at the start of the game), you could still tell that the city was under attack within mere seconds of being in the level.   


- **Classic Method #2: Reading**

**""Your princess is in another castle,"" and  ""It's dangerous to go alone.  Take this,""** are classic examples of using text to convey story.  While there isn't much to these blurbs, many action (especially action rpg) games to follow employ the heavy use of reading in order to fill in the blanks.   While this is expected, and sometimes even desired in RPGs, action games have their pace broken by using this too much.

If you intend to use text elements in your action based game, be sure to use it intelligently or optionally.   Use text sparingly, and only when you intend to give your players a brief moment of reprieve from the rush.  Using it in the heat of an intense scenario is both distracting and obnoxious. 

[Here's an example from **Metal Gear Solid**.](
http://www.metalgearplanet.com/images/MetalGearSolid/Mgs1%20Photos/otaconcloseup.JPG)  Exciting, isn't it?



- **Classic Method #3: Cut scenes.**

Cut scenes, like Reading, need little introduction.  If you've played an Action or Action RPG with cut scenes, you generally know what they're for.   In short words, cut scenes are scenes acted out by characters containing action, dialogue, or both, and are either out of control of the player entirely, or the players have very limited influence over it, such as how they performed in the game, or by Quick-Time Events.

Also like the reading component, cut scenes represent a significant break in the pace of what should be a fast paced game.  Cut scenes should be used sparingly, and only during planned breaks in the action.

------------------------------

Now that you've seen a few classic examples of action genre storytelling, here are some modern approaches and examples.  

- **Modern Method #1: ""Banter"" or Incidental Audio**

Incidental dialogue and exchanges between characters has been a tried and effective method of delivering the story. Action RPGs and squad based FPS games use something frequently referred to as party/squad banter.  Games like **Dragon Age and Mass Effect** employ this regularly to inject background lore(and frequently humor) into the game play, keeping the player informed about the world, their party, or other circumstances without being a significant distraction from the action of the game.

Be careful not to confuse this with dialogue systems, where players interact with characters using options in a dialogue menu.  

- **Modern Method #2: ""Narration"" or Overlaying Audio**

While hardly a modern concept, narration over action has been shown to be an effective means of telling a story while maintaining pace.  Games like **[Bastion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_\(video_game\)) and [The Stanley Parable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stanley_Parable)** use supporting character/antagonist narration(Rucks and 'The Narrator') to both inform and direct the player.

Game Narration is a very unique type of narration.  Since games are interactive, Narrator characters have the opportunity to respond to the actions of the player, as opposed to the narrator purely retelling or directing the story.  

This gives games the potential to have Narrators with changing or unique dispositions.  Rucks of Bastion is a great example of a consistent but supportive narrator,  while 'The Narrator' from the Stanley Parable is a good example of Narrators that change their disposition in reaction to the player's actions.


- **Modern Method #3: ""Audio Logs/Communicators"" or Responsive Audio**

The last approach I will discuss is  the 'Audio Log.'  This method of story telling involves a player either finding an object or completing a certain objective, and being rewarded with a non-intrusive clip of audio.  Games like **Borderlands and Diablo** use this method to both give relevant and current information, as well as historical or trivial lore without being distracting or disruptive to the pace of the game.   

**Borderlands 2** uses this effectively to handle both storytelling and in-game quests(another mechanic that hurts action pacing if handled improperly.)

**Diablo 3** uses this concept to give in-depth lore about creatures, events, or locations as the player discovers them or finds certain items.  The journal of one of the game's prominent characters is regularly available for this, and gives the player a secondary, non-hero perspective to the events within the game.

The game would play like a 2D Legend of Zelda, or Binding of Isaac, except with 2 to 4 players.

**Basic Rules:**

* Randomly generated dungeon layout with prefabricated rooms

* 2 Prebuilt characters to choose from (potentially 4).

* Both players would need to touch a room transition to actually move to the next room

* Bosses would need to require team-work to defeat

* If a player dies, resurrection by the other team-mate(s) is channeled and limitless.

**""Risky"" features that I'm not sure about:**

* One guy holds the sword, one guy holds the shield.

* Sword guy does lots of damage and has increased mobility but can only take a couple hits.

* Shield guy can't do damage, but can knock enemies around for his attack (into environmental hazards, preferably) and is immune from the front.  Can take more hits.

* No ""equipment"" in the traditional sense, no level building.  All you get are a wide variety of potions and consumable trinkets that last a few minutes and often have unpredictable results, with good and bad side effects. *Run 50% faster, but you cannot stop.* or maybe *Attacks leave behind fire, enemies on fire leave behind a trail of fire that can hurt you.*.

I am wondering what sort of tricks could be implemented into making killing an NPC gratifying for the player.  

(Note: My current concern is for a 2d top down game regarding generic baddies so some of this doesn't apply but it's still worth thinking about)

What first to mind is good use of sound and animation.  However games like Assassin's Creed where the animations are well done get old after a while if kills are meaningless

The next though is to add meaning to the NPC's death in an attempt to engage the player's emotions,  but i guess every npc death can't be like [this!](http://xkcd.com/873/)

The next thought is a scenario where the NPC has challenged the player enough to warrant respect, and thus satisfaction is achieved through completing the challenge.  Such as losing a few battles to an NPC boss type, begin to get annoyed, then finally finish him with a slow motion final strike.

However this doesn't apply to the storm trooper variety of NPC enemy where they serve as more of an obstacle  rather than an opponent

So, any thoughts on how to breath life into enemy NPCs?

I'm currently going to Full Sail for Game Design and I found a web series through my education called Extra Credit. They spoke about the beginning of games and how they should serve to represent the several hour journey you're about to take on. The beginning of your game can serve to either welcome the player to the world, or completely turn them off by it. It's a pretty big part of the experience, the first chunk of the game. 

I just played Metro Last Light, and the beginning of the game was, in my opinion, a tad weak compared to Metro 2033. (Here's a reference for anyone who hasn't played it yet: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykci1gSZ35c) 

You start out in a slightly metaphorical dream sequence, and then immediately are taken out of it and have exposition shouted at you by a character who really shouldn't even be in the situation. It just seemed so unnatural and weird to me. The game picks up, but it leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Wouldn't it make more sense to show the player how Khan discovered this, instead of just saying he did?

The reason I thought to post this in this subreddit, is because I'd like the insight of people who look at games from a design perspective. Why did we **have** to have that dream sequence? Why **couldn't** Khan have to say what he saw, versus us actually seeing it through his eyes? The game's already thrown several cut scenes out at us. 

If I was wrong to post this here, I apologize. But I thought this could be an interesting dialog to have. It could also serve to show those of you that are already making games to analyze the beginning of your own games. Maybe say to yourself, ""Do I really have to explain this through dialog, or could I just show the player? Do I need this? What purpose does this serve?""

Let me know what you guys think.

1365063471.0,15,self.gamedesign,1bnec3,A discussion on power progression paradigms in gaming,19,4,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1bnec3/a_discussion_on_power_progression_paradigms_in/,"I have played a great many games over the years. I’m also in the process of designing several games of my own. In all but the most basic of games, the topic of power progression must come up eventually. There are several established paradigms for the advancement of character power. I’d like to discuss the ins and outs of these paradigms and see if we can’t come up with some fresh ideas and potentially a way for us to have our cake and eat it too.

On the one side, you have the planned obsolescence of powers. In this paradigm powers are gained, and then newer, clearly better powers replace those early powers at later levels. We see this fairly often. D&amp;D tends to follow this model with their spells. Most higher level spells of the same school, are clearly better than spells of a lower level. 

I’m not especially fond of this particular method of power progression because invariably, I feel that those early powers are now just wastes of space. If I am forced to use the lower level powers due to the limited availability of higher level powers, it feels uncomfortable, like I’m being dumbed down.

Though in defense of this model, it does create a clear ramp of power; I can look back and see how much I’ve grown by comparing what I have now to what I began with. It also provides lower level characters something to look forward to.


In opposition to planned obsolescence, we have a neutrality of powers. In this paradigm, all powers are roughly equal. No one ability or spell causes much more damage than any other. Often times there are far less powers overall in systems like these, which makes for a cleaner list of powers since the same version of a power doesn’t need to be listed multiple times with ever increasingly cooler sounding names. The powers are differentiated more by the situations they are useful in, rather than some being better than others. 

This might seem like the optimal method, but there are problems here as well. For one, if the optimal usage of a particular power is now situational, you have powers that will sit dormant for most of the game until such a time that the power in question is allowed to shine. Additionally, as the character progresses through the game there isn’t a clear feeling of improvement. I personally like the feeling that I’m growing more powerful as I progress through a game.

Another caveat to the neutrality of powers model is that it can be very difficult to balance. If all powers are supposed to be equal, but some end up being better than others, not by design, but by accident, then you have a rickety game. This is often seen in games like Diablo 3, where you have a grand selection of powers, all supposedly equal to each other, but some powers are almost universally ignored due to simply not being as viable in as many situations, or just not as good outright.


I’d like to hear your opinions on these two paradigms, as well as your experiences with other progressions that you have experienced. What systems do you find the most rewarding and why?

1365975105.0,15,self.gamedesign,1ccj5a,Mechanics to incetivize cooperation in shooters,17,2,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1ccj5a/mechanics_to_incetivize_cooperation_in_shooters/,"A friend and I were discussing Battlefield, and he said that Battlefield will always fall short of good because there's no incentive to actually play cooperatively. So, I got to suggesting a few and the concept sparked my interest and I began to wonder what ways you can incetivize cooperative play in large scale shooters. My two ideas are as follows:

-Squad leaders will gain tactical commands to isse to squad members. The main example I have is a ""supress"" command. The SL would mark an area or target to supress, and squad members would recieve a few points for every bullet that produces a supression effect, leading to points that could equal a kill if you emptied and entire 100 belt. So, a light machinegunner would have the incentive to work cooperatively with a squad leader to deny an area and allow squad members to move up. 

-In order to better combine air power and ground assaults, a better targeting system should be devised. Instead of just marking a target, desinating a vehicle such as a tank with a laser designator would make the nametag above flash and would give the vehicle a faint, glowig outline. This would make it easier to prioritize designated targets. Then, in order to incentivize the usage of this mehanic, there would be a good amount of points for a designation assist and the air vehicle would recieve more points than normal for a ""priority kill"". So, imagine that a tank is pinning down a few people who are holding an objective. One of the men lazes the tank. Above, a tank-killer type plane such as the A-10 ""Warthog"" featured in Battlefield 3, would see the glowibg target and jumps at the easier, higher-reward target. It swoops in, does a strafe run or two over the tank, destroying it. Points for everyone.


What design mechanics would you impliment to incentivize cooprative play in shooters?

Feedback welcome!,13,0,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1e8alw/an_idea_for_difficulty_scaling_in_an_open_world/,"I'm in the design stages for a Metroidvania-style RPG. The whole point of the game is that you can tackle all of the bosses and areas, except the final one, in any order. The advancement will also feature a more traditional RPG skill tree, with multiple paths, instead of the typical unlock-based advancement found in Metroidvanias.

I've been struggling with how to manage difficulty. Because the player will level up as they tackle each area and boss, there needs to be a scaling system that will keep each section challenging, since they can be handled in any order. I don't want to do an Oblivion type system where enemies simply scale to your level, and I also want the mechanic to be make sense in-game. I also want an appropriate punishment for death. I've been working over these problems over in my head for a few weeks now and have come up with a solution that will hopefully solve both of them.

My game has a day-night cycle, and the player can only go out on missions at night (they're a vampire). This was originally part of the game to encourage short bursts of play due to being portable. Now, this also offers an answer to the queries above. When a player dies, they lose any progress they made that night. Additionally, the enemy gets stronger with each passing day. This is a simple and elegant solution to my problem. 

Let's say a player decides to fight Boss A first. There are, say, 50 rooms on the path to Boss A, and you can do 15 rooms a night. On Night 1, the player is killed in room 10. It's now Night 2. The player is fully recovered, but the rooms they cleared are now repopulated, and have slightly more or stronger enemies, depending on the enemy type. But the player is experienced with these enemies and knows how to beat them. They make it through all 15 rooms they can in one night. Night 3, they go again. They attack the same area and make it through 8 rooms before being killed. Again, the enemies advance with time, and the player loses that night's progress. So they attack again on Night 4 and have to start from Room 15.

This system, if properly implemented, offers a few different advantages:

* Each room can be designed with the same baseline dificulty, and difficulty scaling is based almost entirely on time. There will probably be sub-bosses and particularly difficult rooms, but instead of rooms in one area growing more difficult the further in they are, they will grow more difficult the longer you take to reach them.

* Death has a minor but permanent punishment, making all enemies more powerful.

* There is a sense of urgency in the story, giving the game more momentum.

* Allows exploration and attacking to take place in any order the player chooses while still challenging the player at all times.

There is much more to the day night cycle, such as a base/army management system and enemy vulnerabilities based on specific dates, but that's not directly relevant to this post. What do you think of what I've got here? Any tips on how to implement this? Is this whole idea just plain bad?

EDIT: I've received really great suggestions so far! Thank you guys so much for the help - this is my first game and it's great to have a community like this. I'd like to clarify a few things and post my current thoughts on this stem. 

* I still really like the general idea I've got here, but I need to alter some things.

* There will be a cap to how much more powerful enemies can be, and a few successful nights will help close the gap, giving the idea of rapid progress when you figure out just how to take down the enemy. 

* On death, you only lose that single day's progress. 

* You have an army at your base that you can send out to attack at night. They consistently grow more powerful, and you can attack specific areas to weaken the enemy there. This base management is a key part of many aspects of the game.

* The leveling system will not be +numbers. It will be almost entirely based on new abilities, ala Megaman. This may seem like there is no need for difficulty scaling, but I think if the difficulty increase is low and reversable with success, there well be a very definite sense of satisfaction when you get it right.

* Despite me calling it a Metroidvania, there well be little to no need for backtracking.

* On death, only a single day's progress is lost.

(Need Critique and Ideas),17,3,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1bqcff/what_things_could_i_do_to_really_separate_my_game/,"Hi, so I've been working on my game for the last year and a half, and still have tons of ideas with what to add, but thought it would be nice to hear others inputs.  The game is in a genre that many people seem hostile to by default.. Tower defense.  So I am really looking for ways to differentiate, and perhaps give a reason to people who normally would dislike the type of game to give it a look.

I wanted to go for a zerglike (tons of guys at once) tower defense where strategy is key(mazing, placement, abilities that use energy, and so on), which is working pretty well, but I am looking for a good way to introduce more depth.  

I have been thinking about a new system that rewards conditions like comboing abilities, multikills and so on, but I'm not 100% sold that this will solve the problem.  I am thinking about also doing other things like introducing enemies with special abilities as well, or different armor types.   But I am mostly looking for something that would drag people in if they saw it.

Graphics obviously need improved and are being worked on, but looking for mainly game play ideas.

1375947103.0,10,self.gamedesign,1jxynu,The Importance of Rule Consistency?,15,5,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1jxynu/the_importance_of_rule_consistency/,"I've decided to launch a simple game development and theory blog and wrote this as my debut article.

(For anyone interested, it can be found here: http://coahman.com/blog/2013/08/08/rule-consistency/)

I wanted to throw out some ideas I've been juggling in my head, and get your feedback on the ideas and article itself. Here it is:

***

One thing that has been on my mind lately is the consistency of rules in games. By ""rules"", I mean a defined set of action-reaction laws that the designer has specifically taught the player either throughout gameplay or more obviously in a tutorial level.

For example, here are a few of the rules that we are taught in Super Mario Brothers:

1. Proceed to the right to progress through the level.
2. Jump on enemies you encounter to get rid of them.
3. Do not touch moving enemies with anything but the bottoms of your feet.
4. Hit '?' blocks to reveal an item.

It may seem obvious to you that these things need to always be true, but many game designers (AAA titles included) have committed the cardinal sin of bending, or even outright breaking, the very rules they created for their game. I'll be a bit bold in introducing these ideas, and if you don't agree with me I hope that you're willing to discuss some other viewpoints or alternatives with me.


There are two levels to this concept:

**1. Never punish a player for doing something you taught them to do.**

**2. Any given rule must always apply.**


**1)** Imagine you're playing Super Mario Brothers, and you've mastered dozens of levels and countless enemies by now. Suddenly as you jump on the head of a monster, you die. This is an extreme example of breaking layer 1 of rule consistency: punishing a player for something they were taught to do.

Even if there were spikes on the enemy's back, the reaction still doesn't make sense contextually. You can't assume a player will adapt to a new rule simply because it applies in real life or another game. The only time you can assume that is if your game is a simulator, which is grounds for another discussion altogether.

Every new rule should be introduced either in the beginning (think of a board game's instruction manual), or in a direct and concise manner (much like drawing an event card on said board game which alters the way the rest of the game is played).

**2)** Going even deeper, every rule introduced into the game should apply universally- regardless of circumstance. A good example of this is exploding barrels. In almost any video game you play, the brown barrels are static and the red ones explode when you shoot them. If some of the brown ones were to explode while most didn't, I'm of the opinion that that would be poor design. Sure, it might introduce a higher level of suspense, but ultimately it is a poor design choice because it is an unreliable mechanism.

A lot of games, particularly older ones, I've noticed, like to do the ""fake wall"" trick. Where along an entire stone corridor there is one wall that you can walk through to get to a secret area or proceed through the level. If proceeding through the game requires the ability to break or pass through a certain wall, please make the wall different from the others. Even if the difference is so minute that it's hard to notice in passing, at least it makes it a consistent rule. I say ""if proceeding through the game requires [it]"", because I believe that this rule shouldn't apply to easter eggs. Easter eggs or secrets are fun and not inherently important to the state of the game, so I don't find it harmful if you have to get lucky to find it.

**There's another side to this though...**

Does having 100% clear-cut and reliable rules interfere with its ability to be a game? If everything is black-and-white logic, a computer could beat the game. Does that make it more of a puzzle than a game?

Let's take into account the containers in Diablo. Some of them reward you for breaking them open, and some explode causing you damage. This serves to add a risk for searching for loot. How necessary is that?

I hope this article can help people get thinking in the right direction. In writing it, I think I raised more questions for myself than I answered. How do you guys feel about the ideas herein?

The biggest problem with classic RPGs in my opinion was getting bogged down in menu-based combat.

As a replacement I will make combat done on a hex-map in strategic-military style.

It is currently set up so each unit has separate Action Points, and Movement Points. A unit can do more than one action if they have enough points.

You begin with only one unit, but others can join. I am thinking a max somewhere between 3-6.

The rules are very basic at this point. But i am trying to decide what should be added.

Things i am considering :

1 - Bonus damage if there is more than one allied unit around the target.

2 - Units armour cut in half when attacked from the opposite side of another hostile unit.

3 - If a unit is beside a hostile unit and attempts to move away, the hostile unit gets a free attack of opportunity. This would also enforce a type of ZOC. A unit can still pass-by though, but not without giving up a free attack.

I would like to hear other opinions while I am still in the early stages.

Most if not all video games have a form of life/hp, whether it be the points into a goal that allow you to beat an opponent or the amount of times you can be hit by a spell before you are killed or KO'd. Systems in each style of game, whether board or video, are numerous and I am a finite being - so I cannot give every example possible. What I do want to focus on, is the relationship of damage vs defense, from a specific angle of math.

 - Damage  

Linear Damage: All offensive points against an opponent increase through the gameplay, perchance by a level up, powerup, etc., but do so at a regular rate. Examples: MOBAS - Dota/LoL 

Stagnant Damage: Offense is generally horizontal to your character's strength. You don't powerup as much as you might learn new mechanics or focus in specific strengths for specific areas. Examples: Mega Man's Boss weapons, Magicka

Exponential/large gain Damage: Damage, stats, etc., gain at phenomenal increments. A 10 damage sword was good for a few levels, but then a 20 damage sword shows up, later a 40 or 50, character bonuses might increase this further. Once 10 damage was good, but later 1000 damage is considered weak. Examples: Common in Rpgs/grinders - Diablo Series (specifically 2-3)

- Defense  

Linear Defense [Subtractive]: Damage is reduced by set amounts. Armor may reduce some damage more than others due to the flat damage reduction. Examples: Starcraft 1-2

Percent based scaling [Multiplicative]: Damage is reduced by %'s, commonly scaling in near linear fashion (effective health). Examples: Warcraft 3 and offshoots like DotA and LoL

Damage based scaling: Damage is reduced based on the strength of the hit. Only known example: Path of Exiles

- Using these games for math  

Warcraft 3, DotA, and LoL All use the same basic formula. While WC3/DotA used ""damage reduction =((armor)*0.06)/(1+0.06*(armor))"" [source] (http://classic.battle.net/war3/basics/armorandweapontypes.shtml), while LoL expands/simplifies this to ""DR% = armor / (armor +100)"" 
Each of these games has at least 3 damage types, making each unit, hero, or spell, useful for different circumstances. Increasing armor at the same speed as they increase damage often ends up neutralizing both players gains, dependent on the damage types-armors matchup. Dealing or receiving damage in Wc3 depended often on an entire army, with units offsetting different damage and armor types. In Dota/lol this is seen with the different character metas of commonly having heroes focused in disabling/ganking, nuking/spell damage, physical/dps, or healing/peeling/tanking.

LoL % damage reduction [link](https://www.google.com/search?btnG=1&amp;pws=0&amp;q=x%2F(100%2Bx )

Diablo 1-2 and similar style games commonly use a form of evade or ""armor class"" to simulate dice rolls for melee or all physical attacks. However, magicks and D3 use % damage reduction. D2 specifically had an issue/design where the player could mitigate up to 75% of a type of elemental damage, but then a new difficulty would reduce all resistances. (sidenote: the same character would advance tiers of difficulty). This affected gameplay to the degree that while all resistances are stacked additively, the next ""world"" of difficulty was instantly more difficult instead of gradual.

Path of Exiles is a new game I just started playing, and I ended up looking into their damage scales. While they follow a linear % system similar to Diablo 2 for magic damages, they follow a somewhat linear armor calculation for physical damage reduction. However, this near-linear reduction is actually different based on the damage being received. 100 armor roughly translates into ~8 damage reduction per hit, but this is assuming damage is high. When damage is low, it is reduced by a smaller flat variable of 3-4. This ensures that low damage is not removed, while high damage is still affected by armor. 

PoE Per hit damage reduction: [link] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=x*100%2F(100%2B12*x )

- Damage Types  

I've seen others post on this topic already so I will be brief. Damage types allow a player to subvert forms of defense. One of the simplest examples I can give is League of Legends. There are 3 damage types: Physical, Magical, True. Physical damage is generally done via auto-attacks, and a few spells and is reduced by armor, Magical damage is generally done via spells which cost a resource, and is reduced by magic resistance, while True damage is much rarer and cannot be reduced. Each of these damage types is strategic, a team with mostly physical damage can be easier to stack armor against with only 1/5 characters dealing magic damage (assuming equal damage from all players), a team with more magic damage would allow you to counter more opponents by stacking ""MR."" Life on the other hand is still useful against all forms of damage and the armor types increase the effective life you have, but it is especially significant to build life or life regen against forms of true damage, which cannot be reduced, but can be reduced in effectiveness due to 100 damage over 500 life being 20% vs 100 damage over 1000 life being 10%.

I want there to be more depth to it that just ""click to swing your sword"", because that gets repetitive.

First off, I'll give a description of what I want gameplay to be like. I don't want it to be just a hack and slash combat system like Skyrim where you just hit the attack button until the enemy is dead, I want there to be more strategy involved. There will be powers and abilities that you can use during combat as well. Not generic spells that use up a mana bar or anything either; more like abilities that let you teleport behind enemies, slow time, push enemies back, summon physical walls between you and your opponent, etc. I'm trying to avoid the every day rpg spells. So your abilities that you gain over time will complement your normal weapon combat.

I like melee combat in 3rd person games that allow you to string together combos like Assassin's Creed, but I don't know how well that would work from a first person perspective. Ideally, I would like to allow players to switch between 1st and 3rd person perspectives, but the problem with that is that a 1st person combat system wouldn't translate well into 3rd person and visa versa. I also don't want there to be a possibility of one perspective offering an advantage over the other since I want to implement a competitive multiplayer mode.

I apologize ahead of time if it's not. I've been working on looking at levelling and why I don't necessarily like it in action games.

A very simple answer to the question “Character progression or Player Mastery” is “Why not both?”.  There’s actually an answer to that question - Batman: Arkham Asylum.  Batman: AA was praised as an adaptation of the comic book - a game that really made the player “feel like Batman”  I’d argue that the dueling progression systems in the game actually fight against that.

Arkham Asylum is a Metroidvania.  This means that weapons that are earned throughout play actually open up more of the playspace throughout the rest of the game.  However Arkham Asylum is also a brawler with an experience system.  Batman may earn more combat moves by being effective in combat.  Hang from a gargoyle as opposed to just perch, multiple batarangs, and elbows behind him.  All useful in combat.

In other words, Batman punches more in order to learn to punch more.  As a result, this is a shallow system and a common problem in RPGs.   As they’re more about increasing stats in order to make things easier for a player - the opposite of learning to be better at something to begin with.   It’s not hard to see why there’s a combat unlocking system - they wanted to drive the player to experiment more with the “Flow” system and learn how to use it to be a more effective Batman.  The problem arises with this sort of progression though is similar to  a "" +1 sword problem.""  For example, if I dig a lot, I’ll earn a better shovel, so that I can dig faster, so I can dig more.

The problematic part of it is the fact that Arkham Asylum’s gadget system is a perfectly serviceable marker of progression.  You get more gadgets as you progress in the story.  You progress in the story through mastery of the mechanics.  

It’s interesting because modern games - since about Deus Ex - have been about mixing these kinds of system rather than treat them as distinctively different styles of play.  The issue here though is that - as it is - by performing better at something in game, you also level up and make that task easier.  This applies to shooting in Borderlands, Mass Effect (1), hunting / scavenging in Far Cry 3, and the weapon shop system in Assassin’s Creed.  

I just want to talk about the sort of mixing of Character Progression (i.e. RPG style levelling) and Player Mastery we're seeing in a lot of modern games.  Also games like [Candy Box](http://candies.aniwey.net/) and [Progress Quest](http://progressquest.com/) and [Linear RPG](http://sophiehoulden.deviantart.com/art/The-Linear-RPG-114501766) openly make fun of this process.  the issue being that instead of earning new mechanics, the RPG player simply has a larger percentage to hit.

But also games like Portal and Doom measure their progression by player mastery.  Both slowly introduce new weapons and mechanics earned through gameplay, and each new weapon interestingly changes the gameplay and gives the player even more of a sense of mastery.

So I'd like to know from you what you think about this, and how these are being mixed.",,False,self,t5_2qimq,False,,,True,t3_1efqtd,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1efqtd/batman_arkham_asylum_and_reflections_on_character/,

I posted this originally in r/tabletopgamedesign, and they thought I might benefit from posting here too, presumably because it draws a lot from established videogame mechanics. From you guys, I'm looking specifically for feedback on how to move some game mechanics from a virtual settings to a physical setting. Any ideas are wanted and welcome. Thanks!

Original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/tabletopgamedesign/comments/1cr862/looking_for_advice_on_creating_a_scifi_4xesque/


WARNING: Wall of text and very rough ideas present.

tl;dr: I'm creating a sci-fi 4X tabletop game. What advice can you give a first-time game developer and what resources should I know about to help ease this process?

I guess I should provide a little background before I get started; A few days ago, I found myself wondering, ""Why hasn't there been a good 4X videogame since Galactic Civilizations 2?"" For those unfamiliar with what 4X means, it stands for ""explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate."" To the gaming layman, this translates to an in-depth strategy game that takes everything from culture to economy into account when trying to conquer the galaxy/universe/whatever (4X seems to be pretty exclusive to sci-fi, but I could be totally wrong).

As I was pondering that thought, I happened to glance over at the aftermath of my Warhammer 40k game from the night before, then it hit me; A 4X game definitely has the potential to be played in a tabletop setting, in which the social aspect adds a ton new depth.

I haven't put anything to paper yet, just thought about it quite a bit. I've determined that I want to provide a dynamic gametype that combines the customization (for lack of a better word) and storytelling of a game like D&amp;D, a combat system similar to that of RISK or Axis &amp; Allies, and then a totally unique exploration system (which I'll explain shortly), tech-tree (may be a bad idea), simple in-game economy (operative word is simple), cultural development of your race, etc.

What I have pieced together on my own so far is the race-creation and the early-game exploration system. I'll start with race creation: This is where the D&amp;D influence is heaviest. You'll start with a race-creation sheet that looks a lot like a character sheet for D&amp;D. You'll have spots for the usual stuff like your race's name, maybe a little background info, and finally, traits. Your traits will be determined by a roll of dice, in which you will discard the lowest roll and use the rest. The numbers you rolled will act as your race's base traits which will be stuff similar to ""intellect"" which can govern technology, ""charisma"" which can govern culture and inter-racial relations, and so on. Past the numeric traits, the player can cook up whatever lore or background they want for their race within reason.

Onto the exploration. At the start of the game, each race begins in one randomly-determined solar system on the grid-like gameboard (could be some type of square or hex-grid). The rest of the board is ""unexplored"" and blank. Early in the game, you will send out ships to explore the space beyond your solar system in order to discover other habitable planets. To do this, a ship can move out of the starting solar system and enter the next grid or ""sector."" Once in the next sector, the player will roll for the ship to determine if there is even a system there to begin with (for example rolling a 5+ on an 8 sided die would mean there is a system there), and if there is a system present, then how many habitable planets there are (any number rolled over the 5 needed to find a solar system determines how many habitable planets are present; rolling a 6 means there is one habitable planet, a 7 means there are two, etc. for a max of 3 planets per system.)
How will this exploration system work on a board game, you ask? With the magic of dry-erase markers, that's how! The board itself will be made of some kind of plastic or dry-erase friendly material. As the game progresses and as more systems are found, you mark the board accordingly. Each player also has a unique color marker which they use to draw the boarder of their spacial territory, and other things specific to their empire. The marker idea seems to work best because it can be easily changed as you expand your empire or as someone else expands into you. (Note: the board will probably be rather large, but since it's a symmetrical gird, you can determine how much you actually use. This will dictate how long the game lasts. Very similar to choosing ""map size"" in a videogame.) The strength of this exploration system is that it ensures that every game will be extremely unique. The next time you play, the map will look totally different, forcing you to change up your strategies.

I apologize if little to none of this made sense to you. I promise that it does indeed make sense, and that I might just be terrible at explaining what goes on in my head. I just wanted to provide a little info so you can see the scope of what I'm planning design.

So, I'm here to ask for advice and resources. Any advice is appreciated, as this is my first time embarking on the creation of a tabletop game. As for resources, are there any books/websites/tools I can use to help ease the development process along? Also, I'm open to ideas from the community. If there is something that you guys think should be a feature in this game, speak up. If I like it, I'll definitely put it in. I plan on posting a few more times regarding this, and if it generates any feedback, I'll post consistent updates as I progress.

Random questions:

-Does this seem like it can't work in a tabletop setting/has it been done before?

-This game wont be terribly difficult for those familiar with tabletop gaming, but will seem daunting to new players. Is there a way to ease the learning curve? Maybe create a second, watered-down version of the rules for newbies to start with?

-Would it be a good idea to crowd-source ideas? Just ask people what they want to see in the game, and go from there? I'm worried that I'm creating something that only I would be interested in, only to have nobody else give a damn about the game.

One that really aggravates me is something I call ""fake content"". Basically, games in the late 70's and early 80's had a lot of technical limitations, but they wanted to make sure people felt like they got their money's worth. Parents weren't going to buy Johnny and Ashley a $60 cartridge that only gave them 10 hours of gameplay. 

So there were a lot of tactics used, often clever ones, of fake difficulty, infinite levels, replays, and... fake content. The JRPGs were the worst offenders, but a lot of other games did it as well. 

This is where grinding comes from. All the random encounters, all the levelling/stat-buffing you need to do beat some enemies, all the items to collect and manage is fake content.

Most of it is there to take up your time. It doesn't add anything to the story, and you can easily spend big chunks of time doing it.

How many hours of your 70 hour FFVII playthrough is of item-juggling and grinding? How much was actually spent on the story? 

There are some arguments that the items, the grinding, the random encounters serve to establish the world, put you in it,  to create a narrative. 

This is a fair argument! 

But like many things in game design, it matters *how* it is done. Has anyone here played any of the Etrian Odyssey games? That game is entirely grinding, levelling, combat mechanics, and its a **good** game. It gives you a distilled well-designed essence of one part of RPGs, the combat and mechanics and the dungeon-exploring - you have to fill in the dungeon map yourself, make notes, and so on. 

But the trick to how the Etrian Odyssey games does it well, is that they make the items meaningful, with you needing to bring stuff from monsters to open up new items(crafting basically). The monster parts drop just enough to level you up while you're getting them, and this leveling is often sufficient for you to be able to survive the next floor. Each floor is significantly harder, and the combat mechanics offer just enough depth and strategy to make all of this fighting interesting. Because of the difficulty engaging random encounters, this makes all of this a tense affair, because one bad roll, one bad move, can set you back, and make it very very hard for you to get out of the dungeon. Then you have the mapping of the dungeon, and if you don't put down a threat, its your own damn fault. 

Its little intricate design touches like all of that that make Etrian Odyssey games fun for me, but not necessarily for everyone.

But when there is no purpose to the leveling, no real reason to fight a slime for the 50,000th time, knowing it will never ever come close to beating you... what is that encounter there for, if not to waste your time? 

And if that's there to waste your time, is it not fake content? 

That battle with the slime was pretty much never a threat to you. So being able to beat a slime really easily becomes very quickly pointless. In the Etrian Odyssey games, being able to beat enemies easily that when you first ran into them, basically mauled you like they were grizzly bears gives you a feeling of *success* and achievement. The encounters don't happen often enough to really waste your time and you have ways to avoid them. Again, its *how* its done that makes something fake content. 

Item juggling: 
I feel like items in RPGs are a distraction. You get so many items, and upgrade so much that it feels like character progress. ""Haha, I now do +2 more damage! My character is progressing!"" But as designers, we know there is a big difference between stat progression, mechanical progression, skill progression, and character as in story progression. What purpose do these items give? We get given so much money from all the encounters that buying what we need is often not a problem. 

And come on, who here hasn't wasted an hour upgrading their equipped gear, selling the old gear, and checking for new gear? What did that hour really give us? An illusion of progress and control? Or did it spend our time, and make us think the game was longer? 

Mission templates:
This is something newish, but its been polluted by the same design pitfalls that we've inherited in our games. Mass Effect 1 with all of the planet missions, uses identical objects, differing enemies, identical interior maps, and its a big waste of time. I get so many items dumped on me, I'm constantly scrapping them for omnigel, and I've spent maybe 7-8 hours clearing out all the sidequests. The only decent ones involved actual conversation and character decision points, like the Bringing Down The Sky DLC, and one or two of the other missions. The one side-quest that mentions Cerberus is bugged with doors that don't open, and you get a piece of text at the end saying, ""Cerberus must answer for their actions."" Meanwhile, the Exogeni sidequest actually has voice-acting! 

So what does all this mean? Basically, we've fallen into the habit of pushing fake content at consumers, because consumers demand 40 hours of gameplay out of their games. There's really strong economic motivations for this, and part of it is because of the sheer cost of the games these days. People want their money's worth, and we've trained them to expect lots of fake content in these games. I don't blame any designer for doing this. 

But on PCs, with indie games, we have a chance to change this for the better. Platforming games need to be exactly as long as they should be, and no longer. (Limbo, I'm looking at you!)

1371181243.0,9,self.gamedesign,1gbeqt,Mesh- a simple storytelling game that gives voice to the players and challenges the traditional RPG cliches,10,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1gbeqt/mesh_a_simple_storytelling_game_that_gives_voice/,"This is an *almost* complete write-up of the rules. Since it is fairly short, please read through the whole thing before you form an opinion (it might be confusing if you don't). I welcome all feed back, and would particularly appreciate references to other similarly constructed games that you know of.
___________________
Firstly, Mesh very clearly defines a ""conflict"". A conflict is any situation in which the Story Weaver decides he wants to leave things to luck and debate from the players. As with virtually all RPGs, the Story Weaver can at any time decide to let the game unfold naturally as casual roleplay moments, or can decide exactly how things happen. However, when he decides a ""conflict"" has arisen, he officially leaves some elements up to chance and debate.

Once a conflict arises, the players Pledge action points- they can pledge 1,2, or 3 depending on the Character Level of their current character. For beginning players it is recommended you only play as one character at a time.

A player can only pledge points for one character in any given conflict, and a player himself is limited in action points- if he runs out all of his characters run out. Action points are replenished each day and are expended only to participate in conflicts.

If a player pledges an action point he could potentially have say in the conflict, but if he is out bid he must either match or withdraw his request to participate.

After all characters who wish to participate place their bids to act, the Story Weaver can also pledge points for one or two NPC characters. He then declares the exact parameters that he wishes for the conflict to have, these can be vague or somewhat specific depending on the style of play; ""You are surrounded by hungry wolves, and you must fight them off"" or ""You are ambushed by a group of hungry wolves, one of you dies"" could be declared as parameters.

Then, each player who pledged enough to act will describe the situation as his character would most like it to go, telling it as a narrative withing 30 to 45 seconds (depending on character level), with as many ""details"" as possible.

a detail is using a characteristic of your own or other characters in the story. So for example ""Jill is a pyromaniac, so she would try to scare the wolves with fire."" would counts as one detail because the characteristic ""pyromaniac"" appears on Jill's character sheet.

A player can have 3,4,or 5 permanent characteristics, and up to 1, 2 or 3 temporary characteristics both depending on character level.

A player can use up to 5 details in any story he is telling during a conflict.

A player gets a die for each detail he accurately uses (according to the Story Weaver). 

At the end of his story (30, 35 seconds or 45 seconds long) the Story Weaver determines the difficulty (0-12 in the standard game)*, based on the perceived likeliness of his version of the story.
Once all players and NPCs who bought into the conflict as participants have told their versions of the story, all players roll. The Story Weaver compares the number of successes, and Weaves a final draft that is then cannon.

If there is debate over who should tell their stories first, it should go clockwise around the table starting with the player immediately to the Story Weaver's left and ending with the NPC's versions of the stories. 

If two versions of the story are considered by the Story Weaver to be too similar only the person who told it first is allowed to roll. 
_____________
Character Advancement:
[This part is a little less developed since, but here is the rough idea]: All characters who have a characteristic used as a detail in the cannon story get an experience point- players who get the most successes in a conflict gain Player Experience (the only player stat are the pledging points).

  * There are creature cards, and creatures have statistics ""health"" and ""attack"". Creatures are used to fight other users and to deplete the opponent's health.

1368502542.0,9,self.gamedesign,1eak2t,How to make an FPS less FPSish?,12,3,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1eak2t/how_to_make_an_fps_less_fpsish/,"Worst title I admit so I'll start off with explaining exactly what I mean..

FPS combat with guns.. pistols.. rifles etc.. in a 3D game with a first person camera.

Examples: Counter Strike, Call of Duty.

But I don't want the game to be so much a deathmatch.

If you look at games such as The War Z and DayZ..
It's very hard to play the game with other players unless you are in a clan etc, Because if you see another player in these games.. You have no choice really but to stay hidden/run away or kill them before they see you.

You can't really walk up to them and start talking, find out their intentions.. if it's possible to team up or just share the area they are at.

Because if they want to they can just shoot you and you're dead before you can react.. It's all about who shoots first.

What you could do is make it take a more shots to kill another player.. but it would likely have the same outcome.. let's say each bullet does 10% health damage... then the player who start shooting first is likely to win the fight with 10-30% health remaining.

I also find this type of FPS combat to be very boring.. *Basically* all you do is hold your cursor over the target and spamm mouse button 1.

I much more would prefer a FPS combat if it wasn't guns they used but magic.. You can be a lot more creative then and create an interesting combat system.. Imagine for example WoW combat system if it was FPS instead of auto target.

Also, If it's more medieval with bow and arrow it's also better because then it's much more possible to dodge those arrows and predict where they land if it's very far or where he is aiming (arrows are much slower travel speed than bullets) if enemy isn't so far away.. you can even use a shield then to protect yourself.

But what do you think is good ways to make an FPS with guns more interesting (more RPGish and less ""who shoots first wins"")?

Another example is Fallout 3 and FO: New vegas..
I find the combat there to be really boring.. Even tho they have realyl good hit detection to see if the bullets hit the arm/torso/right leg/left leg/head/etc.. You basically just stand there and trade hits with your target until either one of you die.. which is always the enemy because enemies don't have all those stimpacks for example.. And because the AI is really bad and doesn't take cover or anything.. just stands there and shoots/chases you if they lose 100% of line of sight to you.
But even if the AI was better it would still be pretty boring.

A fight against a mutant for example is both of us standing infront of each other and just shooting at each other for a minute, reloading, shooting, reloading, shooting.. it looks ridiculous and it's boring.

The mutant has more health and better armor but the player has lots of stimpacks and will win in the end.

Another example of a game that actually has made it accidentally interesting is Gunz.
That game would of been boring if the players didn't find a glitch witch made them jump around like ninjas all over the walls and flying around in the air by pressing 100 buttons at the same time (not easy) which makes it much harder for someone to shoot you when you are all over the place.

It's also important that it was a glitch because if it was intended they probably would have made the glitch more user friendly to do and then it wouldn't have been as interesting/skill based anymore.

But what if you want to make your FPS a bit more realistic (no super ninja powers etc).. Something that would be interesting even on a plain map without obstacles?

Edit:
Also to add, Even if it wasn't manual aiming but auto target.. Even then I can't see how you could make it more interesting.
Take a turn based game like fallout 1+2.. Combat in that game was pretty boring too.. Just had to prioritize targets mostly, decide who is most important to kill first, who to cripple etc.. In a stretch you could say it's just trading hits in that game too.. specially if you imagine a 1v1 in that game.",,False,self,t5_2qimq,1368502759.0,,,True,t3_1eak2t,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1eak2t/how_to_make_an_fps_less_fpsish/,

Servers with persistent stats that aren't too demanding, think DayZ type servers and amount of people playing at the same time.

There would have to be a maximum or scaling of some kind of the amount of units one can bring along to a battle to prevent massive, server crashing battles, since Players can bring AI units along like in the campaign.

* What are some short comings (can be purely anecdotal) that you find with most eSports titles?
* Is there a way to make shooters/FPS more watchable?

Critiques or random new thoughts very welcome!,7,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1f45ki/need_help_determining_the_setting_and_background/,"I am about to begin development on a turn based strategy video game and I need some help with the setting of the narrative. As a programer foremost, story and background are what I struggle with.

As of right now the game will be 1v1, player vs player with each player controlling a finite amount of units on the board through a so-called ""master"" - or whatever you want to call it - who in turn makes all of the moves for the player. The player never sees this ""master"" but the player knows that they are there. The board will be of hexagonal design with the viewpoint being isometric. As it is a turn based strategy game, each player will have a turn to plan out their moves. The game is intended to make the player think before acting, attempt to out think their opponent and make decisions that mater with lasting impact over the remainder of the 1v1 match.

My question is, what would drive the people who are controlling the pieces, these so called ""masters"" to begin such a game? Let me be clear, I am not talking about that human player sitting at the physical computer, I am talking about the person who executes the players commands by moving the pieces, and the player can kind of roll play as. This question is about the setting and somewhat about the story of the game. The time era is not really set yet, so that makes this question more or less extremely open ended.

My initial thought would be to have an Ender's Game style scenario, a war game played by the participants to gain standing, only that instead of exclusively gaining standing they would also gain resources for whom they represent. Something like their home town, their country, or their world. Again, kinda open ended.

1367853288.0,7,self.gamedesign,1dsnjt,[Tabletop] Untitled Space Ship Combat Game Design Document,9,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1dsnjt/tabletop_untitled_space_ship_combat_game_design/,"**Premise**

To provide strategic naval combat in a 2D space environment that mimics modern/traditional naval combat. Players will deploy a variety of space ships and build customized fleets using point values to attempt to defeat their opponents.

**The Pieces**

Originally slated to be a CSG, patents and expensive costs of creation are getting in the way of that. With the advent and costs associated with 3D printing it has been decided to shift the project to a more traditional design of plastic ships on plastic bases, with the base providing some of the combat stats and associated cards providing the rest.

The ships themselves have a detailed ""scheme"" on their base (See Figure 1). This layout shows color coded lines of fire, turning angles, and other information that is important for players to adhere to when moving/attacking with ships.

**Phases**

*Start of Game*

At the beginning of the game, each player rolls 2D6, the one who rolls highest may choose to go first or second. The player who goes second (from here on out referred to as Player 2, player going first as Player 1) may choose a designated starting area to place their ships. Then when they are finished Player 1 may place theirs in another starting area.

*Movement*

Player 1 may then make the first move by moving each ship up to its movement value (TBD universal, universal/class, or individual) and within its turning radius (displayed by two marks on the base of the ship, see Figure 1). Instead of moving a player may opt to simply turn a ship along its turn radius, or to not do anything at all with a ship. When Player 1 has finished their moves, Player 2 may move their ships in the same way. Each ship may only be given an action once during the movement phase to turn/move/or do nothing.

*Combat*

Once both players have finished moving their ships, the combat phase begins. Each ship has printed ""color arcs"" on their bases and weapons tagged of the same colors (See Figure 1). These arcs designate the line of fire for each weapon group. Player 1 may begin combat by selecting a ship they control, and declaring a target within line of fire of one or more of the weapons of their ship (If a player has enemies within multiple arcs of fire, they may target multiple enemies, however they cannot ""split fire"" within the same arc between multiple targets. IE: Red weapons can shoot at one foe and Blue weapons at one foe, however Red cannot shoot at two separate foes. All firing for a single ship is done simultaneously and all effects resolve at the same time).

Player 1 then rolls appropriately for each ship to designate whether or not it hits, Player 2 then rolls defense systems for the defending ships, and then damage is resolved (Damage systems still TBD). Each ship may only fire once per arc of fire per combat phase unless stated otherwise. When Player 1 has finished declaring attacks for the turn, Player 2 may then make their attack declarations/resolutions.

*End of Turn*

Once both players have finished attack resolutions and the effects of combat, they then begin the next turn.

**Objectives**

Players may choose to play with one or more objectives to determine how to play out the game and determine a victor.

*Elimination*

Simply put, Elimination is the destruction of your opponent's ships. You win when all of your opponents ships are destroyed and you lose if all of yours are lost.

*Sector Control*

The board is designated pre-game and divided into sectors. As long as the only ships in a sector belong to the same player, that player generates a Victory Point at the end of their turn. If an opponent moves a ship into the sector the sector becomes ""neutralized"" and neither player can gain a point until all opposing ships are removed from the sector. The winner is the one to hit a predetermined number of victory points.

*Homebase*

Each player may field a space station or planetary body with specific rules. You are the victor when your opponents home bases are destroyed and lose when yours is destroyed.

====

*Discussion*

I want combat to be moreso based on strategic placement, good fleetbuilding, and proper combat as opposed to rewarding raw unadulterated luck. While dice will play a role in combat in both offense/defense, I'd like to avoid bigger ships getting one shot by tiny ships randomly (a feature of some tabletops I hate with a passion) so I'd like to implement a damage system/tracking system but I've hit a bit of a wall trying to find a simple way to track that.

I'd also like to consider a ""systems damage"" system, where a ship upon receiving damage can lose access to important systems (IE: damaged engines halves their movement, loss of defensive rolls, etc.).

The three potential combat systems are:

1) Roll for hit, roll defenses, any damage kills

2) Roll for hit, roll defenses, ships have varying damage to kill (requires a marker/counter of some sort!)

3) Roll for hit, roll defenses, ships have varying damage to kill and can have certain systems damaged (requires a marker/counter of some sort!)

I considered potentially using ""battleship"" style damage marking with pegs, maybe different colors represent different systems hit, etc.

I'm also open for any ideas/concepts. The universe/backstory itself are rather fleshed out and I'm moreso interested in locking in game mechanics.

Thanks for your time /r/gamedesign,

I want it to play very ""naval"", IE: strategic positioning/turning, broadsiding, etc. like I'd imagine real space combat would be.

The issue I'm beginning to hit is related to the pacing of the game and phases.

The two main ""methods"" I'm looking at are:

-One action per turn, either move or shoot

-Movement Phase then Shooting Phase

I'm sure there's a potential third+ idea of course, but I'm trying to find a proper way to play this out. Ideally ships would be able to move and shoot in the same turn (logically) since they would basically shoot while moving. While I can't properly commit game design to be ""hyper realistic"" in this regard, I can try my best to get close while maintaining a simple atmosphere.

The other issue I could potentially foresee is the potential for ""kiting"", where a smaller, faster ship could stay out of range of a larger ship and eternally move then fire without him ever being able to approach. I suppose this is negated with objectives/homebases or some such system rather than a ""kill everything"" objective.

Just wanted to bounce ideas, discuss naval-based combat in tabletops. See if you guys have any good ideas/feedback on the idea. What do you guys think?

Edit 1: Think I've decided. Effectively the ""alternating"" system, Player 1 moves first, then Player 2, then Player 1 attacks, then Player 2. This method effectively allows Player 2 to see Player 1 move into position and helps offset the inherent ""first shot"" advantage. I'm also going to limit movement to a ""turn radius"".

It's a bit rough around the edges and fairly old (2008) but still relevant to today's MMORPGs. Amongst other things it shows the darker side of MMORPGs, the addiction, the gold farming and similar stuff.  
It seems to me that most of the negative ""effects"" of MMORPGs are mostly caused by the ""grindy"" skinner box-ian nature of the core mechanics of the game. So it got me wondering, would it be possible to make a MMORPG that would keep all other aesthetics (like the social component, the massive world to explore, the deep ruleset, competitive play etc...) but would leave out the grind.  
How would that even look? I guess one way to make it would be to make all the players characters grind automatically, even when they are offline. The players would only log in a couple of times per day to ""give orders"", manage loot, upgrade skills and similar stuff. I know that there are some real-time text-based browser RPGs that do mostly that, but at least from what I've seen they are not that streamlined as any WoW clone and are definitely not that much popular.  
Do you think that if a game was made and it was an exact clone of a popular MMORPG (like WoW) but with the grind removed, would that make it a worse game? Would it make it better?

A health point system where vehicles take damage depending on what weapon is used, or how many collisions can be endured before resulting in death and respawn

Or 


A stun system where vehicles are temporarily incapacitated when knocked off track or hit giving other cars a chance to pass/gain advantage

Alternatively some completely new system or a combination of the two above?

In my opinion, The hp system makes it a game of stamina where the stun system makes it a game of exchanging hits back and forth

the player who achieves a kill under the hp system will have more satisfaction but it will take a larger toll on the victim's experience.  Whereas with the stun system there is a lesser toll for the victim.

It's a variation of an Alternate Reality Game (ARG), and as such tries to fuse the game into your own reality, breaking out of the traditional game sandbox. I call F-ARG (Forensic ARG) to the game's format because, instead of being played as the story happens like in an ARG, it's played after the story have occurred in the real world.

This roughly explains the format: The player starts with just a SMS message from Mark Lane. From there, he has to reproduce Mark's steps, find what he found, and live a discovery adventure just like he did. The idea is to make the player feel that he's uncovering a real case. The game is heavily based on real-world facts and news, and is highly visual. Hundreds of photos will let the player revive Mark's adventure as if he was there.

The game is still played on a computer device, but there is no software. The player is enticed to take the challenge and go out to cyberspace looking for things that will help him discover and solve the case. The truth is somewhere out there, on the Internet. He's out in the wild. The Internet is millions of times bigger than a computer game sandbox. It's a kind of 21st century treasure hunt, but much more complex, mixed with cryptography, problem-solving, forensic work, intertwined with a strong narrative featuring a hollywood-style plot.

Due to the special characteristics of the game, it can be played on any computer or tablet (Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, Android) as long as there is access to roam the Internet

This game format gets people intrigued but also confused. It might sound weird and unattractive.

If you need more info, you can see a trailer here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA9btPAlz-U) a blog here (http://www.indiedb.com/games/mark-lanes-logs-project-human) and the official site here (http://www.zorean.com/marklane)

If you were a player, would you clearly understand the game's design and how to play it?
What would you expect to find and do?
Ultimately, would you feel compelled to try it out?
How would you change the message (how the format is presented)?

You can check out the game on this [Website](http://fatal-reaction.com) and you can download it for free [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fatal-reaction/id595860429?ls=1&amp;mt=8).

Currently the game has multiplayer and missions. It has one in app purchase that unlocks more guns. These guns can be used in missions and multiplayer sessions. I am looking for different ways to add more depth to the game. Here are some of my options:

1. I can add powerups in levels. Currently there are no powerups such as health, bouncy pads etc. This should increase the replay value of the levels. It might increase the complexity for some.

2. I can add a leveling system for the multiplayer. Right now there aren't many things to unlock. I can add new guns etc. The main problem here is that not too many people play online because there aren't many people playing online. I see people searching for a match and every once in a while they will find one. Most of the time no one else is looking. The leveling system might increase the number of people playing online or it will not be used as not too many people are playing online. Not sure which direction it will go.

3. Character customizations. Right now the characters are very bland and don't have much detail. They are stick figures. I can add clothing and other accessories. Not sure how much this is going to be used.

4. Increase the depth to the gameplay. Add new types of enemies and make goal based objectives instead of just being a deathmatch.

5. Work on a new game. Take what I have now and add a new twist. The app was not picked up by apple's new and noteworthy team and thus did not get that initial publicity.

1366482936.0,5,self.gamedesign,1cr5tg,Let's discuss character customization in MMORPGs,9,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1cr5tg/lets_discuss_character_customization_in_mmorpgs/,"Why, you ask? Because the recent batches of MMOs have suffered, among other faults, from a lack of 'content'. Content is just stuff to do, but somewhere along the line developers seem to have narrowed it down into dungeons, raids, and quests.

I'd argue that character customization is content too, and VERY lucrative to a lot of players (see league of legends skins for how lucrative). I'd like to skip the appearance customization portion though, since it's been pretty well explored and is overall fairly intuitive.

If you folks are willing, I'd like to discuss two specific forms of character customization: Skill and Stat.

**Skill Customization**: This is an area that older games like Star Wars Galaxies really went in depth with, but newer games have more or less discarded, primarily due to balance concerns. The problem here tends to be that, where build diversity exists, there will be an optimal build for PvE, which will then be used. This has proven true in practice, but is there a way around it?

PvE environments require what they are designed to. If certain encounters need various forms of CC, then the players will have to spec accordingly. What if they have to trade damage for that CC? Is that a fun or meaningful choice if they're 'forced' into diversifying? What if the raid is looked at as a whole, rather than on a per encounter basis? Players need to plan their specs for the whole raid, adding more planning and diversity. Again though, is that even fun? Is that really customization? 

I wonder if it's even possible to promote customization in a competitive PvE environment or if it should be left to PvP.

**Stat Customization** has similar problems. The ideal stats will always be mathed out in a PvE situation. At the same time, it's satisfying to watch the numbers go up, to figure out (or look up) which specific stats are best for you, and to have goals to increase those specifically. The WoW approach is to have a few stats whose priority is more important depending on the class and level of gear. This doesn't really feel like customization, but on some level it is and it *can* be satisfying.

Maybe without the standard class or dps/healer/tank constructs, stats can be more meaningful? What if there's no threat, and it's important for everyone to build a certain level of survivability? It seems difficult to promote diversity without forcing it though. Maybe this should be the case in certain scenarios? But then people are forced to have gear sets just for those? What if they can modify their stats on the fly? Does it become too tedious then, another obstacle?

I've mostly been questioning PvE thus far, because stats in PvP can be much more flexible. A game where you can decide to build your healer tanky at the cost of healing a little less isn't so difficult to design. Difficult to balance maybe, but personal playstyle can be customized much more in a PvP environment. It seems though that nobody really does this anymore. The only 'PvP' specific stat in WoW is a generic PvP power that makes you do more damage to players. Same sort of thing in SWTOR. That customization could exist, but developers don't bother anymore. I expect balance problems, complexity problems, and the fact that it only matters for those who PvP all contribute to this, but it seems like an untapped area of content.

So if you've gotten this far, here are my key questions:

*Is it worth it to try to have an in depth skill/stat system if only PvP players will be able to make use of the customization it offers?*

*Is is possible to have an MMO where stat/skill customization matter in PvE in a way that is actually fun? How?*

*Do enough players actually enjoy that sort of customization to be worth the time to balance it?*

And then for a little fun:

*What are some stats (that could be passive, on gear, affect a skill, whatever) that might offer fun customization in a clever way. Bonus points if the effect can't just be mathed out.*

I know that was a wall of text but my hope is to get a good discussion going here. Thanks for reading if you did and please share any thoughts you have.

Most I've been able to solve but there is one that I'm rather stumped about.

I'll start with some short points that are necessary to understand the problem.
    * The city the players has build will be simulated when they are offline, resources increase.
    * There are two types of resources in the RTS genre. Resources that are required for upkeep, and as such are consumed at a stable rate, and resources that are used only at the player's behest. For example, food is consumed daily by units, stone is only consumed when a player erects a new building.

The space in RTS storehouses tends to be limitless, but in the game I'm designing storehouses will only be able to house a finite number of resources (based on the volume of said resources).

The problem that arises from this is that as time passes while a player is offline, the resources (in this example stone and food) will fill up the storehouse, and at this point the amount of food will start to go down and the amount of stone will start to go up. If there is 50 stone and 50 food when the storehouse is at it's limit, and 1 food gets taken out, it will either be replaced by 1 stone or by 1 food, if it gets replaced by stone then you have 51 stone and 49 food, since stone wont ever get taken out unless there is player input, food will keep being taken out until the entire storehouse is filled with stone.

What kind of solutions to this problem can I implement, without inconveniencing the player (by, for example, saying the storehouse can only ever have 50 stone an no more). I'm rather curious to hear other peoples thoughts on this.

EDIT: formatting doesn't seem to work for me, which is weird.

**EDIT 2: A possible solution that has come forwards from this is having containers for the upkeep resources. Containers take up slots in the storehouse and can either be full or empty, thereby creating a reserved space for the resources in question, which is easily understandable for players, and since the players create the containers they themselves get to choose how large the reserved section of the storehouse is.**

The game is a team-based space shooter with a strong focus on micromanagement. You control a space ship, mine resources and construct buildings that make bigger and better space ships you can fly. The goal is to destroy the opponent team HQ. The game map represents a single solar system. Basically a MOBA-inspired game in space with a twist.

Since the game is based on multiplayer I need a model that can pay for the servers while making the game free to play. I have no interest in making a fortune.

My plan was to make the game completely free during the beta phase. For the release version I'd implement a skill system that allows a small edge in combat and introduce a very cheap premium member status that allows you to go over a certain skill cap. Everyone who participated in the beta would get the premium status for free. Since this doesn't scale well with an increasing player base, I would work on a global war system where every battle decides ownership of a single solar  system in a small galaxy. At this point the game would require a very cheap subscription that allows you to go over the skill cap, where existing players get a long-term subscription for free.

I'd like to go the Riot way selling only cosmetic content, but selling space ship skins doesn't really fit in this game. We all hate pay-to-win so I'd work on making the skill cap minimal - it would almost feel like donating. I'm totally open for alternative ways on funding this.

EDIT: I'm including a more detailed game description for context.

&gt;In the ongoing fight between the forces of Blue and Red, you and your team have been dispatched to establish a presence in a far away solar system. Five blue shuttles are warping in near the J5 planet - fourth from the star, one carrying the crucial HQ building module. You order 3 of your team mates to inspect the major celestials and asteroid fields. After receiving their reports you decided to deploy your base of operations near an asteroid field between the second and the third planet. You regroup and align to the asteroid field. Mid-warp your long range sensors pick up something near the asteroid field. Brace yourself.
&gt;
&gt;The warp engines shut down and you jump back to subwarp space. *Dampeners on*. *Target that shuttle*. The red shuttle starts charging his warp engines but it's too late. A pod emerges from the debris and warps in the direction of the star. Now they know where we are. You deploy your HQ and two shuttles start mining ore from a nearby asteroid. Other two shuttles start warping towards random celestials in order to scout where the Reds have deployed their base. In the meantime you start producing a scaffolding module and a factory module from the HQ. While your are locking the scaffolding with your tractor beam, one of the mining shuttles locks the factory module. You drag it off and deploy it nearby, your team mate installs the factory module and starts the factory building construction. Dozens of small drones start zooming around the scaffolding and after a minute or so the building is ready.

I'm really sorry, I just wanted to write a short story. Anyway I hope you got a better description of the setting I'm trying to achieve. The game view is 2D top-down focused on your ship. The map is really large with choke points near planets, moons, nebulae and asteroid fields. Fights are short, risky, somewhat skill dependent and not that frequent. One match should last for about an hour.

EDIT2: From the feedback below that fits the game I've concluded that I should be selling monthly premium status that gives them increased leveling rate and various other small benefits like premium status icons, match-making priority queue and access to in-game voice comms.

I'm coming to you to ask for help with my senior year project. I'm creating a tabletop role-playing game (Similar to Dungeons and Dragons).

In doing so, I have three goals:

* **Simplicity**: I want the system to be easy enough for someone who hasn't played an RPG before to be able to pick it up quickly, without guidance from an experienced player.

* **Modularity**: I want the simple tools to be able to interact in complex ways.

* **Depth**: I want the complex interactions to create large amounts of additional content, so that the simplicity does not limit player options.
Right now, I am testing Character Creation. You can, of course, read beyond the rules that I ask you to, but it will take longer. Later, I will be asking for feedback on more mechanics, but right now, I want the system basics to be hammered out.

I really want to extensively test this, so I'm hoping that you will take this survey and ask anyone who you think might be interested in this to fill it out as well. 

If you are interested, you can start with [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FWxQZY91-wqmqYKSJwoFF71i-yzYHls8V-cnrn1Cldk/viewform).

To begin Character Creation, read the [Rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zy93-9TgME_XYbyHXS5RfCCl3QgPYSu47m4yq9anadY/edit). You only need to read the first section - you do not need to read Character Advancement or beyond.

You'll select [skills](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dMPYZUpqiy_N6uCjY5Z1bzFlXeJdKYCzzPO4GZ3G5A4/edit), [spells](https://docs.google.com/document/d/187TU9zIrK4DhlpZJsUliWuM32gDeN66DprvCBWDXQHY/edit) (if relevant), [perks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14yczvYS-7xXNF_QSzQhnYlfgCz4A1sLt1tHa1ROHxmk/edit), [equipment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18541ph9R1c2eZpOLAbmP8DjuwZDkX-Dv5ZIBTyhS0s4/edit), and your character's [race](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TxKtQcT9hW-Sm6MbPgmzdn0PCgRRO8cIyM4nGrHC_AU/edit).

The character creation process can be as short as five to ten minutes (for someone fairly familiar with the system) but no longer than fifteen to twenty minutes (for someone who has never seen the rules before).

The whole process, including the survey, shouldn't be too much longer than thirty to forty-five minutes.

Its kind of a unique game design concept because card games are sort of born as a way to represent abstract game concepts in a real-world form (similar to pen and paper rpg's) but they've been coming in hot in digital form as a throwback to old experiences. But when I play a tcg in real life, it's largely to complete with friends and hang out, but I think digital ccgs have an entirely differently appeal.

I think a big focus of ccgs is on the advancememt -- beating campaign, earning achievements, growing your collection, etc. Similar to a traditional video game. Sure the pvp and the ladder climbing are fun aspects too, but I think even if you had a super fun game, if everything was available to a player immediately people would grow bored of it quick.

And I want to jump a level deeper -- people love that gambling aspect (and maybe more importantly the artificial content lengthening) that comes with boosters. I don't know if its the lack of decision making involved in what to buy, or just that rush when you open something good, but I think a lot of people would rather spend statistically more money ripping boosters than cheery picking singles you want (or worse singles you don't want but need for completeness)

I think a lot of this comes from the f2p model and playing games earns you rewards. But is it the best way? Can the reward be something other than expanding your collection? Is it a case of people not challenging the norm? Boosters are clunky in a world that doesn't suffer from physical distribution issues. Fantasy flight ditched the whole notion all together with LCGs. Boosters prey on people's wallets (and can be downright abusive to competitve players in booster only ccgs) and offer only game roadblocks that people seem to willingly love.

Why not have NPC's wearing all kinds of clothes from Armani to the GAP. This would certainly add variety to games and save development time. And now would be fresh since the new generation of games are on their way.
The same thing could be done with cars. If you look at GTA, you see the same 10 models of cars being used over and over again. Why not have 3D models of cars being licened to any game? In real life you see Ford, Volvo, Ferrari, Subaru, Mercedes etc. Many cars. Why not have those models replicated in games?
Even future cyberpunk settings can benefit from this. I'm sure coca cola will be around in 10-20 years time and I doubt Adidas is going to go away. Why not have these companies virtual stores licences out to every game and let developers work on the details.
Another possibility is to have companies license out concept products to futuristic worlds. Like the nokia bendable phone or samsung's future concept products

I've never designed a game before, but I woke up with an idea the other day, and I quite like it. The working title is Spacebrawl. You and up to three of your friends play as manic, hypercognitive war AIs, each with a differing specialty, who colonize and strip a series of planets in the pursuit of complete dominance over all other sentient beings.

To describing the actual game. It takes place on a table, with one planet card for each player already dealt out. In the middle, there are various piles of cards containing purchasable abilities that go into a player's deck, buildings that go onto a player's planet, and upgrades that go onto a player's AI card. The object of the game is to of course destroy all of the other players, with the ascending pile of resources that are obtained from building upgrades onto the planets. 

At the moment, I have each planet and AI output a set amount of materiel, energy, and exaflops each turn. These are used to purchase and activate abilities, cards, and upgrades, as well as to squabble over planets. Each is predominantly used to purchase and activate one type of thing. Materiel is mostly used to attack. Energy is mostly used to build your planetary economy. Exaflops are used to navigate your ever-expanding deck, and to use various card actives. 

Something that's helped me to get *this* far (not too far) is to envision the type of experience I want to create for the player. What I want is a game that is fast-paced, replayable, and complex. I want it to be focused around card combinations, unorthodox tactics, last-minute grand-gesture stupid ideas, and utter dickery. Player victory should be sudden, crushing, and accompanied by initial yelling followed by the slow realization of ""ahhh but I could have done this!"" It should be decently easy to learn, but I'm comfortable with the idea of there being a 30-minute learning curve or so walking in.  

Here are the things I'm having problems with:

* Turn order and ordinary action counts. This is probably the nitty gritty stuff. Each turn somebody should be able to buy something and play a card. When do they get to build stuff or play the card that they just bought? 
* I'm having some issues making combat work in a way that feels good to me, but it serves such a purpose in the game. Actual destruction needs to be around because that's almost the currency that these AIs trade in. I want it to be almost this rare occurrence that happens when you have a planet optimized for it, huge particle cannons and incredible destruction at a distance. I would make it smaller and more frequent with ships, but the game is already pretty damn complicated.
* I'm not sure how to get the planet-squabbling quite hashed out either. Is it a type of bidding war? An actual war? Is it claimed? What would be the fastest and most amenable to interference, but still would let a planet be actually obtained in the end?
* One of the more important things to me seems like the chaos of the battlefield. I almost want to have some variety of simultaneous turn, but I don't know how to implement that without making it too hard to play.
* I feel like I'm overcomplicating things. Three resources? So many actions and actives? How many cards of each type should I shoot for to make the game playable without giving myself a huge headache?
* Is there a way for me to balance it without playing it yet? Are there any resources available on how to balance a game of this type before giving it a go, or should I just play it and nerf whatever stands out as broken?
* Also, how am I doing?

I can't seem to figure out how I'd like to balance a sword in a game directly inspired by the setting and themes of Metroid while still having the gun as a central aspect of the game.

It's my opinion that you can't have a truly good Metroidvania game if the enemies and environments are not finely tuned around the things the player can do at that specific time. Metroid is what it is because you get an upgrade, and realize that it's what you need to get to this section of the map. So this is the kind of thing I need to work out before trying to develop any of the assets for the game.

When you get the Ice Beam in Super Metroid you quickly realize that it's what you need to get higher up in Brinstar, and that's the same kind of feeling I want. But I also want to differentiate the character in more ways than just the art and upgrades. I want them to have a different move set from the get go, and this is where the idea for the sword comes from. I want the character to not only look different, but also have different options in combat.

So how do you introduce a sword into that, while still having a gun that plays similarly to the Armcannon from Metroid? Do you make it slower, or faster? Do you give it one, or more attacks? How hard should it hit compared to the gun? Should it have high knock back? What kind of upgrades should it get? Should it get one where it can instantly kill most weaker enemies like the Screw Attack from Metroid?

So I'd like to know how you'd do it, or how you'd like to see it done. What do you think would be a good – or bad – way to handle it?",,False,self,t5_2qimq,False,,,True,t3_1is0f1,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1is0f1/having_trouble_designing_some_gameplay_elements/,

I've been making a 2D game with basic FFT gameplay and rulesets for a while now and this idea suddenly came to mind last night:

**What if say, during the day you have the ability to make your own fort (let's say you'll start from a village) and at night (or upon a timed encounter) the whole map became your battlefield with FFT style gameplay?**

Possible features and rulesets:

1. The AI that came to your village will have **their own jobs and stats.** 

a. You'll be able to choose all of them for the battle with the possibility of perma-death if the AI ally doesn't survive the battle. Broken I know, but we'll put a threshold depending on the number of enemy units attacking.

b. **Their stats grow during the day**. Depends on the roles available in the village of course. ie Knights grow it stats by killing stray monsters/guard a Freeman (basic job, can level into classes depending on what they do + stats)

2. **Form of currency based on resources available**. Trade resource to ""a job board"" to entice AI from a different area coming to help your village.

3. First person/third person free movement during the day/fort building. Grid-locked during battle.

----

The Battle:

1. I'm really open to anything on this one. From a speed/agility based ruleset similar to SMT: Devil Survivor series, to a move-all-per-turn like in FFT/SRW series. I'm leaning towards the latter tthough

2. **A job vs job weakness**. Since there are abilities 1-2 for each class, balancing them *seems* to be much easier this way but I maybe wrong on this one.

3. **A battle reward**. Open to suggestion . Enticing player to look forward to the battle during the night is something hard to achieve unless they in it for the battles/fort building/city building.

----

**So what do you guys think? Yay/Nay? Any flaws I didn't consider? Or general thoughts on the idea?**

I'm planning for the AI to follow a set of ""availability schedule"" depending the time of the day (ie advance interaction with thief, drunklord at nights) similar to Radiata Stories for the PS2. Of course you have ability to recruit those rogues AI depending on what response you gave them.

Diablo has a pretty unique item system, which make it very interesting to grind for better loot. You get a rare item, and then you have to identify it to ""upgrade"" the item. You only do it once and you get all the bonus.
You have to pay about 100$ to identify your item.


But what if, instead of giving all the bonus of the item in one go, we would give them one at the time? You identify it once for a very low price, and it gives you one new ability. You can then identify it for a second time, but the price would be higher, and you would get a second ability.

Will that make the player care more about his items? Or will it just make it not worth it to grind anymore (since he spent so much money on his current equipment)?",,False,self,t5_2qimq,False,,,True,t3_1es41k,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1es41k/diablo_identify_system/,

Basically an aquaman game without aquaman, and maybe on land.

First off, the most straightforward idea would be a semi RTS like Brutal legend or that one with the demon and the minions. But that genre is always plagued with bad controls and limited gameplay.

Going mobile, it would be like a simplified RTS where you select and animal type and get them to do different attacks. It would be a tug of war type with 2 players, using hard counters to overcome your opponent. 

Like the one above, a fighting game with a character that uses animals to fight would be just a different coating with a animal theme on it, nothing new about it.

finally, a farming game, with no combat, just use your animals to rebuild a destroyed world, Elephants lift heavy objects, termite cut through wood etc. But the problem comes as each individual animal becomes a mechanic by itself. The whole thing becomes a really simple puzzle/farming hybrid.

In the latest SC2 expansion, the Medivac and the Void ray obtained what I'll call 'free skills', basically, these are cooldown related skills that give the medivac a temporary boost and void ray temporary higher damage against armored units.

If I'm not mistaken, these are the first skills that do not require a trade off of any kind.

For most general skill, energy is required, upgrades are required to obtain higher starting energy and using one skill deprives the player of another for a few moments.

Another version would be Stim, which gives marines faster attacking and moving speed, but reduces their current hp.

Transformative skills trade off against base stats. Siege tanks get different stronger attacks and range, but lose mobility. Hellbats/Lions gain and lose range attacks/armour etc.

The game was developed by allan alcorn and released in 1972 by atari corporations. Soon, pong became a huge success, and became the first commercially successful game. Today the pong game is considered to be the game which started the video games industry, as it proved that the video games market can produce significant revenues.

Atari sold more than 35000 pong machines, this figure is only about one third of the total number of pong machines that were sold globally, since many pong clones appeared shortly after the debut of the original atari pong game.

so heres what the designers secondary role should be..
to play the game.. he should be getting paid by the hour playing the game and designer is best for this role because 1 he has more freetime than other roles and he is also best for the playing/testing of the game because he is the designer.

Lets say I have a 50 page document describing in detail a game. Everything about it, the central idea, the feel of the art style, sound effects and the music, the main mechanics, the protagonist, NPC's, the story, the levels, everything that you would need to make the game with minimal direction.  
Would making that count as pulling your own weight in the scope of a game development company?  
  
I mean, I know that there are a lot of people with a lot of ideas and that having ideas is easy. Having said that, I know that having ideas is what I'm best at. I can program but I don't have the skill to make a full blown game engine and even fidgeting around with game making tools and libraries like CraftyJS, pygame or even construct 2 becomes tedious after a while. I know enough about music to understand and recognize a good score but I'm miles away from being able to compose  or record one. I can imagine in great detail how the game world would look and feel, but I can't draw to save my life. I grew up on games and movies so I know in general what a good story would look like, and I think I am good at constructing a storyline in a broad kind of way, but english is my second language and I don't read books that much so I can't write dialogue.  
It feels like having a great fleshed out idea doesn't mean that much if I am not able to help in the actual development.  
  
I guess what I'm asking is, if I take the document, and find a programer, artist, composer, writer, etc. would I be right in feeling that I am bringing enough to the table by just helping them to coordinate and create what I have imagined?

At the title screen, there is the options: Kick Ass Dojo...

At this dojo you have the ability to script combo moves. Most likely this will need to be an unlock at some point in the game. At the beginning it wouldn't make sense for a user to script any moves because he hasn't got far enough where combo moves would be useful.

So lets say half way through the game, you unlock the dojo. 

You can take all the basic punch moves, jump moves, and place them together. You can apply slow motion, speed up etc... to each move. You can have your character pull out guns, knives, swords, etc... they can throw the items... think garrys mod but more confined. Not the ability to do anything but allow the user the illusion of freedom of choice. 

Essentially it is a minecraft for action games. You give the users the tools to build their own experience.

You could also limit the amount of movements, slow motions etc. Have power meters (i.e. they get tired after certain combos) You could allow them the ability to master these combos. Or even if they put together the correct combo of moves it unlocks new combos. Thus it is almost like a real dojo... 

Maybe you could even apply the freemium model to this... making users pay for the ability to customize their combos. I don't know the sky is the limit... but I feel like this could be really cool if executed... even if you executed it poorly...

33% share? 10%? 5%?.. between artist and programmer it's harder to say ofcourse it depends on the game if it's not a lot of art assets needed then ofcourse artist gets less than programmer but some games are mostly about art then artist gets atleast even share as programmer.

Programming is always what I've done the best, and is what I've always liked to do. Math isn't. Do I really get no chance at all? Do every programmer actually has to know all of this just to develop games?!

I'm looking to assemble a team to join my ""company"" Halbrid Games. I'm programming a game currently that if I can finish by mid January, I'll be putting on discs and selling at my local con when it starts. Of course, each member would receive a cut of the profits.

Here's what I need:

Scenario writer (To write a story and come up with ideas)
Sprite artist (Pixel art mainly)
Sound engineer (For awesome music)

I know it's not that much of a team, but that's really all I need since I'm doing the programming myself.

Message me for any more info you need, I'll be here. Thanks!",,False,self,t5_2qimq,False,,,True,t3_14yjqw,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/14yjqw/looking_to_assemble_a_team/,

I figured with the new influx of people it would be good to share my views about what a game designer's job really is.  Hopefully this article can help frame the conversation into something really productive.  Would love to hear your thoughts, and keep spreading the word about /gamedesign!
