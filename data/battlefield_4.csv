1371228915.0,542,self.battlefield_4,1gcj48,To DICE: Please implement a Shooting-Range in BF4,618,76,119,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1gcj48/to_dice_please_implement_a_shootingrange_in_bf4/,"Now that practicing modes for air vehicles have been confirmed it would be really nice if there also was a shooting-range on which we could try out new guns and attachment combinations before diving into real multiplayer. 

I feel like a lot of weapons are neglected in BF3 because it's hard to adapt to a new gun if you're constantly get stomped on while trying to get used to new properties like recoil patterns, sights, rate of fire, damage and time to kill. Some people just get frustrated with ""ruining their stats"" and stick to their beloved M16 or AEK. 

Same reasoning goes for fps noobs who can learn and experiment with different firing techniques other than spray and pray , train recoil control to become more efficient and ultimately improve their overall online experience by practicing the main game mechanic in a save and controlled environment. 

While older titles included things like offline bot-matches or onslaught which were great for this purpose it is understandable that a full fledged AI and a working offline mode can't be made with all the other tasks on schedule this close to release. But a shooting-range satisfying some basic properties should be feasible: 


___________________________________________________________ 

• The shooting-range should be accessible for all players of BF4 without having the need to rent a server to host it on. (something like an offline map) 

• All (unlocked) multiplayer weapons + attachments should be accessible. (simply include the spawn menu from the multiplayer) 

• All weapons should have their exact multiplayer stats in terms of dmg, recoil etc. 

• The shooting-range targets should be spottable and take the same dmg as players in SC/HC (let us select our preferred mode before launching the shooting-range) 

• Build a map in the spirit if of Ghost Recon (→ http://youtu.be/emjQSpMEezc?t=1m11s  http://youtu.be/3QTEgc7JWmA?t=10m17s ←) including still targets, moving targets, different types of cover for both the player and the targets, different distances and a unlimited supply of ammo and explosives for the player 

• It doesn't have to be fancy, immersive or realistic it just should serve the purpose

My name is Daniel Lingen, and I'm the EA employee responsible for putting on / producing the Live Stream. Of course I couldn't do it alone - We had a huge help from the great folks over at Tekamaki, who operated the cameras / tricaster etc. We also have to thank our professional casters Corey Dunn and Alex Mendez, as well as our segment host Lisa Malambri. Finally, a HUGE thanks goes out to all of the DICE developers and community streamers that made guest appearances on the stream. Not only were they a great source of information, they were the ones who got the code to where it is today - rock solid and ready to be streamed to the millions of fans watching at home. 

Now that we've spent the weekend recovering from what can only be described as an awesome E3, I wanted to reach out to Reddit and say THANK YOU for being such an awesome community. 

Corey, Alex, and myself spent a great deal of time on Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook during the live stream. We did our best to get your questions covered and confirm / deny anything that we could. We also sent on your positive vibes to the team back in Stockholm, and let everybody running the booth know you were watching. 

We also spent a great deal of time in the Twitch.TV/Battlefield chat trying to get questions answered there too. 

Beyond this, many of the internal teams - both at DICE and EA - were super excited to see all of the positive feedback on the live stream. Putting the show on was a huge effort from all teams, and we're extremely happy with the outcome. Positive feedback definitely helps us push internal campaigns like the live stream through, and for that I am grateful.  

As we move forward, we'll still keep an eye on community sentiment with regards to the livestream. Feel free to send any feedback our way, we're always looking to improve.

Thanks again Reddit! ",EA Person,False,self,t5_2uie9,False,rumor,ea,True,t3_1gj4hv,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1gj4hv/on_behalf_of_the_e3_2013_battlefield_4_live/,

The one thing that really shits me is the circle jerk over the old battlefield games. We get it, they were good, but I don't want to see Battlefield turn into something like COD because everyone wants the same thing everytime around. Can't we just let the devs work their magic?

it was no problem on BC games as we got used to it fast and we used to have an idea what dose it mean form experience and situations we are in.

or at least give us the option to switch it on or off like BC.

on the other hand can we please get a separate voice actors for each role just like we used to in BC, in BF3 the Russian side has literally 1 voice actor talking English. and on the US side the same story as the voice acting gets boring fast.

like for example the Russian engineer voice actor in BC2, that guy had and epic voice and even spoke nice English/Russian.

all the voice actors in BC were great, we want it like that.

who agrees with me ?

I'm sure other fans would like to thank you as well, and I hope they do in the comments.  

DICE, you listened to us.  Seeing things that I *know* were asked for come to life is just unbelievably cool.  Aftermath made me want buildings to fall and change the level, it made me dream that it could be done...  And *holy crap it can be done*.  It shows that you're not just churning out a polished version of an earlier game.  It shows that you're actively trying to evolve the gaming community by changing how the game is played.  That is so goddamn COOL.  

And Battlefront?  And Mirrors Edge 2?  I don't need anything else.  **Knowing** that these games are coming just makes me happy.  Now one of you add me on XBOX so I can finally get your tags.

**Stats during E3** (last 7 days)

* With 23% subscriber growth we are once again the **fastest growing Subreddit**, here is [the link](http://stattit.com/subreddits/by_subscriber_growth_1w/) for comparison, note that we have had an issue with stattit not updating us.

* We had over 450,000 page views (number may be higher)

* We hit multiple news sides with our content (pixelenemy, frontpage of /r/gaming and many larger gaming news sites)

**So, how do you think it went?**

The game presented blew most people's minds, it is simply amazing how DICE listened to the pleas of the community.

From a community perspective, let me summarize how I think everything went

* We had Alex Mendez come and take questions and advise

Thank you Alex! It was great to see you involve the community!

* We had the DICE team on here, answering many questions and cracking jokes

You guys are the best, thanks so much!

* We had users, taking their free time to update us with real time info (like /u/VampireVendetta's list of confirmed features. 

* We had long, informative discussions with little downvoting for opinions

* We had very little spam

**In Summary**

You guys did great, thanks so much for making this E3 so awesome for this sub and for helping add to this great community.

**But as promised, here are some Reminders/announcements**

* we now have flair for the nextgen consoles! 

* please read the wiki and rules

* the downvote button is not a disagree button!

* Try saying suggestion instead of ""Dear DICE""

*Some things about us*

This Sub is opinion censorship free (just don't break the rules)

We are not sponsored and independent from DICE/EA, however; we greatly appreciate their contributions here

*If you have any problems with the sub, a user or if you would just like to chat, message the mods!*

I'll explain by epic scenario analysis:
      
Your main weapon is out of ammo. You hit reload button. Animation begins. Empty mag is dropped. Wild enemy appears during animation. Quick switch to pistol and kill enemy. After switching back to your main weapon, you notice the previously dropped empty mag has reappeared. You then have to start the reload animation ALL over again. This gets extremely annoying, especially if it's a full reload.

Incorporating some sort of reload memory system is something that can only make the gameplay of BF4 smoother and more realistic without taking away from the fun aspect of the game at all. I don't know if something like this would be easy to add or not, especially at this point in development.

Does anyone else know what I'm talking about? Am I making any sense?

Karl Magnus has revealed somethings:
[Link](http://www.twitch.tv/battlefield)

&gt;DarkLord7854:He forgot to mention.. can use pistols in the water :)

* Sprint swim
* Auto lean over thing as in far cry 3
* Suppression is nerfed for all weapons except support weapons and it is also nerfed for close ranged combat
* Also he wants us to keep posting feedback, they can't respond to all the feedback but they do read a lot of these suggestions.
* Diving underwater, you can use pistols when underwater
* 4 pillars which you can spot to make the skyscraper collaps
* ELEVATOR MUSIC YEAAAAH!!!!
* No other maps than Siege of Shanghai(for the alpha in E3)
* You only get bonuses for your Commander for B,C and D
* They apparently have some sick commander stations at E3, no footage tough

Interview with Patrick Bach:

* They are happy with responds from the community to the gameplay footage
* Limited ammo confirmed for MBT(Some claim it regenerates)
* Metal detectors, gates fire extinguishers and more create a more living and interactive environment 
* For some reason the heli which was disabled repaired itself while being on fire, couldn't see a engineer repairing it.
* Reason for levolution is not only to make it look better but also make the game more dynamic so games will be different each time you play. 
* Team and enemy tags are probably switched in spectator mode, The player walked past red icons but killed a blue guy. Probably uses the team the spectator is in so if the spectator is in the opposite team of the person they are spectating the team tags are still from the team they are in.(Fix that)
* Sick wave when the building collapses
* Map is dusty after the collapse of the skyscraper, low visibility 
* Commander adds a layer of value without taking it away from people who don't care about commander.
* [He tweeted the commander station, looks sick!](https://twitter.com/ConsiderIt_dunN/status/344548857679597568/photo/1)
* What the hell was that kind of rocket launcher? Appears to be a [SRAW](http://i.imgur.com/k3BQ3CD.jpg) thanks to triops-300
* 2 jet-skies on the back of the boat, you enter it automatically when exiting the boat. 
* [ZFB05 Vehicle for china](http://www.sinodefence.com/army/armour/zfb05.asp)
* Flash bangs? 
* Defibs are now needed to be charged up before you can revive 
* Vehicle disabling is in, but has been reworked and now takes into account what part was hit 
* Special squad leader commorose
* No custom squads
* The waves are all dynamic and react to things like boats

I didn't record it in action due to the NDA but this screenshot from the already revealed leaked alpha stuff some time ago shows somewhat of the proof http://www.ea.charlieintel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/RVK3YsXh-610x400.jpg

Now the image looks pretty ordinary, however notice how there is a team mate within the AA. This was actually not the case, in the alpha the AA always had a blue team mate symbol above it and was AI controlled. I discovered this by attempting to enter the enemies base for random testing (spawn rape balance, out of bounds timer etc etc) yet in an empty server I began taking damage. I notice the AA had started to shoot me, the out of bounds timer got to me before it did but on confirmation of hitting TAB the server was absolutely empty. Hence an AI controlled AA defense, from what I gather is when a human is not inside the AA a computer AI defends the base on its own.

Now this very well maybe just a thing within the alpha to get people out in the action rather than messing with the base AA but what are your thoughts if this were to be implemented into the main game? Great way to prevent vehicle left and spawn rape? Or another hand holding mechanic that shouldn't have to be put in the game?

I personally love it, but I don't really fly vehicles or go near enemy spawns with choppers and such so I am biased as an infantryman.

They have a prompt to grab a specific weapon. Well, I had tried a few times and never thought it worked because the weapon wasn't in my hands. Well, scrolled all the way down, and found that the weapon I grabbed was a Barrett M82A1, 50 cal semi-auto rifle. It was able to hurt jeeps and helicopters. I got a vehicle hit for 15 when I hit a chopper, so it seems pretty powerful. In another crate was the revolver grenade launcher thing, which I didnt get to use much.

Just thought you guys would like to know, and since I havent seen it posted, I figured I would.


Edit: Apparently I started a bunch of shit with at least one person. I want to be clear, I have been playing the alpha using a friends account. That is the reason I will not be posting a screenshot. I do not know if there is some sort of watermark that could have the account I'm using traced back to the owner. Sorry but that's how it is.

I would also like to point out, that after looking through the MP trailer, I cannot find the same logo in the same locations, so the Battlepickups could have already been removed, they could be triggered by the commander, etc. Things are still changing so take this info with a grain of salt. 

I can confirm that there are three locations. One at B, C, and D. They are at fixed locations, marked by a similar logo to the med/ammo packs on the ground in BF3, except the bullets and medical cross logos are now an M9. B flag contains the MGL. This is the area at the beginning of the multiplayer trailer where they drop the tank through the ground after shooting a pillar out. It seems it is placed there to allow any class to potentially drop the tank through the ground, although it is not limited to this. The M82 was on top of the skyscraper at C flag. Obviously a good vantage point. And, there was one at D but I didn't get to see what it said or grab it, but it contained a ""GL"" in it and had a current BF3 M320 logo. The only restrictions I noticed on the weapons was that they couldn't be resupplied.

I started noticing them towards the end of yesterday's alpha session. The alpha closed before I could get back and see what the D flag one was exactly. Which I will post back.



EDIT 2: They appear after a flag is captured.

I'm a battlefield fan from Shanghai, China. It is really cool that you made a level in Shanghai. The buildings look exactly like the ones from home. I can recognize many landmarks such as the Orient Pearl Tower and the ""bottle opener"" skyscraper. I see that you are trying to bring your audience an authentic feel of the city Shanghai. However, the Chinese words in the city are very strange/awkward..


I'm not sure if humor is intended here or your Chinese translation dude needs to get fired. But there are some examples -- 

http://i.imgur.com/LkpjQDN.jpg &lt;- ""Deadly pan-fried deadly oil""

http://i.imgur.com/ZmzjhWP.jpg &lt;- ""A lion""

http://i.imgur.com/MrUOtQu.jpg&lt;- this one made sense but the red rolling text is gibberish

http://i.imgur.com/S748Tqd.jpg &lt;- the shop to the left of the iron sight says ""and many big shops""

http://i.imgur.com/HR1xlye.jpg &lt;- ""Good suits""


Again, I'm not sure if the inaccuracy or humor is intended here. But this is the worst translation I have seen since the tattoo on a pretty girl's neck that says ""soy sauce"". (she must have thought the word “酱油” looked really cool..)

Hell, I'm willing to do translations for you guys for free. Just have your graphics artist PM me, it will take me a couple of minutes to translate. You can also just tell me that your audience who read Chinese don't matter and leave the Chinese words the way they are. I'll still play the hell out of Battlefield 4 because you have done such excellent job already. I just want to bring this to your awareness.

Big Fan,
 -Yuxin

1371350216.0,126,self.battlefield_4,1gfm74,I hope maps in Battlefield 4 are more open and have better layouts. BF3 had some really jammed designs. Here is why...,161,35,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1gfm74/i_hope_maps_in_battlefield_4_are_more_open_and/,"Battlefield 4 is looking really good so far. A lot of features that were taken out when Bad Company came into play are coming back. Mainly features people had wanted for the past few years like Commander mode, larger squads, voip, etc.

However there is still one problem we're seeing that most will tend to overlook. That is **Map Design**.

Battlefield claims to want to be a teamwork based open world. However we've been seeing a lot of very small cluttered maps, specially in BF3.

Note that small cluttered maps aren't terrible, even BF2 had some like Karkand and Jalalabad. However even those maps allowed more tactical options of flanking and different approaches you can take.

*This really all aims down to one main point. TLDR at the bottom.* 


**What BF4 needs to include with maps is:**

^^*Green* ^^*lines* ^^*are* ^^*routes* ^^*you* ^^*can* ^^take ^^*via* ^^*foot.*

1. **More openly spaced out flags** : Here we have Firestorm. As you can see the actual playing area is merely a small rectangle within the flags on a ""large map"" that have been pushed together with mostly open spaces. Still a fun map, but would be more enjoyable having a large oil facility map. [Something like this](http://4st.me/PqXAQ.png) - Obviously a very crude composition of the same map, but you can imagine how fun it would be having a large map like that with lots of corridors, roads, buildings and even amount of open areas for every type of fighting that way you could play the map more than one round and not be bored by repetitiveness. 

2. **More flanking routes** : Here we see the preview of Shanghai on the commander mode. The map looks great, but look at how it plays. There really is no way to actually attack the other flags aside from pushing straight into the enemy, which obviously is almost impossible. Aside from water route which is vehicle only, there really isn't much. And compare it to Zatar wetlands which allows many ways of taking an objective and going around the enemy. [IMAGE](http://4st.me/EaLwN.png) 

3. **More streets and roads for urban maps** : Maps like Grand Bazaar tend to be a mess of grenades and pointless combat, so much that it has to be played with less people to really have fun. So instead of being forced to play with only 32 players, why not design it large enough for 64 players? [This image shows](http://4st.me/Zh4Gy.png) how there are very little corridors to sneak around buildings compared to Mashtuur where there are a lot more buildings and roads. 

Looking forward to how BF4 turns out, and I really hope that maps are a lot more open and require people to be more versatile to win the match. Rather than just put enemies facing each other and have people blindlessly shoot one direction non-stop. Thats CoD's job, this is Battlefield. We're cooler ;)

*TL;DR: bigger, more open maps that require more teamwork and coordination specially with the commander and squads to win the match.*

I think that it would be really cool if BF4 included night maps that were really REALLY dark. Not like Teheran Higway there you still can see, but a night map that requires a flashlight or a IRNV scope to see really well in the dark. I think that it would me really epic with playing stealthy to for exemple arm M-COMS or sneak past the enemy frontline to afterwards proceed to kill them with silenced weapons! 
Tell me below what you think of this!

Tl;DR: Night maps in BF4 that requires tools to help you see the enemy due to the extreme darnkness.

It doesn't make sense that even though I am in the same tank as another player on my team I cannot talk to them or issue commands. I might be assaulting a flag stealthily with another player but I am not easily able to let him know to keep quiet so we can flank.

I propose that some sort of proximity chat be introduced into the game. When you speak in the game everyone within a 10 foot radius should be able to hear you, friend or foe. Your squad will be able to hear you regardless of their distance away. Games released 10 years ago such as Halo 2 had this feature (albeit not to this scale) and to improve teamwork within BF4 I really think it should be implemented.

Adding voice distortion or radio static to the in-game voices could really increase immersion and make it feel like you are part of a living breathing battlefield. I wouldn't think this proximity voice chat would be too difficult to implement either, and would go a long way in truly making battlefield a team oriented game.

What are your thoughts on this?

As everyone else says, body armor and magnum ammo were a thing in BC2 and there was literally zero reason to use anything else. I like some of the other new ones, the vehicle supports are pretty interesting, and I like that they differentiated the gear a bit more. But I still see ABSOLUTELY NO REASON WHATSOEVER to use any of the perks besides body armor. Just remove it, honestly. I love DICE and it seems like they're actually listening to the community (giving C4 back to supports, making gadgets more mobile, etc) and I think the community outcry against this is overwhelming. 

Please don't shoehorn people into using one thing, it completely defeats the purpose of so many unique specs. And honestly, BF3 already feels like it has a ""body armor"" problem, what with people constantly getting away with the infamous 2% or even 0% health. This will be even more rampant in 4. If 2 dudes at full health both empty the same amount of bullets into each other in the same spots, they should both be dead. Not arguable. Body armor is a crutch and will be absolutely necessary (or at least much better than anything else) in EVERY SINGLE BATTLEFIELD SITUATION except vehicle vs vehicle. Get that shit outta here.

Battlefield 2 was Incredibly flawed, and jets were completely imbalanced. The top spot on the leader-board was nearly always reserved for the guy bombing the crap out of the enemy airfield.

However, the game play since then has been changed significantly. Requiring players to choose one secondary weapon means it is difficult for a plane to combat both air and ground. Good! The problem is that the most effective available alternative to the heat seekers are the rocket pods. And rocket pods reasonable against vehicles, but not good at much else. Bombs would provide a way for jets to target infantry.

There are plenty of ways to balance this addition. Limit the capacity to 1 or 2 bombs, or maybe lowering the maximum speed/maneuverability of the jet.

Here's the bottom line. Giving Helicopters heat-seekers means it doesn't take a level 100 colonel for an attack chopper to kill a jet. Its very rare (on Xbox) to see a good jet pilot effectively help their team, and I think bombs could go a long way to improve their utility.",,False,self,t5_2uie9,1373645818.0,,,True,t3_1i49h0,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1i49h0/bring_back_bombs_for_jets/,

Here are my suggestions.,108,19,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1gli1f/i_hope_dice_doesnt_make_the_same_mistake_with_the/,"I know this is probably early to say, but I'd rather address this now rather than regret not saying it later. Alpha footage didn't exactly raise my confidence on the matter, and it's extremely frustrating to watch DICE make the same mistake twice in a row. 

There are a few things they needs to do in regards to the Commo-Rose in order for it to be effective, that they for some reason didn't in BF3 

* Add a text-feed for all of the call-outs. It's otherwise useless on the China/Russia side since you can't understand what people are asking for and it's going to get drowned out by radio chatter on the US side.

* Make the name of the player flash above his soldier. It helps you identify the player who made the call-out on your screen.

* Make the player flash on the map as well.

All of this stuff was present in... Battlefield 2/2142

The text-feed could either be a separate window or integrated into the chatbox. Since we now have audio that actually calls out the direction your enemy, it should also reflect in the text-feed and it doesn't have to be complicated, like:

* Enemy tank, north! (west/est/south)
* Enemy machine-gunner, south! (etc)

#Now in regards to the chat-box... I honestly believe BC2 had the best chatbox out of the entire series. It was simple and intuitive, which makes the BF3 one look like a definite downgrade. It highlighted the entire message of the player along with his name in accordance to what he was: enemy, teammate squadmate as opposed to BF3 which highlighted just the name.

I [especially liked its simple design](http://img176.imageshack.us/img176/135/bfbc2game20100902211155.jpg) and how it fit right at the top and at the edge of the screen, [as opposed to BF3](http://answers.ea.com/ea/attachments/ea/battlefield-3/388/1/bf3%202012-08-03%2022-51-54-85.jpg) where it just kind of flows in-between the spaces and uses up unnecessary space.

I think an interesting addition would be to make the attacking team not lose once all of their tickets are gone, but once all the attackers are dead. You can't spawn back in on your teammates, but if you're alive still you can come in and try to still get the MCOM. Maybe to avoid one of them just hiding so they can't be killed there is a 3-5:00 minute time limit so it doesn't go on too long.

So right now with BF3 there's little or no advantage to using iron sights. Personally I still love using them. I like the way they look, I like that my vision isn't hindered with zoom, and I like how aiming is done instantaneously. However I think the game misrepresents just how adaptable iron sights truly are.

**Okay, so wtf is ""dynamic"" iron sights?** Almost every assault rifle in the game offers an alternate sight picture in real life, simply by flipping or rotating the rear sight. For example diopter sights can be twisted to allow for different sight pictures (usually relating to target range). Here's an [example video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj4H_8j-sK8) of how that works.

**Still have no clue wtf I'm talking about?** The G3 and G53 in BF3 look awfully familiar, don't they? Except those sights look dramatically different... Well the reason why is because each gun has the rear sight twisted at a different mode/range. It would be awesome if BF4 gave us the option to alternate between those modes, rather than being stuck with the intrusive peephole design for one gun, and then an open design in another.

**Okay that's nice. Wouldn't this complicate the game?** Actually no. You know how BF4 has a magnification scope that can be flicked in front of a red dot sight? Get this... with iron sights equipped only, that same button will have your character twist or flip the rear sight to change the mode. Tadaa!

**Is it worth the effort? How will this affect gameplay?** Peephole mode can provide a slight zoom advantage at the expense of limited visibility. While the larger opening alternative would obviously be more open, for CQC situations. I figured since the iron sights are pretty static and boring in the game, why not give them as much depth to the gameplay as optical sights?",,False,self,t5_2uie9,False,,ps4,True,t3_1h42qx,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1h42qx/dynamic_iron_sights/,

Example and suggestion
The battle boat on the current Alpha map:
Instead of allowing the driver to drive AND gun at the same time why not add another seat so the driver only drivers and an additional gunner seat is added to control the 30 rounds cannon...

However, after watching bf4 footage, i have noticed that the cockpits inside the viper and the Venom seem to be drastically improved! its fantastic! i can see the nobs and dials and scratched paint and the screens actually reflect! look at the screens of the cockpit [here](http://youtu.be/tegjq8mv7oQ?t=17m30s) and watch how the screens reflect the sky and a building!

With spectctor mode (confirmed to ship with Battlefield 4 on PC) you watch as a spectator (one of 4 non-active player slots) and see things in REAL TIME meaning you cant rewatch any epic moments that happen in-game. Danile Matros (producer on spectator mode) mentioned how with spectator you can capture those ""Battlefield Moments"" with spectator, I don't see how since spectator is in real time and those moments are unexpected, and even if you see one happen you can't rewind to capture it.
 



Battlerecorder was supposed to be released for BF3 post-launch, we never got it. I'm pretty sure more people wanted Battlerecorder over the spectator mode.
 

This whole ""Consoles have built in recorders and PC's have 3rd party recording software"" is bull. What if we want to rewatch battles and get those ""Battlefield Moments"" from multiple angles and slow-motion? Currently you cant in BF4 by the looks of it.
 
With spectator you can only watch in real-time meaning you have no clue when somthing epic is going to happen, and you can't spectate yourself since when spectating you don't occupy a server slot and can only watch one of the 64 active soldiers.
 
Make it so each match is recorded and then you can rewatch them via Battlereport history, then you can save the top 5 battles and go back and watch them anytime from any angle. Obviously you can only watch the 10 or so most recent matches so the memory isn't insane.

As excitement for the game is increasing, so is the number of subscribers. As you can see from the title, we have now passed the milestone of 5,000 subs!

Keep on spreading the news! The more people know, the better. We are expecting a steady rise along with some bursts with E3 until the game releases.

* **Rules, quality and moderation**

You can expect the same kind of great mod team at work from /r/battlefield3 -- many of them are part of the mod team here! We want to encourage thoughtful discussions and a drama free environment. We'll mostly have a hands off approach and let the community decide what to up&amp;down vote. If you report something to us, there will always be someone to look at it.

We have decided to only be strict on **memes** and **non BF4 related posts**, this means in all other cases, you decide on how to vote!

We've created some guidelines for rules, so make sure to take a sec and check out the wiki in the sidebar. We'll do our best to keep it fair and simple!

* **Regarding E3 Event coming up!**

We plan to have an official E3 thread which will be stickied when E3 starts, where the mods will keep an organized, clean looking current and updated summary in the main thread so you know all the ins and outs of what goes on at E3.

You are free to make posts regarding E3 news, you decide what goes on the frontpage, the official thread should complement these.

* **Any questions, problems, or suggestions?**

Message the mods or comment here! We're here to help and open to suggestions on how to improve the subreddit and our community.

Thanks, the /r/battlefield_4 mod team

[What positional VOIP/audio is](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/Positional-Audio)


TLDC (too lazy didn't click): You know how when someone fires their gun, you can tell what direction the shots are coming from just by the sound?  Positional VOIP means that your squadmates voices also sound like they're coming from a certain direction in-game.


Why?

+Helps you instinctively keep track of the position of friendlies from sound alone

+More immersive

+EASY/FAST to implement from a development standpoint

1375493741.0,66,self.battlefield_4,1jlpce,!Suppression should prevent squad spawning,97,31,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1jlpce/suppression_should_prevent_squad_spawning/,"I've always felt this is an ideal way to use suppression. You and your squad are hunting part of an enemy squad which is badly hurt, but has found some cover. The support guy in your squad deploys his LMG and starts laying down suppressing fire. This gives you enough time to advance on the enemy squad without their squad mates spawning on them. 

If implemented, the mechanism would have to be tweaked, but here is my idea of how it should work:


Suppression (at least that stops squad spawning) should be for support only

* This gives the support a powerful tool that makes the use of the class more focused
* I think this would also provide better balance for the classes since recon has C4


A support should have to fire 10-15 bullets to stop squad spawning. 

* This makes sure that suppression is intentional
* Also prevents suppression spamming over many targets


Suppression should decay rapidly after fire stops

* Also prevents spamming suppression
* Creates a time limit for suppression which is related to the size of the support's magazine
* I think it would be really annoying if it weren't the case


There should be a clear visual indicator that lets a person know when they are 'nearing suppression' and when they are suppressed.

* Nearing suppression could be the same blurry effect
* Suppressed could maybe be an abrupt loss of color or darkening of the edges of the screen
* This takes away potential frustration of 'Why the hell isn't anyone spawning on me'
* Allows the target to try and avoid suppression before they are 'fully suppressed'


There should also be an indicator on the spawn screen that shows who is suppressed

* Prevents people from wondering why the hell they can't spawn


I've always thought suppression was a great idea that could encourage team play and lead to deeper tactics. It just didn't turn out that way. I think the above 'system' could really add some interesting decisions to the game. Do I choose the larger, less accurate gun for better suppression? Do I choose a magazine upgrade over a suppressor or heavy barrel? Do I go medic to revive my teammates, or do I go support to pin down my enemies? Do I (as a suppressed, sole-surviving squad member in great tactical position) try to run for cover and risk getting shot, or sit here and hope I can wait it out until that LMG runs out of bullets?


The main reason I think this is a good way to go about suppression is it actually gives a person incentive to suppress his enemy. Suppression always felt like a bonus in BF3. I never shot to suppress someone. I shot to kill them. If I didn't think I could kill the person, suppression never seemed like enough of a bonus to use a bunch of bullets, give away my position, and risk being shot while reloading my now-empty gun. If, however, I knew I could prevent that person's squad mates from spawning on them, I would be much more inclined to empty a mag in his general direction.


I'd love to hear your thoughts.

However, looking at vehicle weaponry, the same cannot be said. A large part of this is due to the way that balance was attempted to be made. For instance, a Stationary TOW launcher did massive damage while an AGM fired from a jet did considerably less. 

Now that weapon ammo is purported to be limited, I think a lot of those shackles can be removed and more attempts to what I call ""intuitive representative balance"" can be made. Balance such that someone can easily field a weapon, inflict damage with it and not under/overwhelmed by the amount dealt as it's commensurate with the weapon's caliber and consistent with the way other weapons are represented in the game.

Here's how the missile weapons were represented in BF3:

| Weapon   | Warhead Weight (kg) | Damage vs MBT | Damage vs Jet
|:-----------|:------------|:------------|:------------
| RPG       | 2   |   41   |na
|   IFV GM|  5.9  |    41 |na
| Hellfire (Heli AGM) |9| 41|na 
| Maverick (Jet AGM) |136|41|na
| Stinger | 3| na|  65
| Sidewinder (Jet Heatseeker| 9| na| 45

That's not to say that I expect a Maverick to do 68x more damage than an RPG does   but it should do fairly critical damage and should ignore reactive armor and iron fist. A similar situation appears with Stingers. Although there's a good reason why they do so much damage there's not a good reason why heatseekers shouldn't be a 2 hit kill against other jets. 

The counter measure system is also getting major overhaul to coincide with limited ammo for heavy weapons:

| Counter  | Effective Jam Time |Reload Time | 
|:-----------|:------------|:------------
| IR Smoke    | 7   |   15   
|  (New) Smoke|  ? |   ?
|(New) Iron Fist| ?|? 
|Flares|3.5|15
|ECM| 7 |30

**CREDIT TO LYRA AND BON BON OF THE CLAN BON BON FOR BF4 ALPHA COUNTER MEASURE TIMES**


So it appears the days are gone when tanks could just smoke out of any situation involving guided missiles. Now that active radar missiles (requiring a constant lock) are in play I hope we'll also see the end of ""below radar"" effecting heating seeking missiles. Finally, I'd like to see laser targeting not increase the damage to a target but only the range at which the target is engaged. I think this is going to be the case since I believe the counter measure are going to behave differently with some working well against heat tracking and others vs radar and laser. The main benefits from having a target lazed is that you have longer lock distance and you know which target your teammates want you to attack.

In any event I really hope we'll see more variety in the characteristics between the missiles. Having them do all 41 dmg despite the warheads ranging vastly in size. What the hell, I'll do bullet points. This is getting DV'd anyway since it isn't about dog tags.

* More variety in the damage done by the various warheads (while keeping balance by tinkering with reload and ammo count values).

* Heavy Missiles from IFV GM on up should ignore reactive armor.

* Laser targeting should not increase damage but only lock on range.

* Below radar shouldn't effect heat seeking missiles.

While I'm not looking for Project Realism, I would like DICE to give a [nod to more authenticity.] (http://img.pandawhale.com/49652-Jeremiah-Johnson-gif-0osi.gif)

1372173315.0,61,self.battlefield_4,1h1hte,Battlelog Suggestion - Create a Squad,66,5,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1h1hte/battlelog_suggestion_create_a_squad/,"When I play Battlefield with my friends, literally the only thing I want is to be on the same team with them, and preferably the same squad.  In the early days of BF3, we had something called ""Party Join"" where you could join servers as a group.  It never worked right and was eventually scrapped entirely.  For BF4, it needs to be fixed.

**We Come Not to Party**

First of all, this isn't D&amp;D.  This is Battlefield.  We don't form parties.  We squad up!  Replace the useless ""Create a Group Chat"" button with ""Create a Squad"".  Once created, you can drag up to four friends to the squad and they'll be invited.  The creator will be squad leader, but can designate another player to be the squad leader by right-clicking them or maybe hitting a star icon beside their name.  Members of the squad will all be in a group chat in Battlelog to get things sorted.

**Join Together**

When a member of the squad joins a server, all squad members automatically join, too.  Once connected, the server creates a new squad and puts all the members into it.  This part is non-negotiable.  This is the only function Battlelog needs.  Once this part is working, DICE can truly say that *""It's never been easier to play with friends""*.  Same team.  Same Squad.  EVERY.  SINGLE.  TIME.  Also, the squad leader you designated in Battlelog, will be the SL in the game.

**Stay Together**

Squads created through Battlelog and joining together get a special attribute called ""bound"".  They could have a little icon in the UI like the lock symbol, maybe a chain.  A bound squad can never be broken up by the auto-balancer.  The only way the squad can be broken up is if the players leave the squad or if the server admin does it manually.  Changes in maps, modes, or rage quits will never break up a bound squad.

**Wait for me**

When you try to join a friend that's already playing, the game should ALWAYS put you on your friend's team.  If that would create further imbalance (your friend's team already has more players), then Battlelog should give you the option to wait.  The join dialog box down at the bottom should say ""Waiting for team balance"" and have a button that lets you ""Join Enemy Team Now"" that you can hit if you don't want to wait.  When someone quits or joins and the teams are even, or the round ends, then it lets you in and puts you on the correct team.

**Balance Issues**

So the big problem here is team balance, right?  What do you do when five people try to join a game together that's already even?  It would be a huge problem in small servers that have maybe an 8-8 game going and five guys show up for one team suddenly making it 13-8.  Well, the only real solution is for the server to try to move people using a series of preferences.  The first is balancing at the squad level.  If possible, move an entire squad to balance the game.  If it's 13-8, is there a squad of 2 on the bigger team?  Move 'em.  If not, how about 3?  No?  Okay then, move on to individual players in unbound squads.  Start with the smallest unbound squads.  Is there an unbound squad of four?  Move two of them.  Since the squad is unbound, it's less likely that they're buddies.  There are, of course, some corner cases where you have say 5-on-5 with two bound squads and a third bound squad tries to join.  In that case, you just have to put the new squad on the losing team and ride it out.  That's a problem, sure, but I think it's the lesser evil here that's far outweighed by always playing with friends.  This becomes less and less of a problem the larger the server is and is only really magnified in very small games.

**tl;dr**  

**Pro:**  Form a squad in Battlelog and always be on the same team and in the same squad with your friends.  
**Con:** Occasionally have to deal with unbalanced teams.

I think it's worth it.  What do you think?

*Note: None of this addresses the issue of team stacking or skill balance.  That's a whole other issue.*",,False,self,t5_2uie9,1372174125.0,,pc,True,t3_1h1hte,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1h1hte/battlelog_suggestion_create_a_squad/,

AMA about my BF4 Pre-Alpha experience/gameplay.,71,6,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1g8zjh/iam_alpha_04_from_the_e3_stream_ama_about_my_bf4/,"Hey all, I'm the Alpha 04 from Tuesday's E3 livestream. When I got home I decided to check if I could see myself on the stream (I mean physically), only to find out that my gameplay had gotten a lot of attention. Had I realized those darn ammo/reload changes while I was playing and known that everyone was watching, I would've gone as support and put on my big boy pants to give you all a show... but I guess some insight did come out of the disastrous parts of what you saw. I also got the chance to play commander just the round before because I came in at the back of the line for my time group and they had run out of computers, so I can talk a bit about that as well.

Some main things I'll go ahead and mention now:

1) As you probably know, each station was provided with a regular keyboard/mouse setup, as well as an Xbox One controller. I feel bad for the peeps that went with the controller... You could easily pick them out as they lost firefights.

2) Right off the bat I opted to configure my Assault class a bit instead of changing my keybindings. I put on the new RDS, called the Coyote sight, which you saw me using most of the time. Love the visibility on it, felt even less clunky than the Kobra. I also put on the new Green Laser Sight, which from what I understand trades the blinding component of the Red Laser Sight for a bit more visual stealth when it's not shining directly at an enemy soldier. I also put on an attachment that reduced the initial recoil of your weapon (the strong recoil that comes with the first shot in every burst).

3) I was able to click directly on my spawnpoints/squadmates, hell yeah!

4a) On to the ammo... oh man was it bad, and at the time I was focusing too much on the shiny new toys to realize that reloads were dumping partially full mags. The cherry on top, which I later found out when I eventually switched to support out of frustration, is that the ammo bags were NOT on by default, so my constant Q spamming on the support guys was futile unless they were knowledgeable enough to look at their loadout. With more ammo for the primary weapon, there really wouldn't have been an excuse to go less than 20-0 in the group I was with.

4b) Every kit you saw me pick up was empty. Not sure if this was a bug or intentional, but I doubt every single person was out of primary ammo when they died. Rather, I think that picking up a new kit was either automatically starting you with 0 ammo OR **the amount of ammo that you had on the kit you dropped**. You'll see that I had a good amount of secondary ammo at the moment of my first switch (3:36:39), but that after picking up a kit WITHOUT a secondary, all the following secondaries I find are also out. This leads me to believe that my second theory is true, because I definitely don't think everyone died with empty secondaries.

5) Swimming and shooting! I dove in and realized that my gun was out, not really sure what my plan initially was without that little piece of knowledge. Xfactor was correct on his livestream of the gameplay when he said that it's HIGHLY inaccurate. The waves bob you up and down way more than the third person camera they were showing would lead you to believe. Xfactor was also right about not being able to ADS, you just have to hip fire awkwardly with little visibility and the most ridiculous vertical motion. And I enjoyed that very much, it felt right, and it made the kill even more satisfying for me than it was for you all.

6) Someone asked somewhere what happens when you are in the building during the collapse. I was in the elevator actually. The spectator guy had just left my first person cam to watch the whole thing come down, but I'm one of the little skulls you see pop up as it does. You just die to Bad Luck, and there's a bunch of awkward clipping on the screen. Would love to see a special kill cam of the building collapsing in the release version for this circumstance.

7) And finally, the failed knife fiasco. They could've shown my 6-0 opening, or my triple spray finish after my death on the B flag, but instead they managed to get the epic 3-5 minutes of me with no ammo, no support players, and useless kit switching. Yet I haven't seen anyone actually give the REAL reason for why I couldn't knife: the kit I picked up **didn't actually have one**! I was mashing the button, which albeit took me two keypresses to remember because I have everything bound differently at home, and nothing was happening. On the loadout screen you can actually select between two types of knives. I honestly forget what the descriptions said, all I know is that I ended up choosing the basic one. My guess is that you can either accidentally leave off a knife, or maybe it was just another bug in the kit switching, because after another pair of kit switches, the knife is back. I actually end up knifing a guy shortly after the camera jumps away from me to watch that squad of guys cross the channel, giving me my 9th kill.

Anyways, if you can think of any other questions about what you saw on the stream or other things in general, have at it. I'll call this a pseudo-AMA because I'll check back to answer questions, but I'm not dedicating specific time to sitting at the keyboard to answer them. Remember, I also played commander mode, so that's free game as well. All in all, the game was awesome, minus the frustrating ammo starvation. It feels familiar coming from BF3 (as LevelCap mentioned today in his video), and the UI is way cleaner, particularly when spawning in and editing your kits. I do have some concerns about commander snowballing rounds, but I'm sure DICE has commander balance at the top of their priority. Nevertheless, I think that commander mode should be a toggled option for servers, but I'm assuming this is ALSO planned. 

Round in question starts at 3:31:35 in http://www.twitch.tv/battlefield/b/415662298.

And here's my battlelog for context. http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/en/soldier/thejig1212/stats/363008727/

A stat wipe would do wonders at this point in my career (I did one months back after first getting the game because I felt self-conscious), but I'm stubborn. I consider myself to be a good player, I tend to hit at least the top 3 spots in most of my rounds if I'm not trying obscure assignments and put on my game face. With comfortable keybindings, a familiar mouse/sensitivity, and some damn ammo I would expect good PC players to get some 30+ kills in these lobbies.

1372551321.0,64,self.battlefield_4,1hc6mo,Your thoughts on choppers taking small arms fire,73,9,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1hc6mo/your_thoughts_on_choppers_taking_small_arms_fire/,"Haven't seen a thread specifically asking you guys on what your thoughts are on this. (if there is then i apologize)

As we all know by now, choppers (most likely jets too) will take damage from small arms fire and the damage towards these aircrafts can range to a higher damage depending on what weapon/calibur you are using against the aircrafts.

I will start by introducing my judgements to give an overall asumption on what i believe the game would be like after release with this feature and what ways it could be improved. First of all I agree that small arms fire should damage aircrafts, I hated being constantly raped by lolpodding jets and choppers podding me while popping up and down from a hill half way across the map, the only solution was to get in an aircraft yourself and take it out or hope for the best that your stinger could touch it, the problem was that most of the time the aircraft was already taken by some idiot that never seems to notice the enemy craft and just carries on trying to kill infantry.

Introducing small arms fire is a welcoming sight from the days of playing bad company, if gives people a fighting chance to at least deal some damage before they get ripped apart. 

Although i like the looks of small arms damage, i can't help but feel incredibally worried about this outcome rendering the aircrafts useless to a point that the battlefield will turn into an infantry/land vehicle battle. These thoughts come from past experience in bad company 1 and bad company 2:Vietnam. Because of the layout of the terrain and the close engagements with infantry, flying a helo was basically a deathwish, which was a lot more prodominant in bad company 2:vietnam. On conquest, one person with an m60 could single handedly cripple a huey which would always result in the huey having to make an emergancy landing to repair practically EVERY time it just gained altitude. After moving onto bf3 and later returning back to vietnam, i noticed that the hueys were never used on the maps i joined. No one even bothered using them anymore apart from the odd 1 or 2 people over time.

Again, this worry from vietnam comes from the fact that the game only has 12 enemies shooting at your huey... bf4 will have 32 enemies shooting at you, so thats a considerably higher concentration on recieving damage.

This made me think alot on how bf4 would play out and i am really uncertain on how this could lead out. My brain is telling me that small arms fire is a tactical and fair defence against aircrafts while my heart is telling me that the days of the choppers are over because of lock on weapons, small arms fire, laser designators and a lost legacy.

Other thoughts tell me that we might pull through if more maps in bf4 are going to have more cover for choppers like in seige of shanghai. We already have auto repair which is a feature that was not in any of the bad companies, so we could recover a lot better than them. If i would want to add in a sense of adjustments to small arms fire on aircrafts, then i would suggest the following:

-Damage to helos would be more potent in certain points of the chopper. if you were to shoot at a helo's belly or sides etc, then it would take minimul damage. However shooting at the engines, exhaust would deal maximum damage.

Please tell me how you feel about small arms damage? do you agree? disagree? feel free to add your own opinions in!",,False,self,t5_2uie9,1372551943.0,,,True,t3_1hc6mo,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1hc6mo/your_thoughts_on_choppers_taking_small_arms_fire/,

From BF2 : Spectate Mode , Commander , &amp; limited vehicle ammo
From 2142 : Titan Mode ( still unconfirmed ) 
From BC/BC2 : Recon with C4 &amp; motion balls , heavier infantry focus . note: I say heavier Infy focus because of the limited vehicle ammo, ability to block access to areas of the map .
From BF3 : Aggressive game play as assault keep m320, medpack, and defibs. Also from BF3 they take the lessons learned from early glitches of Frostbite 2. 

Add to all this the deep customization in weapons, camos, and vehicles              that so many have been asking for .

(as well as all the other threads)",71,14,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1eupd8/now_that_we_know_battlefield_4_multiplayer_will/,"Hello Everyone,

This is the moment we have been waiting for. In 2 weeks we will receive a glimpse at multiplayer in Battlefield 4, after that there will be a constant storm of new information coming, new content info and speculations.

E3 is a large event, full of rumors, content and of course gameplay. Battlefield 4 has now officially been confirmed to be shown there, including the multiplayer. This will be a lot of informations coming straight at you. The question is on how this info will be handled in this one off information.

Remember, no content which doesn't break the rules (which will adapt in the future) will be deleted, this mainly change what the mods will do during the E3.

Here are some options I personally see

**My suggestion**

* Mods make a post were updates are constantly posted, no jokes and rumors will be highlighted as rumors. Basically a megathread. The comments are free to say anything they want of course, only the thread holds this standard.

* All E3 info would be in this thread, updates should be posted in comments, users who contribute and whose content is put in the thread are of course credited.

*  Users upvote the most important announcements and post them in seperate threads, for example if suppresion is removed, this would warrant a seperate thread.

Your votes decide on the other threads, what I am asking here is...

...TL;DR

Do you want a mega thread of a high standard along with seperate user threads for the E3? Any other suggestions?

*If you want to create or contribute to the megathread, meassage the mods or comment here saying what you want to do!*

In fact it's what made me quit playing. I used to have a few favorite servers but they all shut down, then I was left playing on a couple of german servers where noone spoke english.

Normal settings to me would be: a variety of maps, a ticket count that is somewhat close to standard, normal vehicle spawn times, no weapon restrictions, no class restrictions etc. Basically, vanilla settings with no major changes. 

I tried searching just now for non-hardcore 64 player servers with 1-10 slots open. Literally none of the results suit the above. 

So I guess what I'm asking is:

Would the game benefit from restricting what server administrators are allowed to change? Maybe changing certain things should exclude them from quick match?

I'm not even sure if it's a problem that others feel exist, what do you guys think?

* Better Default maps (Some of Bf3's default maps really suck In my opinion) 

* Most vehicles such as tanks , Lav and Amtrac **Need** More traction  , You can power-slide tanks and they can barely drive up small hills without Failing somehow  

* Perhaps not Tac lights but Things like the sun and lasers might need a slight tone down in lens flare

* Jet play , I've never really liked how jets work , a good pilot will dominate the skies and have almost no way of being taken down by the opposition , His only weaknesses are flying  too high and getting stuck in that weird Sky-jelly layer below the clouds or getting distracted by the sun glare and hitting a lamp-post .
A Noob pilot will get Pwned by The jet shitbuckets 

I feel it would be a better system by having the jet more reliant on teamwork (2 seat jets , infantry designate places for jets to strike , limited ammo which can be restocked by landing at base , Etc...) or having stalling mechanics 

* Same with other vehicles about the limited ammo and you can restock at base , Although I'm not really bothered about this one , its just a lame idea 

**Weapons**

* Would anyone Like the idea of a Bow &amp; arrow kit for recon? (Not the xbow but more like the Tf2 huntsman)

* [M134 Minigun](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/US_Navy_070825-N-9769P-317_A_Special_Warfare_Combatant-craft_crewman_\(SWCC\)_mans_his_GAU-17_minigun_during_live-fire_patrol_training_along_the_Salt_River_in_northern_Kentucky.jpg/300px-thumbnail.jpg) Perhaps as stationary equipment at some Base spawns ( Although this has potential to be ungodly OP )

* Optional knife swap between ACB-90 and default knife
 ( And knives with under-slung Grenade launchers ! tac lights! suppressors! Holo sights! )  ^^s/

(Cant really add much to this as I don't have a wide knowledge of weapons)

 **Vehicles**

* [This](http://i.imgur.com/AZ2s4.jpg) (Not mine)

(Again I really cant much because of lack of military knowledge)

**Other** **stuff**


For all that is holy please Have a GOD-DAMN TUTORIAL FOR THE HARD STUFF (^^Please ^demize/crash )

PDWs are, pretty much, only designed for close quarters combat and Engineers are required to be available in all situations. I understand that Carbines are now universal, but I just feel like removing PDWs as the universal weapon class is a mistake. 

All soldier classes can play close quarters, thus requiring PDWs, but now only Engineers will get PDWs making them not as effective on larger maps (unless they switch out to a Carbine, but that shouldn't be a hassle because they should be able to use their original class weapon in all situations). 

Carbines are good weapons for Engineers, that can be implemented in all situations. PDWs however should be universal for all classes to use in CQC situations, just like how Shotguns are universal. I like Carbines being exclusive to Engineers in BF3 and I like how PDWs are universal. The way I look at it is, imagine if they removed Carbines altogether, this would make Engineers completely useless at range. Does anyone else feel like this is a bad move?

Here is a list of variants from the past:

===Conquest: Assault===

One team is specified as the attacker (pre-determined, depending on the map). The attacking team starts out with an uncapturable base and more tickets than the defending team, which holds all or most of the capturable control points on the map at the beginning of the round. The defenders usually start with 200 tickets and the Attackers either start with 230 or 250(depending on the amount of capturable bases there is in the map). Ticket bleed is inflicted when one team holds all the capturable control points, so the attacking team usually starts with ticket bleed at the round's start and must neutralize at least one flag to stop it.

===Conquest: Head-On===
Each team has at least one uncapturable base. If one team capture more than half the total number of flags on a map, then the opposing team will suffer ticket bleed.

===Conquest: Double Assault===
Each team starts with at least one control point. All control points on the map are capturable and capturing more than half of the flags will inflict ticket bleed.

===Conquest: Assault Lines===

A new gamemode variant exclusive to the Battlefield 2142: Northern Strike booster pack, this gamemode is similar to Assault. The EU team begins with a single, uncapturable base, while the PAC team has all the remaining control points. However, the PAC home base cannot be captured unless the EU team controls all the other flags on the map, forcing more defense onto flags that have already been captured. If the PAC flag is captured, all players on the EU team receive an award. However, if the PAC manages to recapture a base, the round will continue. If they recapture their home base, the EU is eligible to receive the award again.

===Conquest: Double Assault Lines===
A new twist on a twist. This gamemode has only been seen following the Battlefield 2142 1.40 patch on the Highway Tampa map. The only difference to Assault Lines is that both teams now have a base that is uncapturable until all the other flags are taken.

[sauce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_(gametype))

Battlefield 3 was predominantly Conquest: Head-On. This resulted in often drawn out battles where one team is pummeled by the other, and everyone plays like they can't lose because they will always have at least one base left to spawn at.

There were only four Conquest: Assault maps in Battlefield 3:

Wake Island
Sharqui Peninsula
Strike at Karkand
Talah Market

All other maps were Conquest: Head-On.

Conquest Head-On works fine for maps that are super massive, such as Daquing Oil Fields, Fushe Pass, Or Armored Kill maps.

However, the vast majority of Battleifeld 3 maps are tight, infantry focused clusterfucks where there is often one team that dominates and takes all the flags, pushing the enemy back into the uncap, at which point they being the rape-machine. In all other variants, the round would end when a team holds all flags (and the other team is eliminated, can no longer capture flags).

You might say: Oh, that is imbalanced. Well, no, not really. In Single Assault, the team that has an uncap typically only has one base, while the other team has all other bases, or all but one of the bases. A half witted team can easily hold majority bases if they try.

The best part of Assault / Double Assault is that it ends rounds before players start to drop due to rape. A round quickly ends, allowing for autobalance to take place between rounds. Sure, players will drop because they lost so quickly, but it would result in far less player attrition.

Just imagine how awesome and intense knife fights would be, or how amazing it would be to be on top of the skyscraper or some other tall place, and kick him off during the animation.

&gt;Default Weapons:

**25 MM** - Strong against other Aircraft/ Weak vs Armor

**30 MM** - Inaccurate vs Aircraft/ Strong vs Armor

&gt;Secondary Weapons

**Heatseekers** - Likely unchanged from BF3 version. Low damage but easy to use.

**Maverick (Guided Missile from BF3)** - Likely unchanged as well. Small possibility that you can actually fire Tom Cruise at unsuspecting armor and convert them to Scientology. Damage increased by Soflam. 

**Guided Homing Missiles** - Possibly a version of ground attack missile that requires that you maintain a lock on. Higher Damage than Maverick since it requires more effort for hit. Unknown if counter-able by most likely yes. May or may not benefit from Soflam.

**Active Radar Missiles** - An AA missile that requires a constant lock for impact. Higher dmg than Heatseekers. Presumed counter-able.

&gt;Counters

**ECM** - Mostly the same as BF3, though there's the possibility that they will have ECM work against the ""active"" missiles and not against Heatseekers. 

**Flares** - Mostly the same as BF3, though there's the possibility they will work against Heats but not ""active"" homing missiles.

**Fire Extinguisher** - Hopefully wrong about this but I presume this is returning to countermeasure slot. This means it will go largely unused in HC and have only slightly more use in SC. IMO would be better off used in the upgrade slot.

&gt;Upgrades

**AutoPilot** - I suspect this is what we know of as ""Maintenance""

**Reload  (Beltspeed)** - Increase burst length and decreases cooldown. Viable now that Radar should be default

**Stealth** - Increases the time needed to lock on to you. Reduces the time you stay spotted.

**Proximity Scan** - Scans a 5m radius around your craft which is useful if you're worried about infantry parachuting and skyjacking you. At least that's what it did in BF3. Hopefully they've either turned this into a ground version of air radar or have made the range specific to each class of vehicle (tank gets 5m while Jet gets 100m) Possibly placed in game to troll me personally.

&gt;Random thoughts...

* *Rocket Pods are now relegated to the attack jet which is presumably balanced by the fact they are more vulnerable.* 

* *Beam Scanning appears to have been retired.*

* *Air Radar is presumed default since it's not an unlock.*

* *No below Radar spotted either...unless it was below radar....and we couldn't spot it....get it? NM.*

Really hoping you can equip both Anti Air and Anti Ground Weapons. Otherwise you're going to have AGM picked *heavily* over AAM. The only way around that I can see is if they make Counter measures only effective against one type of missile or the other (e.g. flares effective against heat seekers but not radar ""active"" missiles).  That would create a strong enough incentive to make the choice of AAM vs AGM more difficult.

I'm inclined to think that might be the case since ground vehicles now have the Iron Fist system. So the question becomes, why use smoke anymore if you have Iron Fist?

Unless they're going to create a tier system. Which I hope they don't. A tier system where older unlocks are obsolete once new ones are unlocked. Not only is that punitive towards newer players but the end game becomes duller as well as you limit the options.

My guess is that Tanks will use smoke to deflect the traditional guided missiles while using the Iron Fist to ward off the Radar Lock ones.

*Please Note:* These are not the trolls from the pink clusteruck the sub used to be (the story is a bit more complicated), but people with good intentions and who want the best for the community. Otherwise they wouldn't have agreed to move here. 

I am sure they will help us a lot in the next few years.

Finally we can now concentrate on improving our own Subreddit instead of concentrating on where people are going to go, this makes everything easier for everyone. The community is still relatively small, however; with E3 in June and and the game release in October we should see nice constant and also bursting growth.

We will do our best to make this the best place for the community and we will be happy to give you guys the best moderation possible by keeping content quality high while letting people voice their opinion. We do not censor, we moderate. If people want to voice their opinions we will let them.

Anyways, before I go too far off topic. Welcome to the new mods and all the /r/battlefield4'ers

Also a big thank you to their mods for being so cooperative, this has truly convinced me of their good intentions.

Let's do this!

If not, Why cant we?

a good example was during the EA press conference they dropped a tank  through the street using a M320/203UGL what would stop me from using an M320 or larger projectile to blow a hole in the street and dropping down into the access hallways below? Same concept. If we can blow up stuff to go up why not blow it up to go down.

With the new Chinese setting in the game we can confirm these all-new Chinese vehicles in Battlefield 4, including (but not limited to)…

-Type 99 MBT

-ZFB-05 Armored Car

-Z-9 Haitun Transport Heli

-Z-10W Attack Heli

-DV15 Interceptor Attack Boat



**What kind of water vehicles will there be?**

Amphibious Assault will play a big role in Battlefield 4 as we’ve added attack boats like the RCB-90 (U.S.) and jet-skis. Controlling the sea in addition to the land and air will play a crucial role in victory.

And, if you need to bail out of your jet-ski or attack boat, now you’ll be able to dive underwater or sprint-swim away to escape pursuers. If the situation gets desperate, you’ll also be able to use one-handed weapons and one-handed gadgets while in water for the first time.



**When are we going to see videos or screenshots of more vehicles?**

Right now! To commemorate the first “Ask DICE: Battlefield 4” we have this exclusive shot of the Chinese Z-10W Attack Heli. Check it out! [[imgur]](http://i.imgur.com/QFLCgNi.jpg) [[Battlelog]](http://blogscdn.battlefield.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Vehicles-Screen.png)

For those who don't know, since the bullets from your gun and your eyesight originate from the top of your player model in game, 99% of a player model can be hidden behind cover, including their gun and eyes, yet they can still see you and shoot you.

I know it's present in a lot of shooters, but that's really no excuse for its continued presence in the battlefield series. It's completely unrealistic, and especially annoying when combined with the existing suppression system, which I'm glad to have heard is being changed.

I think your vision should come from your player models eyes, and bullets should be obstructed by blocking cover at hip height unless the player is aiming down sights. In that case, it should work similar to how it is now, but bullets should be projected from roughly 8 inches lower than the top of the player model, so that the minimum player profile behind cover is the area from the top of the shoulder to the top of the head.

Anyone have any information?

**- RKG-3 Grenade:** Anti-tank grenade used to disable and destroy tanks and other enemy vehicles, but less effective against infantry. 

**- M84 Grenade:** A stun grenade. Upon detonation, it emits an intensely loud ""bang"" sufficient to cause immediate flash blindness, deafness, tinnitus, and inner ear disturbance.

Foggy, snowy where applicable, rainy, sunny, cloudy, windy.

How it works: You aim at the cover to calculate the distance, when the distance is determined it transmits the distance to the grenade and you aim over the cover and fire. 
The grenade will track the distance it has traveled by the amounts of spins it has done and will explode in the air taking out the person behind cover.

It might even be possible to increase/decrease this distance manually  by up to 3 meters(you can irl). This is for if the cover is really thick, you will then need to add distance to make the grenade explode at the right time.

It can also be used to make your own estimation on the distance. For example if you are under heavy fire and can't peek you could aim at something closer then the target cover and add a few meters.

I think this is awesome, high tech is always nice. And if mortars are gone then this is an excellent way to have the support players be offensive instead of sitting at base but still be viable to take out people behind cover (like a mortar).


NOTE: This is how it works in real life, i have no details on the actual mechanics for the weapon in game.


[here is the wiki site for more info about the weapon IRL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XM25_CDTE)

EDIT:
IN GAME DESCRIPTON: 
&gt; Fires 25mm grenades that can explode mid-flight creating a devastating burst taking out lighter targets behind cover. First aim down the sights at the cover, then lift your sights and fire over the cover, the grenade will explode on the other side.

This also means that to laser-designate a vehicle the recon must keep the laser directly on target for the entire flight of the missile. Missiles will always track where the laser is pointed, even if it changes location after the missile is launched.

As an addition, it would cool to be able to choose top-down or direct attack mode with the javelins while getting a laser-lock. This way if a recon puts his laser in a window, the missile can use direct attack to fly into the window.

This can be either completely replace the current laser-designating system, or work along side it.

As the commander gives orders to the squadleader, he gives the command to one guy, out of 5. Now the SL might press ""agree"" to the order (hopefully there is such a thing) and off he goes for the objective.


Now where is his other squadmates? They spawned on a guy on C to get some free capture points. Yeah, everybody loves points. But meanwhile commanders sits there frustrated as hell, why the squad is not following the orders and screams over VOIP to the SL - ""What the **** is going on out there?""


The SL sends the same messages to his squadmembers. In the end commander gives up sending orders out to the squad and squadleader gives up squadleading.



I just don't get why people want this. Do you want this? It's gonna be so frustrating to be commander and squadleader in BF4 if they don't change the spawn system.

If gameplay gets taken down, please pm me and I will see what I can do (I have them both downloaded to my computer and suggest you do the same).

I may have listed some things that are already on BF3 for PC without 
knowledge of such because I play on PS3 and will play BF4 on PS4.

I have listed things that are already known so do not flip out if you knew about something I listed.

Feel free to let me know if I should add or delete parts.

Keep in mind that some things I did not list because I was unsure about them/how they work.

Please upvote this thread (only if you think it is worthy) so other people can see my in-depth analysis. It took me exactly 3 hours to watch the footage, take notes, and edit the thread.

Sorry if this is not all greatly organized, I used notepad and just copy and pasted it to here.

===========================================================================================

Part 1:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Attack Helicopters
	1. 00:40 Gunner has more recoil than in BF3.
	
	2. 00:43 Air space seems to be limited to the same
	space alotted to infantry units instead of more
	air space than infantry like in BF3.
	
	3. 00:43 When gunner has no left over rounds,
	replenishing 30 rounds took about 4 seconds.

	4. 00:56 When gunner has left 30 left over rounds,
	replenishing 30 rounds took about 16 seconds.

	5. 01:15 Gunner reload time seems to take less over-
	all time (possibly the player is running belt speed).
	
	6. 02:26 Being in an attack helicopter (perhaps even
	all vehicles) does not add points to the squad specializations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spawn Screen 
	1. 03:27 Respawn timer in conquest is about 5 seconds.

	2. 03:27 Only the Medic Bag is shown and not the Medic
	Kit (small version of Medic Bag). Perhaps you can only 
	choose one or the other? Or you are always given the Med 
	Kit which would be a bad idea for balancing reasons.
	
	3. 03:27 Map seems to show a lot of room in water.

	4. 03:27 Picture in picture to show where you spawn for a
	fixed location seems pretty crappy (could be color scheme
	or camera angle).

	5. 03:27 Under the picture in picture in lower left corner
	shows a button ""Team Setup"". Perhaps brings player to squad
	menu or something totally different.

	6. 03:56 Picture in picture shows the name of the place selected
	to spawn at. Flag D is nicknamed ""Arcade"". Flag E is""Restaurant"".

	7. 04:27 Underneath the scoreboard shows ""Commander Score"".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Infantry
	
        1. 04:48 Medic bag seems to have odd physics by rolling around.

	2. 05:20 Player switched to gunner seat then switched back to 
	driver seat without going through all seats to get back to driver
	seat like in BF3.

	3. 05:24 Minimap shows an arrow pointing to an objective. Commander probably told the infantry to cap it.

	4. 05:59 Minimap still shows an arrow pointing to flag E. Commander
	probably told the infantry to defend it or it just stays there until
	the Commander gives further instructions.

	5. 07:13 Minimap shows an arrow pointing to a new objective.
	
	6. 07:25 Player gets Flag Possession when entering the premisis
	of the flag his/her team owns. Receives 40 points.

	7. 08:55 Players get 30 points for healing squad members, probably 20 points for healing teamates. Same
        probably goes for resupplies.

	8. 09:31 Incindiary grenades have a large blast radious and last     a good 4 seconds or so.

	9. 09:57 Killcam follows your killer while being stationary above your body.

	10. 09:57 Killcam interface is updated, but not improved upon that much (in my opinion).

	11. 10:02 Killcam lasts about 8 seconds total in conquest (Entire killcam for conquest in BF3 took about 11 seconds in total).

	12. 10:38 When the squad receives the ammo specialization, the player does not receive an immediate ammo boost. Perhaps after the player respawns, the extra ammo will be given? Proven in point 1 of Infantry sub-topic in Part 2.

	13. 11:13 T-POSE! (need to watch Part 1 to understand)

	14. 11:06 Player no longer does a full reload.

============================================================================================================================

Part 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Infantry 
	
	1. 00:48 Player spawns with more ammo proving my point I made in Point 12 in the Infantry sub-topic of Part 1.

	2. 01:26 Press E to Enable Power on a generator, presumably to enable the elevator. Players may be able to use the elevators to gain roof access. BEWARE OF RECON! However, the player may need to get access to the roof first in order to access the elevator.

	3. 4:00 Squadmate support player to the left is using some kind of at least 5 shot seemingly grenade launcher of sorts on enemy tank. Possibly the XM-25. See 4.

	4. 4:49 After bringing up the brightness, the support player is carrying an XM-25.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Tank

	1. 06:55 Player receives Flag Possession, this time only alloting the player 10 points instead of 40.

	2. 10:29 Tank replenishes health by itself when at 12% (Possibly running maintenance upgrade).

	3. 10:51 White marker to the right of crosshairs indicate the location of where you are being targeted.

	4. 10:53 IR Smoke is a bit different than in BF3 by not completely encompassing the vehicle.
	
	5. 10:53 IR Smoke now has a countdown timer indicator and takes 15 seconds to be reloaded.

==============================================================================================================================

Throughout Part 1 and Part 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	1. Top right corner shows a box where when you click on it it will bring up a menu of, essentially, challenges and other things. I hope you can remove this because I would not use it too much.

	2. On the bottom of the screen (when infantry) there is a rectangular box with a list of things. One of which is of lines with the key V to use. What is this? The others are also odd considering there is one of a flashlight while the player does not have the tac light equipped.

	3. Dice shamelessely self promotes themselves by putting their logo on buildings throughout the map (just kidding).

	4. Bringing up the characters hand to spot is inconsistent (sometimes the character brings his hand up, sometimes doesnt).

===================================================================================================================================

I hope you all enjoyed and please let me know what I should add or remove from my points.

Obviously, we all know what Levolution is. We've seen the skyscraper fall thousands of times by now, and also the part where they destroy part of the street and bring a tank with it. But how much more will there be? Hopefully, DICE has implemented an ""event"" such as the skyscraper in every MP map. But let's focus on the smaller scale of Levolution, i.e. the tank scene. How many sections of the street will be destroyable like that?  Is that the only form of small-scale Levolution on that map? What else do you think we are going to see?

I just wrote this up five minutes ago, so I will improve the grammar and everything as soon as I get a little feedback. Tell me what you guys think.


The server problems of Battlefield 3 are set in stone. Since it’s so close to the release of Battlefield 4, DICE will concentrate all of their time to working on improving it, leaving its predecessor to fall into a never-changing rut.  That does not mean that we can’t influence the development of the new rent-a-server system that will be put in place. 

By identifying the problems we have faced in Battlefield 3, we could hope to impact how DICE decides to handle badmins, and how they should give some sort of incentive to be a good admin. Anything to make our lives, or lack-there-of, a little easier.

When first introduced, renting servers to players seemed like an amazing idea. Anyone could pay some money, and host a server where they could play with their friends on the maps they want, in the game-types they want to play. It would also open up battlefield to more competition, letting clans rent servers so they can train, as well as host matches. All of this would be great, were it not for the fact that DICE forgot to adjust for the human factor. When given control over anything, even something as mediocre as owning and administrating a server, power rushes to people’s heads faster than a snail infused with nitro can finish the Daytona 500. As ridiculous as the previous metaphor may be, it does not soften the point that admins abuse their power way too often. This is especially prevalent in games where badmins are not penalized for being unfair or dimwitted administrators, as is the case with Battlefield 3.

Inane and inept are two words that come to mind when one thinks of the admins on Battlefield 3. They tend to set forth amazingly stupid rules without proper justification, then tactlessly and haphazardly enforce them. How is using a scope on a sniper rifle that has a power lower than seven times such a bad offense to the people to play this game that it warrants a kick from the server, or even sometimes a permanent ban? How, exactly, is my tactical light going to affect your gameplay experience so dramatically that you must now boot me out of your game? And, finally, how in the world are the slugs in my shotgun going to ruin any possible fun you could have had on this game? It’s rules like these that tend to ruin a lot of potentially good gameplay. In Battlefield 4, DICE should be able to solve this problem easily. 

The first system they should implement is a rating system. Players should be able to give a yay or nay vote on the server, which would come up as a percentage.  The higher the percentage, the more universally liked the server is. If an admin’s server has a low percentage, they will probably won't have too many people join their server. If there is no real repercussion other than less people on the player’s server, than what’s the point of having the rating system in the first place? The use of incentives based around the player’s performance as an admin would be a great start.

As any economics expert or mafia boss would tell you, the best way to get someone’s attention is through the use of incentives. Thankfully, DICE has already done half of the work for me by creating the perfect incentive for a gamer; battlepacks. Battlepacks are little packages full of new gadgets, weapon and soldier skins/camos, vehicle unlocks, weapon accessories, and more. Admins that are able to keep a server running with happy people deserve some sort of reward, right? The level of rewards you get would be based off your percentage; the higher the percentage, the better the battlepacks you receive. If DICE doesn’t want to give out battlepacks full of stuff that you should only unlock via leveling up, then why not hand out something along the lines of double experience for either the player or the entire server? Hand out something that isn’t game-breaking, but still gives admins a reason to be good.  Anything would work, so long as it keeps the interests of the players at heart.

Often in BF3 I found myself playing with more than 3 friends. This meant that we had to form 2, 3 and sometimes 4 squads.

My problem is that there is nothing to discern a battle log friend in-game from any other player. Considering how much the social benefits of battle-log are being emphasized it seems crazy that one of the most pivotal social elements-having a permanent in-game ""friend"" indicator-is non existent. Even something as simple as a slightly different colour blue for their map triangle and the overhead indicator would do the trick.

Please guys, make it easier for me to have fun with my friends on this fabulous franchise. This tiny addition in Battlefield 4 would be such a great feature that would mean so much for larger groups of players.

The icons you see below the spawn cam are just **your** current loadout for that vehicle. We can clearly see it at [1:33](http://i.imgur.com/LSrpAWO.jpg), where the player selects an empty attack helicopter and the icons are shown… Some may argue that maybe when vehicles are empty these icons show your loadout and when they are occupied they show the pilot’s loadout; but after a few seconds a teammate spawns into the chopper and the same icons continue to be shown. (Maybe they had the same vehicle upgrades selected?) You can see a similar example when the player selects and spawns into an empty boat at [8:12](http://i.imgur.com/sqTrmBw.jpg).

1373379866.0,32,self.battlefield_4,1hxp4i,[Discussion] Alpha players: care to discuss TTK/Survivability in the BF4 Alpha?,38,6,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1hxp4i/discussion_alpha_players_care_to_discuss/,"[*Note: for those that don't know, TTK stands for ""Time to Kill.""  It is basically an average measurement of the time it takes for a given weapon to kill an enemy and it is usually measured at various standard ranges.  An example of this is the notorious M16A3.  It has one of the lowest TTKs of any assault rifle/man-portable weapon in game and it was one of the most frustrating weapons to be on the business end of in BF3. Also, for those that haven't played previous BF games, it is important to note that the TTK of BF2 was considerably higher than in the successive games (it decreased in the BF:BC series and again in BF3)  If you're curious, I recommend checking out the [Symthic TTK Charts](http://symthic.com/bf3-ttk-charts).*]

So I've been watching the E3/Alpha footage again this morning because I have no life, and I've been thinking about TTK in BF4.  I'd like to use this post to discuss how the balancing and TTK feels in the current iteration of the game.  From what I've seen (and I know that DICE either lowered the damage or increased the player health for the pre-alpha), it looks like TTK has received a slight overall increase.  It is difficult to tell however from some of the footage because as a viewer I can't always tell when a player was hit, and it does seem to decrease in certain clips.

I've thoroughly enjoyed the BF series since BF2 and the changes to the series have always fascinated me (it's kind of like watching evolution unfold in front of you).  There seems to have been a significant change in TTK over the years, and personally I don't really like the state of it in BF3.  Personally, I was pretty happy with survivability in BF:BC2, but dissatisfied with the netcode situation.  There are pros and cons for each version:

**Low TTK**

* More realistic
* Makes the killers feel awesome
* Speeds up gameplay
* Frustrates the hell out of the killed which can lead to more stalemates and less tactical thinking
* Leaves the dead feeling like crap and robs them of confidence in their own abilities

**High TTK**

* Less realistic
* Frustrates the shooter (""WHY WON'T YOU DIE?!"") while the target bunny-hops/dolphin-dives their way to safety
* Robs the shooter of confidence
* Can lead to some seriously goofy firefights/clusterf*cks
* Makes the target feel invincible

It is also important to note that TTK is just one factor of the whole player survivability model in each game.  Other factors include (but aren't limited to):

* Headshot/critical hit damage
* Player movement speeds
* Player reaction time/choices
* Healing/revive/resupply speed, frequency, and accessibility
* Visibility/suppression effects
* Environmental effects and objects and their hitboxes
* Buffs/Debuffs (conditional or unconditional damage/survivability modifiers)
* Weapon stats (TTK is a derivative/function of these stats which include ROF, accuracy (which is another function/derivative), etc.)
* Emergent player behavior (which can hardly be predicted, merely adapted to and directed)
* Netcode/lag issues

Obviously, this is a complicated and delicate picture and a balance is difficult to strike.  So a lot of balancing revolves less on stats and more on the end result: how the game feels.  So, if there are any people who played the Alpha/Pre-Alpha as well as previous BF games out there who care to discuss how player survivability and TTK felt, that would be awesome.  Also, if anyone has any ideas for improving it or balancing it, I'd love to hear them too, but keep 'em reasonable.


[*I'd like to be clear that I'm aware that balancing a massive game like this is extremely difficult and I do not think that Demize99 and the rest of the team have an easy job.  They clearly made some tough/unpopular decisions and got serious flak for it, but for understandable reasons.  I know that it is impossible to make a game like this perfectly balanced, so this post isn't intended to complain, but merely gather opinions and insight on the game.*]

The fact that they would just be stuck in limbo for sometimes forever really made it seem as though they were just something Dice quickly threw into the game without putting too much attention into them. **how would you guys like to see jet stalls be handled in BF4? Whether it be because they hit the ceiling of the map or just because they slowed down too much.** 

Personally, if they were flying straight up and hit the ceiling I think they should loose all speed then they should quickly begin falling out of the sky dropping like a rock and it would be up to the pilot to have it regain control and to level out before getting pancaked. If they were flying horizontally and just slowed down to much because of a strafing run perhaps they also might just start falling to the ground if they don't start the engines back up immediately, which would balance out the ground pounding that happens currently in BF3 when the jets simply float and unleash rocket pods to the ground below. **however I also think because of these weaknesses the jets should get an overhaul on their maneuvers**.

* Fix the hit detection (Client side). This is THE biggest concern for me. Dying behind corners, getting delayed hitmarkers due to high pingers,  etc. Also, getting rid of Client side hit detection makes it harder for hackers to create hacks that abuse Client side by getting mass kills with a Medkit for example. If the ""client"" reports a kill, the server will check and confirm. Server side will fix a lot of this.

* PLEASE remove the jumping animation. I want to jump. Not do some cinematic jump that looks cool. It isn't reliable half the time you need it to be and you die. Not to mention it messes with the hitboxes and makes it impossible to kill someone in the middle of the animation.

* Fix the spawn protection. Spawning on a squad mate should NOT make a person immune to dying. The risk of spawning on someone in a firefight makes it a risk-reward system. You may win a battle, you may lose. Keep spawn protection for **deployments** **only**.

* Let's get it so every gun has different traits. Not every assault rifle does 25 damage per bullet with the exception of a couple. 

* Please for the love of God remove Suppression. If you aren't going to remove it at least fix it! Don't magically change the characteristics of my weapon and make it have more spread when an inanimate object doesn't know Suppression exists. 

* This shouldn't even need to be listed, but add the spectator mode and Battlerecorder that should have been in BF3. 

I will add more to this if good ideas are left in the comments.

1371153705.0,31,self.battlefield_4,1gag96,Locking Weapons - a Game Design Discussion,62,31,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1gag96/locking_weapons_a_game_design_discussion/,"####This is the first piece of information regarding Battlefield 4 that has seriously concerned me
In [a recent interview](http://youtu.be/0tmEjpI51R0?t=16m50s) Daskro states that “I did get to use both the RPG-7 and the Stinger for the engineer class.  They feel very similar to Battlefield 3, for better or worse ...  (The stingers) operate nearly identically to the Battlefield 3 stingers.”

####This is not a balance discussion
We've seen threads discussing Stinger/Igla balance a hundred times already.  A balance discussion is not appropriate because we don't know the state of BF4's balance.  This discussion is about game design, and should focus on whether or not BF3’s locking weapons contributed to the quality of the game, and whether or not they are appropriate for BF4.

####Weapons should be engaging
Most of the weapons in BF3 engage the player with their distinct characteristics and subtle nuances.

There are a lot of engaging and interesting weapons in BF3.  A perfect example is the RPG-7.  

####The RPG-7 is engaging
It is:

* *Skillful* - Mastering the speed and arc of the RPG-7 makes it possible to accomplish amazing feats of long range accuracy.  With enough effort, it even becomes possible to effectively destroy air vehicles with this weapon.

* *Interactive* -  When you use an RPG-7, both you and your victim are interacting in a meaningful way.  One player is aiming and predicting, the other player is moving, dodging, and reorienting their vehicle’s armor.

* *Risky* - Firing a SMAW of RPG-7 lights you up like a christmas tree.  The rocket’s loud sound effects, smoke trail, bright glow and explosion make certain that you are highly visible to your victim.

* *Counterable* - The repair tool does a respectable job of mitigating the RPG-7’s damage.  Drivers and pilots can lower their chances of being hit by moving quickly and changing directions often.  Some vehicles can also equip Reactive Armor.

* *Predictable* - As long as the user is not suppressed, the RPG-7 fires in a very predictable fashion.  Its function is also extremely well communicated via hit indicators, sound effects, and obvious graphical cues.

####Locking weapons in BF3 are not engaging
They are not:

* *Skillful* - To fire a locking weapon you have to: 1) Aim vaguely at the target, and 2) left click.  There isn’t much for the player to think about or get better at.  A new player and a veteran player will use locking weapons in pretty much the same manner.  There little to no depth.

* *Interactive* -  The user and the target of a locking weapon are not interacting in an interesting or engaging manner.  One player aims, waits, and clicks.  The other player presses their countermeasure button.  It’s boring.

Some maps provide more interesting interactions in the form of cover and buildings to block the locking weapon’s path.  This is more of an example of a player interacting with the environment rather than players interacting with each other.  Ideally, weapons should be engaging regardless of the environment in which they are used.

A player can place their locking weapon’s crosshair on a target indefinitely, causing the target to constantly hear their vehicle’s lock warning sound.  The victim has no recourse for this action, as there is no way to tell where the lock is coming from.  This is another symptom of these weapons’ lack of meaningful player interaction.

* *Counterable* - IR Smoke hard counters the javelin and guided missiles, and Flares / ECM randomly and unreliably counter heat seekers.  Hard counters and random counters are both unacceptable.  Countermeasures should work situationally and predictably.

* *Predictable* - Countermeasures will often fail to divert heat seekers.  This degree of randomness is unacceptable.

####This is why you feel cheated when you’re killed by a locking weapon
The utter lack of effort put forth by the user, the lack of player interactivity, and the lack predictability all make it feel very unfair when you’re killed by a locking weapon.  Using a locking weapon to kill player doesn’t feel rewarding for the same reasons.

####Neither player is having fun
This is the antithesis of game design.  The more engaging the weapon is, the more fun it is.  Weapons should be fun and engaging for both the user and the victim.

####Flying a helicopter high and away from the action is the least interesting way to fly
This is the type of playstyle that the game’s mechanics need to discourage, but are instead encouraging in BF3.  Because there is no reliable counter for locking weapons, the best strategy is to avoid them entirely.

If Below Radar still worked against the Stinger, it would encourage helicopter pilots to fly low to the ground and close to the action, which is the most interactive, interesting, and engaging way to fly.  It’s more fun.  It makes the helicopter more vulnerable to other types of attacks, so it also presents players with an interesting tradeoff.

####How do we fix this?
[This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield3/comments/10y94p/lock_on_weapons_in_bf3/) posted by a very experienced scout helicopter pilot provides some very well thought out solutions to this problem.


*Fixes:*

* *Change the way countermeasures work* - Make countermeasures 100% reliable, but also make each consecutive use of a countermeasure temporarily increase its cooldown.  This would be a great way to make locking weapons situationally useful in a nonrandom manner.

* *Make locking weapons dodgeable* - This could add a ton of interesting maneuvers and strategies to the game.

* *Make aim matter* - The more centered the target is, the faster it gets locked.

*Other Fixes:*

* *BC2 tracer darts* -  In order to lock a target, it must first be hit by a tracer dart.  Tracer darts required time-on-target and they were also dodgeable.

* *Remove locking weapons entirely* -  Favor the use of vehicle-based AA solutions and infantry-based guided rockets like BC2's AT4.

####Are we jumping the gun here?
No.  If BF3 has shown us anything, it's that DICE can be a little slow to when it comes to making changes to their game.  We need to let DICE know right now that we want interesting, engaging, interactive, and skillful game mechanics for our locking weapons.

In E3 they demonstrated very extensively ""new"" feature in Battlefield 4, spectator mode. Spectator mode that will enable flexible survey of ongoing match for on-the-spot recording (FRAPS) and/or casting it from the fly for Esports. Here would be ours needed free-cam for watching recorded demo, already build into game.

Player location etc. data is constantly written, stored and purged from yours PC's memory. This is essential so whole thing even can work, goes to any game and MP or SP. Instead of purging it from the memory why couldn't player (spectator or person on the map) enable recording of data into .demo file like in Bf 2?

**Playback, how that could be done?**

I don't say it's not more work, extra work, but couldn't DICE build playback options into spectator modes framework? Couple different speeds for playback, button to reset into beginning and take switching between player point of views (POV's) straight from current spectator mode? Just like in Bf 2, basically.

Loading into .demo can be harder concept considering that DICE has ditched whole main menu system and uses Battlelog as replacement. So lets integrate with help of Battlelog developers. 

We could take already existing tab ""Multiplayer"" and under it add tab ""Demos"". When clicked on that option we are taken into simple UI that has file browsing function and button ""Play"". When you click ""Browse"" it would pop open pre-defined (by DICE) demo location folder, you choose wanted demo and hit ""Play"" from Battlelog. Demos name would be freely decided by recorded so easier to choose one you want.

System proceeds to boot up game and throws you into recorded demo in free-cam mode.

**Alternatives?**

FRAPS, or similar software, combined with free-cam of spectator mode or as you play. Sure, that argument can be done, but same time it would be just what we have now with Bf 3. You would need to record hours upon hours of footage, watch even more footage and then proceed to do **a lot** editing in order to make cool videos.

If DICE wants enable us to make those ""old school"" cool **Battlefield moment** videos something like Battlerecorder is rather essential tool. This way you don't need record hours upon hours footage, create possible scripts for small group of players etc. in order to create those videos.

**Conclusion**

First of all, sorry about wall-ish of the text and thank you if you read it all. Point of this thread is to create discussion about Battlerecorder. How people see it, do they want it and throw around ideas how it maybe could be done without creating a lot extra work to developers.

Second, this was just rough concept I thought up and wondered if people want to voice theirs thoughts and ideas about Battlerecorder.

**It's time to make Battlefield moment videos, easy way!**

Edit: Naturally even larger streamlining would be have automatic recording by game, every match from countdown to ""X won!"" -screen would be automatically written into e.g. ""temp.demo"" and in scorescreen player can click ""Save demo"". Game would save demo with e.g. date and time as name, when match was played that is.

Feel free to give your thoughts or add more suggestions. 

**Classes:**

**Assault:** aggressive frontline class.

*Primary:* Various ARs with 3 attachments or shotguns. Silencers only on select guns. Tactical lights.    
*Equipment 1:* 

* under barrel shotguns with various ammo like BF3. Not necessarily mounted like BF3. 

* under barrel launchers with various ammo, including smoke. Not necessarily mounted like BF3. 

* breach charges. Mountable on walls/doors and open up hole when detonated by timer. Allow for player to stand very close to charge without taking damage. Damages enemies on other side and disorients at even greater range in other side.  

*Equipment 2:* adrenaline shot like BC1. Quick, fast health. Has a cool down time and possibly ammo. Allows for assaults to be full health for charges or get quick health in battle. Health regen would need to be slower/more delayed or removes for this to work. 

*Options grenade substitute:* 2x flash bang



**Engineer:** vehicle based class like BF3. 

*Primary:* Carbines and SMGs or shotguns. No silencers. 3 attachments.
*Equipment 1:* 

* RPG/SMAW. Like BF3's

* AT4/Gustav. Faster rockets like BC2's Gustav allowing for farther tank engagement or better accuracy at aircraft.  Less damage. Won't one hit kill aircraft, but leave disabled at 10% or so. 

* javelin. Location fire only without lock on. Can be used to hit stationary vehicles, snipers, or as a bunker buster. 

* ERYX or equivalent wire guided. Like BF2 AT rockets or BC2 AT4.
 
* MANPADS (stingers). Similar to BF3 versus jets. Can't hit helicopters below a significant altitude (below radar). Faster rockets, painted javelins, and user guided can hit the closer choppers. 

*Equipment 2:*

* repair tool. Not as good at destroying as BF3's. 

* improved EOD bot. Converts land mines and equipment, controls better, stronger.

* AT mines

*Optional grenade substitute:* can't think of one. Feel free to suggest one

*Other:* can fix bridges like BF2. 



**Support:** class to back up infantry

*Primary weapon:* LMGs and shotguns. 3 attachments. 

*Equipment 1:*

* ammo packs. Resupplies infantry and vehicles. 

* deploy tripod weapon. Can deploy tripoded .50s, wire guide launchers (TOW), and maybe an AA one. Limited ammo, very slow resupply, and health. Engineers can repair when damaged. One at a time and cool down. Can be used by anyone, but enemies chat fix or resupply. 

*Equipment 2:* 

* time fused C4. Can be defused by enemy engineers. 

* claymores 

* mortar. aiming and damage like that of mobile artillery in AK and recoil. Can have aim assisted by recons. When recon requests some kind of assistance appears to hit very close to request. Smoke, HE impact, HE burst, flares

*Optional grenade substitute:* 2x smoke

*Other:* can fix bridges like BF2 engineers. 



**Recon:** sniper and reconnaissance. 

*Primary weapon:* DMRs, Sniper rifles, SMGs/Carbines. Can use silencers on all. 3 attachments. Scope that auto spits like BC2 would be nice. Also a range finder. 

*Equipment 1:* 

* spawn beacon. Would be neat to actually parachute from an aircraft. 

* jammer. Hides 2D spotting for enemy in radius. No dot when spotted or firing. 

* remote C4. 

*Equipment 2:* 

* TUGS

* UAV. Like BF3's MAV. Can also request artillery/mortar/bombing on location, but has cool down. 

* SOFLAM. Auto spot or remotely controlled. Targets much like BF3's. Has red light.

* binoculars. Visually like BC2's. Function like a SOFLAM. No red light. Require targeting whole time. If recon looses target target missiles will still follow the binoculars focus or if put away/killed his go straight.

*Option grenade substitute:* 2x marking smoke. Can be used to request a mortar/artillery/bombing. Farther throwing distance than normal grenades. 



**Medic:** well rounded medic class

*Primary:* ARs, DMRs, SMGs, lighter LMGs, and shotguns. 2 attachments. Can be silenced. 

*Equipment 1:* 

* defibrillator. Has cool down. Can't revive some deaths. 

*Equipment 2:*

* med packs. 

*Option grenade substitute:* smoke. To cover revives. 

* if you can think of more medic equipment feel free to suggest



**Squad leaders:** can request support from commander. Receives points for following commander directions. Can direct squad mates. Spawn location. Squad gets point bonuses for following orders and being near. 



**Commander:** directs squad leaders. Gets points for assisting team, answering request, and having squad leaders be successful. pistol only

*Abilities:* 

* some may be available based on captured bases like BF3 AC-130 and C-130. 

* supply drop. Provide ammo and health to all team assets. 

* transport drops. Drops transport vehicles. Drop from aircraft. 

* UAV. Like BF2 UAV.

* could use some more here abilities of things to improve from BF2. 



**Vehicles:** similar active and passive spec. A mix if same pick a secondary or pick two weapons. Some new specs and features and classes. Also, I would like to see boats, but I'm not sure if they're going back to a grenade launcher ons dingy like BC2 or full out aircraft carrier, sub, battleship like 1942 so I'll suggest my wishes for land and air. 



**MBTs:** like every BF.

*Weapons (pick two, at least one shell, all have ammo):*

* speed. Boost top speed and acceleration.
 
* maintence

* area effect. Like BF2's. Medic heals near by infantry, support resupplies near by infantry and vehicles, engineer lower the disable damage of vehicles and slows burn damage, recon hides removes spotting on near by allies, and assault significantly reduces suppression to near by infantry.

* ammo
  
*Gunner:* 7.62mm robot by default

**Tank destroyers:** so on like other armour. No gunner like BF3. 



**Self propelled artillery:** have mortar/howitzer like guns. Faster and more armoured than truck missile based ones in BF3 but slower firing and weaker.  Air burst and regular HE. Aiming much like BF3s. Can be assisted by recon like mortars. When assisted have ability to the fire 5 or show shells really quick that land in same area at same time. Have some machine guns for defense. Specs like tanks. 



**Artillery trucks:** like BF3s. Higher damage and faster firing than self propelled, but more vulnerable. Can be assisted by recon. Can target aircraft or use TOW like missile like in BF3. Specs like tank. 



**Mobile AA:** much like BF3. Specs like tanks. Maybe a flak weapon option, though not that realistic.

*Pilot weapons:* pick 2

* heat seekers

* Hydra rockets or equivalent (more splash, less damage) 

* Hellfire or equivalent (less splash, more damage) 

*Gunners:* gets cannon and then a laser guided missile that can lock or TV. 




**Scout helicopters:** similar spec to BF3. Below radar, but lesser ceiling due to engineer repair ability. Give pilot another active action to drop smoke below chopper and another passive to allow passengers to drop down repel ropes. 

*Pilot secondary weapons:*

* heat seekers

Like a clone army of the same engineer guy with a beard an cap on.

* MICH helmet with goggles worn on the helmet in cover
* Helmet with goggles worn on
* khaki cap with shemagh
* simple beanie
* boonie hat
and so forth

I also think the camouflage would be the same for the entire team. I don't know about you guys but i found the camouflage choice kinda redundant.

1371049621.0,30,self.battlefield_4,1g76a5,Full Magazine Reload is actually inconsistent in E3 live gameplay video,35,5,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1g76a5/full_magazine_reload_is_actually_inconsistent_in/,"I was watching the E3 video on http://www.twitch.tv/battlefield/b/415662298 and thought it would be good to spot new mechanics such as the full magazine reload that was posted here on Reddit. While I didn't watch the whole thing (it's 5 hours long), I came to believe that unfortunately, it seems our knowledge on the subject of the full magazine reload is still incomplete, because: 

1. Beginning around 1:05:17 you will see the player have 14/98 bullets before reload, and 31/81 after reloading, which means the reload just drained 17 bullets, exactly the number he had already used with his 31 bullets gun. Weird thing: seconds later, the player ""reloads"" without triggering any reload animation.

2. At around 1:10:43, on the other hand, the guy has 13/230 on his LMG, and after reloading he has 46/184, meaning a full magazine reload of 46 bullets. The 13 bullets were discarded. 

3. At 1:11:16, before reloading it's 18/217 and after it's 31/204. Again,  only 13 bullets were drained, so there is no full magazine reload this time.

It seems to me that there it could be a bug, some unexplained and/or unusual mechanic that makes classes reload differently from each other or that DICE is testing this but didn't decide what to do yet. Regardless of the cause, what I think I spotted was that the reload mechanics are inconsistent right now, so it may be too soon to draw conclusions about this.

That being said, im hoping they get some variety in there and have differing weather types and what not. One of these im hoping will be full on night time maps.

That means: everyone having to use some sort of IRNV vision. Combine this with the new green laser pointer and you got yourself some awesome looking scenes. The dark has to be DARK, not kinda semi dark like Tehran Highway, but basically you cant see without IRNV.

Originally i thought of this for just infantry maps but with tanks and helis having IRNV too, they could join in. They would probably PWN without a decent trade off so having them go around with flashing lights attached as its night time means that people can see them better.

Some ideas about these kinda maps:

1: Getting shot in the head area/helmet could result in your IRNV going fuzzy for a couple of seconds, and an animation could kick in for your character to fiddle around with it to make it normal again.

2: The green laser pointers would be invisible to naked eye, only seen through IRNV. (This probably isnt what the green laser pointer actually does in BF4.)

3: Some parts of the map could be lit up. For instance, the inside of a building so you can take off/put back on IRNV going in and out of the dark. (much like the Heavy Helmet thing in MOH Warfighter.)

However The great thing about it was that you could also customize the individual colour of everyone of your buddies to be a unique colour. 

http://i.imgur.com/EGke1va.jpg

So if like me you play with a lot of different friends and clan mates at the same time then by giving each of them a different colour you can easily and quickly know who is who on the battlefield even if they are in your squad or not. For example if i had made my friend ""DarkLord7854"" purple colour and my other friend ""Demize99"" yellow colour and was driving a jeep and saw a purple buddy on my mini map just up ahead i would instantly know it was ""DarkLord7854"" and could shout to him on VOIP if he wanted a lift, if while heading over to pick him up i saw an enemy tank heading towards the yellow buddy icon on my mini map i could warn ""Demize99"" that a tank was heading his way. 

It will make the game much more fun as it increases teamwork and communication as it did with battlefield vietnam. I know we can currently have 4 friends in our squad in games BF4 but many people have more than 4 friends and clan mates playing at the same time and also having your 4 squad members a different colour would help differentiate between them much easier.

To use this feature in Battlefield Vietnam you had to do the following:
&gt; Quote: -Unique colors for individual buddies. Once a buddy has been added to the buddylist.con (located in the settings\profiles\profile_name folder), that file can be edited manually to adjust the RGB value of the individual buddies. The unique color will appear in the mini-map, 3d map, and for text, and death messages. For instance, game.addPlayerToBuddyListByName “Player” 255.0 155.0 0.0 = Red(R) 255.0, Green(G) 155.0, Blue(B) 0.0 –&gt; an Orange buddy icon. 

Might sound complicated to some but it wasn't, and also people made little programs to easily edit the colours with a GUI. Of course if it was implemented like that it would have to be PC only but there is no reason why it couldn't be improved with a menu in game or on battlelog in the friends page that let you click on your friends name and then use a colour picker like this ""Html Color Picker"" http://html-color-codes.info/#HTML_Color_Picker  to do it, Even console versions could then have this feature.

So DICE please add this little feature, at least add it for PC in the same kind of way it was for BFV as if BF4 is going to be something special it needs to have all the great features of previous battlefield games :)",,False,self,t5_2uie9,False,,,True,t3_1gehk6,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1gehk6/bring_back_coloured_buddiesfriends_feature_to_bf4/,

I'm pretty sure this means that there will be a cooldown for 3D spotting in multiplayer, so people can't just spam the spot button in crowded areas, making stealth and smoke more of an option.


Also, the triangle was hollow when he was in the gunner seat of the jeep, but full as the driver, so hopefully this means that there will be more communication between driver and gunner in vehicles.

The assault kit is clearly the go-to kit in most situations, at least PC where there is almost always heavy infantry fighting. I realize console players are engineer a lot  more (percentage wise) due to the lower player count. Instead of giving the medical equipment back to the support kit, what if a class similar to engineer was created and dubbed the medic? Essentially take the engineer class from BF3 and put medpack and defibs as the equipment instead of the explosives.

That will help balance the medics out, and remove their explosives equipment (M320). This does leave the assault kit with the only equipment option being underslung attachments. They could be given access to spawn beacons to help *assault* objectives.

Support and Engineer are already well balanced classes so there is no need to do anything with them. Only minor tweaks to the Recon class are needed.

How is this fair again? The only way a Recon can fight back through Smoke is if the enemies are spotted because then you can fire at their red triangles.

The Glint being visible through Smokes just makes Recon, especially when playing Rush, that more difficult to play effectively.

Most of this comes from the average recon player being percieved as useless to the rest of the team.  There are some players who use what they call ""Aggressive Recon"" to use the abilities of the class to find enemies and push objectives.  Other players simply use the class to snipe.  In battlefield 4, both strategies should be allowed and encouraged to help the rest of the team.  This is going to be long so I'll try to break it up and avoid the wall of text.

Sinper

The sniper aspect of the class could be used to help the team be observing how snipers benefit their teams in real life.  As it says on Wikipedia, ""Generally, a sniper's primary function in modern warfare is to provide detailed reconnaissance from a concealed position and, if necessary, to reduce the enemy's fighting ability by neutralizing high value targets (especially officers, communication and other personnel) and in the process pinning down and demoralizing the enemy. Typical sniper missions include managing intelligence information they gather during reconnaissance and surveillance, target acquisition for air-strikes and artillery, assist employed combat force with fire support and counter-sniper tactics, killing enemy commanders, selecting targets of opportunity, and even destruction of military equipment, which tend to require use of anti-materiel rifles in the larger calibers such as the .50 BMG, like the Barrett M82, McMillan Tac-50, and Denel NTW-20.""  

These roles can be reflected in game.  The first role, recon, can be helped by improving the ability to spot enemies.  This could be done by adding a multipurpose binoculars gadget.  Aside from the basic function of seeing far away with a wider field of view than the scope, the binoculars should also automatically spot enemies (think spotter scope attachment from BFBC2) and include a range finder.  The scopes should be designed so as to make a rangefinder actually useful.  Another thing that could help is to include something similar to the BFBC2 mortar strike, but less spammy.  Also, icluding something similar to the IRNV scope, but make it recon only and less overpowered.  This could be done by making it a gadget that applies to the zoom level you've chosen.  The whole point of the scope is to make seeing enemies easier, and that is what recon is supposed to do.  Because this should be done from a concealed position, another gadget option should be to allow the sniper to wear a ghillie suit, or another suit optimized for camoflauge on the map.  This would also add environmental camo to the rifle.  Also, should a prone sniper with this gadget be allowed to be spotted? Let me know what you guys think.

The part about neutralizing enemy officers would be really interesting if Battlefield Commander is incorporated.  Maybe if the commander died, he wouldn't have access to his commander map for a time.  Also during this time, the other team would not be allowed to spot anyone to represent communication being limitted.  Because snipers are supposed to target particularly effective individuals, someone on a turret, someone with a deployed lmg, another sniper, or a medic could have distict icons when spotted, and the sniper could get a bonus for killing these people while they are spotted by someone else.  Sniper rifles should have greatly increased suppression per bullet compared to other classes (but no random bullet deviation).  This would represent the fear snipers are supposed to create.

Sniper damage should be adjusted, but not in the way most people suggest.  In real life, sniper rounds actually have more knockdown power at long range.  At close range the bullet is moving fast enough to zip through the target, but at long range it slows down to the point that it transmits all of its energy into the target and puts him on his ass.  This could be reflected by making the sniper get a headshot at medium to long range, and at very long range, allow one hit kill body shots.  This would encourage snipers to help the team from afar.

Scope glint should stay, but it should be toned down and actually be based on the light conditions.  When in the tunnels on metro, what could possibly be causing the scope to look like the tac light?  However, this would allow players to use the taclight to find snipers by scanning with it in dark places looking for scope glint.

I also propose a trip wire gadget that would basically be a trip wire attached to a flashbang.  The sniper could place it in a door way and the target would be stunned when they activated it and the sniper would be alerted by the loud bang.  Claymores should also be given to the sniper.

Finally, antimaterial rifles would allow one hit kills at all ranges, the ability to disable light vehicles and helicopters with shots to the engine or rotors, and the ability to shoot through helicopter cockpits.  However the shooter would only be allowed to fire while the weapon was on a bipod.  Also, recoil would be higher than other rifles and could possibly take up one of the gadget slots.  This way, the player can only defend themselves at close range with their pistol.  The anti material rounds would punch holes in walls and destroy other equipment like medpacks, ammo, and things like that in one shot.

Finally, suppressors on snipers would do the same damage and have the same range, but they wouldn't use subsonic ammo.  This means when a suppressed sniper fires, you still hear a loud crack, but you don't know where it's coming from.

Aggressive Recon

The close quarters aspect of recon should also be embraced.  They should be given C4 as a gadget option (and honestly, so should all classes).  Another gadget option could be that the countries default carbine is equipped as a close quarters fighting mechanism along with the sniper and pistol.  It would reduce the speed of the class, and make switching between either of the three take more time.  It would be on the D-pad on consoles and have its own button on PC.  This gadget would also mean less ammo for each weapon.  It would take up the same slot as the Anti Material rifle, so no M107, M4A1, and pistol at the same time.  The purpose of this is that the class still wouldn't have the front line power of the assault or support class, but be versatile in combat.

Recon should also be allowed to use two more types of drone.  First would be one of the kite like ones (Israeli Skylark I think) and the player would be able to control it or designate an area for it to orbit and spot automatically.  The other would be really cool for aggressive recon.  A smaller version of the EOD bot that functions as nothing more than a steerable camera.  It can be driven around corners to find/spot enemies, and collected later.

I would also add smoke grenades as a gadget.  As far as the current gadgets go, I would keep the MAV, keep the motion sensor in its deployable form and not return it to ball state, and remove the spawn beacon.

Thanks to everyone who actually read that whole thing.  Do you guys have any ideas for the recon class?

Edit: Also, maybe the suppressor on all weapons should remove the kill cam?

Edit: People talking about bullet trails made me think of something.  I was watching a show once about snipers and it said that when looking through those scopes the spotter in a two man sniper team uses, bullet trails are visible for some reason.  This is used to help tell the sniper how to adjust his aim.  In game however, this could be an effective counter sniper tool if implemented as some gadget.",,False,self,t5_2uie9,1369101929.0,,,True,t3_1eof1k,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1eof1k/what_to_do_about_recon_post_your_ideas_too/,

On console I had currently done well in BC2, and I was pretty average in BF3 on PC (kdr1.5 spm ~500 (CQL and Rush only).
So when I started the game, BC2 on PC, I was often killed by people with 1-15% health left. I quickly came to realize that all these more experienced players had 25% more health or damage, since they used these specs  (I had used them on console ofc). Other people's guns I picked up were much more effective too, even if they were the same as my own.

This made the game very difficult to pick up.

After padding enough score and spamming an AT4 on EA fun servers (20x score ranked server) I got most unlocks and specs and boy, did it make a difference. 

All normal rounds before I had gone sub-1 kdr and low score, but now in normal servers I found myself as MVP with a kdr of 2. The game was actually getting bearable now. One Heavy Metal round I shot down 6 choppers with my AT4, which is hands down the best rpg launcher in the game.

What I thought there was, what if you were a real starter, and every single player, the better and the worse, had an advantage over you in every situation? Would that not be bad for newcomers?

This does NOT mean that I want unlocks removed, unlocks are good the BF3 way, and with proper weapon balance (or the best guns being the first you get)

I thought I would gather together anything new we learn in the stream, in case people are at work or cannot connect to the stream for various reasons.
_________

LIVE UPDATES:

* **Karl Magnus Troedsson**, the DICE general manager, is being interviewed.

* In the pre-Alpha stage, you can **counter-melee attacks** that happen when the enemy comes towards you. You cannot counter melee attacks which come from behind.

* **Levolution** is a ""concept"", not just setpiece moments like the skyscraper collapse. You can shoot fire extinguishers to create a brief ""smokescreen"".

* **Spectator mode is confirmed.** You can spectate through **first person, third person and free camera!** Magnus Troedsson says Dice are listening to the competitive community. E3 is the first big test of the spectator system, he says.

* Changes to the **suppression system** are confirmed. Suppression is now more heavily focused on the support class. Magnus Troedsson says it will be much more obvious in long range combat, not close quarters fights.

* Thanks to /u/SchnitzelSandwich for pointing our something I completely forgot to mention: Magnus Troedsson says you will be able to **dive underwater and ""sprint-swim""** both above and below the surface.

* If I heard correctly you can now **lean over cover** with a sniper rifle and look down the scope.

* For those not watching the stream they have 64 computers set up in the corner of the EA booth at E3. There's a big screen playing the reveal trailer.

* **First look at spectator mode!** You can switch between any player, and look through first or third person, or free camera.

* We're watching from the view of a pilot of a U.S. attack helicopter, it's the same helicopter as the U.S. attack heli in BF3.

* Big news: **having control of different flags will give you different abilities.** In Seige of Shanghai, C flag gives you control of the gunship, flag B gives you a ""tomahawk"", flag D gives you some sort of scanning device.

* Taking down the skyscrapers is done by shooting down four ""pillars"" on the four corners of the building. It is player controlled, not a timed setpiece at a certain number of tickets.

* You can **use pistols while swimming in water.**

* First, low resolution screenshot of spectator mode. You can see the user interface at the top and how you switch between players and camera angles: http://i.imgur.com/5YxTko7.jpg

* They're running PCs on the show floor. It's also confirmed to run **64 players at 60fps on next generation consoles.** Yesterday we learned it will be 30fps, 24 players on current gen consoles.

* More gameplay. We're now looking at a player using a tank. There is an underground parking garage on this maps as well as the metro station we saw yesterday. Patrick Bach says metal detectors are in the metro station, when you go through them they make a noise and alert enemy players to your presence.

* Helicopter is on fire. Is it me or does that fire look much better than BF3?

* **There is not unlimited ammo for main battle tanks.** It seems that there is for attack helicopters.

* New kind of red dot sight, not sure what it's called.

* ""You can use your sidearm while in the water,"" Bach confirms.

* We're watching a guy who seems to be trying to shoot down his team's helicopter with a **stinger**...

* **Knife customisation,** Bach confirms.

* There is still debris falling from the sky around the map following the skyscraper collapse.

* **The commander cannot force people to do things.** If you want to go take a different objective to the one the commander has ordered you to take, you can.

* /u/SchnitzelSandwich notes that the stinger appears to have a slightly longer lock on time. Good observation: ""There is a guy who is a Medic who pulled out what looked like his defibs. It says that he has 2 ammo left when he pulled it out. **Limited revives maybe?**""

* More gameplay. We're looking at the free camera in spectator mode, following the U.S. team as they go through the map.

* One minor thing is that bullets are now much more obvious as they go through the air. Not sure if they have tracers or not but there are orange streaks all over the place in hotspots on the map.

* One thing that seems to have changes is that it is no longer the case that enemies are orange and you are blue, it appears **there are orange and blue teams**, so half the time you will shoot blue players and half the time you will shoot orange players. Unless I'm missing something, I'm not sure why this is the case.

* There seems to be **a lot of microdestruction**. Think Close Quarters, but all around the huge map. There is lots of debris littering the city.

* I'm off, since [the thread the mods have named the official thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1g55xm/bf4_livestream_discussion/) is much further up the subreddit and there's a lot more discussion going on there.

1371679878.0,26,self.battlefield_4,1gopg6,I'd like to remind everyone to keep criticism on Microsoft for a couple of key reasons completely relevant to Battlefield 4,42,16,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1gopg6/id_like_to_remind_everyone_to_keep_criticism_on/,"It's no secret that Battlefield 3 suffered from a number of awful weapon glitches.

These glitches stayed in the game for months, waiting for DICE to push out their large patches.

The cause of this, I believe, is due to patch fees. It costs an awful lot to push out a patch on the consoles, Tim Schafer is quoted saying $40,000 for PS3 and 360 combined.

We know Sony are changing their policy on fees for PS4, there certainly aren't any on PC. This leaves the Xbox as a key component in holding things back, the other systems WILL have to wait months for large super patches as a result of the one system that charges.

I really suggest that, for those that want to see DICE capable of releasing hotfixes on the fly to get rid of those pesky weapon bugs, everyone stay highly critical of their position on fees, and even not support them unless it is removed. It holds everyone back. The fact that they've turned around on these policies so far is demonstration that voices CAN be heard.

Remember, in a best case scenario where DICE push out hotfixes for everyone EXCEPT the Xbox One, that still means One owners will have to wait months for fixes while everyone else does not. That in my opinion makes the One certainly not the best system to be playing BF4 on.

I want DICE unhindered and I want what's best for gamers on all systems. You should too.

2) I would also like to see players being transported into the area and being dropped off at the start of the map. I.E when the game is loading you see yourself and other players in the seats of a vehicle moving to the first base if attacking. And it would show defending players in a meeting room or in the armoury getting ready.

The second bit IMO would make the loading screens a lot more interesting.

Edit: off topic, it would also amazing to see smoke grenades that actually hold well, and don't dissipate straight away.

If you're not familiar with us, our YouTube channel is Shustybang (pronounced shoosty-bang) and we became fairly popular with our BF3 Weapon Reviews. They're not the most viewed (I believe LevelCap has the highest viewed weapon review vids) but unless I'm mistaken, our BF3 weapon reviews are the second most popular/viewed on YouTube. If you haven't seen them, and you're interested, here's a link to the full playlist (no pressure to watch anything though) http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9B8C58515C46C5DD

FakeThriller and I were talking about what we planned on changing, if anything, for when we continue our weapon reviews for BF4. We both decided we didn't want to take anything away from what we have done with previous reviews. We both like the layout/formula, and apparently a lot of other people do. Aside from really enhancing the graphics that we use, we figured we could add a thing or two to make the videos either more enjoyable, more informed, or both. Thing is...we're not really sure what that could be.

So, I'm asking you guys, what is it you would like to see added to our videos (if you're familiar with them), or what is it you look for in a weapon review?",,False,self,t5_2uie9,1374504566.0,,pc,True,t3_1itbhu,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1itbhu/bf4_weapon_reviews_what_will_you_be_looking_for/,
1373653196.0,25,self.battlefield_4,1i62zl,Discussion: dot or triangle 2d spotting on minimap,30,5,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1i62zl/discussion_dot_or_triangle_2d_spotting_on_minimap/,"Q spamming and 3d spotting are realy ""OP"". But what about 2d spotting (minimap)? Once you spot someone (sound, equipment, manually) even if they broke LOS you can keep tracking where re they going and where they are looking through the minimap. 

To consoles players, on PC besides bringing up the ""big"" map we can also modify the zoom of the minimap pretty quickly (i have bind it on the mouse wheel). This makes flanks n pushings really easy once you know where the enemy is seeing.

Yeah, i know, the game is almost near release. Just want to debate if it would be more ""balance"" if instead of having a triangle we had a dot.  In this way at least i dont know if the guy who is around the corner is waiting for me to run or oblivious to my presence. 

Now, if you let me, i would love having BOTH systems. Manual spottings gives you the triangle while automatic ones (mav, tugs, sound, proximity) gives you the dot.
To make it graphic, something like this (Planetside2):

 It could be a lot of fun in battlefield 4, and they could experiment with the play style to include vehicles in this type of play. What your team starts with is all they get for the entire round. Perhaps make it so if you capture an objective your team can respawn again, and push forward. I remember a half life military mod that was like that. It would be a lot of enjoyment for the hardcore and oldschool old fashion gamers who grew up playing these types of games, and I would be happy to give a warm welcome back to it. It really makes the game play a whole lot different and difficult when you know that that next bullet could be the last for the rest of the round, and with the new spectator mode, it would be more enjoyable to watch the round after you get taken out.

1371668105.0,26,self.battlefield_4,1go88e,[Suggestion] BF4 - 72 Player servers,44,18,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1go88e/suggestion_bf4_72_player_servers/,"So in BF3 32 vs 32 (64 Player) servers worked really well because you could end up with 8 full squads working together on each side.  With the squads bumping up to 5 players (from 4) it throws off this balance and you will end up with 6 full squads and 2 loners; plus the commander who doesn't take up a squad spot.

My request is the the server player count be increased from 64 to 72 so that in a full game all the squads can be maxxed out which theoretically would result in better team play...

TLDR:

* 66 Players = 6 Full Squads + 2 loners + 1 Commander, per side
* 72 Players = 7 Full Squads + 1 Commander, per side


EDIT:

Also want to point out that this wouldn't just be a change for the large the other server player counts would change too.

 • 16 player servers would now be 20 players (+2 Commander spots)

 • 32 player servers would now be 40 players (+2 Commander spots)

 • 64 player servers would now be 70 players (+2 Commander spots)

 
Of course these are just the default sizes, you could have 30, 50, 60 player servers as well. The purpose of the change isn't to make the servers bigger it's to balance the squads so that they can be maxxed out if the players choose to.

* This was all that was available at launch.  It included the base game, and if you buy the Limited Edition, it also included the first expansion.  The same deal is confirmed for BF4.  This is what you get if you pre-order.

**Premium Service - $50** 

 * The Premium Service gave you all five expansion packs plus access to the Premium Member perks and specials.  It did not include the base game.  This will probably be available within a couple months after launch.  it's a decent deal because it's actually less than the cost of all the expansions purchased individually.

**Premium Edition - $60**

* The Premium Edition bundled the base game together with the Premium Service for one low price.  This was an insane deal, but this bundle didn't come out until about a year after BF3's release.  If you're waiting on this to save money, you're going to be waiting a very long while.

Basically, if you want to play BF4 sometime within the first year, you're not going to be saving any money by waiting and not pre-ordering.  Some people are confused and believe that the Premium Service which comes out soon after launch is the same thing as the Premium Edition.  It's not.  Lastly, [here's a link](https://help.ea.com/article/what-is-the-difference-between-battlefield-3-premium-and-battlefield-3-premium-edition) with more info on the differences of BF3.",,False,self,t5_2uie9,1371506833.0,,pc,True,t3_1gjhnh,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1gjhnh/clearing_up_some_confusion_regarding_premium/,

So you would have your sprint always working for you but no flak protection from your squad mates perk if he is on the other side of the map, but as soon as you get within a certain distance of him, you get flak protection and he gets faster sprint from your perk.

This makes the vehicle not adequate to transport an entire squad to the battlefield. Perhaps the transport helicopter should allow for at least one additional players to ride.


 To break down the seats, we can have 1 Pilot and 1 Copilot, 2 Door Gunner / Commander Chair, and Passenger Seats.  Or at least available 5 seats in addition to the pilot. 

Additionally with the 64 player limit, I still wish there was a bit more, my favorite games battlefield are the ARMA series, so I would love to see an influence from ARMA 3, increase in the player count to even 128. Can the Xbox One and PS4 even handle something like this, or should I just plan on investing in a pc, to stop being let down by the console versions of games with the lack of MMO? Can anyone clarify how many players will be in the PC versions of the game if it will be additional like in the bf3

I'm not talking from the highest of the pedestals here, since BF3 has been my first Battlefield, but what I'd like to see in an actual hardcore mode are features like

* **Nerfed defib.** Headshotted? Can't be revived. Your throat has been opened in half like a tin can? Can't be revived. Also, you can't die like 5 times in the same life. Seriously. Also, headshot insta-death could be a thing.
* **A way to check magazines left and fire mode**. No, I don't want them on the screen, but a way to check it (maybe with an animation that makes you tap your pockets or whatever, so it takes you half a second and actual care) is necessary.
* **A mode with permadeath**. Like rush with only one M-COM, if you die, you have 20 seconds to be revived with adrenaline or whatever or you are a spectator for the rest of the match. I remember something like this from old SOCOMs.

Now I'm throwing out very unpopular opinions:

* **Animations to get in and out of vehicles**. In BF3 co-op it took just 2 seconds, and I find that the ability to teletransport inside a tank gives an unfair advantage on infantry, while a quick defenseless animation is a fair toll to pay in order to gain such superiority. Look at knives animations: you're not wasting bulletts, you are totally silent, so you pay all this with a couple of seconds of defenseless animation.
* **Reloading half-emptied magazines will either make you lose the remaining bullets or re-store those magazines half emptied**, so that when you reload your last one it's already used.

All this, or some of this, would make hardcore servers a place for hardcore gamers, and create some very intense games.

-

If you fly the helicopter so that you control the [**yaw**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_principal_axes) with your mouse X axis, the input is not analog. If your mouse controls the roll and pitch, even the smallest movements will result in pitching or rolling in the respective direction. However, if you control the yaw with mouse, there is a threshold speed you have to move the mouse at before it starts to turn at all, making it very annoying to do fine tune aiming with. The yaw input should definitely be made analog.

TL;DR - **Yaw input is digital with mouse, not analog like pitch and roll**


**Vehicle driver and gunner sensitivities are too different**
-

If I set my tank driver sensitivity so that I turn approximately 1 full rotation (~360°) on my mousepad, the gunner sensitivity will be such that I turn a bit over 2 full rotations (~800°). Since you need to have a rather high sensitivity as the tank driver in order to be able to turn around fast enough in hectic situations, the gunner sensitivity will be absurdly high.

- Suggestion 1: Use infantry sensitivity for the gunner
- Suggestion 2: Allow independent sensitivity values for vehicle driver and gunner

**You can't change sensitivity values from the dev console**
-

The developer console is enabled on PC and you can use a few commands with it, like the framerate limit or framerate display. But it would be immensely useful to be able to change the sensitivity with the console, since the slider bars are far from accurate enough. 

- Suggestion 1: Allow players to change sensitivity values from the developer console
- Suggestion 2: Add numeric values next to the slider bars for more accuracy in setting your sensitivity


**Please refrain from suggestions regarding mice that allow for DPI switching on the fly, that is not an option for everyone, and is definitely not a valid reason to not have these features in the game.**",,False,self,t5_2uie9,False,,pc,True,t3_1fj8vg,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1fj8vg/a_few_small_things_i_hope_will_be_done_better_in/,

In BF3, there was a short time for a bullet to hit at 100m. In the clip, it seems almost instant, which is what it should be. I also noticed when he was testing the bullet drop on the building which looked to be about 250m, that the bullet impacted much faster than it did in BF3.  Can anyone confirm my observations?

Also, has the bullet drop been fixed?  For example, in BF3 you'd have to aim about 2 feet or so above someone at 200m to get a hit, when in real life it would only be about 5 inches with a 100m zero.

I'm mainly wanting to know if a bullet at 800m/s will reach a target at 800m in one second, with the appropriate drop.

The latest COD has the dev team shouting ""look at the awesome fish AI!""

This year, it seems, EA/DICE is sitting back and letting the footage do the talking. Sure, the video IS staged to show us specific features in the game that look pretty but none of the DICE/EA reps have specifically been directing my attention to useless features so far.

If the enemy who killed you has been spotted, for example, you should be able to see the last few seconds before he shot you on the killcam. If the person was not spotted, there would be no killcam, just weapon information, etc. If the person was using a suppressor, the killcam should be limited to weapon information.

I'd like to acknowledge the work [u/KILLINIADOR](http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1jfwc2/every_confirmed_bf4_feature_alpha_files/) and [u/VampireVendetta](http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1g7qls/bf4_running_list_of_things_weve_learned_so_far/) have done to create very organized lists of what we know so far about the game and I'd like to add that I really appreciate these very detailed threads and how well the BF4 community responds to them and helps them to grow.

So, on to my point: I'd like to create a thread to organize our questions about the information that comes out of GC so that redditors who are attending the show can know what the rest of the community wants to know about the game.  Be it general impressions, specifics about the new systems or weapons, information about the maps, interviews with devs or staff, etc.  Basically all of the questions that we had during E3 posted into one thread so we can get the most out of it.

I know we'll probably see a lot of new footage come out of GC, but I'm also very interested in the impressions of those that got to actually play the game.  Think of it as an AMA Request post from /r/IAmA  .

To start, here are just a few of the very general questions I'd like to see answered:

1: (Assuming this is a newer build that we'll see) What are some of the major changes you've noticed between the E3 build and the GC build?

* Animations?
* Effects/Textures/Models?
* Any new levolution moments?
* UI features?
* Etc.

2: What new things do we have to look forward to?

* Weapons/attachments
* Gadgets/knives
* Customization options (skins/emblems/camos)
* Vehicles/customizations

3: How do you feel the game has changed/progressed from BF3 overall?  Do you get the feeling from this build that this is just going to be BF3.5 as some people believe or does it genuinely feel like a fresh new entry into the series?

4: How does the new Battlelog integration feel?  Is it still clunky and awkward or does it verge on seamlessness?

* Did you get to play around with the new tablet or mobile UIs?

5: How does the balance feel?

6: Any classic BF glitches still present?

So that's what I've got for general questions, but I'd love to collaborate and get many more specific questions ready before GC in about 3 weeks. Any questions you felt went unanswered, that could have been answered before, but may have been forgotten/ignored/neglected?

The sheer power you feel as you leave the base and steam towards an objective is without equal among video games. But from a gameplay prospective they have to be one of the hardest assets to balance. With that in mind, I wanted to get everyones thoughts on the changes to the Tank in BF4. 

1. Limited Ammo

Would it be better to have a hard limit on Ammo, say 25 rounds ( 5 rounds per mag. plus four reloads like infantry ) or is what we saw at E3 of slowly regening ammo better?
 Having certain bases in Conquest that will resupply the tank works well , but what about attacking on Rush ? Look how far it is between the second &amp; third bases on Caspin Boarder is that reasonable to have to drive back and resupply?

2. Ammo types &amp; choices  

At E3 they had 2 types of shells for the main gun but in the leaked alpha files there was multiple types such as AT Arrows or sabot rounds . So what if one of the upgrades for the tank is the ability to carry two different rounds. Like 10 Sabot rounds , and 15 HE rounds . Or 5 Air Burst , and 20 normal ap rounds. Is that crazy? Is it to hard to balance?

3. Tank loadouts

This is pure speculation, but will the increased loadout spots make the Tanks impossible to balance? Give a  good tanker their choice of main rounds, optics, countermeasures, and an upgrade spot ? Could make for a deadly combination. 

I'm really excited to tryout the new dynamics , but am a little worried as I know there are far better Tankers then me :-)",,False,self,t5_2uie9,1372785462.0,,xboxone,True,t3_1hi8us,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1hi8us/battlefield_4_tanks/,

The idea of this level is that you get text orders that pops up on your screen like ""Get into the tank"" or ""Attack Alpha"".

The tutorial level is obligatory to all players and you can't play online unless you do this!

It should be a tutorial for every mode, commander and vehicle type and 2 obligatory (Conquest and classes).

Every tutorial should be about 5 minutes and include all info about the game mode/Vehicle.

If you haven't done E.G tank tutorial you can't jump in a tank besides gunner seat and the same goes to any other vehicle besides car/ATV/Dirtbike.

The idea is to learn the new players how to succeed and become a better player!

Tell me what you think about this idea and please give me feedback if you don't agree with me.

I know DICE is developing Battlefront too, but can we keep the lasers in that game? 

Now BF isn't about realism and if the fictional US and CHN forces decide to sacrifice a little effectiveness for the sake of looking cool then I don't mind. But in BF3 it already looks like a sci-fi movie on night maps and like a sci-fi movie with bad production values on day maps.

I am digging all the new particle effects in BF4 but tracers should at least be *very* hard to see in daylight and completely miss the surrounding glow. I get that this would have an impact on balance, but if you wanna know where you're shot at from, you'll have the HUD indicator for it.

NOTE: **I am not talking about the tracers we see in first person alpha footage**, those are not what it looks like in the actual game. This also causes the ""bullet exiting the barrel at weird angle"" phenomenon which is probably due to the overdone effect and slight network lag since what we are seeing is footage of another client playing. But the 3rd person views are scary enough.

1371352232.0,15,self.battlefield_4,1gfo8l,[Suggestion] transport helicopters,18,3,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1gfo8l/suggestion_transport_helicopters/,"I think this needs to be addressed for dice to see and was recently brought to my attention by a comment on a post here


Transport helicopters are (to me) like boats in bf3, most people don't touch them, not powerful in fire power but have huge potential. I think the main point that people don't touch the transport helicopters is the lack of points/action that the pilot gets and is quiet a boring role. The only points the pilot gets is the kill assists and the spawn points (excluding the flag capping and other side points) and with the lack of pilot weaponry and only having to trust the insanely inaccurate and weak mini guns on either side. I'm not saying give the pilot his own guns, but maybe increase the damage/accuracy of the side guns.
 
The problem with points can be easily solved and was addressed by a user in the comment section of a post. The pilot should gain points obviously if someone spawns on him, but also if one of his crew members cap an objective shortly after being dropped off, the pilot should get some kind of assist. Also the should raise how much points they get if someone spawns on them or if a passenger gains a kill.

Another reason why I believe the transport helicopters are untouched is how helpless it is from ground and air. If the only form of protection is from the underpowered, inaccurate guns on the sides and the occasional stingers/javelins from the passengers then most people would avoid the death trap which are the transport helicopter. So what if, as well as the side guns being nerfed, the pilot gets a SOFLAM/heatseeker ability to further protect itself from air threats, and also have customisation like the attach helicopters such as proximity scan, laser painter, auto loader-like perk which could speed up the cooling down process of the mini guns and other perks.

I believe that the transport helicopters are a powerful asset to the team as a mobile spawn beacon behind enemy lines as well as the ability to distract/take out straggling infantry/vehicles, but lack the ability to grasp the attention of most players, so implementing a more rewarding point system and to add more protection to the helicopter in perk form as well as nerfing the already existent guns will give the helicopter the edge it needs to become a true weapon on the battlefield.",,False,self,t5_2uie9,False,,ps4,True,t3_1gfo8l,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1gfo8l/suggestion_transport_helicopters/,

Battlefield 3 was a flop for lot of gamers. Many want AI in offline Mod to play on the online maps. 
There are good reasons: 
1) They make multiplayer accesible for persons who dont play online (yes, many of these people still exist) 
2) They allow a player to practice all of the game modes at any time with a full compliment of combatants. 
3) They dont curse, cheat, complain, or leave the match when loosing. 
4) They allow for a full game without any lag, slowdown, or dropout. 
5) They provide great opponents Vs. teams of humans (once their difficulty is turned up). 
6) They cause a game to have infinate replay value.
7) Even if we can only play alone (no Lan) with Bots, it would be a great opportunity to practise all of the vehicles. Online it is very hard to practise new types of vehicles.

WHAT USERS THINK:


""Because it means fun!""

""for me, it is important to first gain some experience on the maps before playing them online against other players and it would be a very good way to try some strategies for the different maps and modes""

""Would be best game ever made""

1369103544.0,16,self.battlefield_4,1eqm5c,Sniping in Battlefield 4 and Recon Balance (very long),22,6,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1eqm5c/sniping_in_battlefield_4_and_recon_balance_very/,"hey reddit :) so today I want to talk and go over some of my ideas for sniping and the recon kit in Battlefield 4. So please feel free to share your ideas too ;D

ok so let's start out with the weapons we all know that the Sniper Rifles are the main weapons for the recon kit and this is where most people want to see changes in BF4. Many people want to get back the damage from BFBC2 so that OHK are easier achievable and even though this would make the Recon class more viable, I think this would be the wrong way to balance it out (will talk about both console and pc). I think sniper rifles (bolt-actions) are balanced how they are at the moment. I like the idea that it is a class which takes a little skill to master. Also I think upping the damage  would not actually encourage teamplay, if you think back yes aggressive/objective gameplay was a lot easier in BFBC2 but there were also a lot more campers, just think about all those times where half your time would not move up as attackers on rush. I'm mainly playing the recon class myself and I hate it when people always get down on the snipers. On the other Hand I think there should be a happy medium between playstyles and nobody should be forced to play in a certain way, so how can we get that happy medium between long range/passive and close range/aggressive?


let's start out with the aggressive side since that's what I'm mostly playing so I'm more familiar with it.
As I said in the beginning I like how it takes some skill to play aggressively with bolt action rifles up close, but not everyone is like me and some people would just like to hop on the recon class and do some work towards the objective too. 
So here is my thought how about a ammo like magnum ammo from BFBC2 which increases damage up close.
Most sniper rifles at the moment have a damage from 80-59, however if they would use the magnum ammo the would have a damage from 100-45 like this you would get a OHK (really) up close everywhere besides the on the body besides legs and arms (although bullet would be able to punch through the and hit the body = still OHK).
Like this a Headshot would still be a OHK at all ranges (240% damage) and a 3HK at long range which would only make the ammo viable for close range.
The upper Chest hitbox would be a OHK up to lets say 20 meters. (like SV98 in BF3)
However if this would still be too strong I think you could also decrease the bullet velocity ( which would also increase the drop) in order to make it a little bit more challenging.

I think like this it would be a lot easier to play the objective!


Now for long range sniping or passive sniping.
Let's talk about bullet velocity first. (Bullet Velocity in BFBC2 was 600m/S for all rifles) The bullet velocity determines how fast the bullet travels and also how much it drops. The lowest velocity of 490m/s belongs to the M40A5 and the best one of 650m/s to the M98B. So it is pretty much obvious that a long range sniper would go for the M98B. I think its actually pretty balanced with a 12x scope and fewer rounds for its high velocity however I still think that a bullet velocity of 650m/s is not quiet high enough since some of the AR's can shot at 670m/s and I think the highest bullet velocity should belong to a sniper rifle. In my opinion the bullet velocity for the slowest sniper rifle should be 550m/s and for the best one 700m/s to make it a little bit easier to get those needed headshots. 
But we haven't discussed the main problem with long range sniping yet. Which would be that most of them are not playing the objective. I know that many of them are playing a supportive role close to the objective but still behind or with the team which is probably what DICE had in mind ( which also works pretty good) however if there is someone up on a hill trying to get 1000m+ Headshots he isn't helping anybody since he is just playing against other snipers, since most players without scope glint are hardly visible anymore. So I think it is ok for a Sniper to go up to 500meters to kill targets but everthing else is just a sniper war because getting a 1km Headshot on a not sniper is very rarely the case since every little movement will make them miss/not kill. So like a said 500 meters limit with an effective range of 300 meters (please no comments about realism this is not arma :P). Another Idea would be to still show the marksman bonus (distance) but cut the points at 500 to keep them (""remotely"") close.
So much for the nerfs now let's talk about buff's.
I would like to see multiple Ghillie Suits for snipers (desert, wood etc.) to make it easier for them stay unseen. In addition to that I would also like to see reduced scope glare in general and a 6x times scope without scope glint, which would make it hard to hit long range targets in exchange for better ""hid-ability"" (you know what I mean). I think this would make sense however I'm not making games or balancing them so feel free to share your opinions :)

so much for the playstyle I know I haven't talked much about the passive inbetween sniper which supports his team since most people I was talking to (who are playing that role) are pretty happy with it.


So now let's talk about gadgets!

I really like the idea behind most the gadgets although I hate that I have to control almost all of them xO! Mav really awesome spotting tool but it makes you stay there out in the open like an idiot so what I would like to see for the MAV if it is making a return in BF4 is that I can aim at a point  on the map radius maybe like 100 meters (maybe like 20meters height above the ground/object) where it will be flying to if I send it there(will hover in the air).
In exchange for that it would do it slowly in a straight line so it would be easy to shoot it down.

For the TUGS make it easier to deploy! just that you can drop it nothing to add here i guess :P

For the Soflam I would like to see it having an attachment slot (like underslung for assault) so you can just aim at the target to designate it. In exchange we would have to sacrifice a attachment slot and it would have decreased range. 

For the Beacon... I'm happy with it :) only problem again is to deploy it! Make it so that you can drop it so it wont attach to the ground but it is faster and safer to put it down.

now for some gadgets which have not been in BF3 which I would like to see in BF4! 

Motion Balls! Please put them back in they were one of the most useful gadgets in the game also encouraged ptfo in my opinion.

C4! I would love to see C4 for the recon kit again,  to balance it out I would suggest implementing 2 ""throwmodes"" one is the one we have in bf3 you have to be up close and the c4 will stick to whatever you're putting it onto.
Other throwing mode would be more like BFBC2 although less range than in BFBC2 and it would not stick to anything.

....I know the Recon wont get the C4 back...

so I thought about something else what if the recon would get something like a time-bomb. It would be bale to disable tanks in one blow it would take like 10 seconds for the timer (and if that would be too strong make it so that you can disarm the bomb if you go up and hold e for 2 seconds or so :P


so these were some of my thoughts on sniping in bf4 I had mostly the pc in mind but I think that this would apply very well for the consoles too :)
so please let me know what you would like to see for the recon BF4.

(ps: English is not my first language)

1368482004.0,16,self.battlefield_4,1e9tey,Let's talk about HUD (or Heads-Up Display).,25,9,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1e9tey/lets_talk_about_hud_or_headsup_display/,"One thing many people criticize in Battlefield 3 is its UI (User Interface). Countless of good suggestions have been made about ways to improve the menus, so I will be staying away from this topic. Let's first analyse the flaws of the HUD in BF 3, then compare the BF3 HUD to the HUD that BF4 had in the 17 minutes gameplay reveal and finally make some suggestion about what can be done to improve the experience of BF.




I wasn't all that fond of the BF3 HUD. Let's first talk about the 'static' HUD ( the minimap, ammo, etc). It gave the basic information you needed (health status, the minimap and your ammo) but it also had info that is not necessary to be on the screen the whole time(your squad status, the score, the objective squares and most of the time the minimap wasn't used). The bright colours made it pop out against the environment. While the static HUD isn't great, it was functional.

Now the 'dynamic' HUD (don't know how else I should call it) however, is absolutely horrid. Mainly being the fact that your screen was full with blue triangles and objectivecircles the whole time. Showing a mark that a person is friendly is helpful, but when you see it when there are not in your sight is is just annoying. I know the locations of the objectives after a few games. I do not have to be reminded of their location all the time. The same applies when you get a kill. I know my name, I know what weapon I'm using and I would most likely know how much points a kill earned me. There is no need to flash it in big letters in middle of my screen. A thing that also bothered me at times is that the guns seem rather big and takes up the half of my screen.
**In general** the BF3 HUD showed too many **unnecessary information** and **flashy colours** which contrasted strongly with the environment. All this used **too much place on the screen** hindering the vision and decreasing the beauty of the game. 




The BF4 gameplay trailer has been released and while it HUD might be a placeholder, it will probably provide an idea in what direction they want to take the HUD in BF4. I will use this 2 pictures to illustrate my comparison. 
[3](http://bf3blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/battlefield-3-magnum-3.jpg) [4](http://i266.photobucket.com/albums/ii272/misnomer01/BF4hud_zps7233e051.png).
The first thing that you notice is the colour change. The bright colours have been traded for grey/black. It is very noticeable that the BF4 hud merges more into the environment while still providing clear information. The next difference you notice is the ammo/health indicator on the bottom right. It looks cleaner while providing more information. For the rest we can't talk about all that much since all the other HUD aspects are multiplayer only. The weapon size stays about the same as in BF3. 
**In general** is the **BF4 HUD less outstanding** while still providing all the information you need.




Now suggestions for improving the HUD for BF. 
The main changes needed to solve the problems I have with the BF3 HUD are:

* **Less outstanding colours**. The current BF4 version has already vastly improved on this so I won't be addressing this.

* **Less unnecessary information**. Every piece of HUD that is on screen while you not needed, is hindering your vision and does not add to the gameplay.

My suggestion for the latter is simple. The addition of a **tactical view**. When a button is pressed the player gets to see all information, such as the objective locations and status, the score, requests of teammates that are relevant to the player (requests should pop on for a while, even if the player is not in tactical view), your/other squads their objective (which would be important if commander mode makes a return), your squads status, ...

When the player is not using tactical view, his HUD is limited to a bare minimum. This would mean you ammo and health status, spotted enemies, allies in the line of sight and relevant position (e.g. not a guy on a mountain 1000 meters away from you) and requests. I wouldn't even put the classic minimap in the normal vision since it is pretty big and barely used for getting the accurate enemy position. A smaller, more basic map could take it's place innormal view that would provide the direction of allies and nearby spotted enemies. When you get a kill it shouldn't be showed in the middle of you screen, but your kill should be highlighted in the killfeed and stay for a while. The points you got from your kill could still come up where the where because it was rather satisfying to many people.

Leave your own opinions and suggestions about the HUD in the comments. 
Thanks for reading this wall of text.

1366836357.0,15,self.battlefield_4,1d19ah,A few of my Ideas on BF4 (Longish),18,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1d19ah/a_few_of_my_ideas_on_bf4_longish/,"We all remember the Voice overs from the Alpha correct ""Be Advised there is a blah blah blah in the AO"" Well those sounded much more like soldiers than BF3s do with the whole ""im getting it pushed up my ass over here"" or whatever he says
My idea is that Normally the VO will sound much more like the Alphas did, soldierly, organized, and all around more professional, and then when suppressed even a little bit they get more like BF3s VO, showing more stress and the professionalism wears off and they sound all around more scared. We could also extend this to work in Ammo and health, if you have a good amount left its like ""I could use some ammo"" while if your out your screaming your head off at the guy.
Its not important in the long run but it would be a nice touch and also add variety in some sorts


Besides that I believe that the ""ammo"" Squad perk should not give you ammo. Rename it and instead have it give your squad Dual Magazines (if its a magazine fed weapon) or Extended mags if its not a mag fed weapon. I say this because that perk makes the support class less useful, which should never happen IMO.


Customizatable HUD, you could set the transparency, where everything is, its size, color, pretty much everything. If you want to remake the HUD like CoD, do it, Want a BF2ish HUD, Do it. You can choose minimap type like on PC right now why not expand it for this type of thing.
Of course there would be presets but a full customization option as well.


Every jet has the possibility to become a 2 seater, its an ""attachment"" if you will, changing the jet model slightly, the F-18 has a 2 seater varient (F/A-18F as oppossed to the F/A-18E) as does the A-10 (YA-10B) and Im sure we could figure out things for the RU jets.(first off I decided to overhaul the vehicle attachment systems, Defacto jets have flares and an airrader (which needs to show missles on it!) &amp; an IFF indicator on the HUD and can choose any other 2 attachments)
So the Pilot would select the second seat attachment and anything else (so like missles, bombs, advanced fuel tanks to make it harder to be disabled, ecm, etc...) Then a second person can get in the jet and the second seat can control more weapons that he may select (like JDAM, more Missles, etc...but not flares or anything of that sort)


All Class Equipment is an idea Ive been toying with as well. Essentially its what it sounds like, each class would then get 3 pieces of equipment, 2 set to that class, 1 all kit. Ideas Ive had are: Parachute (default one, can be like BF3s) Grappling Hooks,NVGs, Tripods (can place LMGs on them and they get extra accurate),Binoculars (act like Bf 1242s/BF4s), 1 Flashbang (only 1 cant be regained), Local Radar Jammer (like in the SP), Claymores (hand detonated only like IRL, strong), and Thermite flares which may be used to illuminate dark areas/blind people with NVGs (dont disappear until respawn) and can disable vehicles.


Vehicle Disabling is area specific, so If you hit an enemy tank in the right spot of the engine it can be disabled like in BF3, but it can also be destroyed without it being disabled
Also different tanks get disabled easier/ harder than others, IE The Abrams gets disabled easier due to its gasoline engine, but it has its other MG on the top (M240, which it does IRL)
Although disabling is back, vehicle armor regen is not.


Small and Large medkits/ammo packs. the small ones are very similar to BF2s packs and function in the same way (they dont have to be put down, only in their hand) while the large ones must be put down. The large ones do work faster though and can provide some temporary cover but take a bit to ""replenish."" Also in a vehicle with someone who has these will heal you/resupply you.",,False,self,t5_2uie9,False,,,True,t3_1d19ah,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1d19ah/a_few_of_my_ideas_on_bf4_longish/,
