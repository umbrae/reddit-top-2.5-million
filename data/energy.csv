Secretary General's advisory team on climate change,376,53,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/m7gyv/i_have_a_chance_to_present_thorium_power_to_the/,"MIT has an annual contest to crowdsource solutions to global warming. I've made it to finalist with an entry that advocates liquid thorium reactors, along with other advanced reactors and various other technologies.

At this point, a winner will be chosen by popular vote. Anyone can log in and vote. [My entry is here](http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/5/planId/15204) if you're so inclined. 

My entry is the only one that promotes any form of nuclear power. There was an entry focused on thorium, but it got knocked out before the final round...but that group has formed a team to promote thorium going forward, and I've joined up with them.

Last year I was a winner in this contest. We went to the U.N. and had a nice roundtable discussion with a group that directly advises the Sec Gen on climate change issues. The next week we had a more formal presentation to congressional staffers. That'll happen this year too.

**EDIT**: One vote per person on each entry, please. Things are going great, and duplicate votes just make work for the MIT guys who have to filter them out.

([Read this](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/mc712/i_have_a_chance_to_present_thorium_power_to_the/) if you don't know what I'm talking about.)

Reddit came through with a huge number of votes, [first](http://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/m7gyv/i_have_a_chance_to_present_thorium_power_to_the/) from [r/energy](http://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/mbtak/update_presenting_thorium_power_to_the_un/) and then from [r/technology](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/mc712/i_have_a_chance_to_present_thorium_power_to_the/), which got me to #13 on the reddit front page. 

In the National category, with five entries, I ended up with 56% of the total (652 votes). In Global, out of three entries, I got 61% (359 votes). Votes were coming in so fast that another team accused me of cheating.
 
The presentation to the U.N. will be on Jan. 24. Congress isn't scheduled yet but they're going to try to make it around the same time. At this point I'm in touch with experts on LFTRs and IFRs who can vet my presentation.

I gave reddit props on the contest site [here](http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/discussion#discussion%3DpageType%3ATHREAD%2CthreadId%3A9649): 

&gt; I'll also mention, most of my votes came from reddit, and so did a lot of the material in my proposal. Much of it I wouldn't have come across if the reddit ""hivemind"" hadn't fed it to me. More came from the collection of blogs I follow. Essentially I've been leveraging some collective intelligence separate from the colab.

1321281952.0,156,self.energy,mbtak,Update: presenting thorium power to the U.N.,197,41,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/mbtak/update_presenting_thorium_power_to_the_un/,"A few days ago I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/m7gyv/i_have_a_chance_to_present_thorium_power_to_the/) and you guys really came through for me. I'm about a hundred votes ahead and tomorrow's the last day to vote. If nothing drastic happens, I'm going to the U.N. and Congress.

The first half of my proposal has nothing to do with thorium, and I'll only have five minutes or so for the formal presentation. However, that first half is contained in a [separate proposal](http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/4/planId/15203), in a different category (Global instead of National).

If I win both, I'll be able to put the first half into my Global presentation, and devote my National presentation to thorium, IFR, and fuel-from-CO2 technologies. LFTRs seem the most promising to me and I know the most about them, so that'll be the bulk of it.

The Global proposal is only three votes behind right now. Just thought some of you might like to know.

**Edit**: Looking a bit scary at the moment...there's a team in India that's picked up about 50 votes so far today under National. They were deep in third place and are still about a hundred votes behind, but if they maintain that pace my thorium proposal could be at risk. Meanwhile you guys have pulled me slightly into the lead on Global.

**Edit2**: The India team has picked up about a hundred votes today, so far. I've posted on [r/environment](http://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/mc48c/last_year_you_helped_me_win_an_mit_contest_for/), [r/technology](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/mc712/i_have_a_chance_to_present_thorium_power_to_the/), and [ycombinator](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3235022).

[Global](http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/4/planId/15203)

**EDIT3**: One vote per person on each entry, please. Things are going great, and duplicate votes just make work for the MIT guys who have to filter them out.

Here's their response.",128,24,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/q349j/on_jan_13_i_sent_doe_sec_stephen_chu_an_email_in/,"Your email to Secretary Chu, dated January 31, 2012, asked for the Secretary’s opinion regarding Thorium reactors.  You also commented on the potential benefits on a Thorium design, in particular a liquid core design.    Your email has been forwarded to the Office of Nuclear Energy for response.


 

The Office of Nuclear Energy believes that nuclear power has a critical role in providing safe, clean, reliable, and affordable electricity.  In order to achieve these goals, extensive research and development has been conducted on a wide variety of nuclear power plant designs in order to increase efficiency while simultaneously reducing carbon emissions.  We are currently funding research on several advanced Generation IV reactors including Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactors (SFRs), High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors as part of the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) demonstration project, and Fluoride High Temperature Reactors (FHRs).  Specifically related to thorium reactors, we are also funding a study at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) to evaluate the transition of a uranium-fueled fast reactor to a thorium-fueled fast reactor.  The goal of this study is to understand the implications of transitioning to a thorium core and compare the performance with a uranium-based reference core.  However, this effort will be focused on using a fixed fuel form rather than having the fuel dissolved in the liquid salt, which would present additional technical and non-proliferation challenges.

 

From a fuels perspective, the advanced reactor concepts that we are pursuing, as well as light water reactors, could be modified to utilize thorium fuel.  However, the Unites States does not currently possess the infrastructure to process thorium or to fabricate thorium fuel.  This commercial capacity would need to be developed before thorium fuel could be used for commercial power production.

I'm responding to these parts of the [conspiracy theory](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/uqlq9/reddit_i_think_there_is_a_giant_nuclear_coverup/) (the parts dealing with claimed radiation anomalies):

&gt;**EDIT 7 comes first: To those who say it was still a malfunction:**

&gt;You miss a VERY elementary point: one detector was privately ran in South Bend. That one ""malfunctioned"". But then the data is corroborated by a federally ran detector in Ft Wayne, a good drive away. And then more data as time goes on from other detectors. Like here, where [one can see the drifts over Little Rock, AR 12 hours later](http://i.imgur.com/sRYMi.png), which lines up with [the wind maps](http://hint.fm/wind/). For those that don't seem to know, that's a long way away from Ft Wayne. And the ""average"" CPM level in Little Rock has been around 8 CPM for the past 12 months.

....

&gt;EPA's ""near-realtime"" open-air geiger counter for Ft Wayne Indiana [no longer shows live data but cuts off May 19th](http://www.epa.gov/radnet/radnet-data/radnet-ftwayne-bg.html). This morning, it didn't (hence the basis for [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/ups1a/dangerously_high_radiation_levels_reported_in/c4xfz40)), but by using the EPA.gov RADNET query tool, WE CAN STILL PULL THE DATA UP [as in this screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/KVEqg.png) &lt;- For more cities and a breakdown of the wind spread, [check here](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/uqlq9/reddit_i_think_there_is_a_giant_nuclear_coverup/c4xo9gt)

My friend has tried to explain to me that we, as a society, have already invented several methods of energy extraction, for transportation purposes, which are more efficient or less polluting than I.C.E.'s. But that the large oil companies like Shell, Chevron, and Exxon just buy up the patent rights to these technologies and shelve them so that they can maintain their dominance over society's transportation needs by proliferating oil and oil based products that I.C.E's require such as gasoline, diesel, motor oil, transmission oil, and all the products that go along with it.


He cites the case of the Chevy EV-1 and Toyota RAV-4 electrics from the 90's, and a documentary called 'Who killed the Electric Car' as his main source. http://www.ev1.org/chevron.htm


I believe if the big oil companies had better tech patent rights that they would use them to gain an advantage over their competitors.
If anyone can reply to this question with answers either way, I would greatly appreciate any assistance you could provide.

1245350320.0,74,self.energy,8to7m,***Notice*** Energy Subreddit Changes,110,36,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/8to7m/notice_energy_subreddit_changes/,"The energy subreddit has 11886 subscribers. Not really big, but the umbrella-term branding should allow for discussion of all forms of energy.

I've reviewed a conflict between a moderator and a user, and have decided that a couple changes should be made that would be best for the subscribers of this subreddit.

Several posts from the user `uvdiv_blog` and (same person), `uvdiv_is_banned`, have been invisible to users due to a combination of auto-bans (a script that runs on the reddit servers), and from a relatively new moderator, samseed101.

I was given access (from the user himself) to check out his inbox/outbox on both accounts, and I found no evidence of warnings issued before a ban was given out.

The reason given for banning the user was offensive language, and personal attacks. Although I agree that these should not be used in arguments, and that this site *is* viewed by a diverse population (including younger teenagers), I feel that a ban for this sort of behavior is not the way to go about shaping discussions on the site for the better. If anything, a warning (either public or private) would best serve this purpose.

*****

**to samseed101**, I will be taking you off of the moderator list for this subreddit. I was thinking of just giving a warning, but there are some people who are really pissed, and it *was* an isolated incident, so I think it is justified. Although I agree that personal attacks and profanities should not be used in the way uvdiv\_blog used, there could/should have been notices and warnings if you were introducing this as a sort of policy. I didn't see any evidence of these, and it was isolated, so it does appear to be a mild bit of censorship (for what reason or cause, I'm not going to postulate). I'm sorry, and I hope that you can respect this decision.

*****

**to uvdiv\_blog/demre/uvdiv\_is\_banned**, I will be un-banning all posts of yours that I can find (for both active accounts), and take you (uvdiv\_blog) off the subreddit's ban list. For this reason, I ask that you delete the account 'uvdiv\_is\_banned', and continue use of 'uvdiv\_blog'. I will try to keep my eye on it so that the auto-ban doesn't catch the comments from that account anymore.

But *please* be civil with your commenting. Personal attacks and profanities in your arguments make you sound like senile old grumpy asshole. The following sample of comment fragments from you are not welcome, and I advise you to modify your commenting behavior to try to be more civil.

&gt;* This is fucking bullshit. I demand a public apology and retraction from the imbecile journalists at Guardian, and from maxwellhill for wasting my time with this crap, and for the rest of you for blindly upmodding him.

&gt;* Ha! Denmark is a fucking case study on the necessity of hydropower for backing wind farms.

&gt;* the page is still there, with its +2940 karma. Makes your dick look kinda small

&gt;* You're full of horse manure.

&gt;* Go fuck yourself.

&gt;* But unlike you fucking morons (you know who you are)

If somebody's attacking you, then it's not so much of a problem. From what I've seen of these discussions, however, these attacks of yours are given purely out of your own frustration and anger. Let your facts and opinions speak for themselves.

*****

**to subscribers**, please be civil when you are commenting. It's that simple. Also, if there is something that offends you (personal attacks, profanity, and such), report it. That way, moderators can actually see if there are people out there opposed to the content, rather than basing it off their own assumptions.

I am taking `samseed101` off the moderator list. **I am looking for one (or two) people to join the moderator list**. Reply here if you are interested, and give a little bit of info about yourself (karma, comment karma, how long you've been on reddit, how often you are on during the day/week, and tell me that you plan to moderate without bias). I will stay on the list to ensure that moderating remains fair and unbiased.

Hopefully I have been fair about all this.",,False,self,t5_2qhkd,True,,,True,t3_8to7m,http://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/8to7m/notice_energy_subreddit_changes/,

Also on the effect it will have throughout the world from the micro level (the family) to the macro level and geopolitics and potential world wars that could occur over the scrambling for resources.

I want to know, are these concerns valid as far as scientists and other experts are concerned?
Are these concerns about a collapse, or a receding back to the pre-industrial age only popular amongst activists and writers?

Is peak oil a well-supported theory? If so, will it simply be a phasing into a new energy source, or is it a race against time to develop nuclear fusion energy before we are too far into the decline of oil?

If it is a valid concern, will it end ""life as we know it""? Will automobiles decline in use, will the world become a bigger and more harsh/violent place as it once was, will we lose the ability to explore space and sustain scientific research?

I'm obviously not an expert at all, and all I've read has really been based on activists and writers outside the scientific world and outside the realm of actual research even though they compile and refer back to research.

1278016215.0,72,self.energy,cl2i7,"Nobody ever reads the original peak oil paper from M. King Hubbert. He didn't predict the collapse of society. He predicted that we would phase out fossil fuels in favor of nuclear energy. The title of the paper was ""Nuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuels"". ",112,40,131,http://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/cl2i7/nobody_ever_reads_the_original_peak_oil_paper/,"I just read the original 1956 paper by [M. King Hubbert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._King_Hubbert) that defined [Hubbert Peak Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubbert_peak_theory) (aka peak oil). Guess what it is called... ""Nuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuels.""

Apparently, although people freak out about peak oil all the time, what you never hear is that the guy that came up with the theory believed that nuclear energy would not only replace fossil fuels, but provide vastly more energy than fossil fuels for many centuries. It appears that although people talk about peak oil on a regular basis, no one ever takes the time to actually read the original paper.

Here are links to the original paper (Protip: **read it**):

* PDF (scan of original paper): http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf
* HTML: http://www.energybulletin.net/node/13630

And here is a chart in the paper that shows his projections for energy usage that pretty much summarizes the whole paper...

* http://i.imgur.com/YTBuw.jpg

As I said above, this prediction was made in 1956 and his peak oil prediction for the US was almost dead on (we peaked in 1970). Here is the actual production of petroleum in the United States:

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_Oil_Production_and_Imports_1920_to_2005.png

Unfortunately, his predictions for nuclear were off. It was pretty dead on early on, but then after the Three Mile Island accident and the success of anti-nuclear activists (and probably some behind-the-scenes lobbying by the oil industry, who have certainly read this paper) essentially destroyed new reactor construction, this happened:

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nuclear_Power_History.png (note: this chart shows the world instead of the US, but it is essentially the same)

As you can see, we were clearly on the path to have Hubbert's prediction of exponential growth in nuclear power. And then between 1980 and 1984, 51 reactors were canceled in the US (http://clonemaster.homestead.com/files/cancel.htm) and we have been hovering around 100 active reactors ever since.

Hubbert's paper has some great quotes in it:

* The world appears to be on the threshold of an era which in terms of energy consumption will be at least an order of magnitude greater than that made possible by the fossil fuels.
* The energy content of this [uranium deposit] per square mile is equivalent to 30 billion barrels of oil, or to five East Texas oil fields
* There is promise, however, provided mankind can solve its International problems and not destroy itself with nuclear weapons, and provided the world population (which is now expanding at such a rate as to double in less than a century) can somehow be brought under control, that we may at last have found an energy supply adequate for our needs for at least the next few centuries of the ""foreseeable future.""
