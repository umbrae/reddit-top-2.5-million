P.S.For those who missed it, 219 votes in favor vs. 212 against in the House.

P.P.S. Second vote has already passed 232 against altering the bill vs. 192 for changing it (or if you like, the motion technically failed for changing the bill. I just prefer the positive phrasing more).

P.P.S. And.... that makes the final vote passed at 220 vs. 211!

----------

Edit: As far as the Republicans go, I don't actually mean them any harm. It was just too easy to jest a bit in light-hearted celebration. :)

Final edit (I think): If you missed all this as it happened, [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/bgchp/for_the_first_time_ever_im_watching_cspan_at/) has some great coverage and commentary on the debate &amp; voting as it happened! 

Also, [Obama was speaking live about the bill](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/bge1p/the_health_bill_has_passed/c0mncdn?context=3). If anyone else has a recording, please post it!

Update: [This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bgemw/so_healthcare_has_passed_can_someone/) on r/AskReddit has some good explanations of what this bill means specifically.

1283253595.0,6373,self.politics,d7ntl,I've had a vision and I can't shake it: Colbert needs to hold a satirical rally in DC.,13382,7009,1350,http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/d7ntl/ive_had_a_vision_and_i_cant_shake_it_colbert/,"I was woken in the middle of the night by this(along with the sound of my cat getting ready to pee on the rug).

Think about it. It'll be just like Colbert's mockery of GW Bush at the 2006 White House Correspondent's Dinner, but 500,000 people will be able to participate with him. We'll all stay totally in character as teabaggers. The kid with the microphone that interviews all the idiots at these things can come by and we'll ramble into his microphone.

This would be the high water mark of American satire. Half a million people pretending to suspend all rational thought in unison. Perfect harmony. It'll feel like San Francisco in the late 60s, only we won't be able to get any acid.

I know you're out there somewhere, Stephen, watching LOLcat gifs along side us. We need you. There's no way to have a logical public discussion with the teabaggers. The best we can do is to mimic them. Show them a mirror and hopefully some will realize how ridiculous they actually are... Or maybe they won't even realize that they're being mocked, which could be even more awesome.

Note: This is a repost. First one never popped into New.

**EDIT(Finally): The response to this post has blown my mind. I really did jump out of bed at like 5AM and type this thing up. Then I checked from work and it's front page and there's a Facebook page and people are emailing one of the Executive Producers. I was just hoping some people would get a laugh out of it, and now it has over 6,800 upvotes? It's like I cracked the best joke of my life in a public place. :D**

**But to be fair, both pugsworth and hobbit6 posted the general idea before me in that Jon Stewart thread. I just fleshed it out a little bit. Anyway, I don't really know what to do or say about actually trying to make a Colbert Rally happen. I'd sure as hell be there, and I think I'd opt for the ""Go back to the rug store with the rest of the Afghans"" sign. **

**I just wanted to say that I'm really happy that so many people got a kick out of it. And the thought of Colbert himself actually maybe seeing this is probably the coolest thing that's ever happened to me so far in life.**

EDIT (Added Sources &amp; Statements)

Source:
""Go Daddy has a long history of supporting federal legislation directed toward combating illegal conduct on the Internet. For example, our company strongly supported the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008, the Protect Our Children Act of 2008, and the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act of 2011 (PROTECT IP).  Go Daddy has always supported both government and private industry efforts to identify and disable all types of illegal activity on the Internet.  It is for these reasons that I’m still struggling with why some Internet companies oppose PROTECT IP and SOPA.  There is no question that we need these added tools to counteract illegal foreign sites that are falling outside the jurisdiction of U.S. law enforcement.  And there is clearly more that we could all be doing to adequately address the problems that exist.""

We have a non-voting delegate to Congress but the delegate does get to propose legislation in Congress, add amendments to current legislation and co-sponsor legislation.  Our current delegate, Madeleine Bordallo, added herself as a co-sponsor to [CISPA in Mar 19, 2012](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr3523).

This is the [news article](http://www.guampdn.com/article/20120703/NEWS01/207030306/Dizon-files-candidacy?odyssey=tab%7Ctopnews%7Ctext%7CFrontpage) about me filing.  I have a [young staff of mostly other redditors](http://i.imgur.com/KCgBL.jpg) and while I know it's a long shot, it's a small island and turnout can be as little as 12,000 for the primary.

I think until internet freedom becomes a real ""voting issue"" that drives voters to the polls, we won't ever be free from the attacks to an open internet like SOPA, PIPA and CISPA. I hope my challenge is just the start of driving the message home to Congress that you do not mess with the internet.

**Edit:**  This is crazy.  Thanks for all the support and if I didn't get to your question I apologize.  I want to be clear I'm running on a broad platform of issues and I am not a single issue candidate, though this issue is near and dear to me.  You cannot donate to the campaign if you a not a US national. Thank you to everyone that has donated, it's a HUGE help!  If you live on Guam, come by our offices at the Sanford Building, 355A S Marine Corps Drive in Tamuning, we are generally open noon to 8pm.  Because the incumbent refuses to have a public debate with me, we are going to try to host a village town hall meeting in all 19 villages of Guam between now and the primary on September 1st.  I will take questions and we will get to know each other and talk about what we want the future of our island to look like.   It's getting late here on Guam so I have to get to bed soon, thanks everybody!  I will check and respond to messages in the morning

I'm in my late 20's (fuck), and as I sat eating a breakfast of turkey bacon fried in pork grease with eggs and a corn tortilla this morning I had a flash of understanding. For the first time in my life my demographic is a political force. 

We are technologically savvy and we have the ability to organize in a way that is incomprehensible to corporate entities and governmental bodies. We are faster, better and more efficient - and we know how to have fun with it.

So here are the guiding principles I propose for the U.S. Pirate Party:

* Internet neutrality and progressive legislation regarding technology. ([1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_neutrality))

* Legalization and taxation of drugs, prostitution, and all other activities we currently classify as ""consensual crime."" &lt;-----Quite possibly the most asinine term of all time. ([2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensual_crime))

* Fiscal conservatism, social liberalism. ([3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism))

* An end to corporate personhood. ([4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_personhood_debate))

* A Public Option health care system. ([5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO%27s_ranking_of_health_care_systems))

* Reducing the power of filibuster by restoring it to its original place in Senate procedure, requiring simple majorities to pass laws. ([6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster#U.S._Filibuster_History))

* Eschew professional politicians in favor of politically knowledgeable  citizens interested in political positions. ([7](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_the_Elder))

* Campaign finance reform that prohibits corporations from giving money to a political candidate in any form. Only contributions from private citizens. ([8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance_reform))

That's what I've got. I don't want to put too many more down - I'd like to to be a collaborative effort. What tenets would you like to see on the official U.S. Pirate Party platform?

------------------

**note** Apparently the name, ""[U.S. Pirate Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Pirate_Party),"" is already taken. They've done such a wonderful job with it I hadn't heard of them until I posted this thread, so I propose we make like pirates and take over the U.S. Pirate Party -or- change the name to the [American Pirate Party](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/arzh7/america_we_need_a_third_party_that_can_galvanize/c0j2yjv).

**note 2** I just created the [American Pirate Party](http://www.reddit.com/r/americanpirateparty/) sub-reddit. Post, collaborate, plot. I'm a terrible organizer, so anyone who wants to mod this and help head up the party, just send me a message.

**note 3** To those who think the name is unrealistic. A name pales in comparison to the enthusiasm and dedication of those involved. The ridiculous-party-name barrier has already been broken for us very recently by the Tea Party. In comparison to that, the American Pirate Party is positively three-piece suit respectable.

[**DROPBOX MIRROR OF THE .XLSX FILE**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/73h1pk6xx7wxzoi/Surveillance_For_Reddit%202%20-%20Copy.xlsx).

**EDIT**:  Getting questions about accessing the data.  Click 'file - &gt; download' to save a .xlsx spreadsheet to your hard drive for easy manipulation.

The list includes congressional members' names, party, chamber (house or senate), and their votes on the patriot act (2001), the reauthorization (2006), the Protect America Act (2007), FISA (2008), the patriot act extension (2011), the FISA extension (2012) and the Amash amendment (2013).  

It then attempts to tabulate an intrusion score based on the number of bad and good votes each number has made.  A high intrusion score means a member has done more damage to our privacy, and a low intrusion score means they have done less damage (or acted to protect our privacy).

Some of these data were tabulated from a table [shared in this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1jkmjf/what_real_reform_of_the_nsa_looks_like_holts/cbfy1kn), other data I assembled myself.  If you see an error (and there will be errors) let me know or correct it yourself if possible.

There are three tabs:

**Master List**:  This is the first tab, which contains all of the data.

**Key**:  This is the second tab, which explains the column headings in the master list.

**Priority Contacts**:  Right now, the Holt ['Repeal the Surveillance State Act'](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr2818#overview) is sitting in committee.  I have ranked the House Judiciary Committee (roughly) by the priority with which they should be contacted, and included my reasoning and their DC office numbers.  The higher the name on the list (ideally), the more worthwhile the call should be.

---

**What You Can Do**:

**I.  Call the names on the priority contacts list.**  

The list is in the data file linked above, and I've also copied the names and numbers below.

When you dial the number, you'll be connected to an intern sitting in front of a clipboard or computer screen with check boxes.  Wasting your breath with long-winded discussion helps no one.  Keep it as clear and simple as possible, and be kind to the person you're talking to; they control whether your message goes up the chain.

""Hi, I'm calling to ask representative X to support Rep. Holt's 'repeal the surveillance state act, HR 2818.  I'm very concerned about PRISM and XKeyscore.  Please pass my message along to the representative.""

If you are not asked for your zip code and you are not a constituent, don't provide it.  

If you are a constituent, make sure they get your zip code.  

If you are asked for your zip code and you are not a constituent, say, ""I'm calling Rep. [X] in connection with his role on the house judiciary committee, where s/he is making decisions that affect me directly, and I'd like my message passed along though I am not a constituent.""

**II.  Call your own reps.**  [Here's the link to find their contact information.](http://www.usa.gov/Contact/Elected.shtml)  Use the data above to let them know you're familiar with their voting record and it will be influencing your vote.  Again, keep it brief.  Ask them to support Holt's 'Repeal the Surveillance State Act, HR 2818'.



**III.  Reach out to friends and family and get them to call.**  

This is the second most important thing you can do.  Especially family that are in the districts of high priority contacts.  For every person you convince to call, you are (doubling, tripling, quadrupling) your impact.

Every step you help them take increases the probability they will call.

Looking up their reps for them and sending them the phone numbers probably doubles the chances they'll call.

Explaining the situation, how to talk to interns (as I explained to you above), then dialing the phone for them and sticking it in their hand probably puts you close to 100% success.

**IV.  Share this post or something like it.**

I don't care how you do this.  The spreadsheet is public domain.  This post is public domain (within whatever terms Reddit imposes in their agreement) as far as I'm concerned.  Copy it, claim it's your brilliant idea, or link people directly to this post.  Change it however you want.  Just share this information (Facebook, Twitter, Carrier Pigeon, Pack Mule, etc.) so others can have access to it and will be encouraged to contact their friends and loved ones as well.

&gt; On December 7, 2011, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor indefinitely postponed a scheduled markup of the legislation. The **bill currently has 235 co-sponsors**- 153 Democrats and 82 Republicans.  A bill **needs 218 votes for passage** by the House of Representatives.

This bill had enough support and co-sponsors to PASS had it finished going through the process and gone to voting, but Eric Cantor prevented any voting to occur by indefinitely postponing it.

This should be front page. How are we allowing him to override the majority of congress? Blockading the democratic process. We should be absolutely outraged at this. This should be the headline across all media. Of all places, REDDIT is the place to make this news. We did it for PIPA/SOPA. Let's do it again!

Do everything and anything you can to make people aware and to make this big news. It's not just about this bill, it's about people in congress abusing their powers to sideswipe discussion and taking an authoritarian approach over democracy.

**UPDATE (7:35pm est):** A few people have brought up Eric Cantor's explanation of why he postponed it and asked I link it here. I think that is fair, as we should always be willing to look at all sides of a story: http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57344486-503544/cantor-plans-to-revive-stock-act-in-early-2012/

His talk is good in this interview, but as we all know from our experience with politics, talk means nothing without action. He promises it'll come back in the first couple months of 2012. We're now 1 month in and have no date scheduled for this. The most important thing in all of this is that we ensure this bill, and other important bills, don't get ignored and dropped. Congress has to serve the people. Not self-interest.

Reddit we need to understand that we are an open community which means there are people posting in these threads that are paid to spin the conversation away from the real issue. It is causing us to waffel on the issue at hand. If you have nothing to add to the conversation then please don't post so we can see those individuals that are spinning the conversation. Otherwise do everything you can activist wise to help our cause. No cynics, pessimists, detractors please. 

CISPA could allow any private company to share vast amounts of sensitive, private data about its customers with the government.

CISPA would override all other federal and state privacy laws, and allow a private company to share nearly anything—from the contents of private emails and Internet browsing history to medical, educational and financial records—as long as it “directly pertains to” a “cyber threat,” which is broadly defined.

CISPA does not require that data shared with the government be stripped of unnecessary personally-identifiable information. A private company may choose to anonymize the data it shares with the government. However, there is no requirement that it does so—even when personally-identifiable information is unnecessary for cybersecurity measures. For example, emails could be shared with the full names of their authors and recipients. A company could decide to leave the names of its customers in the data it shares with the government merely because it does not want to incur the expense of deleting them. This is contrary to the recommendations of the House Republican Cybersecurity Task Force and other bills to authorize information sharing, which require companies to make a reasonable effort to minimize the sharing of personally-identifiable information.

CISPA would allow the government to use collected private information for reasons other than cybersecurity. The government could use any information it receives for “any lawful purpose” besides “regulatory purposes,” so long as the same use can also be justified by cybersecurity or the protection of national security. This would provide no meaningful limit—a government official could easily create a connection to “national security” to justify nearly any type of investigation.

CISPA would give Internet Service Providers free rein to monitor the private communications and activities of users on their networks. ISPs would have wide latitude to do anything that can be construed as part of a “cybersecurity system,” regardless of any other privacy or telecommunications law.

CISPA would empower the military and the National Security Agency (NSA) to collect information about domestic Internet users. Other information sharing bills would direct private information from domestic sources to civilian agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security. CISPA contains no such limitation. Instead, the Department of Defense and the NSA could solicit and receive information directly from American companies, about users and systems inside the United States.

CISPA places too much faith in private companies, to safeguard their most sensitive customer data from government intrusion. While information sharing would be voluntary under CISPA, the government has a variety of ways to pressure private companies to share large volumes of customer information. With complete legal immunity, private companies have few clear incentives to resist such pressure. There is also no requirement that companies ever tell their customers what they have shared with the government, either before or after the fact. As informed consumers, Americans expect technology companies to have clear privacy policies, telling us exactly how and when the company will use and share our personal data, so that we can make informed choices about which companies have earned our trust and deserve our business.

Here's the deal: CISPA is now tucked inside of Senate bill S.2105, which has bipartisan congressional support, is being actively supported by the Obama Admin., and is scheduled for a vote in early June. It's alive and well, and on a clear path to becoming law.

The Senate goes on recess next week, which means we have exactly 3 days to make calls before they leave for a week and then come back for the vote. The most important thing we can do with that time is to try to get meetings scheduled with our senators while they are in their home states over the recess. This is a proven grassroots strategy that was key to killing SOPA. We can beat CISPA if we do this.  

**Reddit, we *really* need your help this time. We can't email our supporters about this because of an ongoing deliverability issue with our system, so we're counting on our friends and allies to spread this in other ways.** 

Here's the site we put together -- use it to call your senators and request a meeting ::

**[Privacy Is Awesome.](http://privacyisawesome.com)**

Good guy Sen. Wyden said yesterday that this bill would create a ""cyber industrial complex [...] that profits from fear and whose currency is Americans' private data."" He's right, and our best shot at stopping it from becoming law is getting this strategy spread out far and wide right now.

First of all, thanks so much for all the support! You guys are doing an AWESOME job contacting your Congresspeople about CISPA, and more importantly, you're helping to spread the word.

**We would love it if you could leave a comment in this thread detailing how your conversation went after calling or visiting your Congresspeople's office.** It'll help us know who is for the bill, who is against the bill, and which tactics are making a difference. 

With everyone's help, we're confident that this thing can be beaten. Let's work to keep The Internet safe for another day!

Now, GO VOTE.

EDIT: There is a run-off system in place which eliminates the spoiler effect and strategic voting. Mathematically speaking, if your only goal is to unseat Lamar Smith, a vote for either of his opponents will give you the same advantage because they both lower the total percentage of pro-Smith votes by the same amount.

I love you guys with every shred of my hard-left leaning heart. But I think you might be doing something wrong. Here is one thing that can help you. 

Tomorrow, wear a polo and khakis

Seriously. polos and khakis. Every time you guys DO finally get some fucking press, it's a scrawny dude with dreads in a ratty t-shirt. You're going big here, dress it. Tomorrow, Polo shirt and Khakis. 

Why? Because you need to get the right-leaning equivalent of me on your side. I'm 35 right now. I understand where the hippy thing comes from. I get it as well as a guy who's 35 can. My Counterparts do not. They think you are scummy druggies on welfare and when they see on tv a bunch of people who they think are S.D's on W, they root for the cops to hit you again. 

Speaking of the cops, Who do you think they'll mace first? SD's on W, or a guy in khakis and a polo? Seriously, it's fucking cop camouflage. And if they DO come for you. When people at home see** PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE THEM** getting abused by police... That's when shit changes. 

**Seeing protesters get beat up means nothing because protesters get beat up all the time. Therefore, don't look like a protester! This connects you to the person watching and opens them to your side!**

So for serious. Do it. You're almost about to tip this thing over. Polos and khakis. Cop Camo + target audience = Shave, shower and polos and khakis.

TL;DR: Polo shirt and Khakis = dress code for nyc protests tomorrow.

Do it.

Edit: Going to bed soon, one more thing before I turn it over to all of you.

Please spread this as much as you can. Professionalism will help push this thing over the edge. You have labor pushing you. National Media is starting to wake up to you. You're almost there. Keep pushing.

Think: Business Casual Friday. Don't play it up like the Billionaires for healthcare. You're just a guy, going to work in this big office building here.

Even if you don't think that you SHOULD be judged on appearances (which I do agree), You have to realize that you ARE. Fight the appearance fight another day. Polos and khakis.

Edit: She has a history of intestinal blockage, which is a very serious condition. She said the pain was exactly the same as when she had the blockage. When she had the blockage (didn't know it was a blockage at the time) she tried to wait and see if it would go away before she went to the hospital. This only made matters worse and she almost died. And she had to declare **bankruptcy** because of that hospital bill. So it was safest just to go to the ER this time.
I realize that the pricetag may pale in comparison to many other hospital bills given in this country, and that is exactly why the system needs to be fixed. ",,False,,t5_2cneq,True,,,True,t3_bdclk,http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/bdclk/one_cat_scan_and_a_2_hour_er_visit_10254_if_you/,

&gt;After September 11th, Bush's approval ratings were near or above 90%. Practically the entire country was behind him - saluting and ready for duty. Yes, the Left did try to derail his plans for Iraq - but they failed. And when millions (actual millions) of Americans came out to protest that war - - it was largely ignored by the media. But when 70,000 lunatics came to DC last week to protest ""Government Spending"" (which, let's be honest, is a euphemism for ""Barack Hussein Obama"") - they got massive amounts of media coverage and hours of pundit commentary. 

&gt;Every tea-party rally has been aggressively championed, and all-but-sponsored, by cable-news giant FOX. CODE PINK was almost completely ignored (which, as a liberal, I'm kinda glad about -- but I still stand behind my larger point). A couple went to a Bush rally wearing anti-Bush T-Shirts and got arrested. Guys standing outside Obama rallies openly carry guns and get interviewed by the media.

&gt;The heaviest hitters in the Republican party, and in the conservative media have loudly and proudly called for Obama's failure. Liberals who even softly criticized Bush were roundly shamed and called terrorist-loving-America-haters. George W. Bush, despite the controversial beginning of his presidency, was given the chance - - no, in fact, after 9/11, he was given all the unopposed freedom in the world to succeed or fail based upon his own decisions and his own performance. Bush EARNED his hatred.

&gt;Obama has not had that luxury. ",,False,,t5_2cneq,True,,,True,t3_9lijd,http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9lijd/when_millions_of_americans_protested_the_iraq_war/,

However, this is a very conservative Texas district, so it's not like we have much choice. What's important is that this will get Smith off the judiciary committee and demonstrate that we will not tolerate bills like SOPA. Plus, Mack does have a bit of a libertarian streak and opposes the War on Drugs. 

His district is heavily gerrymandered, so it won't be easy to get rid of him. We're in for an uphill battle here.

If people are interested I would be glad to help set it up but I don't think I have the time to effectively moderate it so I would need some help.

I think it would be an interesting way to have us all keep better track of what is going on in the house and senate.  Not only would we have a venue for discussion of each bill but the reddit voting system would identify which congressional issues are most important to our community.

Edit: created /r/watchingcongress in case this idea takes off.  Left it open for now and once a system is in place for the content and we have some moderators it would be switched to restrict posting.

Edit2: Throwing this in here since this is currently on the front page.  A bit overwhelmed by how much response this got, but I have been reading all of the comments and messages and everyone has a lot of great ideas and valid concerns.

The EFF, Public Knowledge, Demand Progress, CDT, and anti-SOPA lobbyists all agree on this.  

So together we've been organizing meetings with Senators in their home districts. The Senate's in recess until the 23rd, so it's the perfect opportunity for a) a local show of force and b) *actually convincing* Senators that these bills are flawed.

Here's the problem: the following Senate offices are ignoring our requests for meetings before the 24th. It's not just that the senators are busy; we're asking for meetings with staffers too.

Redditors! Can you call the offices below and ask them to meet with us?  Even if your state isn't on this list, calls are helpful. It's fine (and encouraged!) to call the entire list. Be polite, but insist that the senator or staff members meet with concerned constituents.  

FOR YOUR STATE: Introduce yourself, say you oppose SOPA and PIPA, insist that the senator or her staff meet with constituents during the recess, before the cloture vote on the 24th (FYI, ""cloture"" is a motion to limit debate and push PIPA to a vote, clearing the way for SOPA).   

Urge the senator to vote against cloture on the 24th, and ask for a meeting to explain your opposition. If they give you a meeting or any useful information, report it on the thread for your state.

NOTE: there's some chance they've already granted meetings to individuals who aren't part of our process, so again be polite. But in most cases, these offices are ignoring us.

**UPDATE:** We're getting their attention! KEEP IT UP! [Sign up here] (http://americancensorship.org/) for notifications about meetings in your state.

&gt;
&gt;It was the government’s second big raid in recent months after a similar investigation in May involving $452 million in possible fraud in Medicare, the health program for the elderly and disabled.
&gt;
&gt;The accusations include billing the government for unnecessary ambulance rides in California, writing prescriptions for patients in Dallas who did not qualify for them and paying kickbacks like food and cigarettes to patients in Houston if they attended programs for which a hospital could bill.
&gt;
&gt;**The investigation is part of an effort by the Obama administration to find health care savings.**

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/05/business/medicare-fraud-charged-against-91.html?src=recg
&gt;
&gt;Arrests were made in Houston, Dallas, Brooklyn, Baton Rouge, Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami. The largest crackdown occurred in South Florida where 33 people were rounded up and charged in connection with health care fraud cases totaling more than $230 million. In Texas, the president of Riverside General Hospital in Houston and his son were also charged.
&gt;
&gt;**Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius added that new provisions in President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act made it more difficult for fraud to be committed.**
&gt;
&gt;**This fraud sweep is the latest in a series of raids conducted since 2007 by the strike force. Over the past five years 1,480 suspects have been arrested in Medicare fraud cases totaling $4.8 billion dollars.**

Romney went way, way out of his way to go after PBS in his debate. Yet, as uber-liberal rag Forbes Magazine notes:
&gt;
&gt;For fiscal year 2010, federal funding for PBS through CPB accounted for about 12% of PBS’ revenue. In terms of dollars, that works out to about $300 million. There’s not much wiggle room to be had: the money that actually goes to CPB is split according to a mostly statutory formula. For 2015, Congress has budgeted $445 million for CPB. That’s less than 1% of the budget. Way less. It’s about 1/100th of a 1%.
&gt;
&gt;I’m not disparaging cutting waste: cutting waste is good. But with a deficit as large as the current one, if you’re going to focus on cuts, we should focus on real cuts. By the numbers, cutting funding for PBS won’t save the budget. Not by a long shot.

If the goal is for voters to get lost in sophistry and talking points spin, then Team Romney has done well. But when it comes to producing ACTUAL results, the $4.8 billion in fraud the Obama administration has cracked down on is FAR more impressive than the fear-mongering that Romney is doing over borrowing ""money from China "" in order to keep PBS going.

It would effectively end privacy on the internet.

Today is our last chance to call and request meetings with our senators' staffs before they go into recess mode. These 99 senators need more calls (took Wyden off the list because he is [amazing](http://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/blog/post/wyden-on-cyber-security-privacy-should-be-the-default-not-the-exception)).

The College Republicans, a student club at Fordham University, has invited Ann Coulter to speak on campus on November 29. The event is funded through student activity fees and is not open to the public nor the media. Student groups are allowed, and encouraged, to invite speakers who represent diverse, and sometimes unpopular, points of view, in keeping with the canons of academic freedom. Accordingly, the University will not block the College Republicans from hosting their speaker of choice on campus.


**To say that I am disappointed with the judgment and maturity of the College Republicans, however, would be a tremendous understatement. There are many people who can speak to the conservative point of view with integrity and conviction, but Ms. Coulter is not among them. Her rhetoric is often hateful and needlessly provocative—more heat than light—and her message is aimed squarely at the darker side of our nature.**

As members of a Jesuit institution, we are called upon to deal with one another with civility and compassion, not to sling mud and impugn the motives of those with whom we disagree or to engage in racial or social stereotyping. In the wake of several bias incidents last spring, I told the University community that I hold out great contempt for anyone who would intentionally inflict pain on another human being because of their race, gender, sexual orientation, or creed.

“Disgust”was the word I used to sum up my feelings about those incidents. Hate speech, name-calling, and incivility are completely at odds with the Jesuit ideals that have always guided and animated Fordham.

Still, to prohibit Ms. Coulter from speaking at Fordham would be to do greater violence to the academy, and to the Jesuit tradition of fearless and robust engagement. Preventing Ms. Coulter from speaking would counter one wrong with another. The old saw goes that the answer to bad speech is more speech. This is especially true at a university, and I fully expect our students, faculty, alumni, parents, and staff to voice their opposition, civilly and respectfully, and forcefully.

The College Republicans have unwittingly provided Fordham with a test of its character: do we abandon our ideals in the face of repugnant speech and seek to stifle Ms. Coulter’s (and the student organizers’) opinions, or do we use her appearance as an opportunity to prove that our ideas are better and our faith in the academy—and one another—stronger? We have chosen the latter course, confident in our community, and in the power of decency and reason to overcome hatred and prejudice.

1335622981.0,3054,self.politics,swseu,Let's get Reddit Inc. interested in opposing CISPA.,21712,18658,1046,http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/swseu/lets_get_reddit_inc_interested_in_opposing_cispa/,"Reddit Inc. has obviously not been as gung-ho about stopping CISPA as it was about SOPA. No big deal. We understand that you are a corporation, and you have your own interests. However, I strongly suggest that Reddit Inc. takes a serious stance against CISPA. If there isn't a movement by the corporation, then it will be done by the people. Two ideas.

1. I propose removing Reddit from our AdBlock exceptions list on May 1^st. This will continue until Reddit Inc. decides to join us in opposing Cispa.

2. Also beginning on May 1, there will be a boycott of purchasing Reddit Gold. Thanks for the ideas, guys!

3. A week long boycott going through May 14 until May 21. Seven days of redditors not using Reddit.

If they join us on or before May 14^th we will not need to do the boycott. If they join *any time* after May 14, then the boycott needs to continue as planned. It will not be very convincing if we just wuss out three days into a demonstration.

So, what do you think? Do you like the idea? Will you actually do it?

Edit: Changed the date to May 14 so that /r/FIA will not endangered by the blackout. My bad.

Edit 2: [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/swu9t/looking_for_admin_support_against_cispa_in_the/) is a link to a thread for the admins. Give it some publicity, and hopefully we will hear from Reddit personally.

Edit 3: Along with AdBlocking, we should do a Reddit Gold boycott. No one purchases gold memberships until we see action. Any positive reinforcement on this, and I'll add it to the list. **Implemented**

Edit 4: [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/evolutionReddit/comments/swgyt/cybersecurity_round_two_reddit_hivemind_vs_us/) is a link to some other great web activism. We don't have to stop at CISPA.

Edit 5: Okay, a lot of people are leaving messages about how we need to hit the politicians. I couldn't agree more, but I also accept the fact that this is less likely. If we could get some people to send letters, and make phone calls to their representatives it would be much more effective at mitigating future bills that negatively affect us. Can someone write up an example/template so that we can send these letters en masse?

Edit 6: [Awesome Infographic](http://i.imgur.com/ga3Pb.jpg) that gives some explanation of CISPA vs. SOPA.

Edit 7: Making requests for the FBI to send you all the information they have on you? Might be a good heads up to see some of the types of information that entities will be able to share with each other. A few thousand requests should be a pretty clear heads-up. [Link](http://getmyfbifile.com/) to info about getting your FBI file. (Better idea? Let me know!)

**Serious** Edit: Alright, so there are a lot of people who will (not surprisingly) refuse to leave reddit for a week. Since this seems to be so intolerable, I've gotten an interesting suggestion.  For the days that we have our protest/boycott people should make accounts with something such as: ANTICISPA_PROTEST_xxx (where the x's are for a random number, so you can all make these accounts)

No use of your normal username, just the protesting one. This will keep Reddit informed about our dissatisfaction with their stance on CISPA, and also allow people to take a bigger advantage of our tier-style boycott (No use for the serious boycott, only ANTICISPA accounts for the people who still want to make an impact). Can I get some feedback?

An honest thank you to POTATO_IN_MY_ANUS for this **seriously** brilliant suggestion =)

**To the administrators** I am making a request for *two* things:

1. If the admins 'absolutely cannot, under any circumstance' blackout the site then have them write an incredibly detailed blog post, much like they did about PIPA/SOPA, so that users can be informed, motivated, and encouraged to take action on their own. Using the blog post to effectively spread the word across the entire site will show the users just how much of an impact CISPA has on all American internet users.

2. Have the admins explicitly state that while CISPA does not really affect reddit INC all that much, it does dramatically eliminate many safeguards for user privacy and expectations of anonymity. Have them explain that while they cannot black out the site that they are using their voice, as best they can, to explain to users that they need to advocate for themselves and how they can do it.

Thank you to SwampySoccerField for this great idea in communicating with the admins.

I am not trying to make this an anti-Reddit campaign. You allow us to communicate very effectively, and we thoroughly enjoy using your site. I know that we can come to an agreement. But, **please**, show us that you are listening. Show us that you are trying to do *something* that can benefit (hopefully with some good, politically motivated action) everyone.

**SUNDAY EDIT:** Again, thank you so much. You guys have been awesome. [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/sxdxv/a_quick_note_on_cispa_and_related_bills/c4hs04e) to the administrator's response. Thank you for responding to us and starting to really help us out here. Let's not think that this thing is over, it is only the beginning. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/syif5/redditors_its_time_to_take_action_four_bills_are/) is a link to the start of our movement.

**Monday Edit:** No response from Reddit Inc. AdBlock is on. I hope to hear from some of you that you've started to protest alongside me. Still looking for a better solution, but haven't been getting a lot of response. I was thinking that we could push the idea of using throwaway accounts with ANTICISPA in the name closer to May 7. Maybe if Reddit sees some outcry, they'll actually want to take a stance before we abandon the site for a week. Keep up the good fight.

**Final Edit:** Sorry about the delay. I've had a lot of things going on, so I wasn't able to log in late last night. This will be my last post/comment/anything on Reddit until the 21st. I hope all of you were serious when you said you'd join me. For those of you who simply can *not* resist Reddit, I ask that you kindly stop using your normal account. Make one called CISPA_PROTEST_2220222 and post/comment/vote with that. You guys have been great. I'll see you all in a week.",,False,,t5_2cneq,True,,,True,t3_swseu,http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/swseu/lets_get_reddit_inc_interested_in_opposing_cispa/,

**The real reason is that a significant number of Members on the Judiciary Committee had issues with the bill itself**, although those issues were different from the ones reddit cares about. **Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith basically couldn't get the support he thought he could get at this mark-up and was FORCED to push the mark-up until next week.** Sorry it wasn't clear before: The mark-up IS being continued this coming week, HOWEVER, it is unlikely that they'll be able to get the experts that other Members have been requesting to testify. Lamar Smith is basically being a dick by continuing with this markup even though a lot of the other Judiciary members have been complaining about not having enough info about how this bill would affect the internet.

If there are dirty politics going on, it's not against the American people, it's against other Members of Congress whom Congressman Smith is trying to railroad to make sure this bill goes to the floor in 2012. KNOW YOUR FACTS.

I know this post won't get upvotes because it gives Members of Congress some credit, but I get a lot of my news from reddit, and I didn't want a shrill, INCORRECT post just hovering on the fucking front page without some kind of rebuttal.

EDIT: Someone (edit: milkjake) suggested a wikipedia blackout. I can tell you now that if this were to happen, EVERY SINGLE CONGRESSMAN would hear about folks' opposition to SOPA. Why? Because staffers would see it first and news of it would spread like wildfire between offices. Chiefs of staff and comm directors would be scrambling to make sure their bosses have statements ready in case reporters ask for ""their thoughts on the wikipedia blackout.""

EDIT2: Wonkalot's comment explains it better than me: ""So, just to be clear, this isn't dirty politics. This is politics working. There's nothing scammy or weird going on, its a GOOD thing this has gone into committee hearings. It means that enough issues and questions about the bill have been raised so that Rep. Smith can't legitimately push for a vote without further examination. It means all of the bad shit about SOPA is about to be dragged through the mud. This is EXACTLY what we want - for this thing to ""die in committee."" There will be a giant amendment party for a while, and everyone will try and fix, and unfix, and refix and alter and combine and compromise and etc etc etc until NO-ONE, even the original authors, will have any love for the monstrosity it becomes. And then... quietly, it will be discarded.""

[Original] (http://static.thepiratebay.org/legal/sopa.txt)

___________________________________________________________
INTERNETS, 18th of January 2012.
PRESS RELEASE, FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE.

Over a century ago Thomas Edison got the patent for a device which would ""do for the eye what the phonograph does for
the ear"". He called it the Kinetoscope. He was not only amongst the first to record video, he was also the first person
to own the copyright to a motion picture.

Because of Edisons patents for the motion pictures it was close to financially impossible to create motion pictures
in the North american east coast. The movie studios therefor relocated to California, and founded what we today call
Hollywood. The reason was mostly because there was no patent.
There was also no copyright to speak of, so the studios could copy old stories and make movies out of them - like
Fantasia, one of Disneys biggest hits ever.

So, the whole basis of this industry, that today is screaming about losing control over immaterial rights, is that they
circumvented immaterial rights. They copied (or put in their terminology: ""stole"") other peoples creative works,
without paying for it. They did it in order to make a huge profit. Today, they're all successful and most of the
studios are on the Fortune 500 list of the richest companies in the world. Congratulations - it's all based on being
able to re-use other peoples creative works. And today they hold the rights to what other people create.
If you want to get something released, you have to abide to their rules. The ones they created after circumventing
other peoples rules.

The reason they are always complainting about ""pirates"" today is simple. We've done what they did. We circumvented the
rules they created and created our own. We crushed their monopoly by giving people something more efficient. We allow
people to have direct communication between eachother, circumventing the profitable middle man, that in some cases take
over 107% of the profits (yes, you pay to work for them).
It's all based on the fact that we're competition.
We've proven that their existance in their current form is no longer needed. We're just better than they are.

And the funny part is that our rules are very similar to the founding ideas of the USA. We fight for freedom of speech.
We see all people as equal. We believe that the public, not the elite, should rule the nation. We believe that laws
should be created to serve the public, not the rich corporations.

The Pirate Bay is truly an international community. The team is spread all over the globe - but we've stayed out of the
USA. We have Swedish roots and a swedish friend said this:
The word SOPA means ""trash"" in Swedish. The word PIPA means ""a pipe"" in Swedish. This is of course not a coincidence.
They want to make the internet inte a one way pipe, with them at the top, shoving trash through the pipe down to the
rest of us obedient consumers. 
The public opinion on this matter is clear. Ask anyone on the street and you'll learn that noone wants to be fed with
trash. Why the US government want the american people to be fed with trash is beyond our imagination but we hope that
you will stop them, before we all drown.

SOPA can't do anything to stop TPB. Worst case we'll change top level domain from our current .org to one of the
hundreds of other names that we already also use. In countries where TPB is blocked, China and Saudi Arabia springs to
mind, they block hundreds of our domain names. And did it work? Not really.
To fix the ""problem of piracy"" one should go to the source of the problem. The entertainment industry say they're
creating ""culture"" but what they really do is stuff like selling overpriced plushy dolls and making 11 year old girls
become anorexic. Either from working in the factories that creates the dolls for basically no salary or by watching
movies and tv shows that make them think that they're fat.

In the great Sid Meiers computer game Civilization you can build Wonders of the world. One of the most powerful ones
is Hollywood. With that you control all culture and media in the world. Rupert Murdoch was happy with MySpace and had
no problems with their own piracy until it failed. Now he's complainting that Google is the biggest source of piracy
in the world - because he's jealous. He wants to retain his mind control over people and clearly you'd get a more
honest view of things on Wikipedia and Google than on Fox News.

Some facts (years, dates) are probably wrong in this press release. The reason is that we can't access this information
when Wikipedia is blacked out. Because of pressure from our failing competitors. We're sorry for that.

A line buried deep in the document also ominously states, ""The Fair Wages and Hours of Labour Act is repealed.""
The change would eliminate a 1985 law forcing companies bidding on federal contracts to pay “fair wages and overtime.""

Opposition New Democratic Party MP Pat Martin called the proposal a “solution without a problem.”

“The only conclusion I can come up with is that it's a war on labor and the left. It's what the Americans did with the right-to-work states and the end result is $8 or $9 an hour is now the average wage in places like North Carolina,"" the Canadian Press cites him as saying.

The bill will also overhaul the country’s immigration rules, its temporary foreign workers program and its employment insurance system. In a further blow to the middle class, provisions in the legislation would effectively raise the country’s retirement age from 65 to 67 in a decade's time.""

Nobody should be able to introduce legislation that foul and be reelected without any competition.

I am 35 years old, and I have a master's degree in electrical engineering from UT. I have no skeletons in my closet. I'm currently a chip designer at one of the many Austin chip-design firms. I firmly oppose SOPA.

If there's enough interest, I will post personal details and further campaign-relevant positions, hold an AMA, and schedule an emergency CenTex meetup for the purpose of gathering signatures and planning the campaign. The weather is a bit miserable, so the turnout might be poor, but #OccupyAustin could also be a source of last-minute signatures.

I welcome comments and suggestions, and if we're serious about this, I'll try to get a team together on Saturday for the purpose of creating a campaign website, canvassing for signatures, and creating a position statement.

Edit: It's 11:30pm, and I have to be at work early tomorrow, so I'm signing off.  We've hit the frontpage, but let's be honest: this idea is less than six hours old, and there are an amazing number of signatures to get before Monday.  You'll notice I haven't included my name or identifying info -- I don't want the harassment that comes with this if there's not enough support to get us over even the first hurdle.  We'd need more signatures than we've gotten upvotes, and upvotes aren't restricted to Texas's 21st district.  If anyone's interested in a CenTex meetup for organization on Saturday afternoon, we can give it a shot, and we can hit #OWS for some signatures.  Realistically though, the scale of this project may be a bit too much for us for this weekend.  

IF WE CAN'T MAKE IT: Support your local independent parties.  Call your representatives.  Make yourselves heard.  Run for office yourself -- but don't wait for a reddit post four days before signatures are due.  That doesn't work, trust me.  Look at r/runforit : they've got the right idea.

If you're an #OWS person: Occupy Congress.  If you're a Republican or a Democrat who feels your party has gone off the deep end, CALL YOUR REPRESENTATIVE.  Cynics say that politicians only care about the money, but they know the money only comes if they're reelected.  

We've got less than a year until the 2012 elections.  Let's have some people to vote FOR instead of a plethora of people to vote AGAINST.

Last edit: Apparently I missed the deadline by a DAY.

Back in our twenties we used to ride a lot of Amtrak; with a couple of hours to kill changing trains at Union Station, we used to love walking up to the Capitol building and roaming its beautiful interior unattended. Since 9/11, you can only tour the building with a guide, but the elegant new Capitol Visitors Center offers a partial consolation.

This afternoon, after watching the required orientation film that precedes the tour, I'm exiting the theater when I hear Al Franken's distinctive bass voice right in front of me. It can't be him: why would Franken be on a public tour? I edge around for a glimpse and confirm it's the Senator. I have a split second to decide whether to say something or leave the man alone on his day off. I choose the latter and we end up in different tour groups.

About halfway through our tour, our guide asks if any of us noticed that Senator Franken was in the theater with us. He mentions that its very unusual for Senators to take the public tours when they can easily use their position to schedule V.I.P tours that are able to visit parts of the building off-limits to the general public. Our guide clearly thinks it's pretty cool that Franken has chosen to see the U.S. Capitol from the perspective of ordinary Americans. I agree.

Since I didn't take the opportunity on the tour, I'll take it here: Senator Franken, thank you. Thank you for being genuine and courageous, for being a voice that cuts through the bullshit that seems to be the stock and trade of most people in Congress, for doing the things we'd like to think we'd do if we were in the Senate.",,False,,t5_2cneq,False,,,True,t3_aiu2i,http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/aiu2i/earlier_today_al_franken_toured_the_us_capitol/,

This wasn't the idea at all. The examples below are making a very obvious political play, at the cost of their employees. It's pretty clear, for instance, that Papa Johns could find someplace else to make up for the cost of Obamacare, certainly at least in part. Additionally, if you are trying to save on costs, how does cutting hours back on employees make sense? The work is still there to be done, you'll need to hire more people to make up for the hours that aren't getting worked, so your HR cost will actually go UP, etc. If the idea is to try to limit your employees to a point where you can deny them benefits, I think this is also wrong. Additionally, it's not like Papa Johns is the ONLY company working under the new law, all the shitty delivery pizza places are too. They seem to be fine... wonder what the difference is?


**Update**: Gotta run out for brunch... wasn't honestly expecting this to take off so fast! I'll be back this afternoon and will update the list. Thanks all!

**Obligatory**: ErMahGerd yay, front page, derp... thanks

**To Clarify**: I'm not necessarily advocating a boycott, etc, as that would potentially just make things worse for the workers involved. I'm more advocating we spread awareness and generate some negative PR.

**addtional considerations**: Sources are important. There is a post previously [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/12y1w4/in_response_to_the_right_wing_mass_email_in_the/) (credit mr_majorly for bringing this to my attention) about misleading emails being sent around to make things look dire. Please check sources and don't just post blindly. I'll do my best (hopefully with the help of others) to verify information as it's posted.


Please post company names, what they did/are threatening to do, and the source article.

If this post makes it, I'll do my best to edit this section with names and source articles for every company.

His answer was that they've had their heads so far up the elections ass that they may have missed it. He then said he'd look into it, and mentioned it during the opening of the show!

Watch tonight, its a great interview and we finally got him to mention SOPA on air! Hopefully he'll make it a bit later and help spread the word.

Thanks everyone for the input! I'll post more info when I get to an actual computer later tonight.

Edit: forgot to post what I actually said, which was ""the internet sent me to ask you what you think of SOPA and why you haven't mentioned it on the show."" 

Edit 2: Holy crap everyone, front page? Amazing!!! I'm so glad I was able to deliver this message. I don't know if Jon Stewart really had no idea about SOPA or if he was just saying that, but I almost lost my mind when he mentioned it in the intro. Another interesting point, someone wrote [an article mentioning the exchange](http://www.businessinsider.com/jon-stewart-and-sopa-please-2012-1) and noticed that Jon looked directly at one of his writers when he said he would look into it, so I'm really really hoping to see a follow up on it in the coming days. You are all awesome, keep spreading the word, thanks for the upvotes and the positive feedback! The best thing we can do to beat SOPA/PIPA is to keep spreading the word, so keep up the good work!

I didn't fight for Wall St. I fought for America. Now it's Congress' turn. 



My true hope, though, is that we Veterans canact as first line of defense between the police and the protester. If they want to get to some protesters so they can mace them, they will have to get through the Fucking Marine Corps first. Let's see a cop mace abunch of decorated war vets. 



I apologize now for typos and errors. Typing this on iPhone whilst heading to NYC.  We can organize once we're there. That's what we do best. If you see someone in uniform, gather together.  


A formation will be held tonight at 10PM.

Hope to see you there

I'm no longer in active duty or in any way contractually indebted to the military. Nor are any of my friends that are joining me.

The police justified their use of force on unarmed protesters because they were ""armed"".  By that, they meant they were linked arm-in-arm around the tent camp.  Even without the play on words, is it right that our police are expected resort to force if their arrest doesn't go the way they want it to?  

It seems to me, if the situation is non-violent, the police should not make it into a violent one.

EDIT:  Wow! I'm glad this conversation has really kicked in!  I've got a lot of comments to respond to....feel free to help me out.  lol.  Also, I've been posting all the quality Occupy protest videos I find to VMAP (http://www.vmap.com/tag/occupy).  There are a bunch of Berkeley videos (navigate the map to Berkeley) as well as other cities around the US and the world.  Feel free to use it to share videos you find too.

EDIT 2: My friend was at the protests and forwarded me this link to a petition.  Its just one small way we can make our voices heard beyond this page: [http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/uc_berkeley_teachers_condemn_violence/](http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/uc_berkeley_teachers_condemn_violence/) (Im not sure if this petition is supposed to be Cal students and faculty only, or if its open to the public....can't hurt to sign it I guess)

EDIT 3: Thanks for the thoughtful discussion everyone! Its nearing my bedtime, and this post is at #2!  I can't believe it, I want to stay up and see it hit #1, so I can say I conquered Reddit.  

A lot of people have made posts asking or hoping that we can come to conclusions or something.  I can't say this represents everyone here, but I will add one idea I that is sticking with me personally.

We demand a law, or First Amendment clarification (thats the bit that says we have the right to assemble to petition our government), that not only makes it legal to protest en masse, but dictates that during a non-violent protest, certain laws, such as curfew, blocking traffic or causing noise disturbances can be overlooked.  The logic is this: our laws are in place to protect the citizens.  But if a large enough group of the citizens are peacefully breaking a law to make a protest about a bigger point, then the Police protecting them directly should be more important than protecting them indirectly, by enforcing the minor law bring broken.

EDIT 4: more media coverage,

Dave Loebsack (D-IA) teamed up with another House Democrat and a Republican last week to introduce the Deficit Committee Transparency Act. It calls for the supercommittee to create a website where any meetings with lobbyists would have to be posted within 48 hours. Loebsack says campaign contributions would also have to be reported.

""Whatever they receive, in terms of $500 or above to themselves or to their leadership political action committees, I want that reported within 48 hours,"" he says.

Loebsack says they ""haven't heard from leadership on either side of the aisle yet"" in response to the legislation. A letter sent the supercommittee's co-chairmen asking them to adopt the 48-hour rule has gone unanswered.

Fact:  The government has just given itself the authority to indefinitely detain any and all terrorists, even if they are American citizens, without trial.

""Section (1) is basically a re-statement of the 2001 AUMF. But Section (2) is a brand new addition. It allows the President to target not only those who helped perpetrate the 9/11 attacks or those who harbored them, but also: anyone who “substantially supports” such groups and/or “associated forces.” Those are extremely vague terms subject to wild and obvious levels of abuse (see what Law Professor Jonathan Hafetz told me in an interview last week about the dangers of those terms). This is a substantial statutory escalation of the War on Terror and the President’s powers under it, and **it occurs more than ten years after 9/11, with Osama bin Laden dead, and with the U.S. Government boasting that virtually all Al Qaeda leaders have been eliminated** and the original organization (the one accused of perpetrating 9/11 attack) rendered inoperable.""

After weeks of getting hammered by redditors, blogs and increasingly mainstream media for his inaction on SOPA, Paul Ryan has today reversed course and denounced SOPA:


*January 9, 2012*

*WASHINGTON - Wisconsin’s First District Congressman Paul Ryan released the following statement regarding H.R. 3261, the Stop Online Piracy Act:*

*""The internet is one of the most magnificent expressions of freedom and free enterprise in history. It should stay that way. While H.R. 3261, the Stop Online Piracy Act, attempts to address a legitimate problem, I believe it creates the precedent and possibility for undue regulation, censorship and legal abuse. I do not support H.R. 3261 in its current form and will oppose the legislation should it come before the full House.""*

This is an extraordinary victory. Reddit was able to force the House Budget Chair to reverse course - shock waves will be felt throughout the establishment in Washington today - other lawmakers will take notice. 

We still have much work to do. I encourage you to continuously pressure pro-SOPA/PIPA legislators and remain vigilant, this is merely the first of many battles to come.

You decide... but prepare to back it up. 

**EDIT** Lively conversation. To those who suggest I am setting up a false dichotomy, let me clarify. My title is the argument. A business owner hires more people to meet the demand for the product. If his personal income tax rate goes up, he will still hire the sufficient number of people to meet demand. If his taxes go down, he doesn't hire more people with the extra money. He will pocket it. You might say he would re-invest it in the company, but he would only do so if there is a need. Demand drives hiring decisions. You lose money when you don't create enough of your product/service to meet demand.

1270504451.0,2772,self.politics,bmu2d,Saw the video Wikileaks posted; here's a measured interpretation from someone who's been over there,6591,3819,2449,http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/bmu2d/saw_the_video_wikileaks_posted_heres_a_measured/,"TL;DR: I'm military and been right over that neighborhood at a different time; the video may be disturbing but doesn't strike me as unjustifiable.  The coverup is what we should save our real vitriol for.  I know some of you will immediately dismiss this as you view everyone in the military as inherently evil.  I find that silly.  (There are also people who think I can do no wrong because I AM and I find that dangerous).  Give it a read anyway.  


War is an ugly, atrocious action.  Bad things happen every day; good things only rarely.  It's a waste of money, time, potential, and especially lives.  What's in this video is distasteful to say the least, but it's also intentionally inflammatory (presumably so WL gets more clicks, and we all obliged them).  This video is from a period of increasing, and increasingly violent, action by insurgents.  Mortar and rocket attacks, IEDs/EFPs, executions in the most grotesque manner, were all becoming the norm.  


The men you hear are reacting to stress from a variety of sources: lack of sleep because of indirect fire attacks, stress from friends being WIA/KIA, stress from feeling little support from the Iraqis at that time, from being away from home and family.  In all that stress, they still behaved according to the rules of engagement.  They positively identified small arms (which are a threat) and misidentified an RPG.  Had I not known, I would also have called out RPG.  It unfortunately looks like it, and that was amplified by the pose he took.  WL added in captions to let you know there were cameras to amplify outrage, but having flown around Baghdad in helos *everything* looks like a threat after they shoot at you.


Shooting the van was also justifiable because the ""insurgents"" were going to collect their wounded and weapons.  Clearly the aircrew were wrong, but not unjustifiably and probably only in hindsight.  They followed the ROEs, received approval to fire, and did so efficiently.  Further, the initial statements that said they were engaged with a violent group also does not strike me as ""cover up.""  If you've ever been involved with an emergency situation you know the first reports out are **usually** wrong.  The later reports, however, I find repugnant.  Events like this make me want to **stay** in the military because I don't want the bastards trying to cover up what was a horrific mistake thinking I won't be right over their shoulder next time.

I have found virtually all the military members I was with in Iraq serious, professional (at least on duty!), and genuinely concerned for civilians.  You saw the soldiers running out with the kids.  Genuine concern there, from fathers, older brothers, cousins that know kids like that back home.  The amount of work we did to keep civilians out of harms way was breathtaking sometimes because it put us in much more vulnerable situations.  I'm good with that.  I signed up, they didn't.  As for the attitude and demeanor of the aircrew, yep, it's stomach-turning.  I did see this on occasion, and it's not something I've seen many redditors say they teach you in training.  It's a defense mechanism to deal with the privations and violence you see.  Dehumanizing the enemy makes it easier to deal with it.  If you've never read or seen a synopsis of [On Killing](http://www.amazon.com/Killing-Psychological-Cost-Learning-Society/dp/0316040932/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1270504046&amp;sr=1-1) you absolutely should.  That's why running over a body was seemingly funny.  I'm ashamed to say I've had similar gut reactions of really terrible things, and like those guys I feel awful about it when I reflect.


This post isn't to justify the killings, but hopefully to tone down some of the hyperbole.  It's a terrible tragedy; it's a waste; I'd love to see us out of Iraq as soon as feasible.  It's not a war crime.  It's not 18-year-old kids just wanting to kill people for the fun of it.  Now, let's all be pissed together that it took this long to get the real story out.  OK, too long of a ramble but I needed to get it off my chest.  Ask away if you have questions; I'll tell you what I can.",,False,,t5_2cneq,False,,,True,t3_bmu2d,http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/bmu2d/saw_the_video_wikileaks_posted_heres_a_measured/,

Free Speech/Press issues: [Misrepresentation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misrepresentation) is not protected.

Fox doesn't call their opinion shows ""news"": [Yeah they do](http://glennbeckreport.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/glenn-beck-hitler-youth.jpg)

Will everyone be regulated?: No, I just hate Fox specifically. /s

EDIT 2:

The Media Bureau also handles post-licensing matters regarding Direct Broadcast Satellite service.

More Free Speech: The content of the speech is not limited in any fashion, merely the labeling it as ""news"". Similarly, chicken meat formed into wing shapes can still be sold, but cannot be called ""wings"".

Chicken wings have bones, so aren't 100% meat: Yes, they do.

I am fucking sick over this disgusting display of ignorance. Here's what one of their biggest organizers had to say. Oh, and he's a Reverend:

“God has given us this victory,” Emrich continued, “and it is very important for us to recognize that he is the one who put the energy into this campaign. So let’s not be so arrogant to forget this. It’s very appropriate to pause for a moment of prayer.”

And a shot of some No on 1 supporters hearing the news: http://imgur.com/jq8JV.jpg

Why do people do this to other people? Fear? Lack of intelligence? Ignorance? Lack of empathy?

Thanks GOP. The money you vomited into Maine for this election season worked. Thanks churches. Your army of reverends and priests led a good fight to take away rights from people who genuinely love each other. Very Jesus-like.

All hiring and firing is based on demand. The best way to create jobs is give consumers more money (via wage increases or stimulus) so they purchase more goods which create more jobs.  Production will be based on demand, not on how much money you're paying for taxes. Corporations and wealthy are just going to pocket the extra profit, it's that simple.

[Sign the petition here!](http://www.sherrodbrown.com/petition/overturn-citizens-united-a2/) 

'Edit: In my excitement to get the word out I failed to do my research. Please support the amendment that has been posted by _zardoz_(top comment). I do believe that you should sign the petition that I have mentioned to jam up all channels and make sure that congress does not have any choice but to see that this issue will not be lost in the mix. The amendment that _zardoz_ posted is by design far more professional and seems to be taking the issue in a more serious tone.

Also, a word on slactivisim. No, one redditor will not change the world by signing internet petitions. But in a world where the internet connects people from urban to suburban to rural, from religious to atheist, etc. it is the medium with which we can connect and unite on issues such as these. By coming together and signing petitions, adding support to bills and sending letters to our representatives, we remind our representatives that we are still out there and we want to control the discourse of the debate. When this many people agree in whole or in part on one issue it sends a message that we are paying attention. If you do not believe that this is a significant manifestation of the power of the people, I urge you to use reddit and other sources to organize rallies or protests or whatever you think may work. When millions of people unite without any leadership from the ruling class, we have the power and they can't help but address the issues at hand. Case in point, don't forget that SOPA was defeated using mostly internet protests and blackouts. People wrote emails, letters and signed petitions. When millions of people united under one cause the elite were forced to listen. There were no riots or violence just the power of millions of citizens voices amplified by the megaphone that is the internet.",,False,,t5_2cneq,1345413043.0,,,True,t3_yh8bn,http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/yh8bn/sign_al_franken_and_sherrod_bowns_petition_to/,
