1359240530.0,138,self.singing,17c6jx,How-To Practice; a Guide,145,7,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/17c6jx/howto_practice_a_guide/,"Practice is one of the most important parts of becoming a good singer. Singing well requires developing muscle memory so that you can focus more on performing and less on the technical aspects to make your performances stronger.

For those new-ish to singing, how-to practice can be a little challenging to figure out. While simply singing through songs *does* constitute as practice, there are better ways to optimize practice time so that you get the most out of it.

For starters, a singer should vocalize for at least 15 minutes every day. Even if you can't get a full practice session in, this will remind your muscles of all the work that you've already put in in previous practice sessions so that you don't step backwards in terms of progress. Past that; singing is less about actual increments of time put in to practice and more about the amount of progress and work you put into practice. What someone may accomplish in 10 minutes may take someone else 30. *This is okay.* Everyone's body is different and will learn some things faster than others. You should not practice for more than an hour without taking a significant break and giving your vocal folds a rest. Honestly, for most kinds of singing, an hour a day is more than enough. If you're singing something a little bit more challenging, it's possible that more practice will be required a day. Even then, one should not practice for more than three hours a day. The vocal folds need rest, and singing is less about how long you sing, and more about how frequent you sing. Practicing twice a day for 15-30 minutes will do you better than singing an equal amount of time in one sitting. It's all about muscle memory.

And now- what to practice and how.

**BREATHING**
There are lots of good breathing exercises out there (if you have a chance, give ""Farinelli Breathing Exercises"" a shot on google). It's incredibly important to practice this foundational element of singing separately from phonation. It may seem silly, but your practice session will move a lot faster if you simply take the time to do a breathing exercise or two. [This](http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/breathing-basics-for-singing.html) website has some good pointers to begin with. Doing breathing exercises *with good posture* should be something you do every day.

**WARM UP**
Everyone has their favorite warm-ups. If you're new, you may not have any. Warm-ups help set up the tone that you want for the rest of your rehearsal time. Here is where you get your voice ready to sing in the style that you want. Some good warm-ups to start with include:

* Lip trills on a scale (that motor-boating sound you can make with your lips)
* Onsets. Take a single note. Sing one vowel. take a breath. Sing another vowel on the same note, continue doing this through all of the five basic vowels (ee, ayyy, aaahh, oh, oooo). The object of this is to be able to sing each vowel cleanly, with no scooping or hard [glottals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edxwQK1zBxw&amp;t=1m30s), and in tune.
* Scales or other melodic exercises (do, mi, so, do, or other similar things) on vowels or voiced consonants (like v, z, m, n etc...)
* Sing intervals/scales to simply practice intonation.
* [Here's a list of some other good stuff.](http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/singing-exercises-for-dummies-cheat-sheet.html)

**WORK ON THE SONG/S**
Start with a run-through of each song you're working on. Use this run-through to identify parts that you aren't so happy with that you can pick apart. Do you have trouble reaching the end of a phrase? Are there some notes you have trouble hitting or getting in tune? Is there a place where you'd wish you'd have had some better dynamic contrast? Was there a spot where your tone wasn't consistent with what you wanted?  Be really really picky. Mindlessly singing through songs will not get you very far if you don't think about how you want to make them better.

Now take all of those things that you want to do better, and break the song into pieces. Play around with each aspect until you fine tune it to where you want it to be (or at least make it closer to what you want). If you can't figure out how to do it, go to your teacher, or google, or this subreddit, or a friend, and ask. Don't just let it go. If you don't know the answer, find it. 

After you work on the individual aspects, do another run-through of the song and do an evaluation to see how much of it you remembered to do. I suggest only working on 3 things/song each time so you don't overload yourself with too much to think about at once.

90% of being a good singer is having critical thinking skills and being able to take apart your own performance and know exactly what you want to fix. If you don't know what to fix (or how) because you're clueless as to where to start, post a critique! We'll help you. We're a community here to help each other out- and we're pretty good at it. No need for embarrassment or shame. :)

1353513330.0,94,self.singing,13kj4i,"Your singing and your ""range"": a letter of my grievances over the obsession with range.",105,11,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/13kj4i/your_singing_and_your_range_a_letter_of_my/,"A little bit of a backstory on where this is coming from for those who don't know me. I have been pretty active in this subreddit for about 8 (? possibly more) months now. Around here you tend to see a lot of the same threads show up every couple weeks or so, which I like to, jokingly, refer to as the ""greatest hits of /r/singing"". Basically, they tend to be this kind of thing:

- How can I scream/hard rock sing?
- Lost my voice, need a quick fix for a gig
- What songs should I use for an audition?
- Can't afford voice lessons, can I teach myself?
- Just started singing, very sad that I don't have a 10 octave range, thinking of quitting :(

Now, most of these questions are very well answered by a lot of our regulars, like /u/BlackTheta , /u/afrael , /u/taylorishere , etc. (I know I missed a *lot* of people, sorry) but the last question in particular has always bugged me. For one, the question of ""range"" is very complicated and is actually - as I see it - several other questions in disguise. My attempts to think of this left me with the following questions/problems:

- ""How can I expand my range?""
- ""Why can't I sing to *x* note?""
- ""Will I ever be able to sing to *x* note?""
- ""I want to be like/literally embody *x* singer, but I don't have the range and therefore can't""
- ""I used to be able to hit *x* note, but now I can barely sing above *y*, I hate my life""

...and lastly the occasional (rare around here, but very common in my singing life) passive-aggressive...

- I have an *x* octave range, look at how much better of a singer I am than you!

The problem that I have with range is that I find most newcomers put *way* too much emphasis on increasing their range, often at the expense of musicianship. That term, *musicianship* might be a new word for a lot of newcomers so let me explain before I go on...

------------------

The art of singing is fundamentally broken up into two categories: *technique* and *musicianship*. These can mean very different things for very different styles of music but the most crossover between all styles lies in technique. Technique contains things like:

- breathing and support
- phonation
- resonance
- ridding the body of muscular stress (Alexander Technique, etc.)

*(as you may have guessed, this is where people focusing on range will place most their energy, but more on that later)*

Whereas musicianship contains things like:

- Diction
- Phrasing
- Ornamentation
- Improvisation
- Singing-Acting (generally described to me as *intention*, different but not divorced from [""acting""](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Bernhardt_Hamlet2.jpg))
- Characterization (more common in certain styles than others)

*N.B. The line between technique and musicianship is not truly so cut and dry and the more training you do the more you see them blend together.*

You may have already experienced this phenomenon in your lessons with your teacher. Typically, if you work on scales and exercises in the beginning of a lesson you are honing technique; when you move on to repertoire you are then typically honing musicianship. Similarly, a ""voice teacher"" typically focuses on technique whereas a ""vocal coach"" typically focuses on musicianship in a particular style (though many teachers put these two roles together in one).

-------------------------

***""Range"" as an example of ego-boosting***

When it comes to a singers range, what I see mostly is a bunch of people measuring their dicks and proclaiming ""mine's bigger, so I'm better than you"". This is less of an analogy than it is pretty much the same thing: some people naturally have larger ranges than others just as some people have large penises and some have smaller ones. In the end, just as a large penis by no means equals competent lover, large range by no means equals great singer.

Most of the repertoire is not written for people with huge ranges in mind and even if you are someone who has a smaller-than average range, by performing with amazing musicianship you can still have a long and glorious career. Think about it, the last time you went to a concert/listened to a CD/saw a musical what was the singing like? What grabbed you most? Was it a bunch of people singing scales up to the stratosphere and down to the sub-basement or was it people singing the melodies well, having great sense of rhythm, articulation, enmeshment, improvisation, and selling what they were singing? ""But CrAzY_MoFo_13,"" you might say, ""what about all these famous singers who have huge ranges like *x* and *y* and their songs, doesn't that prove that bigger range = better artist?"" The problem with using this argument is that we only know of the singers that have large ranges and are *also* competent musicians, because the rest never went anywhere. Beyond that, what about all the famous singers who don't have astronomical ranges? And those songs that all require giant ranges to sing? They were generally written with *that* singer in mind, and are therefore tailored to that person's voice. Conversely, look at the giant body of repertoire written to be performed by the amateur singer;* these songs almost never require a total range of more than an octave and a fifth, and never approach the extreme ranges of the voice type they're written for - or they wouldn't sell.

**This practice was fairly common until the mid-twentieth century where amateur singing fell out of fashion, but for a perfect example see ""parlour songs"".*

The next issue I see with people's ranges is the tendency for people to ""round up"" as it were with their extreme ranges. By ""round up"", what I mean is that people have a tendency to barely squeak out high notes or sort-of growl out low notes and figure ""ok, I'll say I can sing from C2 to C6 as a man"". Notes like these are riddled with issues depending on your style of singing, but the main problems I find are universal are the following:

- Notes forced out in these extreme ranges are generally only made because of extreme stress on the vocal cords and are therefore **dangerous and damaging**
- If you sing in a style where you don't use amplification these notes can almost never project properly
- These notes are often there some days/time of the day, and not there others. I.e. they are *unreliable*
- These notes are almost never useable in actual music

To expand on that last point. High and low notes have a tendency - even when done with good technique behind them - to be more easily produced on certain vowels than others, or the vowels need to be modified to produce them. As you might imagine, this means the word is usually secondary to the music in passages like this. Take for instance a good showtune number in Broadway where a singer gets a chance to show off their high notes (male or female): this sort of thing is almost always done in free vocalise (just on a vowel) or on a melisma (multiple notes on the vowel of a word).** The further up or down you go, the more extreme this becomes until you can only phonate that note on a certain vowel, or often just a squeak or growl that doesn't sound like *any* vowel at all.

** *This practice is equivalent to* coloratura *in* bel canto *style or melismas in pop style*

Regardless of a style, a singer's range can only be considered as the notes on which they can hit *consistently* and *artfully* at **any given time**. I won't say any more on that subject for sake of space.

---------------------------------

***New singers and their range***

When it comes to new singers and their range, it is often very frustrating for someone to sit down at a piano and find they can barely sing past one octave, one octave and a fifth, etc. This is not uncommon, but it is something that we all have to work through; just because you can't sing it *now* doesn't necessarily mean it's not there. The voice is a set of muscles and just as you can't walk into a gym on day 1 and bench 300 lbs, you won't be able to utilize your body's full potential without a lot of training and practice. For many people the vast majority of their time vocalizing is done through speech, and depending on the culture, this often means the voice is using a very small tonal range in its daily use. Singing will therefore feel foreign to the muscles of the voice when you first start out, they will be unresponsive in certain ways and will tire easily in others. Just remember to keep at it *safely* and *properly* and eventually you will be able to utilize the full potential of your voice (this will most likely take years, I never said it would be easy!).

Since the good majority of our subreddit seems to be young people (including myself), there is a very important point I have to make. When people think of the body ""maturing"" they often think of sexual maturity (10 - 13 y/o average) and/or political age of majority (16 - 21 average). However, for the voice this is not so! Ever wonder why see so many 40 y/o women playing 16 y/o girls in opera? Well, that's because voices keep maturing long after the peak of most of the rest of the body, men will not become mature in voice until at least 30 years old! Beyond that, if you're under the age of 18 your voice is most likely currently going through the huge changes of puberty or has *just* completed them so you can't expect your voice to be anywhere near what your mature voice will be. However, it is always good to keep training and singing, just know that you're not superhuman.

------------------------

***Conclusion / TL;DR***

So, in conclusion I'll say this: having a big range != being a good musician, too much concentration on your range is equivalent to comparing penis size, and focus on increasing your range often causes musicianship (which is much more important IMO) to fall by the wayside. In addition, young people still have growing voices that will be growing well into their adult lives and teenagers are just babies in the voice and should not be concerned with range.

I've been taking singing lessons from Brett Manning's ""Singing Success"" CD set and free YouTube Lessons from ericarceneaux for a little over a year. I've come up with this for some of my friends who also want to learn how to sing comfortably. Even the very first time you try this, I can guarantee that you will feel noticable improvement :D

1: Tune Your Voice! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd-12-vyCiw

This really helps with sustaining pitches and getting more control over your ""speaking range"". There's a male, and a female doing these ""scales"". [Liproll](http://thevocalteacher.com/how-to-do-a-lip-roll/) with the male's voice, then ""ahh"" with the female's.

2: Vocal Workout to Improve Accuracy, Breathing and Confidence: http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&amp;feature=fvwrel&amp;v=Ea4eBWcZZ2E

This focuses on the control you have when changing pitches. Do with Liprolls and Hums. When you hum, have your tongue lay against the top of the bottom row of teeth, you should feel some reasonance in your nasal cavity.

3: Classic Vocal Warm Up Exercise (6 Times, repeat more if needed)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu4fVTUXZC4&amp;feature=relmfu

1.Hum
2.Liproll
3.Nasal ""A's"" - Open your mouth, place your finger on you chin, make sure it doesn't move. Make a short staccato ""A"" sound (as in nAsal) for each note. This will help open up your upper registers as well as strengthening your speaking register.
4.""Mum-Mums"" - If you hold your nose and try to sing, it'll sound very nasaly. Try and make it, not nasaly, if that makes sense. Lower your adam's apple a bit, it should sound kind of breathy. Now take your hand off your nose and make the same sound with a ""mum"" for each note. This will help reduce a lot of strain when singing.

1343828407.0,65,self.singing,xi6ro,Spoiler Alert: You CAN Sing! Or a short blurb on how many newcomers psych themselves out,71,6,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/xi6ro/spoiler_alert_you_can_sing_or_a_short_blurb_on/,"So, after being a visitor/contributor of this fine subreddit for quite a while (I think I joined around 800 members, wow we've grown!) I noticed that the very new contributors always seem to basically have a title like, ""This is my first time ever singing, should I continue?"" They always seem to be wondering if they were even given the biological structures to be *able* to sing, they don't like the sound of their own voice, etc. etc. etc. Well, I basically always reply the same thing,

**Yes, you CAN sing! You should ALWAYS continue if you love to sing, no matter what you think of how your voice sounds NOW.**

Because singing is such an illogical art in many ways (thinking of surprise will unconsciously raise up my soft palate, whaaaaa?) and relies on so many muscle positions that are antithetic to what we do every day (deep breathing, proper posture, pure vowels, etc.) great singers are often painted in this mystical light as freaks of nature. Well, it is true that some people are just born with amazing biology and will be in the top 0.001% of singers, but guess what **if music relied on those freaks of nature, we would not have music as we have it today.** Even opera, that art form that always seems from afar as a special ""club"" for the vocal elite has roles written for amateur singers. [Die Zauberflöte](http://opera.stanford.edu/Mozart/Zauberflote/) is a perfect example: though the opera contains one of the hardest roles in the soprano rep (the Queen of the Night), it also contains the role of Papageno, a role that is, musically, relatively easy since it was written for a man who was primarily an actor.

But how does this relate to you, and your voice, right now? Well, think about it this way, the voice is a series of muscles, and muscles need to be exercised. But singing softly along to your favourite song on the radio is not exercise in the same way that bench-pressing 15 pounds is not exercise. When the muscles in your chest are pushed and challenged they will get tired, but the muscle will build itself back stronger to meet this new demand; too much push and the muscle can be seriously harmed, maybe even permanently. This is a lot less of metaphor to the voice than you think: the larynx will respond to new demands being put on it (in the right way, read on) and come back stronger and more ready, so will the diaphragm, intercostals, pharyngeal muscles, etc. But, work on the larynx the *wrong* way, or do *too much* and you can develop problems with the muscles inside.

Many people try to sing with no training, hear that they can't go as high as trained singers, have a roughness to the timbre, can't sustain a note, etc. and become immediately let down by the ""fact"" that they ""can't sing"". **This is bullshit**, you wouldn't feel bad that you can't pull a bus with your bare hands because some strongman who has been training 30+ years to do so can. I think part of this problem is a visual thing that, because we can't necessarily see what makes a great singer with our eyes, we just assume ""they're born with it"". **Nope**. Mariah Carey wasn't born with the ability to sing in that whistle register, Jussi Björling wasn't born with the ability to do what he did - they trained, and **hard**, with a ***teacher***. 

Finding a trained, **and well trained** voice teacher is probably the most important thing a new singer can do. They will diagnose your voice in its current form and figure out a way to help you overcome whatever problems you might have at the time. That roughness in your voice? They might show you a way to reduce stress on your cords and eliminate it. Can't hold a note without going flat? They will show you how to breathe and support yourself correctly. But be careful, as there are many, many voice teachers who, frankly, don't know what the fuck they're talking about and will charge exorbitant amounts of money to tell you how great you whilst not doing anything productive. How can you tell? Well, for one, ask about and research the teacher's other students (particularly ones that have been there for a while), if they have many students who are/have gone on to be professional singers know for their great voices the teacher is probably doing something right, if they don't, maybe the teacher is not so good. On a side note, if the teacher has many tenor students that are successful, but no female students, maybe this teacher does not fully understand the soprano, mezzo, and bass voices. Also, the teacher *must* be able to actually *sing*: even if they are 60+ years old, they should still be able to sing in an appropriate way for their age for, if they destroyed their own voice through mismanagement, how can they be trusted with the care of yours? One last thing on teachers, within the first six *weeks* with a new teacher you should see an improvement on some level, if you don't, you're probably wasting your money.

So in conclusion, whenever I see a new singer come in with the question ""First time singing, I don't like my voice, should I give up?"" My question is always the same: **Fuck No**. I apologize if profanity offends you but this is a situation where niceties aren't going to get us anywhere. The fact of the matter is, **your voice may not sound that great now, but that *does not mean you have nowhere to go*; every singer needs to train and you haven't even begun.** My advice, find a good voice teacher and stick with it, because the most important thing that a singer needs to be great is not a freakishly-great set of lungs or any of that stuff but **tenacity** and the ambition to become something better.

**TL;DR** The answer to your question is, yes, you should continue singing.**",,False,,t5_2rlcx,1343836480.0,,star,True,t3_xi6ro,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/xi6ro/spoiler_alert_you_can_sing_or_a_short_blurb_on/,

1. Learn to breathe properly with your Diaphragm. This means breathing without your shoulders rising. (for anyone who plays woodwind instruments, you should have learned this already.)
2. Hit consonants off your hard pallet. It is the part of the roof of your mouth right in front of your front teeth. Your sound is based on resonation in your skull.
3. When singing vowels, try to open your mouth to the point where you can fit two fingers between your teeth.
4. Don't sing sitting down.
5. adjust your cheek muscles as if you're smiling while performing, it will clear up the consonant sounds.
6. Do not be afraid to be loud. Proper singing especially higher in your register is loud.
7. On the day of a presentation, avoid dairy. It creates mucus in your throat that can be problematic, especially if you aren't using a microphone.
8. Water is always good, warm tea (dont burn yourself) is better.
9. When hitting a high note, don't picture yourself raising to the note. Picture yourself pushing the note down. This seems weird but it works for lots of people to avoid straining their throat on high notes.

There is one thing that a lot of people starting out (including myself) ignores, and that is, breathing, the usual thought process goes something like this:

|

-I don't need to learn how to breathe, I already know how to breathe, this is useless! Let's get down to singing shall we?

|

No, we shall not! I got stuck with this problem for 2 months, bad posture and bad breathing equates to bad pitch, bad tonality, singing from the throat, moving your larynx to try and compensate, it causes so many problems that I deemed this to be the most important part of singing during my training!

|

**Breathing from your belly**

The first time you learn about diaphragmatic breathing usually involves people telling you to, breathe from your diaphragm or from your belly, that is wrong! You still breathe from your lungs you'll just make more space for them and allow them to retain and control air without pretty much any effort, the first thing that I've done once I saw ""breathe from your belly"" was trying to do it, don't! you should never force your breathing to be diaphragmatic, that is not how it works! You allow it to be! How, you may ask?

**How**

The first and easiest way is to lay down, relax and breathe, this way you'll breathe from your diaphragm involuntarily, now put your hand on your belly, you should see and feel it expand, if you don't, your forcing it or you're not relax (or you're not human), now that you know how it feels stand up or sit, it really doesn't matter, now stay straight, don't lean forward or slouch, make sure your shoulders are straight, make sure you spine is straight, not rigid, just straight, but don't let them overly relaxed, you wanna be straight without feeling like you're forcing it (If you're still having problems here is a [Video of a lovely British lady explaining it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itrvl3RW9Ek) ), and now, breathe from your mouth, put your right hand right below your ribs on the center right after your sternum [(Images)](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=rib+cage+middle+bone&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.42553238,d.eWU&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=902&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=tEkfUeLGMIeE9QSAu4A4#um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=sternum&amp;oq=sternum&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l10.1768.3621.0.4528.7.6.0.1.1.0.169.856.1j5.6.0...0.0...1c.1.3.img.SfRZx_NIQ60&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.42553238,d.eWU&amp;fp=183778c6ecf3de6b&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=902), put your left hand on your back just a bit to the side [here](http://imgur.com/Nicx9Rq) and you should feel it expand while your breathing! Not exactly the hardest thing to lean or do, but yet it makes a lot of difference! Now, don't try to breathe too much air, actually once you've got this down don't worry too much about your breathing, it becomes natural after a while, it shouldn't take you more then a few minutes to learn this, once you do, warm up, and sing, you'll feel and hear the difference right away! But remember you shoulders should have minimal to no movement from your breathing

It is interesting that breathing and posture are so related, this is pretty much about both but focused on breathing :D

The following is an exceptionally well-written and accessible paper on how to think about singing and the study of voice. I read and re-read it quite frequently, and I firmly believe understanding Baer's position will open doors for you vocally which might otherwise be shut.

Additionally, the paper is too long to post at once, so I'ma break it into two chunks, the second of which will be in a comment.

**Establishing a Correct Basic Technique for Singing**

**By Hermanus Baer**

Artistic, expressive singing demands first of all a type of vocal technique that allows the instrument to be free and responsive, adequately responsive to all the demands of artistic expression. That is all we can ask of any vocal technique. So the question arises: how may the voice student find the muscular action that will give him an instrument that is truly responsive?

I believe the first step toward this ideal goal is to clarify cause and effect. Too often voice students and teachers deal entirely with the effect. The teacher observes that the student's jaw appears to be stiff. Now, no student willfully stiffens his jaw to make trouble for his teacher. The jaw stiffens because the student is attempting to do something which causes the stiffness. I feel certain that one's jaw is seldom lacking in freedom of movement before singing. So, we must conclude that there is incorrect action somewhere which is causing the problem. The difficulty is not purely local in character. Likewise, I believe other vocal faults usually have an underlying cause. The real problem is not where it appears to be. To call the students attention to his stiff jaw is dealing with the effect and will probably make matters worse.

There are numerous examples of this faulty approach in teaching singing. One of the most prevalent is the incessant concentration on tone. I am convinced this works at cross purposes to good interpretation. In our speaking voices we express various emotions, such as joy, sorrow, pity, anger, etc., without thinking about tone. Instead, we think of the idea we wish to express. This idea colors our voices automatically and motivates the appropriate tone. The best tone is produced when we are not thinking about it. Naturally, this automatic response is able to succeed only to the degree that our technique will allow.

I believe learning to sing has much in common with the technique of learning to play golf, tennis, or learning to bowl. There are basic body mechanics that must be learned first. The successful golfer does not begin by concentrating on where he wants the ball to go. He must first learn how to grip the club, how to follow through with his body, proper stance, etc. At first he doesn't even use a ball. The golfer who is not willing to spend time on basic body mechanics is not likely to succeed. If he thinks instead only of where he wants the ball to go and assumes that eventually he will develop good control without any consideration for a basic technique, he is following the same course many voice students are following. The voice student who is completely absorbed in making ""tones"" is dealing with the effect. He may succeed in improving the tone somewhat, but he will probably produce this less offensive tone by inhibiting the tone. The attempt to ""color"" the tone artificially by manipulating the jaw, lips, tongue, etc., invariably causes tension. When the vocal organs attempt to produce what the ear demands [as in “belting”] without first of all establishing correct basic body conditions, [then] tension, unnaturalness and vowel distortion are the result.

When we sing a completely untrained, natural tone, we will undoubtedly produce a good vowel, but a very thin, unmusical sound. Under these conditions, the main fault will surely be a closed throat. This thin tone can easily and readily be changed into a full, rich tone simply by changing the basic body so as to encourage an open throat.

I believe the automatically opened throat is one of the most important conditions for any singer, but the consciously opened throat is one of the most harmful. Dr. Wilmer Bartholomew is one of America's outstanding vocal research scientists. In his book, Acoustics in Music, he states that practically all faults are a result of a closed throat - closed in one way or another- and the remedy for all is an open throat. He further states that every voice teacher should be judged primarily by his ability to induce a completely expanded throat for his students. All reputable vocal scientists seem to agree that the major resonator in the human voice is the pharynx, or throat cavity. If this be true, it behooves the voice teacher to find devices for encouraging the greatest possible expansion.

There are three factors that have a bearing on creating greater space in the throat: a raised soft palate; a forward position of the tongue, (i.e. away from the throat); and a lowered larynx. The naturally forward position of the tongue should be automatic if we do not attempt to open the throat consciously, or do not attempt to use a ""yawning"" suggestion for opening the throat, but will concentrate on purity of vowel. Under these conditions there should be no reason for the tongue to pull back into the throat. The raised soft palate may be encouraged by the thought of making an exclamation of surprise, or by the attitude of astonishment [Richard Miller’s “mild amusement”]. However, I find more and more that as the larynx is encouraged to drop lower in the throat through correct posture and correct breathing, the soft palate automatically moves upward. The larynx and soft palate always tend to move in opposite direction. Since this relationship exists, it is obvious that the low larynx is of basic importance. Dr. Wilhelm Ruth, a Berlin research scientist, recently read a paper for a German scientific society in which he tells of his experiments with many singers. He was trying to determine the behavior of the larynx, moving upward or downward as the singers sang in all parts of their ranges. He used untrained singers, those with a little training, and well-trained professional opera singers. By taking X-ray pictures, he was able to determine the relative positions of the larynx on various pitches. He found that with the untrained and slightly trained singers, the larynx moved upward with each ascending note, while with the best opera singers, the larynx remained low or moved downward with each ascending note. He found that the muscles inside the larynx were functioning under a terrific strain when the larynx was high, whereas the reverse was true when the larynx remained low in the throat.

I believe most voice teachers who are opposed to a low larynx object to it because they know only of the consciously lowered or depressed larynx. I don't know of anything more harmful than a consciously lowered larynx, and I know of nothing more beneficial than the automatically lowered larynx. When singers think of opening the throat consciously, they invariably depress the base of the tongue and push the larynx downward. They are opening the back part of the mouth and closing the lower pharynx just above the larynx. They are deceived by the sense of openness at the back of the mouth; but, in reality, they are closing the part of the throat of greatest importance to the singer. The greatest possible freedom of the throat is experienced by the singer who sings with an automatically lowered larynx, whereas considerable tension in the throat is invariably the result of a high larynx.

After placing so much stress on the automatically lowered larynx, the logical question that arises is: how may one induce a low larynx without conscious manipulation? The answer is: through correct posture and correct action on the part of the muscles of breathing.

I'm currently enrolled in a vocal performance program for opera. I don't have a degree in vocal pedagogy and I'm not a replacement for a voice teacher, but I've been seeing some trends and I'd like to throw out a few ways you might be able to fix them yourselves (or at least improve upon them) by yourself at home. Keep in mind that many of these things are also still issues I have as well- you won't fix all your issues in a day. Singing can be a lot like getting really good at figure skating. Sure, you might be able to do that really complicated move one day- but can you replicate it the next? There's tons of muscle memory that's needed in order to get good consistency in your singing. If your style of singing isn't classical (which it probably isn't. ;) ) it would still probably help you to look through this anyway. Basic singing technique applies to all types of singing. There are stylistic differences in placement of the sound and the amount of vibrato used etc... that differentiates from one style of singing to another. Anyway- ONWARD!

The most common issue is breath support. I know this is mentioned in the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/singing) (as are a few other things I'm going to talk about) but I'd like to expand on what's already posted.

Your breath is the most important thing to your singing. Being connected to your breath is even more vital. Sit on the edge of a chair with your elbows on your knees. Take in a deep breath. Feel the expansion in your lower back? (Didn't know that was something you had to use did ya?) Now exhale with KEEPING the expansion. That's a little more work than most people are used to, but it's that kind of expansion that will give your voice a nice, full and free sound. Breathing is strongly related to posture, but I'll get to that in a minute. Now take in a few deep breaths and exhale with the expansion but engage your lower abdominals. This should feel like you're doing an eternal crunch, and should have more pressure on it the less air you have in your lungs. WHOO! That's a workout. You can also get this effect by doing [short bursts of lip trills](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIqkfbEBEh0) feeling the energy come from your lower abs. Whenever anyone tells you to ""sing from your diaphragm,"" but you have no idea what that means- that's okay. Your diaphragm is actually an involuntary muscle, that simply separates your lungs from your intestines. you can pull down on it to allow more expansion and air into your lungs using your intercostal muscles (muscles that expand/contract the space between your ribs), your lower back muscles and your abdominals. This confused me for a long time, because instead of focusing on control from my abs, I was doing some weird thing where I was trying to control my diaphragm itself, in which case all of my effort was lying too high up in the body. Your lower abs actually do most of the work. Your chest and shoulders should never move because you took a breath. All of the expansion in your lungs should feel as low as possible.

POSTURE! The only difference between sitting posture and standing posture is the use of your legs. If you're standing, your feet should be about shoulder width apart with one slightly in front of the other. Knees loose with your pelvis tucked under. You should be able to shift your weight and use your thighs with ease. If you're sitting, sit at the EDGE of a chair or on a stool. Don't use the back of the chair. A trick to having better posture is to have one leg tucked under the chair/stool while the other one is out making a 90 degree angle. From either of these two positions, your core is the most important part. ""Sitting/standing Tall"" is how most voice teachers go about explaining this, but here's the nitty gritty details. Your lower ribcage should feel expanded, your shoulders back. You should feel like at any given moment you'll be asked to chest bump a football player- that's how expanded your chest should be. Not tense! just expanded. Don't over extend your shoulders back either- that can be tricky too. Your neck should remain loose, but as though you were a marionette, and someone was pulling an invisible string towards the ceiling (essentially making your chin parallel to the ground). I cannot stress enough that this should all be relatively relaxed- just controlled. Tension is never a good thing.

Vocal freedom is *vital* to a singer. If your voice hurts after a song or two, you're doing it wrong. You should not feel any pressure on your larynx- it should all sound and feel free. Your soft pallet should be raised, but not the point of an extreme yawn. Just relaxed and up. Control your dynamics and your pitch with your breath support, not by trying to manipulate your voice box. If you try to sing from your throat rather than from your gut, you're risking giving yourself vocal nodes (calluses on  your chords. You never sound the same again, even if you get them removed), or you can actually paralyze a chord (this JUST happened to a colleague of mine) which takes an immense amount of therapy to fix. The voice is like a pretty sounding whoopee cushion. All of the work comes from the exhalation of air- and the vocal chords just do what the air tells them to do. A whoopee cushion doesn't make sound because you manually slap the flaps together, it makes a sound because there's a stream of air. Your voice is similar. Large culprits of ""singing from your throat"" tend to be musical theatre people who do a lot of belting. There's nothing wrong with belting, I do it on occasion myself- but you have GOT to use the right technique. Know why Idina Menzel had to take a long break? Too much improper belting in Wicked. You can seriously hurt yourself if you sing from the throat guys- I can't stress it enough. Of course, don't confuse singing from your throat with vocal fatigue. Vocal fatigue is like running a marathon and being tired because your muscles have been working for a while and you need to take a break (singing while you have fatigue can damage you as well, but so long as you have proper technique you'll be fine so long as you take a few hours to break. Plenty of professionals get vocal fatigue, especially after long and tiring operas. It's normal and fine, just don't ever over do it). Singing from your throat is like running a marathon only hitting yourself with a hammer in the thighs at every step.

Common with musical theatre and pop/rock singing is nasality. You don't want this. It's not going to hurt you like singing from your throat, but it is going to make you less pleasant to listen to and your sound won't travel as far, so you'll be harder to hear. You can check to see if you're ever singing nasally simply by pinching your nose. If you have nasality issues, keep pinching your nose while you sing to help yourself find a placement that is more desirable. 

RESONANCE! Resonance, or rather, where you place your sound, is tricky and it doesn't work the same for everyone. Some people need more mouth resonance, others more mask, and others more chest. Mouth resonance is what projects your sound and makes it easy to hear. You DON'T have to sing at your loudest at all times, just use mouth resonance. It's easier on your chords and the audience will be able to hear you better than if you were shout-singing. Mask resonance is placed in the mask of the face (around where your sinus cavities are. Don't confuse this with singing through your nose though. They are two different things). Mask resonance will bring warmth to your voice. Many people try to accomplish warmth by swallowing their sound and keeping it in the back of their throat. This will only sound good to you- and be barely audible from an audience. Bring your sound forward and use mask resonance to warm your tone. Chest resonance makes your low notes audible. I'm sure most of you have felt chest resonance before, as it's the easiest one to obtain. As you're in your lower register, feel the vibrations coming out of your sternum. TADA! CHEST RESONANCE. The trick is that you can never JUST use chest resonance. There must always be a mix of all three resonances. Where you are in your vocal range determines what mixture you should use. The higher you get, the more mask resonance you should use. The lower you get, the more chest. Mouth resonance should ALWAYS be a thing, and all three should always be used.

Many singers have intonation or rhythm issues. For rhythm- practice with a metronome. You can find online metronomes with an easy google search. For intonation issues you need to determine whether or not you're hearing the right pitch or if there's a flaw in your technique. Many singers HEAR the right pitch in their head but the wrong one comes out because their technique needs work. Most of the time it's breath support or placement issues. Record and listen to yourself and be honest with yourself. Did you hit that right? Practice intonation by singing chromatic scales and intervals. There are plenty of online resources that can teach you how to do that as well.

Don't EVER try to sound older than you are or try to manipulate your sound so you can sound like someone else (at least, not without proper technique for the latter. Even then, don't compromise technique in order to sound like someone else). It ends up sounding funky to the audience and disingenuine. The best part about the vocal instrument is that it DOESN'T sound like anyone elses. Own your voice and be proud of it. Want to do a cover of Johnny Cash but sound nothing like him? Do the cover anyway, but do it YOUR way, not his way. There will be songs you can't do, or at least can't do as well as you'd like. It's okay- there's TONS of music out there that you CAN do, or you can try changing the key it's sung in.",,False,,t5_2rlcx,1352561553.0,,star,True,t3_x0m0t,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/x0m0t/some_common_vocal_problems_and_new_ways_to_think/,

They've all had vocal nodes. Just because someone is making a lot of money and are considered professionals doesn't mean they have or use the proper technique. Hell, Mariah WAS professionally trained- her mom sang opera. Sometimes all it takes is forgetting technique enough times  to end up hurting yourself.

There's a right way to do pretty much anything you want- but you have to be comfortable doing it with your voice, not trying to be someone elses. Your belting/screaming/shouting/low notes/high notes aren't going to sound like anyone elses.

Find yourself a good teacher and you can accomplish pretty mich anything. :)

For those interested, I've compiled a list of people who've at one point or another had nodes.

Get the picture? Even classical pros get 'em. Every style of singer under the sun has had a few cases of nodules.

1363642618.0,39,self.singing,1ajt7a,Recording FAQ,45,6,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/1ajt7a/recording_faq/,"In the past month or so, I've seen a ton questions about beginner recording (on this forum and others).  I don't know if it's music students needing to build a portfolio for the summer or what, but rather than repeat myself over and over, I thought I'd provide a quick primer.  This is geared for vocal recording, with a few asides for more general practices.

**The signal path**

To get from physical sound to an audio file on your computer, there are three pieces of equipment:

1) A microphone -- Converts the physical sound wave into an analog electrical signal.  This signal is incredibly weak, it is the electricity generated by air molecules bumping into the microphone's diaphragm.  This low level signal is called *mic level*.  
2) A preamplifier (a.k.a. preamp) -- Amplifies the mic level signal to *line level*, the standard operating level at which most processing happens.  
3) An audio interface -- Converts the analog line level signal to a digital signal, and connects to the computer via USB or Firewire as an audio input/output device that recording software can recognize.

Fortunately, you don't need to buy three things.  Most audio interfaces will have preamps built in, and USB mics (such as the Blue Snowball and Blue Yeti) are all three in one.  USB mics are very convenient for recording with only one mic, but aren't expandable if you want to use multiple mics--you can't plug two USB mics into two USB ports and use both of them at the same time.

**Recording software**

Audacity is free and perfectly fine for basic recording and editing.  If all you want to do is record something, trim off the ends, and fix some levels, it will be fine.  If you need too much more than that though, I would recommend Reaper instead.

Pro Tools is the industry standard.  If you're thinking about going into music production professionally, it wouldn't hurt to learn now.  However, there is no difference in audio quality between different programs, it's just a matter of ease of use.  There's some elitism out there regarding DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations), don't let anyone convince you that your recordings are inferior just because you used Audacity instead of Pro Tools.

**Choosing a microphone**

The two most common types of microphones are *dynamic* and *condenser* microphones.  I won't get into the technical details, but basically, condenser mics are more sensitive than dynamics, and are preferred for good quality recordings.  That's not to say that all condensers are better than all dynamics--a high-quality dynamic will be better than a cheapo condenser--but all else being equal, the condenser is going to provide better audio quality.

So why do dynamic mics exist?  Well, in certain situations the lack of sensitivity makes audio engineering much easier.  Dynamics handle loud sources like drums, speaker cabinets, brass instruments, and screaming vocals with less tweaking needed, and they don't feed back as easily.  They're also much sturdier and don't require power (see the last paragraph of this section).  For these reasons, they're commonly used for live audio reinforcement, but these factors aren't benefits when recording.

There's also the question of diaphragm size: large diaphragm or small diaphragm.  Each has applications that they are more or less suited for, but large diaphragm mics are usable almost anywhere and are preferred for vocals.

So, in short, get a large diaphragm condenser for vocals.  The Rode NT1-A is a great mic to start with, and it even comes with some handy accessories.

There's one last thing to know about condensers: they require power.  Some mics can take a battery (and USB mics are usually powered via USB), but usually they are powered via *phantom power*, where the preamp/interface/mixer that you're plugging it into supplies a voltage back through the cable.  So if you're using a condenser, you need to make sure that your interface can supply phantom power.  Almost all can, just make sure to check.  If you're using any other kind of microphone, turn it off.  Dynamics shouldn't be hurt by it, but other kinds of mics could be.  Also, plug the microphone in before turning on phantom power, and turn off phantom power (and give it a few seconds to discharge) before unplugging the mic.

**Quick tips for getting quality recordings**

First of all, this has to be said: the first rule of recording is that the quality of the recording is limited by the quality of the source.  ""Garbage in, garbage out"" as they say.  Don't try to fix bad recordings with processing, as long as rerecording is an option.

Second of all, the acoustics of the room make a huge difference, and matter as much as (if not more than) the equipment you're using.  You want to record in a room that has as little reverberation as possible.  If your ears aren't tuned to hear it, then record yourself clapping and look at the waveform--if there's a tail, that's reverb.  Things to avoid are hard surfaces, parallel walls, and square rooms.  Your kitchen and bathroom are the worst possible places (not that you would record there, just as an example).  A carpeted, non-square bedroom without large patches of bare wall will probably be fine.  A walk-in closet with lots of hanging clothes and almost no visible walls will probably be great--lots of hobbyists record in their closets.  Also, this probably goes without saying, but watch out for background noise, for example from air conditioning.  Our ears tune it out after a while, but it'll be there loud and clear in a recording.

Proper mic technique is also critical.  You need to stay in the same spot the whole time.  Moving around will cause the relative volume to change, as well as affect the frequency spectrum due to the *proximity effect*.  Stay frozen, and typically be close to the mic.  Use a pop filter to keep plosives out of the mic.

When listening to a recording, the same room acoustics apply.  You also need to use decent speakers--you don't need to spend a fortune, but your laptop speakers just aren't going to cut it.  Headphones (of decent quality, not the ear buds that came with your iPod) are probably okay.  In the pro realm you don't want to monitor using headphones, but it will be okay for casual use.

There is so much positive energy in here and enthusiasm about singing that it fills me with happiness. I fear, however, that the majority of you use this subreddit in lieu of a good teacher. I think promoting good discussion involving technique and music is excellent and feedback can be useful at times.

But listen up, because amongst everything I have said on this subreddit, this is probably the most important and useful advice I will give.

Find a good voice teacher and do good work with them. Nothing *anyone* says on this thread, in books, on youtube, or anywhere, no matter how qualified they are, can replace the technique that a well qualified and trained teacher can give you. They hear you, see you, and work with you on a regular basis. They know your likes and dislikes, your goals and aspirations. *Nothing* can replace that. 

I know voice lessons can be expensive and time consuming, but know that if you really want to improve your singing, nothing can replace that. I wrote an article that can be found in the FAQ (or [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/15mmgl/how_to_find_a_good_voice_teacher/)) that will hopefully help you find a good teacher. And as always, if you have any questions or concerns, or if you want help as to where to find a good teacher in your area, I am happy to help. 

Now, with this being said, I recognize that there are situations where voice lessons seem unattainable or unaffordable. Hopefully some of these solutions will be helpful to you.

* For people who live in very small or rural communities, I have two recommendations. First, I would check your local schools to see if any of the music teachers give private lessons. Many times even high school choir directors will teach lessons, and they should be well-equipped enough to teach the foundations of singing (posture, breathing, etc). Second, I would find the most populous area near you and search for teachers with my suggestions in the FAQ, and then also search if any of the teachers you find do house visits. Many teachers will teach in the students' home instead of their own studio. The downside with this is that it may cost a bit more.

* Cost is probably the main concern of every singer, or even every musician, who wishes to take lessons. They add up and unfortunately not everyone can afford it. Many teachers, however, are very understanding of this and will work with you on this. Some teachers will offer discounts to students for referring a friend. Others may recommend spacing out your lessons every two weeks instead of every week and perhaps invite you to sit in on other (willing) student's lessons to supplement your study of technique. I have even heard of teachers who will accept payment in other forms, such as helping them with chores or babysitting their kids, or something of the like. The key is to be open and honest about your financial concerns and to be flexible yet fair to yourself and the teacher.

I know this has been stated numerous times in various threads, but I felt it deserved its own post. Best of luck to you in your search and your singing Singit! You truly are all amazing.

Edit: The concern of how to find a teacher in remote areas has been addressed, so I added finding a teacher under difficult circumstances. Please note that I, by no means, think this subreddit is unhelpful. I just think that it should be used as a supplement to a music education rather than the main source, much in the same way that vitamins should be taken in supplement to a balanced diet.

I went to one yesterday and hung out for 2 hours before I got on stage. The whole time, people are just chatting, drinking, hanging out and not really listening. I get on stage and it feels like nobody is even paying attention, everyone is talking and not even looking at the stage.

I've really just been trying to force myself out of my shell lately and just get up and do it, so I just kind of tranced out and did my thing (I usually stare at the microphone and don't look at people). I fucked up the guitar part a couple of times, but just made myself push through and finish. When I finished my second song, I looked up and the entire room had gone dead silent and everyone was staring at me. The whole room, at least half were musicians stood up and started cheering and yelling. I nervously played two more songs, and had everyone's full attention. I got a bit nervous and messed up on the guitar a few more times and forgot some lyrics, but I just kept going. I forgot a line for a verse, but I just repeated a line from another verse and nobody noticed since nobody had heard the song before. Still, after every song everyone cheered their heads off. None of the musicians before me got that kind of reaction.

I didn't feel like I did great, but afterwards EVERYONE came up and and complimented my vocals and said what an amazing voice I had. I got a bunch of questions on how long I've been performing and a lot of shock when I said I'd been doing open mics for 2 weeks.

I'm also seeing a lot of misinformation floating around so I'd like to clear some things up.",36,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/11d0ix/ive_noticed_a_lot_of_people_asking_about/,"I've posted this in a few singing threads. I've noticed a lot of people explaining about what I hear is called ""false chord"" screaming which (just by the title) seems to be misleading you into thinking that you're not using your speaking/singing voice to scream. I know two ways of screaming, one is for performance, and one is for when I'm pissed off at something, and as far as I've been told there are **only** two sets of vocal folds that we all have. Considering the type of scream I use for performance is called ""fry screaming"" and doesn't hurt my speaking/singing voice at all I'm going to assume that ""false chord"" is using the other which is your SPEAKING VOICE. It seems to me from the youtube tutorials that false chord is simply pushing your voice until it naturally cracks. If you want to rush way too much air into your throat, slam your vocal folds together, and scream like you're getting boiled alive it's **GOING TO MESS YOUR VOICE UP.** It's less consistent, it's less gritty, and it's **very** damaging. That being said, yes, false chord does have undertones that fry screaming does not, yes it has a lower range if you're into growling for death metal bands. 

**DO NOT DO THIS IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON SCREAMING CONSISTENTLY!**

[This is my music](http://soundcloud.com/oceanfloorsmusic/binary-star-re-release), it's me screaming/singing as well as all the instruments. It is a sloppy example, but example enough. The first thing you have to accept is that once you learn how to do it properly it's going to take some time/practice to get any sort of balls behind it. It starts with just a weak, creaky noise that almost sounds like marge simpsons voice in the back of your throat. What you want to stay far away from is using your SPEAKING VOICE to SCREAM. Screaming for performance is NOTHING like screaming when you're pissed off. It's a completely different spot in your throat producing the ""crackle"" if you're doing it right. I see a lot of people don't do their research and just yell as loud as they can to scream and produce ""crackle"". This is NOT what professionals or anyone who wants to be able to tour for more than 3 nights a month do. Guitars use distortion, drummers use triggers, and bassists use fuzz. You should too. In a live setting, you should put some light gain on your voice to make it smoother. If you're in a studio setting they will force you to, because it's as rudimentary for sounding good as compression on drums and so on. Look up ""fry screaming"" or ""The zen of screaming"" on youtube. Fry screaming is like learning to crawl before you can walk, but eventually you want to work up to what a lot of people have called a ""power fry"". It's basically putting a light monotone yell WITH VERY LITTLE PRESSURE ON YOUR YELL behind the noise or ""crackle"" of fry screaming to give the effect that you're actually screaming loud. The one thing you're going to have deal with is that it will not be loud at first, and it doesn't need to be. Coming from someone who has screaming the wrong way for years and fixed myself over the last 2 years, it is WORTH THE CHANGE! I have a hundred times more air, can hold screams longer, can make more variation in my screaming i.e. different pitches and timbres. Once you master it you can start incorporating a ""mix"" of it into your singing to add ""grit"" or feeling. Add this to your ""mix"" of head and chest voice, and the sky is the limit. I hope you have good fortune with it. 

TL/DR: Stop yelling as loud as you can to scream unless you only want to be able to do it for five minutes a month. You're doing it wrong, and hurting yourself and your singing voice.

It doesn't just go to opera singers either though that's what the article discusses.

It's been said a million and a half times on this forum that your voice will change and not fully settle until your mid to late 20s (if you're a light voiced girl, possibly a little sooner, but not by much).

That's when you can expect your voice type (alto, mezzo, soprano, tenor, baritone, bass) to settle. That's not necessarily when you're at full vocal maturity. Your voice is still super fragile until your 30s. Be conscious of what you're singing and if it's good for you. Just because it doesn't hurt doesn't mean you're not doing a lot of wear and tear that you might not bounce back from. 

At the bottom of the article, child operatic stars are addressed. Singing Puccini at the age of 10 is REALLY early. Think of it this way. You have a tiny, tiny rubber band. This rubber band grows and strengthens with years, but when it's young it's very tiny and very tight and sproingy. Now, take that rubber band and stretch it and mold it until it can do something it shouldn't be able to do for another 10+ years. As that rubber band grows, it will have lost all of its taught and be *too* big and *too* loose to do anything worthwhile. It's basically a piece of string. It's lost all elasticity because it was worn out when it was small.

I hope that makes sense to someone other than me - but that's basically it. If you're too young you'll stretch yourself too far too soon.

Be careful about the repertoire you choose. I always think you should sing something you love, but there's a lot of music out there. There's no real reason for a 17 y/o to be belting out Defying Gravity every day. Just like there are bigger operatic roles that aren't touched by singers till they're 45, there are bigger musical/pop/rock roles that are considered hazardous to the young singers voice.

It's frustrating to be told to wait until you're older to tackle that huge Les Mis role, but I promise not only will it sound better because you'll be more experienced with your technique - it'll feel better because you won't be stretching your limits.",,False,,t5_2rlcx,False,,star,True,t3_1ih4l7,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/1ih4l7/about_age_and_your_voice/,

In this post, I hope to give some basic information about each but with some disclaimers. Know first of all that I am a fellow singer and pedagogue, not a doctor, speech pathologist, or other medical voice professional and this information should not override that of a medical professional. You should also know though that most voice disorders or vocal health problems *are treatable* and rarely create permanent damage. 

First vocal health.

Some of this may seem very basic, but that does not mean it is any less important.

1. Water, water, water! According to the Mayo Clinic, the average male should take in 3 liters (13 cups) a day and the average woman should have 2.2 (9 cups) a day. This of course varies according to the amount of physical activity you do, but as singers the average is a must. You should know though that it takes 24 hours for the water you take in to hydrate the vocal folds, so if you have a big concert tomorrow, be sure to hydrate today. Drinking water while practicing helps keep your mouth from becoming too dry, but does little to affect the vocal folds in the moment.

2. Sleep. I know this one is hard to do with busy schedules and lives, but physical fatigue can affect your singing just as much as bad technique. 

3. Use a healthy speaking voice. So many singers are taught great technique when it comes to singing, yet do not transfer that knowledge to their speaking voice. Our instruments come with us everywhere, and the average person, including singers, use their speaking voice much more than their singing voice. Be sure to not shout or scream and to use good breath support for your speaking voice like you would for your singing voice. 

4. Maintain a balanced diet. Not only is this important for your overall physical health but many singers suffer from acid reflux which can greatly affect the vocal folds (more on this in the disorders section).

5. Don't smoke! This is a must. Smoking can cause both lung and laryngeal cancer as well as increase the risk of any of the below disorders. Also drink alcohol and coffee minimally, if at all, as they can seriously dry the vocal folds.

6. Exercise. Singing can require just as much stamina as any sport, so maintaining physical health is just as important for singers as it can be for athletes. 

7. And of course, good technique! Be sure to warm up your voice before you sing every day with warm ups your teacher gives you. It’s just like an athlete stretching his or her muscles before a big game, so don’t underestimate the power of a good warm up!


Voice disorders.

There are more voice disorders than those listed here, but I have attempted to condense this list to various health concerns that can directly affect singers. None of these pathologies are major risks to your overall health. For more information on these or any other problems, please refer to www.voicemedicine.com

These first three pathologies all are very similar and can be diagnosed by an ENT, preferably one that specializes in the vocal folds, with a laryngoscope. This is a small camera that is inserted through the nose and goes down through the pharynx to see the vocal folds in action. The doctor will then have you do a series of vocal exercises to see and hear how the folds function.

1. Nodules: This is probably the most common disorder amongst singers yet the one that causes the most concern. It should first be known that nodules are *not* mainly caused by poor technique (though this can be a factor) but instead by overuse, misuse, or abuse of the speaking voice. Nodules are like callouses on the vocal folds that create slight bilateral lumps, usually in the center of the folds. They can cause raspiness and / or ariness in both the singing and speaking voice and generally are not felt. Treatment involves vocal therapy administered by a speech pathologist and ideally a singing voice specialist as well. Complete vocal rest is not required or even recommended.  Know though that nodules are really only a problem when they are symptomatic. Many singers may have nodules without knowing it and as long as it does not inhibit their singing, they really are not a problem.

2. Polyps: Polyps are like vocal blisters and are caused by some sort of phonotrauma. Generally a polyp will occur on only one vocal fold and look like a mass in the middle of the fold. Again, they are painless yet can cause raspiness or ariness in the voice. Sometimes they can be felt as an obstruction to the vocal folds and create the sensation of needing to clear your throat. Polyps can also be a precursor to a vocal hemorrhage, which can be felt. Treatment does require surgery for their removal as they will not diminish by therapy, but therapy is necessary during the recovery period to prevent a reoccurrence. 

3. Cysts: Cysts are fluid-filled sacs that appear on the vocal fold for unknown reasons. They generally appear in the middle of the fold, suggesting that phonotrauma may be a cause of their formation, but doctors are not sure about that. They cause painless hoarseness and can cause irregular vocal fold closure. Cysts are extremely similar to polyps and can easily be mistaken for such. Cysts also generally require surgery, though depending on its placement and your symptoms, surgery may not be necessary.

4. Hemorrhage: Generally caused by phonotrauma, a hemorrhage is a bleed in the vocal fold. Most people who have experienced a hemorrhage say they feel it immediately as a sort of pop, and they experience raspiness in their sound almost immediately afterwards. This is the *only* voice concern that requires *complete* vocal rest for a period of time. Be sure to see a doctor if you suspect a hemorrhage, but know that the immediate fix is complete vocal rest. Depending on how frequently it occurs or what caused it, voice therapy may be required.

5. Laryngitis: It is widely, yet falsely, believed that laryngitis is whenever you lose your voice. While this is a common symptom of  laryngitis, it is actually defined as the inflammation of the vocal folds for any reason, though it is generally a virus. It is sort of a nonspecific term but is usually treated like other viruses. Voice rest is recommended along with plenty of fluids. If the hoarseness continues for more than 2-3 weeks, this is the time to seek out a medical professional.

6. Acid Reflux: This is not a voice disorder so much as a condition that can affect the vocal folds greatly. It also is relatively common in singers due to our greater diaphragmatic use and how that tends to push more stomach acids through our trachea. More often than not reflux is silent, but sometimes people can experience heartburn, halitosis, or difficulty using their voice effectively in the morning. There is no cure for reflux but it can be managed through a less acidic diet, especially in the evening and not eating or drinking at least 3 hours before you go to bed. You can also lift the head of your bed (your whole bed, not just your pillows) to keep acid from rising. 

7. Vocal Cord Dysfunction: A condition that exhibits similar symptoms as asthma, this is where the vocal folds have episodes that cause them to close upon inhalation. This inhibits the person's ability to breathe normally and create hoarseness. Treatment can depend on the cause, which can be a number of things including stress, reflux, and virus. Most often though treatment involves voice therapy. 

8. Vocal Fold Paralysis: This is where one (or both) of the vocal folds become immobile due to damage in its main nerve. Paralysis is twice as likely in the left fold than in the right, and their causes are slightly different. Both are most often caused due to complications from surgery near the nerve, which runs down the neck and through the chest. Symptoms include hoarseness, breathiness, difficultly breathing, and feeling the need to swallow. Occasionally voice paralysis will resolve on its own, but most often treatment involves therapy to learn how to utilize your voice to the best of its ability. 

This should cover the basics of what you would want or need to know. If you have any more questions or concerns or addendums, feel free to say so! I can also recommend more resources, and I am also happy to answer personal questions about nodules as I’ve had them myself, or about voice therapy. If you have concerns about your own vocal health, research your local ENTs and make an appointment. Even if you feel fine and can afford it, a visit to the doctor can be good to establish a relationship and to have a baseline for what your vocal folds should look like and act. Stay healthy Singit!

There have been a lot of good answers to that question on this sub for a while now, but I don't think there's ever been an actual discussion (other than the ""How to Find a Good Teacher"" article, which is a great one in the FAQ) as to **why** a good teacher is a good idea. 

So, here are my thoughts on the matter (basically a copy-paste of my answer to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/1jos1j/with_the_help_of_the_internet_ive_taught_myself/) thread). Feel free to add or question, and let's get a discussion going!

There are a few reasons as to why having a good voice teacher is important, and are why teaching yourself through other means is potentially harmful. The two most important reasons are as follows are at the top of the list.

* You can't properly hear yourself. Really! You can't! What you hear and what the audience hears are two different things. Ever listen to a recording of yourself and go ""Hey! That's not what I sound like at all!""? That's exactly what I'm talking about. Your ears are placed right above your vocal folds (if you're standing right) so you hear your sound before it's even made it out of your mouth. The audience hears everything that comes out of the megaphone that is your mouth. They are two different sounds, and it's really, really challenging to hear yourself correctly. Even through recording and playing it back to yourself (which is the best way to go if you have to) you won't necessarily know what's going on or how to fix it (see point two). A teacher will be able to give you immediate feedback on how you *actually* sound, *and* have multiple ways to fix any problems (if they're a good teacher, they can always come up with at least three different ways to solve a problem. At least.)

* While the basic mechanics of singing is the same for everyone, most of it is internal work that you can't physically see unless you've become ultra trained to notice the tiniest shiver to hearing the tiniest strain. Those tiny things can be big problems. Especially as a younger singer your body and voice will be more forgiving of poor habits than as you age. It's important to learn good technique and keep it - because that's how people keep singing into their 50s. To continue the thought of ""singing is essentially the same for everyone,"" the emphasis here is on *essentially.* What makes that word so important, is that just because the body is doing the same thing doesn't mean you feel the same sensations as someone else, or are even a similar learner. It's like drugs. Sure, penicillin will work for someone, but for other people it causes mad crazy reactions - but the penicillin will still work just fine. *Because every persons body is different, everyone has a different way they must attack technique.* It's not like a violin, or a guitar, or weights. While yes, there are lower and higher grades of all of those things, they all still use the same body motions to do, and will create the same sound if you exactly replicate what someone else is doing. Unfortunately, if I tried to say, focus on resonating through my hard palate (which works for some people), I'll get a very flat outcome of my pitch, simply because my head is not that other persons head, and my sinuses and resonators will simply not react in the same way as theirs. Some people feel their breath come from their lower back, others their lower abs, some of them their lower ribs. Some people feel their resonators in their forehead, others in the bridge of their nose, others in their cheeks, others in their hard palate. Some people hear mush when they do a coloratura passage, others hear clean notes. There's just too many variables that are specific to you and your voice that taking tutorials online will just not address your specific needs. Everyone sings with a different instrument. That would be like asking a size 2 girl and a size 12 girl to both fit in the average sized 6 dress. Not gonna happen - they both need dresses tailored to not only their dress size, but their body shape. What works for a thin size 2 is not going to work for someone that's a bit more curvy.

* Because you can't see or hear yourself, you have to work off of feeling. But since you're different, no one thing can explain what it feels like for everyone. You won't have the same feeling of sensations, because there aren't as many nerve endings in there. **Because of this, it is easy to cause damage to yourself.** What you may consider just being vocally tired *could actually result in nodes.* Everyone's body is different, so is everyone's pain tolerance. Hell, there are singers that have never felt any pain or discomfort in their voice, just a mild sense of pressure, and they wind up with vocal health problems because they never thought it was a big deal. The depth of knowledge teachers have will help you avoid this by leaps and bounds. They can sense vocal damage a mile away (if they're good. Remember, teachers are people too, and there are bad ones. There's an article in the FAQ about how to find a good teacher, and what to look for.) If the other two reasons aren't reason enough, this one is.

* Since singing is such an inexact science, new research comes out all the time as to how proper technique works. This is why reading books and other source material are great! But again, you have to be wary of them until they've proven right to you *because* new information comes out all the time. A good teacher will remain up to date on what is and isn't good for the voice, so you won't have to wade through all of the information yourself. It's WONDERFUL to have that kind of a guide.

* Having a teacher to teach you technique will probably want you to start classically. **DON'T LET THIS TURN YOU OFF FROM SINGING.** The reason why classical tone has been around so long is because it's what the voice naturally sounds like free of tension and with proper breath support. It is important for you to have a teacher that will relate all of this to the style of singing you want to do, and if you find a teacher that will skip this step and still be healthy to you, more power to it! Classical singing is just the blank slate. All other styles have derived from this technique, and from here you can learn to sing any style healthily with minor tweaks to your technique (usually with resonance and vibrato). *You just have to know what tweaks are healthy to make and which ones aren't, and it's very hard for you to do that by yourself because singing is so inexact.* So definitely find a teacher that will meet you with your goals and will always relate everything back to what you want to do. Just don't be surprised if they throw in an art song or two to help you out. Learning technique adds more tools to your voice. The more you understand technique the more you can do. It's like taking a predominantly acrylics painter and then teaching them how to use watercolors, charcoal, pencil etc... You as the artist will still choose what tools you do and don't use, but your knowledge of the tools will make your base passion stronger. I promise.

This isn't to say that self-teach videos and books are worthless. I encourage singers to be a sponge, because you never know what'll work and what won't work. Just, until something has proven to work for you (which, remember, you probably can't be a perfect judge of), take it with a grain of salt. All of it. Singing is an inexact science, where weightlifting is a lot more straightforward. Singing has a lot of trial and error, where a lot of weightlifting is just knowing your boundaries, and knowing how to properly lift each different kind of weight. In singing, it's challenging to even know how to figure out your boundaries. You can learn a lot, just *be careful.* It comes with risks, and healing a voice (a fragile piece of tissue) is not as easy as healing anything else. It's like paper, once it's ripped there's just no putting it back together the same way ever again. I've learned plenty from videos and reading, but I've also found a lot of crap. I've also learned plenty from teachers, but I've also had plenty of crap teachers. I've been down the road to vocal damage (luckily, as I said earlier, when you're young you can bounce back a bit better), and I've been on the road to recovery. I've tried self-teaching, and I'm never going back. There really is just no replacement for a good teacher(s).

**TL;DR** The reason it's not like weightlifting is because in weightlifting all the weights are the same, and have the same physical motion. Now, imagine that the basic arm structure for every single person was different. Some elbows bent in, some people didn't have elbows, some had 10 fingers, others had less or more, some had fingers on the tops or in the palms of their hands. All of a sudden, when everyones arms are different, accomplishing the same task of lifting a weight becomes very different for everyone and no one blanket instructional video will be able to cover all the differences. That's what you're looking at - only all of your differences are internal so you can't even see them to group them into different vids.",,False,,t5_2rlcx,1375709581.0,,star,True,t3_1jq7m1,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/1jq7m1/why_a_teacher_is_a_good_idea/,

A lot of people during long breaks get lazy. I'll be honest and say that sometimes I veg out for a days at a time and just eat, sleep, play some games and some music. Here is something I've noticed after being mostly socially inactive for the past couple months...

It effects my voice a lot. This is not because of singing less, in fact, I am actually singing the same amount if not more since I have more time to record, etc. So why does my voice feel fatigued after only singing for 40 minutes? It's because I'm not TALKING. 

Think of it like if you sit around on the couch all the time for a week straight, and then you run a mile. You get tired out right? If you are walking around all day for a week, you could probably run that mile pretty easy right?

So here's what I'm getting at. Make sure you are talking/humming/whatever during the day. Call your friends, whatever works for you, but don't jump right in to singing when you've had your mouth shut for awhile.

1337660331.0,20,self.singing,tyqyp,Musical theater audition guide,23,3,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/tyqyp/musical_theater_audition_guide/,"Hello everyone,

I've done a bunch of student and community musical theater around the Boston area as a music director and audition accompanist, and I've seen a lot of young auditionees get thrown by the audition process and ultimately underrepresent themselves.  Now that I'm about to go into auditions for one of my favorite shows (an amateur production, as the music director), I felt like collecting my thoughts on auditioning--who knows, maybe someone who auditions for me will read this and be a little more confident!  But seriously, I really just want everyone to do well.

**Note:** Not every audition process is the same, even within the same organization.  Still, there are some core things that should be consistent at pretty much all auditions at all levels.  Just take this advice a little cautiously, and of course throw it out the window if it doesn't seem applicable for your audition.


**What should I sing for my audition?**

Most auditions at the student/amateur level will accept pretty much any audition song.  Either they will want just one excerpt, or two contrasting ones.  If they want just one, then you need to pick something that shows off your quality of voice very succinctly, so avoid anything too fast like an Arthur Sullivan patter song or a quick Sondheim tongue-twister.  Don't shy away from a slower ballad if it works well for you.  If they ask for two, that actually makes things easier.  Sure, it's a little more prep work, but it actually gives you a lot more leeway with the directors.  As a music director, I typically only ask for one, but the few times that the stage director has asked me to request two, I've been happy to get just one good one, so when someone actually gives me two decent performances it makes them really stand out to me.  If that sounds like a laughable, shameful amateur circus, don't be fooled.  Joanna Gleason only prepared one song (when two were requested) when she auditioned for *Into The Woods*, and [we all know how that turned out](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/41/TonyAward.jpg).

As for what to pick?  That depends hugely on your voice quality, voice type, energy level, and even your appearance, so it's impossible to give a good answer in a general guide like this.  Avoid anything with nauseating subject matter, with excessive spoken lines in the middle, or which relies on specific tricks to pull off (e.g., *Confrontation* from *Jekyll &amp; Hyde*).  Something that allows you to show off characterization is good, but something that requires you to be a certain character is bad.  For the student and amateur community levels, it's perfectly reasonable (and I would say advantageous to you) to just have one standard audition song that you use for everything.  I suggest avoiding singing anything from the show you're auditioning for, unless it's your standard audition song and you can really nail it, or if that's what's requested of course.  The problem with singing from the show is that if they don't like your style, it's going to sour their impression of you for that part, and if you don't sing it extremely well, then you look absolutely terrible for that part.

Just pick a nice, pretty song that you like and that fits your range and accentuates your good qualities.  If you're a low voice, sing something that shows off how rich, mellow, or powerful you can be down low.  If you have a higher voice, try to show the extent of your range.  Don't be afraid that your piece seems too easy--it's much better to sing an easier song really well than to struggle a bit with a harder song.  I never think less of an auditioner for using an easy song.  And it will help your confidence.

Avoid the most popular songs from the most popular recent shows, because lots of people do them and the directors will probably be sick of hearing them.  I seriously heard 3/4 of the songs from *Wicked* at a recent round of auditions.  Shit gets old fast.  And God help you if you choose something from *Rent*.

One last thing to consider--if the group is volunteer, that means they're not paying their accompanist, and that means that you don't know what you're going to get in terms of quality.  They will probably range from terrible to barely acceptable.  With that in mind, don't pick a song that's difficult to sight-read, or you may find yourself having to sing on top of a lot of wrong notes.  If you don't play piano, run it past someone who does.  If a competent pianist struggles to play it, strongly consider picking something else.  Simple keys are great.  Sondheim is generally to be avoided, although there are some easy Sondheim songs out there.


**What should I do if I mess up?**

Just keep going.  I know, easier said than done, but think about our perspective: We want you to do well, because every good auditionee is another good person in our show.  We know that audition songs are usually woefully underrehearsed, so we won't think you're a terrible singer for making a mistake.  We don't care if you have to use the sheet music--in fact, we would rather you use it than try to sing it from memory and get flustered.  If there's a really bad mistake that throws you off, feel free to quickly acknowledge the mistake and take a second to get back on track.  Just don't be annoyingly apologetic, and we'll generally be sympathetic to anything going wrong.

The directors will also understand that you're probably nervous.  It takes a lot of guts to go in front of a group of people who are judging you, and sing something that's probably not very well rehearsed all by yourself.  Just because you're nervous in auditions won't make us assume that you'll get stage fright in performances--that's a totally different situation.  I've done about 2 dozen shows with first time actors, and I've never had a case where someone was so nervous for a performance that they couldn't perform.  I'm seriously not worried about that.


**What should I audition for?  Should I audition for a specific role, or say I'm willing to play anything?**

Be honest.  If you really want a particular part, say so!  Nobody's going to assume that that means you're a stuck-up prima donna with a sense of entitlement.  In fact, we think it shows good self-confidence.  There will also usually be a spot on the audition form where they ask if you would be willing to take another role or be in the ensemble, so there's definitely room to explain your feelings fully.  If it's not on the form, they will probably ask in person, or just assume that you'd consider other parts.  Short of the professional level, nobody is going to assume that you're only interested in one role and that you'd reject anything else.

Don't necessarily get your heart set on the biggest role.  The best part to play is not the biggest one, it's the one that suits you best so that you can give the best possible performance.  It's much more rewarding to do a smaller role extremely well, than to play the lead when you're not well-suited for it.

If you're auditioning with a certain group for the first time, be aware that there can be a lot of inside politics involved in the casting decisions, and newcomers often get bumped to lower roles because of this, no matter how good they are.  Most student groups will favor students, so if you're not a student at that school, you're at a distinct disadvantage.  These rules can be extremely strict (""no non-student can be cast when there is a student available, regardless of skill"") or more lax, and you can usually ask what the policy is.  In community groups, they may favor existing members, either officially or just through social tradition.  Even without any kind of rule, the directors will always be more comfortable casting someone they know and trust as opposed to an outsider.  Because of this, I highly recommend that you accept any part with a new group--then you become a veteran of that organization and get that favorable treatment the next time around.


**What else will there be in the audition?**

The group should describe everything in the audition notice, but auditions typically consist of your song, a range check, some kind of reading from the show, and a short dance segment for applicable shows.  If you're unsure of anything, don't hesitate to contact the directors and ask--we would be happy to answer your questions and certainly don't want anybody to be confused.  Again, we want you to do well.

For the reading, we know that it's difficult to cold read something with any skill, so just do your best.  Take the time to read through the lines first so you know what's going on.  Focus on acting rather than reciting lines flawlessly--we would much rather you act well and miss a few words, than get the lines perfect but be stiff as a board.  Most importantly, make an acting choice and stick with it.  That's really what we're looking for--your ability to perform in general, not any specific choice that you make.  If the stage director gives you direction and asks you to read it again, then the director is looking for your ability to take direction, so really exaggerate whatever you're told (don't be ridiculous, but show that you understood it and are willing to give the director what he wants).

If there's a dance portion, well, it's either you can or you can't.  You can make some improvement if you're a poor dancer by having high energy and being a good sport about the process.  They will probably make everyone do this, even if you're auditioning for a part with no dance requirement.  Either they're obligated to audition everyone identically (common in student groups), or they just want to see what you can do in case they can't offer you that non-dancing part that you want.

That's all I can think of for right now.  If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.

In fact, if you ask me whether you should pursue singing as a hobby, career, or passion, I'm going to tell you not to waste your time.

First off, know that anyone can become a great singer. You may already be a great singer, or it may take years to get there. Either way, once you know that you actually do have what it takes, you should then know whether it is ""worth pursuing.""

If, however, when I tell you not to waste your time, you say, ""But I thought you said that everyone can sing!"" or ""But I want to improve my singing!"" or ""I'm not going to live my life singing only in the shower because something passionate and beautiful inside me is screaming to get out, to become more than just a closet vocalist!"" then you shouldn't feel compelled to ask us, the people of /r/singing whether singing is ""worth pursuing.""

#SUBREDDIT COMMENTING RULES#



Please remember that with a critique you're trying to HELP the poster, think of how your comment can be useful to the OP!


###Do not be a jerk###


Please be nice, it takes a lot of bravery to put a recording up for critique. ""Nice"" in this instance would mean highlighting at least *one* thing the OP does correctly, even if it's just the fact that they put themselves out there.




###Do not be a kiss-ass##



OPs are looking for critiques, not compliments. If you feel the OP is at such a high level that you cannot adequately give advice, please be as specific as possible about what you admire in their performance. A specific compliment doesn't only sound more sincere in general, it also helps the OP to know what elements he/she has a good handle on. 


----------------------------------------------


#ASPECTS TO COMMENT ON#

######Song choice######

* Does the song they picked fit their voice? Why (not)? 

* Is it within their range and experience to sing? 

* Is the song appropriate for their age?

* Which strengths and weaknesses of their voice does this song highlight? And is this a reason to perform this song often, pick another song or just practice more?

* Can you recommend a song that would suit their voice equally well or better?

Especially beginners often pick a style to sing in and try to mold their voice to it, instead of looking for songs that best show of the strenghts of their own voice. In those cases, or when auditioning, picking the right song can make a huge difference on how well the voice sounds. More information can be found in the article on audition tips: [part1](http://redd.it/tyqyp) and [part2](http://redd.it/14tcfl).

###Breathing

* Are there any breathing issues? If yes, can you pinpoint parts of the song these issues manifest or are they present the whole song through? 

* Is the OP out of breath at the end of a sentence? You can often tell if they tense up to wring out the last few notes.

* Does the OP's voice waver or seem unsupported? In general or on specific notes?

* Is the OP expelling breath at the end of the sentence or does their voice sound breathy?

* Does the OP plan their breathing right? Making too long or uneven sentences, or not taking long enough breaths, can give problems even for singers with overall good breath support.

* Can you give specific exercises to help the OP manage the issues they face?

###Posture (on video posts)

* Does the OP look like he/she is sitting/standing comfortably and relaxed? Does his/her posture look straight and active as well?

* Does the OP move their chin up and down when the music gets higher or lower?

* Do the OP's shoulders move when inhaling?

* Is the OP moving around a lot? Is this done for a sense of performance or just plain restlessness, and what is the effect of this movement on their voice and performance?

* Is the OP sitting or standing while leaning either forward or backward? 

* Does the OP look like he/she collapsed his body or trying to forcefully straighten it? Either too relaxed or too tense a posture can be a problem while singing.

* Is the OP sitting bent over his/her instrument?

###Pitch

* Is the OP on pitch? Does he/she improvise in tune with the music?

* If the OP is off pitch, is this just a little or a lot? In the whole song or just a few notes?


###Rhythm

* Is the OP following the rhythm of the music? If not, can you name specific instances where he/she was too early or too late?

* Does the OP try to play with the rhythm and show his/her musicality this way? In what part of the song did it work least/best?

###Strain

* Does the OP's voice sound strained? In general or just on high or difficult notes?

* Does the OP seem to brace him/herself for difficult notes or passages?

###Pronounciation

* Does the level of exactness for the pronounciation fit the song and genre?

* If not pronounced very exact, is the OP just sloppy or trying to sing in a certain style? Does the OP's pronounciation work for that style/genre?

* Does the OP finish his words or swallow them?

* Do the vowels sound like they're supposed to sound, or are they distorted so much that it makes the words harder to understand?

###Placement

* Does the OP have nasality issues? If yes, on which part of the song?

* Does the OP sing from his/her throat? 

###Bad Habits

Does the OP have any bad habits? For instance:

* seeking for the correct notes or sliding off notes

* fake vibrato

* shouting to get volume instead of using breath support and correct placement


###Dynamics/phrasing

* Does the singing sound like every word/note is pronounced separately?

* Does the OP lose focus between sentences/verses or during an instrumental bridge?

* Does the OP sing somewhat monotone, stressing every word similarly?

* Are the breaths placed well, not interrupting the song? 

* Is there a range of loud-soft, neutral-stressed? Are these aspects balanced and effective?

###Emotion

* Does the OP's voice seem very nervous or tense?

* Does the OP move you with the emotion in their voice?

* Does it seem like the OP is telling a story with the song? What makes this (not) so?

###Style

* Is the OP's style similar to anyone else's? Do you feel this is good or bad?

* Does the OP try to force a style that's not suited to his/her voice or age?

* Does the OP give a very unique interpretation of a song? What exactly is (not) unique about it?

###Practice

If neccessary, don't be afraid to ask clarification of how the OP practices, and/or give specific tips or exercises if you know any, for instance:

* breathing exercises

* shortcuts toward good posture

* [how to practice](http://redd.it/17c6jx)

* warmup exercises

* simple tricks, like singing in front of a mirror

&gt;* Who is good at ""singing"" despite being poorly built for it? Who's good at this who shouldn't be?

I'd say people like Tom Waits, Macy Gray, Geddy Lee, Susan Boyle, etc. They succeed because they're distinct, not because they're the same as others.

&gt;* Who are the most impressive lesser-known teachers?

I will always turn to my personal teacher, [Michael Goodrich](http://www.goodrichvocal.com/) and his wife. They helped me turn my instrument into something great. I'd also say [Katie Agresta](http://katieagresta.com/), who helped me with a lot of voice-box muscle tension issues. Both have celebrity clients, but aren't as well known as the Seth Riggs, etc of the world.


&gt;* What makes you different? Who influenced you?

I take pride in trying to model my voice to the wailers of the 80's rock scene, as opposed to trying to copy a ""Broadway Sound"".

&gt;* Have you trained others to do this? Have they replicated your results?

I teach here and there in NYC, but it really depends on clients needs. I haven't taught long enough to launch a person into Broadway, but I've been able to get positive results from a new singer on day one.

&gt;* What are the biggest mistakes and myths you see singing? What are the biggest wastes of time?

Only opera singers are good singers and teachers. Only people who play piano are good singing teachers. That a long warmup = better voice (when in fact better warmups = better voice). There is a magic lozenge or syrup or pill you can take to make your voice better. That only one type of voice or training is ""correct"". Dairy is terrible for you. All myths.

&gt;* What are your favorite instructional books or resources on the subject? If people had to teach themselves, what would you suggest they use?

Try and emulate your favorite songs, and sing in the car/at home/at karaoke. The more you sing, the more you'll figure out what works and what doesn't. Warmups usually work only if you know why they work.

&gt;* If you were to train me for four weeks for a [fill in the blank] competition and had a million dollars on the line, what would the training look like? What if I trained for eight weeks?

I'd focus on creating a ""dumb/cry"" sound to get your soft palate raised and your larynx stable. I'd teach proper breathing technique by descending the diaphragm, and how to remove extra muscle from the equation.

&gt;* What are the biggest mistakes novices make when singing or practicing singing?

Yelling/being loud does not equal being better. The better you are at controlling a soft sound is harder than being loud. Drink more water. Practice is good, but too much practice can wear you out... breaks are good too, just like working out your muscles.

&gt;* Even at the pro level, what mistakes are most common?

Pushing when you don't need to, and feeling ""in voice"" that you push so hard that you wear yourself out. Also, smoking and drinking too much/not being hydrated.

1345235829.0,22,self.singing,ye8yd,The diaphragm and how it works.,29,7,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/ye8yd/the_diaphragm_and_how_it_works/,"I was looking at [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/y9xde/a_few_short_tips_from_my_coach_back_when_i_sang/) post, and noticed that learning to breathe properly is at the top of the list, where imo, it belongs.

I'd like to expand on that point, particularly on the diaphragm.

Your diaphragm is actually an involuntary muscle that *you have no direct control over.* It separates your lungs from your intestines and other lower organs, pretty much as a divider between your upper and lower torso. There are four points in which the diaphragm is physically connected to: 

* Spine
* Sternum
* Two lowest ribs

You can control your diaphragm with your intercostal, lower back, and abdominal muscles.

At rest, your diaphragm looks like two upside down bowls (as there's two chambers, that connect at the sternum) [like this second picture](http://www.songsofthecosmos.com/images/diaphragm_during_breathing.gif). At inhalation, the diaphragm flattens as much as it can to pull air into the lungs.

To make sure a singer is making the most of this automatic response (breathing isn't exactly something you think about a lot), make sure your ribcage is expanded as much as possible- in both the upper and lower areas. The way I expand my upper ribcage- is to raise my arms above my head- feel the expansion in the upper ribcage, and let my arms come down, without letting my chest collapse. To get the feeling in the lower ribcage, sit in a chair with your elbows on your knees and take a deep breath. Your lower back should expand. When you exhale, keep the lower ribcage expansion. Remember how that feels and keep that while standing or sitting in a normal position. This will pretty much make you sit/stand up straight as well. :) Keeping your ribcage expanded will let as much air into your lungs as physically possible. If you're new to these sensations in expanded ribcages, you can expect to be a little achey after some proper practice. Singing isn't nearly as easy as it looks.

Now, all of that prep does you no good if you don't engage it properly. The voice works like a whoopee cushion. The sound is made from the flow of air, not from manipulation of the neck/throat muscles. To get your ""diaphragm"" (actually the muscles around your diaphragm that controls it, see above) to work for you, you need to contract your abdominals at an appropriate rate to the flow of air you need for your voice. The lower abs do most of this work, so you should feel pressure on the muscles covering your pelvic area and just above your pelvis, like you're engaging in a reaaaaaaallly long crunch.

In short, you should be focusing on the muscles around your diaphragm, and not your diaphragm itself. Hope this helps guys!",,False,,t5_2rlcx,False,,star,True,t3_ye8yd,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/ye8yd/the_diaphragm_and_how_it_works/,

1357747235.0,19,self.singing,1694ma,Registers and How to Blend Them,22,3,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/1694ma/registers_and_how_to_blend_them/,"Pedagogues today have widely accepted Manuel Garcia’s definition of registers, which essentially says that a register is a series of tones that are produced by the same mechanical principle and whose nature differs from another series of tones. In other terms, registers are a series of notes that you sing the same physically, so different registers mean you use different physical mechanisms.

This chart [here](http://i.imgur.com/QE33V.png) gives a rough approximation of where the vocal registers and breaks lie. 

There are a *lot* of terms out there for the different registers, but the most widely accepted ones are as follows (from low to high):

- Men have chest voice, head voice, and falsetto, with chest being their primary register.
- Women have chest voice, middle voice, and head voice, with a mix of middle voice and head voice being their primary register.

There are a lot of questions circulating about falsetto, and for good reason as it is a loaded matter. Richard Miller tells us in his book *Solutions for Singers* that the male ""head voice"" is more like the female middle voice and that it is generally accepted that falsetto is where a man sounds like a woman. This is physically caused by the vocal folds closing less completely than in regular range. In other words, the folds don't quite touch in falsetto. Other than countertenors to primarily sing in falsetto, Miller found that many trained singers do not use falsetto as a means to train the head voice. He found that many trained singers don't use falsetto at all. I find this surprising as it seems that men really enjoy exploring their falsetto and have a lot of questions about it, but yet again I am not a male singer. Ultimately I think it depends on the singer and what their teacher feels is best for their development.

So what is physically happening for these register shifts? To know this, we need to know a little anatomy. We have two muscles that are used to adjust registers, the thyroarytenoid (TA) muscles and the cricoarytenoid (CT). The TA muscles are responsible for our chest voice and for some of the middle voice in women. The TA muscles are also responsible for belting. The CT muscles are responsible for some of middle voice in women and head voice, as well as falsetto. 

In the first register shift (from chest to mixed or head), your voice is switching from TA dominant muscles to CT dominant muscles. The second register shift, however, is not so much a muscular shift since you already switched to your CT muscles, but instead a shift in resonance, or how sound travels through your vocal tract. It was asked what this will feel like, so know that really it won't feel like much of anything. I mention this here for your information into what's actually happening, but thinking of these muscles is really not a means to working on registration.

As for our vocal folds, [here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tlpkdq8a8c) that does a decent job of demonstrating the following explanation. Our vocal folds are like a rubber band: the further they're stretched out, the higher the pitch that sounds. As you can see in this video, the lower notes make the folds look shorter and thicker. Inversely, the higher notes make the folds look more stretched out and thinner. Generally speaking, the folds vibrate together in their entirety with the center being the main point of vibration and not just in particular areas (with voice disorders being the main exception).  


**Up until this point, this has purely been a discussion of definitions and what is physically happening and not what you can do to improve register shifts.** Remember that a good voice teacher is always best, but here are some tips.


So how can you blend registers better? What needs to be adjusted? The two factors that need to be adjusted to blend registers are breath pressures and vowels.

As you transition through both registers, breath pressure needs to be increased. As you transition through the second register shift especially, though the first one as well, vowels need to be modified for clarity of sound. For men, this means that your vowels need to be more rounded. Think somewhere between an “oh” and an “oo” sound. For women, as you go higher, your vowels should open more. Eventually though in head voice, everything begins to sound like “ah”. Know that there is no “ideal” vowel for both men and women, but instead it will be on an individual basis.

As always, feel free to ask any questions, add anything, or discuss! It is difficult to express such a complex idea through a short article, but I also wanted to make it as conscience and straightforward as possible. I hope this gives you a good foundation to start with though. Best of luck to you all!

Edit: As I expected, there seems to be some confusion here, and that's totally okay! This is a surprisingly complex subject that is very hard to explain and understand. I have added a section on falsetto above and added what is happening with the vocal folds in different ranges. I hope this helps!

Edit Edit: Although I have said this in every post I have ever posted and thought it didn't need repeating again, none of this beats a good voice teacher! Registration is complicated but I wrote this in response to a request for it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/15zmpl/hey_singit_what_would_you_like_to_know_more_about/).

1356798290.0,20,self.singing,15mmgl,How to Find a Good Voice Teacher,21,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/15mmgl/how_to_find_a_good_voice_teacher/,"It seems that everyone in this subreddit agrees that the best way to improve your singing is to find a good teacher, yet there seems to be a lot of questions as to how and go about that. Here are some tips for how to find a teacher, what to look for in a teacher, and what kind of teacher may be best for you. There’s a lot to consider, so I’ll make this as conscience as possible.

How to find a teacher

1. Look to your local college/university. Besides being a wealth of teachers, they are often a wealth of information. Oftentimes these teachers give private lessons, but if they don’t, many times their students do. Many schools have bulletin boards within their music departments that either have ads for teachers or you can place ads looking for one.

2. Local music stores may have teachers, but *be careful* of finding a teacher here. Keep in mind that singing does not produce instruments you can sell, so oftentimes the voice teacher at a store is also the primary guitar or piano teacher. Sometimes they make good voice teachers as well, but many times they do not. 

3. Organizations like NATS and Classical Singer often have teacher listings according to area. 

4. Craigslist isn’t terrible. I have gotten a fair amount of students myself from Craigslist, and I know many other singers / teachers who post there as well. Just make sure they give their credentials and that the first meeting at least is in a public area (such as a music school as opposed to one of your houses) for your safety and theirs.

5. Do not underestimate the power of word of mouth! If someone you know takes lessons, ask them about it. Teachers are not one size fits all, but if their teacher is not the best one for you, then they may have other recommendations.

6. Know that there is a difference between a voice teacher and a voice coach. A coach works with you almost exclusively on diction, musical style, and factors pertaining to the music itself. A teacher, however, will work primarily on technique but cover all of these things as well.

What to look for in a teacher

1. Be clear about what you want to learn. Many people will tell you that classical training can teach you to sing any kind of style. This is both true and false. Classical training will give you the basics of good singing (e.g. good posture, good breath support), but unfortunately many classical teachers do not feel comfortable teaching contemporary music, even though it is much higher in demand. Know though that a good teacher will create a balance of finding music you want to learn and what is appropriate for your development.  

2. Their credentials. Remember though, those who can do can*not* necessarily teach! Many natural talents do not know how to convey what something should sound or feel like. Look for teachers who have many years of experience teaching or have studied voice pedagogy.

3. What do their students sound like? What are their students doing now? Try to hear some of their students if you can. Do they all sound the same? This can be an indication that a teacher is a one-trick pony and perhaps not the best. Do you like how their students sound? This might be the teacher for you.

4. How much do they cost? This will vary according to your location and to the length of your lesson (which are usually either ½ hour or an hour), but  you really should not pay more than $100, especially for beginner lessons. An hour lesson will vary from $30-$70 on average. This will depend not only on location but the experience of the teacher as well. Know though that just because you are paying more it does not necessarily mean they will be a better teacher! I personally have never paid more than $60 a week.

5. Do they offer sample lessons? Many teachers will offer a lesson for free as a means to make sure that it is a good fit for both of you. Personality matters with a teacher! This is also the time to ask a teacher all of these questions and whatever others you may have. If a teacher does not offer a sample lesson, you may want to keep looking.

6. Male vs. Female? Honestly, if the teacher is a good teacher, it shouldn’t matter if you study with someone the same gender as you. This is especially true if you’re a beginner because the singing mechanism is not so different. Ultimately, this is a matter of preference. Singing is a highly personal study since it involves our bodies, so some prefer someone of the same gender for this reason. I prefer to study with other women simply because I feel they understand my vocal issues better. What it comes down to is, a good teacher is a good teacher, and it’s just a question of what you prefer.

If you have any more questions about finding a teacher, my background, or if you think anything should be added, please feel free to say so. I hope you have found this helpful, and best of luck to all of you on your search!

I truly admire everyone who puts themselves out there looking for critiques- and it's truly wonderful to have a community that you feel safe doing so, and I thoroughly enjoy that everyone here is really supportive and useful with their comments.

However, here's a some pro-tips.

You'll get more out of your critiques if:

* You sing louder than the instrument you're playing. I enjoy that there are people here that are multi-talented, but if you're looking for a vocal critique, you HAVE to be louder than the instrumentation. You're all smart people here, and you can tell when one thing is louder than another. :) 

* Videos will get you more useful comments than just soundclouds. Soundclouds are great- and if you're too uncomfortable to do a video, that's fine and you'll still get some great feedback, but videos are better. With a video, a critique-er can see where your tension issues are, if you're using proper posture (yep, we can tell even if you're sitting), we can see if anything funky is happening (the lower part of my neck has a tendency to shake when I sing, due to an incorrect use-age of support. I had no idea until my voice teacher told me because I hate mirrors....), we can tell if you make any weird facial expressions or have any nervous ticks you can work on getting rid of for performances like bug-eyes, or fiddling with clothing etc... Videos just give the reviewer more material to help you fix whatever it is you're doing. Singing is incredibly physical (more so than most people imagine), and we can't critique you fully unless we see you.

**EDIT2: Compression, in simple terms,  lowers the volume when it is too loud and raises the volume when it is too low, I'm not getting into specifics because it is rather complicated**

I went away from singing for a while, I was studying other parts of the art (music) and I'm now back to singing and poetry, so I recently got access to new tech (gotta love new tech) long story short I can monitor and apply FX in without adding noticeable latency and my questions to professional singers is as follows:

|

* Should I monitor?
* What are the pros and cons of monitoring?
* Should I apply compression in real time? (I'm currently doing it because it feel like singing louder is just a tone differential, for me, currently, it gives me more flexibility)

|

My experience so far has been ridiculously positive, when I'm monitoring it makes it easier to find mistakes as they're happening and allows me to enhance my tone in certain parts of a song as the issue happen, the more I do it, at least to me, the more it seems like I'm learning about my voice and how to make it sound good in general, it makes it easier to sing softly or harshly because I'm mostly listening to a consistent audio level regardless (some times one has to get closer to the mic), so despite my positive experience I know I have a tendency to overlook things, and that is why I'm asking for opinions from people who do it professionally, and do it constantly!

For the audio engineers out there, I don't record the compressed audio stream, I record the raw and manipulate it later, although, lately, I've been using it to train and just goofing around with my vocal folds's capabilities :D

I've listened to some of the clips asking for critique. Sometimes the OP needs help identifying a problem in particular or asking for help in general. It seems to me the times people ask for specific help they are immensely off track, as if they've identified one certain ""hurdle"" that does not even begin to describe the actual singing (""Yeah, I'm having a slight problem with cadence"") or when people ask in general there's a multitude of things that sound off. In other words it sounds poor.

The thing I always ask myself when I listen to these clips is how do you explain these faults to someone who can't hear it themselves? Also, if they can't hear it, can they identify good/bad singing in others? I'm all for singing, I don't anyone want to stop singing. But are there people who aren't aware of how they sound but still manage to improve?

There's been a large influx of people asking for critiques of their friends/family without their knowledge.

I understand that this is all with good intentions, and I'm really glad that you're out to help encourage and support the people you like.

Now, I'm not a mod, so I can't make this any rule of any kind, but I know that if someone were posting recordings of mine without my knowledge to have them critiqued, I'd get pretty upset.

Singing is a really personal art form. Please take that into consideration when posting. It's also easier for commenters to be mean or rude when critiquing someone when they think it's not the person who posted it.

Like I said, I'm all for the support and encouragement, and the good intentions that these posts have- but I know I wouldn't want someone critiquing my singing on a public forum without my knowledge. That can lead to embarrassing roads.

If you're asking a question about vocal technique and are looking for examples or have examples, I'd recommend using well-known singers who are professionals and get paid to sing. Not because they're leas human and should be ripped to shreds either, but because they have put their material out there to be listened too, and are more actively aware that their material won't be liked or hated by everyone. They've grown that skin they need. Let's encourage everyone by keeping this place a safe space.

As the title says, I've had no training, but I've always loved to sing. I've gotten some pretty nice comments from people, but I know I definitely could do better, so I'm here to seek some advice from people that actually know what they're talking about. 

Things that are still quite a problem when I sing: some people have told me that I can sound bored while singing. In other words, it takes me a lot of effort to sound convinced and sing with emotion. Besides watching a puppy being killed while singing, how I could I improve there? 
Also, I've also had a bit of trouble reaching the high notes- I'm aware of the fact that I have a slightly lower range than most females (at least that's what I think!) but I still think it should be possible for me to reach certain notes. I could take singing lessons, but I guess I'm not that serious about singing, and secondly, as a student: LACK OF TIME.

A voice teacher is there to help you mainly with your technique. They should know the mechanics of the voice, how it works, and how to convey that information to you in a way that works with your vocal instrument. 

A vocal coach helps you with the music you are working on. They help you with diction, musicality, and basically anything that is written on the page of your music. *Coaches are usually accompanists and not singers*. 

There can be crossover between the two. For example, most voice teachers will give diction or musical notes, and some coaches will give advice on technique. Some coaches even act as teachers, but usually for beginners. It is important to know, though, that when you are looking for a teacher, finding a vocal coach is *not* the same and oftentimes will not give you what you are looking for. Again, there can be exceptions, but as a general rule, when looking for someone to help you mainly with technique, you should know this.

I've sought out friends who sing well, chorus teachers, searched the internet, etc. and I have gotten many of the same responses. Develop chest/mask resonance, work on your breath support, use your diaphragm, don't tighten up etc. These are all things I've taken to heart, but when I get down to practicing, I realize I wasn't really told anything. 

I really want a nice, full, smooth voice, and I know proper breath support and resonance among other things are key to achieving my desired voice, but nobody's ever told me how to attain proper technique. I haven't scoured all depths of the internet, and I haven't even read through a majority of the help posts here, but I wanted to create place where aspiring singers can go to get a majority of the information they're looking for about HOW to become a better singer. 

My main questions (as you can tell) are about resonance and breath support/proper breathing. So I'll get this started with a few questions that I hope someone can answer. 

* How can I achieve and maintain good mask resonance while avoiding nasality? 

* I've heard that proper breathing is through the belly, but what exactly should I be doing with my belly? Am I just expanding the area and holding it there with my abs or am I actively pushing it in? And can I be taking in too much air?

* I've seen a lot of comments and questions about larynx position, and I've seen a lot of answers telling people to keep a ""low larynx."" Is it supposed to be lower than it's normal position or are we just trying to keep it at the same level that it's at when we're talking? Either way how do we (for the lack of a better word) force it to stay down?

I may be seem vaguely aggressive in this post, but I promise I'm just a little frustrated with my progress plateauing. Anyway, these are my biggest questions. If anyone can provide some insight, I'd be overjoyed! If anyone would like to ask some of their burning questions, I'd be happy to compile them in a comment or an edit in the near future.

1349370820.0,14,self.singing,10y0qo,Discouraging thoughts that I've overcome,14,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/10y0qo/discouraging_thoughts_that_ive_overcome/,"I've been singing with the serious intent of becoming a competent singer for 3 years. I'm currently 18 and self-taught.

I remember early on one of the biggest sources or discouragement from singing was my introverted nature as a person. Just the idea of me wanting to be a *singer* who *performs* in front of people felt totally backward. I was at times convinced that I just wasn't cut out for it. Singing and performing was reserved for the outgoing musical theater kids, not a quiet, reserved person like me. I used to film myself and feel ridiculous for how awkward I looked while singing. 

Yet I wanted to be a powerful performer so badly (and still do, too) that I never quit practicing. For hours a day I would be singing. I filmed myself constantly, and scrutinized my posture as well as every little unattractive movement and mistake I could. It has been a very slow journey so far, with many, many highs and lows of my confidence levels, but in recent months I can *finally* say I look and feel comfortable in my own skin while singing. I have a long way to go still, but considering how I have improved over the last 3 years, I must say I am proud of myself. I've never overcome anything so difficult in my life. While it may seem small, I feel as though this has been a true test of my character, will power, dedication and passion for music. And now I am finally comfortable enough as a singer that I can sing in front of friends and I have even played in front of one small crowd so far. I can only imagine how good I will become as I improve into adulthood, as long as I keep my head in the right place (keep my ""eyes on the prize"") and never stop practicing, which these days is immensely easier than it was in the beginning. 

I am now starting to write my first songs (I've played the guitar for 6 years and have studied music theory for 3) and I'm realizing that becoming a good songwriter is now a *whole new* journey to undergo. I'm not too great at it now, and I feel discouraged at times, but if I just remember what I've accomplished so far then I think I will be able to prevail in the end.

This whole experience for me has been very peculiar. I've always been a very lazy person without much motivation for anything. I've never been a good student because of a poor work ethic, lack of self-discipline etc., yet singing and becoming a performer has driven me like nothing else has in life. I can't go a day without singing, and not because I feel I ""have to"" to reach my goal, but because I genuinely want to. I aspire to one day move people with powerful performances, and I especially hope to inspire other musicians the way my favorite singers and artists have inspired me, because without their influence I simply wouldn't be where I am now. I feel lucky that I've found my passion and I hope I can one day follow it into a successful, effective career.

If you're made it this far, thanks for listening to my self-absorbed ramblings.    ",,False,,t5_2rlcx,1349371107.0,,,True,t3_10y0qo,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/10y0qo/discouraging_thoughts_that_ive_overcome/,

I just found this subreddit today and, already, I have a question. I am not a professional singer, by any means, but I have done karaoke for years and sing any chance I get. The question I have sort of relates to singing karaoke and is this: whenever I am singing a song, my voice sort of automatically immitates that singer's vocal style and I end up sounding like that singer.

I guess for karaoke that doesn't matter, but then when I go to write my own music, the same thing happens where I will be ""channeling"" another singer's style of singing. This is where it gets annoying. I feel like I don't have a voice of my own. I suppose none of that amounts to a real question yet, so what I am wondering is this:

Has anyone else had a similar sort of problem, and if so, how did you (or did you at all) solve it?

Long story short, I work 9-10hrs a day in front of a pc and have been a lifetime slumper.  Taking singing lessons posture was obviously a big issue, so much so when I first started I couldn't even get into something close to a reasonable neutral posture without forcing it.

I've somewhat resolved them through Pilates and Yoga, i.e. my shoulders and neck are just about capable of being in something that resembles ""correct"" posture.  I feel though I am constantly fighting for decent posture / if I stop yoga things tend to regress.

I am thinking posture in my day to day life needs a bit of a work through, my singing teacher mentioned Alexander Technique may help.  It sounds interesting, but is not exactly cheap and some of the sites I have seen have been a little, well, new age / hippyish... so I'm a little concerned about the cost if I get no benefits.

edit:  Thanks for the help, have booked in a session.  Its expensive but hopefully I can some basics in a few sessions then peruse it through books / DVD's (thanks for the suggestion)

Thanks for all the help.  Yeah ended up taking some lessons and it definitely helped.

I'm coltman75 and I am a classically trained musical theatre/opera tenor.  I can also sing most of baritone and all the way up to a high countertenor.  I have been studying voice for many, many years and I have learned from many different instructors who come from all over the world.  I also specialize in jazz, pop, and several choral styles, especially a cappella!

I love singing!  I love music!  And I love helping out beginners!  That is one of the bigger joys of singing, is helping a new singer find his or her voice.  And I love doing that with this subreddit.

However, when asking for critique, it would help me out a ton (and I'm sure it would help the others out) if you asked for specific critique.  Remember, make sure you're only submitting a self post!  Now, in that self-post, try to ask for specific critique.  What do you think needs to be improved upon?  What do you want help with?  It's hard to help someone when I don't know what I'm supposed to be helping with.  Should I open your piece looking to listen for helping you learn to breathe right?  Nasality?  Pitch?  Vibrato?  It would be nice to have some idea to expect what we're going to hear and what we should be listening for.

Now, if you're an absolute beginner and don't know what you need help with, you should say that.  That would help out, too!

I can kind of sort of a little bit sing ""Waiting on the day"" by John Mayer and ""Amsterdam"" by Coldplay, but when I try to sing the songs that I really love, like ""Let Down"" by Radiohead it sounds, to me at least, as bad as when I started.

Does any of this sound familiar to when you began singing - was there a few songs you could sing and then your voice developed and diversified? I have a big problem with tuning which is taking a lot of fixing - like a **LOT** of fixing, is that one of the harder parts of singing? 

I know I've only been singing for a year but it feels like I'm making virtually no progress - I can match a note on a piano but then *really* struggle to sing a word on it. I've had a few lessons and they helped a bit, but I can't afford regular lessons.

Last question: Is it unrealistic to want to be a good enough singer to release your own music? As in starting from being a terrible singer (X factor audition terrible) to being good enough to be at least listenable. Because it sound to me like all of the *bad* singers that are listenable have really interesting voices - Bob Dylan. I'm not expecting to be as good a singer as Thom Yorke, but maybe Noel Gallagher..?

Songs were written with the purpose of enhancing the meaning of a text through music. Our job as singing actors is to bring these stories to life.

It is SO easy to get wrapped up in thinking about technique when working on a piece so that all acting goes out the window. That’s okay! It happens! But we can’t let it be our final performance, or else our audience will think every piece we sing is about immense concentration and blank expressions.

So what are some ways we can work to liven up even the simplest of pieces?

- Know what the piece is about!! I know this seems obvious, but when it comes to singing in foreign languages especially, I cannot stress this enough. You should know not only the literal and poetic translations but you should also know the historical context of what you are singing. Knowing what you are singing about can go a long way.

- Decide how you and / or the character *feels* about what is happening. It would be obvious to say that in a love song the narrator feels in love. It would be much more interesting, however, to see a performer feel the heartbreak of love, or the immense joy of love, and so on. Decide what attitude you have about the piece, how you feel about the piece, how the piece makes *you* feel, and then figure out how to feel that in such a way that your audience feels it too.

- Don’t be afraid to move a bit. Some young classical singers will stand in the crook of the piano and not move an inch, making them look stiff and uncomfortable. You’re not in an opera, but you do have some leeway to move your arms, hands, head, and body.

- With that said, don’t move too much. Make each movement *purposeful*. Many singers have nervous habits where they move their hands too much, twitch the fingers, sway awkwardly, and so on. If you move, make sure that each movement has an intention.

- Use your face. We don't want to create unnecessary tension while singing, but our faces can really convey so many emotions. Many of us are very animated when we talk and then we get on stage and are frozen. Think of singing like a conversation and show your audience how you feel about what you’re saying just like you would with your friend.

- Use a mirror or a video recording device. Oftentimes we think we’re emoting something as much as we can, yet our teacher tells us our face looks dead. Seeing that for yourself is a great way to know what your audience is seeing.

- When you’re in the practice room, alternate between “technique sessions” and “acting sessions”. For example, one day you walk into the practice room and decide, “I really need to work on that run in this piece”, so make that session about that. The next day, perhaps you think, “I really want to show how in love this narrator is”, so that day focus on that. 

- Watch some of your favorite singers. Our favorite singers are favorites for a reason. We like what they do, and they usually know what they’re doing. Explore new singers as well. Find singers who are known for their acting and watch what they do. I in no way encourage mere mimicking, but take note of how they use their body to express ideas, and then explore how you can do the same with your own.

As always, if anyone has any questions, concerns, or anything to add, please feel free to do so! And thank you to brunettesoprano for the wonderful question!

Male, 18 yrs old.

Today I decided to try out really doing some vocal exercises. My singing teacher has given me a few, but i haven't really been doing them outside of lessons. These exercises were comfortably within my range, which is annoyingly limited - I can only reach E above middle C. At F I crack. But the exercises were fun and my voice felt very full. I sang a few songs for fun and then stopped singing for a while and did some work. I few hours later, I was singing along to 'Dancing through life' from wicked (i'm a musical theatre person) and usually i pretty much falsetto all the chorus, but i noticed i could do a lot more of it 'properly'. I started having a good go at it, and it didn't sound pleasant but i was somewhat hitting the notes without flipping to falsetto or feeling strained. I whipped my keyboard out and found that i was still wobbly on the F, but I could hit it. I tried going to the G.. something usually impossible, and i hit it without straining too much at all. Again, not the prettiest note i've ever hit but usually i simply cannot make a sound like that without screaming/falsetto. I got as high as B when my voice cracked again. Holy crap - I think I just discovered my head voice. I've only ever hit an F properly once before - with the guidance of my singing teacher, she did lots of warm ups with me. I didn't even try to go any higher that day, but today i did and found out that i can (kind of) hit an A! 

So - with practise I'm hoping these notes will start sounding prettier and fuller. It's a long long journey a head to actually be able to sing tenor songs but I've gotten a step further today.

As you might expect, he has no problems with lung capacity and breathing, has enough musical experience to have a good ear for tone, and in theory shouldn't have a problem with power in his voice. But in practice his singing can sometimes come across a bit weak and thin - possibly because he's focusing on hitting the notes and that seems to be easier at low volumes. There's no vibrato and it can feel dead even if tonally it is right on the note. Sometimes it's more like melodic talking than singing, and although that often works on a creative level, I'd like to have both options open.

The thing about my voice is that I either have a tendency to be too loud or perhaps that's just the way my voice is, which leads me to believe I might be a Spinto for now and possibly a dramatic wayyyy down the road. 

As a result my voice begins to patter out (due to the loudness) and I have to jump to a very ""heady"" mix in my upper register...I'd say it's about 70% head, 30% chest and because of that the upper register voice has a very distinct timbre that isn't very similar to my lower voice. 

I'd like to know if it's possible for me to make the timbre more full or if I'm stuck with all this extra range on top that's effectively sorta useless?

I find Jussi's phrasing and subtly to be incredibly beautiful. He allowed his voice to be light to great artistic effect, yet he could and often did produce some of the loudest and richest full voice high notes of any twentieth century tenor. For example, in his recording of Beethoven's Adelaide, he takes the first high A mostly in head voice, building vocally to the climax of the song later on. I think every young singer (and particularly tenors like me who are aiming for lots of big and loud high notes) should take a note from Jussi and remember that there's more than just trying to output full force all the time.

I haven't been posting as much in the last few months due to busyness and other things but I thought I should post a few YouTube videos of one of my tenor idols, and one of the greatest lyric tenors of all time (imo): Luigi Alva!

So, why do I think Alva is so great? Well first off, he proves (if it ever needed proving!) that you don't need to be born with a big instrument sing beautifully and get work. Alva's voice is actually quite ""small"" (I'm going to use the term ""light"" from now on as ""small"" sounds kind of diminishing) along the lines of someone like John Mark Ainsley or Juan Diego Florez, and he knows exactly how to use it. Compare [his version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ymPaEDDP9I) of the well-known ""Una furtiva lacrima"" to some of the bigger voices like [Jussi Björling](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cExgrwG0fhc&amp;feature=related) (who, by the way, wasn't a huge voice himself) or [Jonas Kaufmann](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOVjWb8xcYc). 

Alva's knowledge of his *own* voice brings me to my next point, ***he knew what repertoire was good for his voice, and he stuck to it***. As far as I know, he never left the purely lyric repertoire (specializing in Mozart, Rossini, et al) save some [*comprimario*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprimario) roles in other Italian operas. There are so many other great singers who did/do perform in roles their voice never should have done and end up with vocal problems later on (e.g. Franco Corelli, Giuseppe Di Stefano). Most of the time this is by lighter voices trying roles that are too heavy for them, or too heavy for them at that period in their lives. Alva never did this, and I am glad he was so smart about his instrument or we may have lost a great voice (he retired in the early 80's but is still alive and *supposedly* teaching at the school at La Scala).

But finally, the main reason why Alva is such a must-listen singer is his amazing technique. His tone, placement, diction, and especially breath support is amazing. Just look at this video of him as Don Ottavio (for which I believe he was the best ever, btw) [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUnDXmJaiko). Any tenor familiar with the role will tell you that the figurated line on ""nar"" around 1:59 is pretty tough as is, most take a breath halfway through the phrase. As you might notice, Alva does *the entire thing in one breath*, and even then he doesn't seem the least bit phased. That, ladies and gentlemen, is what perfect breath control looks like.

So, I hope you enjoyed my post about Luigi Alva, and I hoped you enjoyed his singing more!

I'm CrAzY MoFo 13, a young vocalist who is currently studying classical singing and opera and I felt that, after a while of providing feedback on people's submissions here I would take a more pro-active approach for advice and write a little bit on the vocal ""crack"".

So first off, what is a voice ""crack""? Well, a video says 1 000 000 words so I'll let you see one [in this video around the 22 second mark](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn8E4G_PzO4) (and for the record, I highly doubt that was the *worst ever*). Essentially the voice crack is the bane of all teenage boys and of younger singers, especially tenors like myself. A voice crack can occur during speaking too and if you've ever sung/spoke all day and gone out to a bar afterwards where you were almost shouting you may notice your voice crack all over the place.

Because of the embarrassing nature of voice cracks, most singers treat them like the plague: heaven forbid if a classical singer *ever* has their voice crack, it must mean they are a terrible singer, that they're pushing themselves too far up their range where they should not go! Actually, that's not necessarily true; yes, if you force your voice too high up you will often have a voice crack but the key word in that sentence is not ""too high"", but rather, **""force""**. Why? well it's time for me to explain what a voice crack *actually* is. Simply put, when there is some kind excess being put upon the [vocal folds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_folds) an unconscious signal is sent to the brain. The brain then assesses the situation (in some way, I am not a neurologist :P) and tells the folds to rectify the situation. The folds then adjust in some way and **that adjustment is the voice crack**. So what? How does this information help us learn as singers? Good question; because of the way that the vocal crack works, *whatever happens in the voice *after* the vocal crack is *always* better than what occurred before it*. So if your voice cracks, assess what was going on in your voice before compared to after and keep that as a mental note; if your voice is continuing to crack on a high note it means you haven't yet gotten rid of that tension.

In the end, we *are* looking to eliminate vocal cracks from our singing, no matter what type of repertoire we sing. The most obvious way to help get rid of cracks is correct *support*: if you're singing with your larynx instead of with your diaphragm you are *always* putting tension into your cords. However, there are less obvious culprits to the crime including *incorrect jaw, tongue, larynx, or rib-cage position; singing on a bad vowel (Franco Corelli noted that when tenors sing up high an ""awe"" in the low voice becomes more ""ooo"" in the high voice); singing with poor placement (i.e. not ""in the mask""); or improper space in the back of the head (i.e. the soft palate)* as well as others I have probably forgot to mention.

So with that in mind, go forth singers and don't shy away from your voice cracks as badges of shame, but rather use them as a learning experience to further refine your craft!

This is the first of three articles designed to show you how to get into classical music and gain a deeper appreciation for it. There are six different periods of classical music, Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Twentieth Century. We will be focusing on the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic eras. In today’s blog, we will delve into the Baroque era and provide you with samples of music from the period.

**Baroque Era**

Derived from the Portuguese word, “barroco” or “oddly shaped pearl”, the term Baroque was used to describe the heavily ornamented, texturized, and intense music of the period, which lasted from 1600 to 1750. Counterpoint, multiple independent melodic lines or voices, and rich expression through contrast in volume, texture and pace characterized much of the music during this time.

**Johann Sebastian Bach**

One of the pillars of Baroque music, Bach was a German composer, whose enthusiasm, brilliance, and innovation helped define the musical era. Even today, musicians are still amazed at Bach’s immensely complex composition style, heavily reliant on counterpoint, which seem to fit together into a complex system of special codes.

“It’s easy to play any musical instrument: all you have to do is touch the right key at the right time and the instrument will play itself” – *Johann Sebastian Bach*

[Prelude and Fugue in C Sharp](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw-0PRovMU8)

Many of Bach’s pieces at the time were written with a “prelude” designed to introduce the “fugue”, which is a piece written with many different interlocking melodic lines. Prelude and Fugue in C sharp is an example of the prelude to fugue progression.  On a more personal note, many people have described this piece as complex yet charming, how does it make you feel?

[Fugue in G minor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO8i5D2uz84)

 “Little Fugue” is one of Bach’s most well known fugues. The Fugue in G minor starts out deceivingly simple with one melodic line, which establishes a main motif for the piece. A few measures in, second and third melodic lines join in, adding to the intricacy of the piece. This is a very good example of polyphonic voicing or counterpoint.

I've been looking about online about this issue but my situation is a bit different from most I've read... 

I love singing. I write my own material and I have just recently got the hang of playing guitar and have just started gigging on my own and I'm loving it!

[My voice is far from bad](http://soundcloud.com/emmzcake91-1/alarm-bells) (my guitar playing is alot more advanced now btw!) but I am becoming very concerned about the fact that I smoke. 

I do smoke cigarettes (5-6 per day), but have successfully stopped these before and I'm fairly confident I could stop again. My main problem is smoking weed. I smoke it every day and find it very hard (impossible) to sleep without it. Now, this isn't something I do all day, I work 9hours a day 5 days a week and usually only have one or two joints when I get home to help me unwind. 

I'm also pretty sure that a lot of my creativity comes from smoking, and I have fears that I might loose my ability to write as well without it, and to be perfectly honest I don't want to stop smoking it. The only thing that's worrying me is the damage I'm doing to my voice. 

For the past couple of months my throat has felt full of phlem that doesn't go away, not even with the nasal spray I got from the doctors. My throat gets sore throughout the day from me constantly trying to swallow and I'm getting really scared that at 21yrs I've already done damage. (I've been smoking weed/fags for 8yrs).

I was wondering if there were any older singers who have simmilar experience or advice? Obviously I should stop smoking, I know this myself, but I'm interested to know if it's possible to loose your voice forever due to smoking? Is there a certain age that your chords just can't take it anymore? Is it something that can be done in moderation and just needs an eye kept on it? Or am I going to fuck all my dreams up forever if I continue on this path?

I had my first singing lesson the other day (a 2-hour consultation). Unfortunately, it didn't go the way I'd hoped. While the singing teacher was very good and had me do a lot of exercises to fix my posture and unmatched tone across my range, there was something he insinuated that was really disappointing. He told me I'd got the makings of a first-class classical bass and that, he could teach me how to use the instrument that I have. Problem is, I sing a lot of pop with my band and a cappella group, which is something I potentially wanted to continue with after my degree as a producer.

Is there still hope for me? Should I find a different teacher? Has anyone else ever been in this kind of situation before? I'm not really looking for reassurance here so much as uncomfortable truths.

Those auditions went exceptionally well, but I just got done accompanying another set of auditions where almost everybody hurt themselves in some way.  I want to offer an addendum to the article with more specific ""do""s and ""don't""s.

Quick note:  I know that several of my friends have figured out my Reddit ID, and yes these auditions just happened this week, so some people might recognize themselves in these tips.  Or you might just realize that you're guilty of exactly one of these problems.  This post is not intended to mock or berate anyone, I just want to see everyone audition to the best of their ability.

**Edit:** This is geared towards students and young amateurs.  I'm assuming that anyone who's auditioning for a professional show isn't looking for tips on Reddit.

**Song Selection**

DO:

* Pick something that fits your range.  Seems obvious, but I just had several people make exceptionally bad choices given their vocal type.
* Pick something that you actually own (or have guaranteed access to) the accompaniment to.  Several people for this round of auditions wanted to sing a particular song, but tried to check it out of the music library and found that it was already taken.  Some people went to backup songs that they didn't know as well, and others just sang unaccompanied (which is a bad idea, see below).

DO NOT:

* Worry excessively over the appropriateness of your song choice.  Go ahead and sing a modern song for a Gilbert and Sullivan audition if it's what you're most comfortable with.
* Sing anything from the show.  I talked about why this is a bad idea in the original article.  Seriously, don't do it.
* Sing anything from *Rent* (or really any musical that has a famous movie adaptation, but *Rent* is by far the worst offender).  Some people have very strong opinions about how those songs should sound.
* Sing unaccompanied, for any reason whatsoever.  One thing that we're looking for is how well you can sing with the accompaniment (sense of rhythm, ability to lead and follow when appropriate), and avoiding this forces us to assume the worst.  Everybody who's done at least 3 shows has had an experience where an actor just could not follow the orchestra, making all of his songs sound awful, and wants desperately to avoid this in the future.

**Sheet Music**

DO:

* Photocopy your music onto single-sided paper, ideally taped together so it's one big sheet.  One very thoughtful repeat auditioner photocopies his music onto card stock so the pages won't fall over.  I almost want to cast him just because of this.
* Find something simple to follow.  If your excerpt requires more than 4 or 5 pages, either pick something else (possibly just a different section of the same song that doesn't require so many pages) or find another version that's written more compactly.  Clearly mark where you want to start and end.  Try to minimize the number of repeats, DS/DC and coda jumps, and cuts.  Do NOT make the accompanist flip pages or jump all around something with a crazy road map.

DO NOT:

* Use a piano/conductor score.  These range from difficult to impossible to sight-read.  Copy something out of a published ""Vocal Selections"" book.  Ideally, pick something where the vocal line is NOT folded into the accompaniment (most Vocal Selections books are like this), as it can make it harder to play.
* Use something with minimalist (or nonexistent) accompaniment.  There's a whole series of voice books that have really boring, minimal accompaniment that's just there for chordal reference.  Unless the accompanist is amazing at improvising (probably not), it's gonna sound bad and make you sound bad.

**Performing the Song**

DO:

* Make a decision about interpretation.  Doesn't have to be major, but do something with it.
* Try to keep going.  If there's a train wreck that's so bad you have to stop, be quick about getting back on track.

DO NOT:

* Talk about how nervous you are or how badly you think you did.
* Apologize for mistakes.",,False,,t5_2rlcx,1355497572.0,,star,True,t3_14tcfl,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/14tcfl/musical_theater_audition_guide_part_2/,
1354047792.0,8,self.singing,13w35y,Stylistic Choices v. Vocal Health Necessities (a guideline for following critiques),10,2,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/13w35y/stylistic_choices_v_vocal_health_necessities_a/,"Since this subreddit is critique heavy, it's good to know the difference between things that need to be heeded when said, and things that are up to you as the singer as to whether or not you want to change.

**Things that *need* to be heeded when mentioned in a comment.**

* *BREATH SUPPORT.* There's lots of articles floating around here about what is and isn't proper breath support. The short version is that you should be breathing into your lower abdominals- the ones on top of your pelvis (if you're thinking the diaphragm, you could still be thinking too high.) You also have to engage the breath as you're singing, which will feel kind of like taking a poop, with the slow contraction of those abs. Along with breath support, there will be comments about your *POSTURE.* Having good posture is necessary to having good breath support, so make sure you pay attention to comments about posture too.
* *TENSION/RELAXING.* Tension will almost always make you sound worse. Being relaxed and letting your body feel free and natural will always make you sound better. It's important to still feel a firm core to your body so you're not wobbly, but you should remain flexible.
* *INTONATION.* Being ""in-tune"" is critical. We've all heard singers that sound a bit ""off"" with their intonation (going flat or sharp, just not quite sounding ""right""). The voice is a glissando instrument: meaning that unlike a piano where you hit the key, and that's the note you hear, the voice can produce pitches in-between the whole-step/half-steps of western music. (There are cultures that use quarter tones, and 20th century shenanigans that use weird tunings.) So being able to correctly tune yourself is essential. This means ear training and working on muscle memory to get the folds to exercise intonation. It is possible to be singing the correct pitch but for it to come out of your mouth incorrectly due to incorrect technique. A lot happens between your neck and when you release the sound out your mouth, so be careful to pay attention to these critiques.
* *VOCAL FREEDOM.* Letting your vocal folds vibrate freely without tension is the most important thing you can do. Any strain or pain felt in the vocal cords will not only sound strained and uninviting to the audience, but it will also damage your voice. (Be knowledgeable of the fact that there are styles of singing in which these are the desired effects. Also be aware that it will cause vocal damage. Whether you care or not, is up to you.) The free-er your sound, the better 4/5 times. (This excludes some genres of rock/metal etc...)

It's a pretty short list, but if you have a combination of all four of those things, anything else ""wrong"" is up to you to fix. These are all out of necessity for vocal health and basic technique. If you get told that you're having issues with any of these four things, it's best to seriously evaluate the situation.

**Things that are stylistic choices/tools that get mentioned frequently; Up to the performer as to whether or not a change needs to be made.**

There are infinite ways to sing/speak/scream/yell/yodel etc... and each of them have their own style, and none in particular are ""wrong,"" SO LONG AS EACH CHOICE IS MADE CONSCIOUSLY. If you're doing something that someone is finding undesirable, make sure you're doing it on purpose. You'll never please everyone, but being lazy about stylistic choices is *not* the way.

* *DICTION (pronunciation of words).* Vowel/consonant choices do effect how you sound, by a lot. Some vowels/consonants will sound better in your voice than others, and everyone is different. It is common to get critiques related to how you pronounce a word, vowel modification in different registers of the voice, or even how long you stay on a ""soft"" consonant (r and s most frequently). It is recommended that you give these things a whirl, as something someone suggested may change your sound completely for the better. Worse comes to worse, you don't like it and you keep doing it the way you have, but you won't lose anything by trying. I personally suggest that if you get a comment from someone saying that they can't understand your words that you work on making your words more understandable, but this too is a personal choice.

* *PLACEMENT*. Critiques on darkening/brightening a tone happen as well. Darkening a tone adds drama, but runs the risk of not projecting as far, where as brightening a tone will make fast passages easier to sing and resonant, but if done incorrectly can make you sound like a nasal mouse. A balance of both is preferable to most people, but you may be told to try it more in one way or another, especially depending on the song. Again, give it a whirl. You never know what will happen. Be careful to follow the top four rules of healthy singing so that (in particular when darkening) you don't end up depressing your larynx so far that it's uncomfortable or hurts.

* *NASALITY.* Again, a preference. This particular topic will usually receive more negative views than positive, as nasal sounds lack warmth, which is generally what most people want to listen to (in western music). However- nasality has been sneaking in through pop/rock/musical theatre over the last century or so, making it a stylistic choice. Nasality can cause issues with intonation, as it by nature depresses the soft palate, which depresses the sound, which can cause the singer to flat. It IS possible to sing with nasality in tune, it's just a precaution to take if choosing to use it. Nasality also has the tendency to not let you project your sound as far, but this is also something that can be overcome with proper usage of breath.

* *VIBRATO.* Knowing *how* to use vibrato is rather important, as that is what the voice does naturally if given the proper vocal freedom and breath support. Whether or not you *do* use it is all up to you. 

* *TONE.* Having a ""rock"" tone or a ""metal"" tone or a ""pop"" tone or a ""classical"" tone are all up to you. Go with what you feel. Give new things a try when suggested, but in the end, your overall tone is YOUR sound specifically.

Sometimes removing vibrato or other parts of your singing temporarily will help you improve your song as you focus on other specifics, and the same is true for the opposite. It all depends on what is and isn't useful to you to help you improve.

There are general guidelines to each genre of music that define what that genre is. So getting comments such as ""since this is a classical piece, I'd remove the nasality from your tone"" is normal, and I'd encourage you to give it a try and see how you sound and if you like it or not. But that is mainly a stylistic choice. It's okay to take bits and pieces from one genre and apply it to another if you like it. That's how music evolves. Vocalists don't just sing, we're also musicians. Making musical decisions like what styles you want to meld is half of the fun. If you listen to the radio today, you'll find a good chunk of pop songs are actually a mixture of pop, techno, and dubstep- and that's only one example. Genres like pop-punk, jazz musicals (such as Chicago), and the like all happened because someone took two things and put them together. No reason you can't either if you like it.

I'm not saying this to tell you to dismiss suggestions given to you on critiques you post. There's actually a lot of good advice posted on this forum. Just use your thinking cap and actively choose, and have reasons for, everything you do, and don't be afraid of trying out new ideas.

Clearly, there are more things that are stylistic choices than what I just addressed here, and I'll edit this post if/when I think of them. ",,False,,t5_2rlcx,1371424430.0,,star,True,t3_13w35y,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/13w35y/stylistic_choices_v_vocal_health_necessities_a/,

I used to be a singer in a band, and I have about 200 shows under my belt. I was also a worship leader in church for about seven years. 
I would get a lot of praise for my singing, most people who have 
heard me tell me that I'm one of the best singers they've heard. 
I'm not that great, but I can carry my weight.

However, when my family are home and I need to practice I'm terrified of singing. I refuse to belt, I refuse to open my mouth. It's really bringing me down. I have a hard time singing around my girlfriend, and friends unless I'm on some sort of stage and the lighting is dark so I don't see their faces. Strangers? No problem. People I know? I freeze. 
Every negative singing experience I've had has always been due to this. 
Friends in the crowd, or family in the crowd and I just shell up. 

This is a huge huge roadblock for me, as I love singing and writing songs. I want to record music at home (it'd be nice to even be able to share something here!), but it just never happens. I don't know why I just tighten up. When I do manage to get some notes out, it's strained, in a soft almost whisper, and my anxiety 
is doubled because I then start to think ""Oh God, this sounds horrible."".

Been singing since I found out I could, was trained properly from 14 to 18.

Basically I cannot for the life of me sing in front of anybody bar my teacher.  The more people you add to the room the more my ability just declines.  The amount of nerves I get cause my vocal chords to tense up completely to the point where I can't physically use a large part of my range which creates in itself a vicious circle (I'm nervous - my voice will be bad - I'm even more nervous etc etc).

I would really really love to audition for my university choirs and maybe even the musical theatre society but I have no idea how I would ever get out there and do it.  I actually turned up to try last year but I had completely lost my speaking voice up until only a couple days before and had no opportunity to practice/warm up - when I tried to explain this I got told I had to do it anyway to 'prove my commitment' and show that I'm reliable and I could barely squeak a note out.  Ended up crying in front of the conductor which wasn't exactly an affirming experience!

I made some progress back at school, I managed to do one small recital by the end which wasn't a disaster and I had a small speaking/singing part in Cabaret but now I'm not surrounded by people who can excuse me because they know I can actually do it I feel lost.

Has anybody got advice about overcoming it when it's this bad?  It's not even like I can use the nerves or like it's good anyway when I actually get up there and do it because it just isn't.

I got bad food poisoning last week, so I look like hell. Hopefully I can put up a video next week and you can see what I look like. In video form!

**First Question**: [Can you talk about some common misconceptions in singing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/pmc35/vocal_coach_question_request_thread_feb_12_2012/c3qlnvj)

*My Answer:* You know, there are a lot of things that vocal coaches agree on: a dropped larynx, a relaxed musculature, a nice, clear tone. But I think one of the biggest misconceptions is that your vocal coach is right all the time, and that you *must adhere to the religion that is your vocal coach.* I've had 3 vocal coaches in my life, and I gained and learned something from each one. Each approach was different, and a lot of teachers will say ""my way is the correct way"", but the only ""correct"" way is the way that gets you to feel successful with your voice. There will be overlapping themes in most teachers approaches, so if you can tap into that, you can get the most out of it.

I think the other thought I have is that some people think choir singing is solo singing or mix singing. Choir singing is a very specific type, to create a very specific sound. Often, choir leaders will have you lift your eyebrows or lift the corners of your mouth to brighten the sound. This is a quick fix, but can add unnecessary tension to the throat and the mouth. Do it for your choir leader when they ask for it, but for solo singing, focus on relaxation.

The last thing, I think, is duplicating the tension that you see from singers on screen. That tension is a backup, and only should be used when needed. But to approach the entire voice with the tension ""attack"" is the wrong way to go about it. Don't use your nitro immediately, just use it when you're running out of gas.

**Second Question**: [What would you say to help such an absolute beginner get started?](http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/pmc35/vocal_coach_question_request_thread_feb_12_2012/c3qhxfc)

*My Answer:* Sing sing sing. Just keep singing. Sing as much as you can. Sing in front of people. Sing alone. Sing in the shower. Sing to the radio and to music you have playing. The more you play with your voice, the more you're going to be able to take control of it. And do go see a voice teacher. Even if it's just once, it's going to be able to point you in the right direction.

And in terms of singing in front of people: don't think about talent. Think about having fun. The more fun you have, the more comfortable you're going to be, and the better you'll sound. If you're scared, it's going to come through your voice. Singing is fun, and you should use it to have fun.

Hope that all helps guys. I'll start a new question thread at the end of the week!

For those of you who aren't really in to classical singing, [Bonney is a world-renowned vocalist of art songs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Bonney) and for musical reference, [here she is singing Ave Maria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gap6wFS6_-w). A masterclass is basically a voice lesson in front of an audience - so Bonney taught students in front of an audience for a few hours.

ANYWAY. That's what prompted this post.

She discussed getting over stage fright, which prompted this post. She discussed that getting nervous or having stage fright comes from the fear of not doing well.

There is nothing to be afraid of on the stage. The worst thing that will happen is that you'll have a bad performance. The more you worry about it, the worse your performance will be. You're not a surgeon, where a poor performance could lead to the death of another person. Don't allow yourself to worry so much!

Of course, that's easier said than done, so here are some tips (not necessarily discussed at the masterclass) that can help you get over stage fright.

* **BEFORE YOU EVEN WALK ON THE STAGE, KNOW ALL OF YOUR MUSIC FRONTWAYS, BACKWAYS, AND SIDEWAYS.** Think about it - all of your favorite actors have all of their lines (and their partners) memorized, your favorite teachers know exactly what they're going to teach that day, chefs make sure they have all of the ingredients and recipes they'll need. No one that was ever good at something half-assed the prep work. Know your words, know your music, *know what message and emotion you're trying to inflict upon the audience.* If you're singing something in a different language, you best have your translations SOLID (word for word, you need to know that ""coeur"" in French means heart, not the three words before it in the poetic translations). This will not only make you feel more comfortable because you know you know your shit, but your performance will be better because you won't be struggling to figure out the words that start the next verse. Prep work also includes getting enough sleep, drinking enough water, and other general taking-care of yourself topics.

* Before walking on stage, find a time to center and collect yourself. Take as much time as you need. If you need to tell your friends to skeedaddle an hour before you go on stage because you need time to calm yourself, do so. If you work best by socializing and distracting yourself before you go on stage, do so. I personally find the former more helpful, but different strokes for different folks. I've seen the latter work for others. Just know what you're doing.

* **[POWER POSE!](http://www.businessinsider.com/power-pose-2013-5?op=1)** Sure it looks silly to do, but taking a minute and physically taking up as much space as possible does some shenanigans to your chemical make-up that *really does make you feel more confident, and takes away the nerves.* I've read the science, I've tried it myself. I can't say that it's wrong. Plus, you get the added bonus of the next point.
* Be able to make fun of yourself. The reason you're so afraid is because you take yourself too seriously. You have to be able to look at yourself in the mirror and laugh. I once was so nervous to get a 3 page aria right, that I cut out a page and a half of it, and skipped right to the end. Well, now that's known as ""Vissi D'arte, the abridged version by Ghoti023."" There's a girl from my school who last summer was doing a summer program in a germanic country - and she was singing with the orchestra. She forgot ALL of the words, and she had to make up 4 minutes of German... to an all German audience. WHOOPS. We're both still performing (she just got back from a jazz tour that went to France and some shenanigans), neither of our reputations are permanently damaged, any one that we could have been singing for that would have given us a job wrote it off that we were young (younger than 22). You gotta love yourself, you gotta love what you do, and you gotta be okay with mistakes - because no performance is perfect. That's the beauty of live performance. It's never the same twice.
* **HAVE FUN!!!!** If you're not having fun, the audience is going to tell. It's really obvious, and no one wants that experience, it's awkward for all parties. The Audience is generally rather forgiving (why do you think they're in the audience, and not on stage themselves? Shit's hard yo) so relax. You're doing what you love, and even if you goof, there are still very few people who can say that they do what they love, even as a hobby. Lots of people struggle to find something they love to do for their life. Enjoy what you do. 
* As pointed out by /u/zerocoke below, perform as much as possible! The more you do it, the easier it gets because you become more and more comfortable with the situation. This same logic also applies to auditions and competitions! The more you do it, the more relaxed about it you'll be. It's hard to put your nose to the grind and face your fears like that, but ""practice makes perfect"" is a saying for a reason. The more you do it, the better you'll get at it.

We've all heard the ""your body is your instrument"" speech. (Or if you haven't let me know and I'll fill you in).

As pressures rise for singers attempting to go into the professional field to be Hollywood-hot, I just want to emphasize that *not all bodies are created the same*. It's not important, or good, for your voice to not eat or eat in an incredibly unhealthy fashion. What's good for your body is what's good for your voice.

Singing is becoming a more televised event, pressuring those (both men and women) who wish to be on the stage to be picture perfect. Well guys, if I followed what a BMI chart told me, I'd look akin to [this](http://theviewspaper.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/Skeleton-Woman.jpg).

This isn't to say that thin singers are bad singers either. EVERYONES BODY IS DIFFERENT. Some people are made to be small and thin, and some people are made to be bigger.

I just want to take this time to remind everyone to just be healthy. Exercise, drink water, eat well, and your voice will thank you for it. Your breath connection will be better, you'll have more energy for a performance, and you'll feel better about yourself. I promise you'll notice a difference in your singing for the better. You only get one voice, and one body. Whether you like it or not, your voice is integrated with the rest of your body, so take care of the whole package.

Based on feedback, I have set up a preorder page for the full 12 week boot camp. For as little as $25, you can help make this happen. I may also begin an official kickstarter.com project to help us get there. The 10 day course is free, a gift from me to you.

Early birds get special perks like live Skype lessons with me and a free copy of our upcoming 12 week guitar boot camp.

Last but not least, if we reach 20 preorders today I will commit to running a paid reddit ad during May. This will help ensure that we meet the funding goals and makes this project a reality.",,False,,t5_2rlcx,False,,star,True,t3_1dk0zj,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/1dk0zj/update_free_10day_singing_boot_camp/,

I will use Freddie Mercury and Meat Loaf as examples.  Specifically, these two singers could belt up to around C5 in their primes.

How were they able to get so much power on their high notes?  Were they ""naturals"" who had intuitively good technique for mixed voice or head voice or belting?  Did their chest voices extend much higher than most males?  Did they push or use unhealthy techniques to get the power?  Were they just freaks of nature with unique bodies and vocal chords that allowed them to do this?  With training, can I expect to be able to belt high notes?

1364399749.0,10,self.singing,1b466y,What's the most effective way to give constructive criticism to other musicians/singers without hurting anyone's feelings?,10,0,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/1b466y/whats_the_most_effective_way_to_give_constructive/,"I naturally have a thick skin, and have learned to take harsh but valid criticism well, and because I live with other people with thick skins, we tend to give each other straightforward and honest criticism.  This honest bluntness has translated well into my voice lessons and studio class (small venue performing w/comments from audience afterwards), however, today we were prompted by the instructor to provide some constructive criticism, and I managed to send a trombonist from my conducting class off the podium in tears with what I thought was simply an observation she should be aware of (and a comment I hear quite often word for word from my voice teacher when singing lieder).  While I know my point was valid (she had a very pained/sad look on her face, and since the song was happy, it was a weird juxtaposition and definitely had a negative effect on the playing/ made me and presumably other people in the ensemble feel awkward), addressing it directly was obviously a bad idea, particularly with my natural tendency toward blunt comparison (I said from her facial expression it looked like she was conducting a funeral march, and maybe a facial expression that was less sad would better fit the jaunty nature of the piece which, while completely true, was apparently not wise). 

I would like to be able to give valid criticism without coming off as harsh, but, having had very little practice, I'm not sure how to do that.  She didn't really have many positive things beyond the basics going on, and I think reaching too far to use the sandwich method by giving a compliment like ""your 3/4 pattern was in time"" is just as bad as saying ""nothing you did was good."" I mean, every performer knows what you really mean when you say ""well, you look lovely tonight, but..."".


So here's the question.  In situations like this, do you acknowledge problem(s) directly, obliquely, or do you just jump straight into suggesting a solution without letting them know specifically what the problem was?  Do you handle constructive criticism differently in one-on-one versus in a group?  Is it significantly different case-by-case?  Also, any tips from those of you who give constructive criticism to musicians successfully and often would be appreciated!

I have been trying to draw inspiration from other covers that I think really show a new side to songs. These are the things I've picked up on so far:

[Kanye West - Gold Digger ft. Jamie Foxx](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vwNcNOTVzY)

[Lucy Spraggan - Gold Digger](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enG44JMUUZY)

- Speed up the tempo (not sure if appropriate for a sad song)
- Use different instruments (the audition is acapella)

[The Postal Service - Such Great Heights](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wrsZog8qXg)

[Iron and Wine - Such Great Heights](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKGHkBComjM)

- Slow down the tempo (possible as long as it doesn't make the song boring)
- Sing in head voice as opposed to chest voice (definite no, I like to sing exclusively in chest voice)

[Yeah Yeah Yeahs - Maps](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIIxlgcuQRU)

[The Fray - Maps](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwtuJdh6McA)

- Change the key/notes (that would be great, except idk how to do that lol)
- Have a super distinctive voice (that would also be great but I unfortunately don't have one)

**Your Voice: An Inside View by Scott McCoy**: A living legend, this book is one of the most used textbooks for vocal pedagogy classes today. I do recommend the second edition as the CD is easier to work, and the CD is *very* helpful, filled with videos and explanations of what he talks about in the book.

**The Diagnosis and Correction of Vocal Faults by James McKinney**: Very similar to Richard Miller's book, this book discusses specific issues that many singers encounter and offers helpful solutions to each of them. This one includes a CD as well.

**Vocal Wisdom by Giovanni Lamperti**: One of the fathers of modern pedagogy, this book offers origins to many of common pedagogical ideas today. This reference also provides a great baseline for the commonly used ""bel canto"" technique.

**Great Singers on Great Singing by Jerome Hines**: This book features interviews of some of the most famous classical singers of the last generation on their technique. They give information such as what warm ups they do, why they do them, what their training consisted of, and advice to the young singer.

**A Soprano on Her Head by Eloise Ristad**: A light-hearted book with many personal stories of different musicians, this book is a great commentary on the art of practicing, relaxation, and enjoying your art form.

But I wonder how many of you are singing along to your favorite tunes. A lot, I'm guessing. I figured something out once, and it really helped me turn a corner.

I figured out that, when I'm singing along, if I can hear my own voice, I'm screwing up. You aren't actually on your note with the recording until you hear your voice ""disappear"". It's counterintuitive, because you'll be trying to hear yourself, and probably be singing about a half step out of tune. When you sing the precise same note as the recorded singer, your voice will blend with theirs, exactly as if you were doubling vocals in the studio. So you won't hear yourself, even though you actually are hearing yourself, you'll hear the recorded singer. When your voice gets tough to distinguish, NOW baby, you're a singin' it.

Once I figured that out, I got better. This exact same principle can be applied to matching notes against a guitar or piano. Which is also  a smart exercise.

Anyway, happy yodeling everybody.

Unless I am using the wrong term... but anyway I need help with strengthening my voice. 

If I sing or raise my voice at all, my voice is very weak. I've been writing songs and music and I would like to start recording it. I think my voice sounds okay (not great) depending on the style, and I think I'm pretty good at singing on key and improvising, but the strength is just not there. It sounds really weak, I can't get into mix, I don't think I have ever even sang in my chest voice... It's not that it's ""breathy"", or ""pitchy"", it's just really weak.

[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfXWrLpkSas&amp;t=1m22s) is an example of what I mean. I am absolutely NOT hating on her but her voice is extremely weak in this instance and it demonstrates the problem perfectly. 

So how would I fix that problem? How would I give my voice strength? I'm not going to try and be some kind of opera singer, but I'd like to be able to sing/record/perform. 

I know people will say to find a teacher. But I need to strengthen my voice a little before I can find a teacher because I have no confidence or self-esteem to sing to one without having at least SOMETHING to show them. Also I'm barely scraping by and have no money and I absolutely can't risk getting a terrible coach that will harm me in the long run (and not just financially). 

ANY help at all would be greatly appreciated; as with many of you this is my dream and I want to get there before it's too late.

I am looking at a Fauré song to sing for a little church service this summer, but I admit I struggle a little bit with my diction at a few spots. I know there are lots of really awesome singers here who might be able to help either answer some questions or point me in the direction of a good resource for this, so... Thank you in advanced!

The lyrics are [here](http://www.recmusic.org/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=2882), and music [here](http://imslp.org/wiki/En_pri%C3%A8re_(Faur%C3%A9,_Gabriel\)).

Specific questions: 

* ""devant Vous à genoux"" - does the ""s"" elide?
* Same with ""pour enseigner vos lois"" - does the ""r"" elide?
* ""avec humilité"" - is there a glottal between avec and humilité, or should the ""c"" elide with ""hu-"" (the ""h"" is silent, right?)
* ""Nécessaire"" - is the second syllable (""ces"") [ə] or [ɛ]?
* ""Pour apaiser les maux"" - another question about elision, between ""pour"" and ""apaiser"". Can you tell I forget my elision rules too often? D:
* ""Révèlez Vous à moi"" - another question about elision (vous à). I am just double checking because I suck at this
* ""Seigneur en qui je crois"" - elision again?
* ""Pour Vous je veux souffrir et mourir"" - another possible elision?

Okay. Whew! I think that's all that I had questions on. If someone could point me to a quick resource, by the way, on French vowel elision rules, that would be helpful for me too, since as you can tell that's a big part of my problem here. So confusing!

Sometimes I.... for lack of a better word, choke when I sing. I start coughing, the kind of cough that is deep and if you keep coughing that way, you throw up, and even if I stop myself before I cough, my voice still gets a little hoarse. I get really red faced and teary eyed and I have to stop for a minute or two before I can start again.

I THINK, it kind of feels like, it's as if my uvula drops down between my vocal folds. Maybe that is what is causing me to choke. But that's crazy, right? My uvula isn't that long... I think...

If it helps at all, I have a stutter. So I, of course, deal with the things that come along with that. I don't talk often, probably making my voice not as strong as a normal person's. My voice has been said to be pretty delicate. Maybe my muscles are so used to being tensed weird from my stutter that I might forget to hold them correctly when I sing, causing my uvula to drop down and choke myself?

1362453387.0,8,self.singing,19olzk,"Dear John(s) (and Janes),",9,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/19olzk/dear_johns_and_janes/,"I've noticed that there have been quite a few posts from the gentlemen of this subreddit as of late asking for help as to help figuring out what their voice type is. COOL! It's really awesome that you're this stoked about singing that you really want to make sure you have a healthy and knowledgeable approach to your singing and choosing songs for you to sing.

There have been a few articles written about [range](http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/13kj4i/your_singing_and_your_range_a_letter_of_my/), but none super-officiall-y (that I can find) to help actually determine your range!

So dudes- What you need to know, for certain, is that your voice will not stop growing or determining where it will ""sit"" until your mid to late twenties. You start puberty later than most girls, and your voice has a lot more it has to do in order to mature from its boy-sopranohood of your youth. For this reason, I strongly encourage not being too terribly tied to any voice-type assignment. (Ladies, your voices don't settle till at least your early 20s, many of you later, but a good chunk of the time the ""settling"" your voice does doesn't really change you between an alto and a soprano at least as drastically. In short, it's different.)

So, now that you're aware that your voice type may change any week, you need to know that more than just range goes into determining your voice type. Here's a good list of things of ""what to do"" in order to figure this out (this list also applies for ladies).

1) **Be honest to yourself about where it's comfortable to sing.** For starters, your falsetto does not count as a part of determining your range unless you're studying to be a [countertenor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lyw6mAwVMA). I'm sure that all of you guys can determine your range from your squeakiest of highs to your graveliest of lows (and you should make note of where those spots are, so you can progress to them with practice n' stuff), but in order to find music that's good for you to sing (not just classical stuff) you need to know where you sing the easiest, and what parts of your voice are actually usable on a performance basis, and what needs to be worked on.

2) **Know your range.** As I said above, range does go in to determining voice type. Basses aren't probably going to have a high C in their head voice, and would probably have to switch into falsetto (this is not a steadfast rule. Basses can and do have high C's). So know what your range is, that'll help you.

3) **What is the spot in your range that is easiest to sing?** This is what classical folks call the tessitura. It's where your voice sits the best. This isn't just where it's the easiest to sing, more importantly, it's the place that you can sing the longest. A baritone for example, probably wouldn't do well on a song that sits on an E (above middle C) for a really long time. Sure, they've got the note, but it's probably a little more comfortable for them to sing forever on a lower pitch.

4) **Where does your voice feel like it needs to switch from chest voice to headvoice?** We've all felt it, that weak spot of notes inbetween our chest and head voices. That terrible, awful, wretched, piece of crap, spot. Well, if it sits rather high for you, you're probably a higher voice. If it sits pretty low, you're probably a lower voice. This is what is called the passaggio.

5) **What tone does your voice have?** If your tone is lighter, and brighter, you're *more likely* to be a high baritone or a tenor. If your tone is darker and chocolatier, you're *more likely* to be a lower baritone/bass. This isn't always the case. There are plenty of meaty sopranos/tenors, and lighter baritones/altos. (Light basses are really odd, but they do happen. Sometimes). This is why you gotta know your range and tessitura.

These things put together will help you get a general idea of what your voice type may be. Keep in mind that it's always subject to change. Women of this subreddit: everything I just said is pretty much applicable to you as well, just replace ""Tenors"" and ""baritones"" with ""sopranos"" and ""altos."" Women's voices occupy a smaller amount of octaves than men's voices do, but it's the same general concepts.

There are a bunch of places online to find references for all of these things. [This](http://www.library.yale.edu/cataloging/music/vocalrg.htm) is a pretty okay one to work off of for a reference. Just you know, be aware that it's not set in stone. Plenty of each voice type have ranges that are both higher and lower than what's written on that staff. It's just a guideline.

Well, I hope this was helpful. As always, I'm open for questions, PMs, and healthy discussions. :)",,False,,t5_2rlcx,False,,star,True,t3_19olzk,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/19olzk/dear_johns_and_janes/,

This song is very intriguing for me. Now, I am very ignorant when it comes to singing, but I would like to know some more about this song and I thought this might be the right subreddit to ask a few questions.

There is no doubt in my mind that Dallas Green is a great singer but I was wondering about what /r/singing thinks about his technical skills and the way he sings.

Is this song sang all in falsetto? If not is any of it sang in falsetto? It really seems to me that everything is in falsetto but, like I said, I am very ignorant. If it contains a lot of falsetto, is that a good thing? How tough is that on the vocal chords? How does he keep his voice under such control while using falsetto? 

Is this song even impressive to you guys? I was actually blown away by the way he sings, and I just don't understand how he does it. I even think no one could really sound like he does in this song. Would any of you guys cover this and prove me wrong? I need to know if it's possible.

Sorry if those are too many questions. Also, if this is the wrong subreddit, please tell me about it in the comments and I won't make the same mistake.

Background: I did musical theater and took 9 years of college-level vocal training with a coach before college. When I got to college, I wanted to be in a rock band/a capella group. Was told that my voice is too distinctive/doesn't blend in a capella groups, didn't want to do choral stuff or more musical theater.

Now, as a senior, I'm really depressed: my voice has fallen out of shape because I don't have anywhere to practice singing. I have a BIG voice, and when I'm practicing notes at the edge of my range, I make BIG ugly noises. I live in an apartment complex. There is a music practice hall on campus, but it's not soundproofed and the orchestra kids use it too. I get so embarrassed even though people can't see me there (there are individual practice rooms) because you can still hear me VERY clearly, and don't want to be disruptive. I also get embarrassed singing popular music in a classical/jazz oriented department. 

Apart from getting over my embarrassment/self-consciousness that my voice needs some work again, where can I go to practice? Where do college singers or people in bands USUALLY practice? Do I just not belt anymore, and wait a year to go find an apartment I can soundproof?

[Rahl001:](http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/qhf1y/vocal_coach_question_request_thread_mar_4_2012/c3xr81s)
&gt;I am curious to how I can relieve all the tension in my throat. I've had a few voice lessons in the past and I've figured out that's my primary problem when trying to sing high notes... however I can't seem to figure out how to use the breathing exercises that I've found online to help me relax. A simple and CLEAR (long-term?) guide on what to do to relieve my tension would be invaluable to me, and I hope many others.
&gt;

**My answer:**  A lot of what you're experiencing may also include tongue, palette, and jaw tension. The best advise I can give is try focusing on not using ANY muscle to sing for a bit. Like you're lazy (or drunk if you're of age).

But if you want a great metaphor: if you can think about going up the register not like stairs, but like **walking on a level street, one step at a time**, in that you're keeping your larynx stable and low, and your head relaxed. The more you keep the sound ""on the ground"" and not ""in the treetops"", you can release some of that tension. I think as you go up the scale, you're probably hiking up your larynx, which is going to create throat tension.

The other thought would be this: have you had a massage lately? Sometimes a massage can help clear up excess tension you've been having. Also, a vibrating neck massager and/or a [TheraCane
](http://amzn.com/B000PRMCJU) are good tools to quickly relieve tension, and good to play with during a warmup.

[oh_fuck:](http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/qhf1y/vocal_coach_question_request_thread_mar_4_2012/c3xoqha)
&gt;My friend and I argue about this all the time. He has a beautiful voice, and always has, whereas my voice is just not appealing to the ears. He says ""anyone can learn to sing"" whereas I say ""you can't just the natural timbre of your voice"". Which one of us do you think would be right?

**My answer:**  You can't just the natural timbre of your voice? Did you accidentally the whole thing? I try to just the natural timbre all the time.

Just kidding.

Anyone can learn to sing. It's a matter of biological coordination and calibrating your hearing.

The biggest stumbling block that a lot of people have is ""I don't sound good"". Bullshit. You're hearing your voice though muscle and bone and brain. You can't hear yourself the way other people here you.

And the other side is that ""the tone isn't good"". There are plenty of successful musicians who have a strange or different tone. There are markets for everyone.

But my final answer: anyone can learn to sing. It's just a matter of practice.

[dukedog:](http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/qhf1y/vocal_coach_question_request_thread_mar_4_2012/c3xp88j)
&gt;What are some different techniques for improving resonance in the mask and improving tone in general?

**My answer:** This is a quick one - keep having a round tone by keeping the soft palatte relaxed and up, larynx down, and try to feel the sound ""spinning"" against the soft palatte. And when in doubt, on lines when you have a lot of different vowels, try to make the vowels sound similar. Kind of like with an Irish accent on the vowels. This keeps them narrow, and more resonant.

I've read morons who try to tell students to physically sing the pulsation instead of letting it happen naturally. If this is your view, I am sorry to offend, but you're wrong.


I've read from people who say it's a simple variation in pitch produced by the free oscillation of the vocal folds. Well, I agree with the ""free"" part, but oscillation of the vocal folds just produces a tone. Does that mean 70 y/o women have especially ""free"" vocal folds?


The way I have always understood vibrato is as a muscular process. To quote John Large:


&gt;The vibrato is a modulation of frequency and amplitude resulting from the pendulum-like movements of the intrinsic laryngeal musculature. These movements are said to prevent fatigue at the laryngeal level; in other words the musculature is alternately working and resting in vibrato. In the production of straight tone the musculature is constantly working. - NATS Bulletin 1976.


This makes sense to me because the younger you are, they ""younger"" your folds are, the less they need to rest. Thats why vibrato comes with age, as the muscles get to a level of maturity where the healthiest way for them to do their job is to constantly release then engage. It also explains why vibrato gets larger as you get older since your folds need longer to rest.


I'm curious to hear other understandings as well.",,False,,t5_2rlcx,False,,,True,t3_jw5yb,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/jw5yb/fellow_pedagogs_and_pros_what_is_your/,

Anyone else interested now that it's starting to take off? I'm going to work on finding a piece for us to do over the next few days. I'm thinking a madrigal, or some other easy SATB piece just to get an idea of what we're going to sound like and how this is going to work.

So the way i'm envisioning this working is that I'll pick a piece, get music to everyone. I'll also provide a recording or a midi to help with part learning.

Here's what I'm unsure of what to do next. Should we base our recording off of a another recording to help keep pitch and tempo, or should we go off of a conducting video? If we did the later, I'm not sure what we could use for pitch stabilization.

Post ideas. Anyone who would like to join the choir, please include your voice part in the comment.

In Singing Success, he talks about the tenor's first bridge quite frequently, which is E, F and F#, which I have lots of trouble hitting. I understand the basics of chest voice and head voice, and realize that this ""bridge"" is somewhere in between. I can hit the pitches and I can  go from the bottom of my voice to the top and back down without any breaks or cracks. But there's a difference between hitting a note and singing a note. Whenever I try to sustain anything in the ""bridge"" with anything louder than a hum, it starts to sound crackly and almost like i need to clear my throat. I generally try to stay away from doing so in case that I am doing more harm than good.

Whenever I pass this ""bridge"", my voice has a noticeable change in tone. It's not breathy, but it is definitely lacking body.

I'm aware that there are certain changes in the throat throughout the day, if I recall correctly, most people's throat/lung capacity is more restricted in the morning and opens up later in the day. Is this the cause of the tonality variance?

The thing is, I like both voices, the morning voice is great for when I want to sing stronger lines, and Johnny Cash style deep vocals, and at night I can sing Bon Iver style falsetto. It's kind of annoying only being able to properly sing certain styles at certain times of day though.

Is there a way to train my voice to be more consistent? Ideally, I've love to have access to both tonalities, but if there's a middle ground that would be good too.

Well, I have always considered myself a really really terrible singer. No range, power, projection, pitch, wimpy tone, etc etc. The last year or so I have been putting quite a bit of time into singing/while playing guitar. I have been playing guitar for several years, and I am actually a pretty decent guitar player, but I have noticed that my singing and playing both go to hell when I am doing them together. 

Anyway, I have made truly massive strides (as difficult as it may be to tell from the recording, haha). I have made huge improvements in all areas, but I have a long way to go. I know/I am sure I have a lot of bad habits and I would like some feedback on changing those. 

I can hear I am off key quite badly in some parts, and would like feedback there too, or anywhere really. I know I am pretty ""yell-ey"" in spots, I would like to reduce that, and I have to a degree. But I do not want to lose the rasp entirely either. 

I am interested in classical singing/training as far as it helping me in my preferred style of music (I would say folk/rock/pop like Mumford and Sons, Swell Season, Trampled by Turtles), and I think my rasp/yell thing is a bit too harsh for that music (not to mention loud as crap, which might not be a terrible thing, I don't know). Like on some of the notes in Mumford where he gets pretty raspy, but I have to get even more so to grab those notes with my chest voice. One thing I know I want is a bit softer high range, and a harsher or stronger low end if that makes sense. 

I do focus on using my diaphragm to breath, and it has developed in strength greatly, but needs lots of work I know. Disclaimer: 1st take, single take on my laptop (sorry for the super bad quality), and I really sucked it up in parts. But I figured I might as well just post it up and see what you guys can tell me. 

I see some posts here about people asking for feedback and then not really responding. I will appreciate and respond to all feedback. I have severe performance anxiety (just singing), to the point where I can't even sing in front of bandmates (or family or friends or whatever) without my throat closing up and my heart pounding. So this might be the perfect place to start. Even uploading a song that I sang to a group of strangers is daunting. 

I have always thought I had a terrible voice. Now I am seeing a little light at the end of the tunnel...but it still sounds really bad, and I know I have a long ways to go. I took singing lessons a few years ago and stopped, and really wish I hadn't. I will be enrolling in the summer for private voice lessons at the local university if finances allow, I am very serious about becoming a good singer. Music is the only thing I really like to do, and I have been really letting myself backslide these last years in practice and therefore talent, but the singing has reinvigorated me, and given me passion for something I had lost passion for. 

As a sidenote, singers that I really really like would be ones like Jeff Buckley, Miles Kennedy of Alter Bridge, Chris Cornell, and lately I have really been enjoying the singer of Mumford and Sons, I think he has a really good voice. 

Anyway, I can tell there is a real wealth of info here, and I thank you in advance for your help.

P.S. If you made it through all that, I guess I can at least put the link, lol.

 I turned 20 a few months ago, and although I've been singing all my life (I allegedly sang before I spoke), I've never done it in front of anyone or received voice lessons of any kind, the latter of which I'm interested in. I'd really like to take singing more seriously as it's something that I genuinely enjoy. I like to sing all kinds of music, but I'd like to get some thoughts on what my voice is best suited to so that I can proceed from here.

1) [""Skinny Love"" - Birdy cover](http://soundcloud.com/jenniferdone/skinny-love)

- Genre: Indie/folk. Personally, I think this soft and breathy kind of stuff is what suits my voice best, but it can get a bit repetitive after a while, so it would be nice to know if I can do other music, too.

2) [""Think of Me"" - Phantom of the Opera cover](http://soundcloud.com/jenniferdone/think-of-me)

- Genre: Choral/opera. Obviously, this isn't going to sound very good because I've had zero training, but let me know if you think I have any potential (if you can tell from just one song!).

3) [""Hiding My Heart"" - Adele cover](http://soundcloud.com/jenniferdone/hiding-my-heart-adele-cover)

- Genre: Pop/soul. This is a stronger sound, and it's a style that I really enjoy singing, but I don't know if my voice contains enough power to pull it off.

It might be a bit much to ask people to review three songs in full, so feel free to just listen to a little of each or even just one and offer some constructive criticism.

I've just recently started singing. I sing punk rock, and I really dig that gritty buzzy sound that you can hear from Less Than Jake, Social Distortion, Flogging Molly, etc.  I feel like since I've started that I've managed to condition my voice to a sound that reflects the above.

Since I've been on here, I've seen countless posts about screwing up your voice. Pictures of nodes and posts about long term damage. So, I definitely have a fear of screwing with my voice. Especially since I'm looking for a rougher sound.

I can't say I've noticed any negative effects of what I would consider ""getting my voice in shape"", which is sort of the mindset I've always heard/believed was how one cultivated their vocal sound.  I do have a little fatigue/soreness after band practice, but this is after singing for several hours so I figure this was normal. The effects don't last more than a few hours. I always wake up the next day feeling fine.  Also, I have a set of songs in the vocal style I'm aiming at that I make a point of singing along to in the car on the way home from work. So, for a good half hour of solid, aggressive singing, I can say I don't notice any fatigue.

So the question I have is, am I still on the road to ruin? I usually warm up with a few quick lip rolls and breathing. That and one particular song by LTJ (the brightest bulb has burned out) seems to be the perfect warmup for me.

I took a few lessons from Ben Alfree (the dude that posts about free lessons over Skype) but my schedule has been nuts lately, so the best I've been able to do is the Zen of Screaming. But I haven't really sat down with it and worked on the techniques much.

This isn't a plea for technique. More just a general question of is it possible to build your voice like a muscle, or will I, absent of technique, end up just damaging my voice?

My sinuses were never, and I mean never, not somewhat stuffed. Turned out to be a problem caused by my wisdom teeth, which, since being out for two weeks, I haven't had a stuffy nose or headache since.

But anyway, one night I was with a girlfriend and she was tweezing stray hairs on (off?) of my neck. She decides to turn her tweezers on my nostrils, and lo and behold I can breathe more clearly than I had in years. I experimented a little, but it didn't take me long to find that plucking a hair or two out of your nose will cause your sinuses to drain and expand. It's just that simple, but there are a couple things to keep in mind to make it most effective.

1) It's gotta hurt. That's the whole point, but it'll only sting for a millisecond.
2) I'm the only person I know who's done this, so the time might vary from person to person, but I got hours out of it.
3) Your eyes will water, your nose will run, but within a minute or two it'll clear up and you'll be good.
4) The hairs on your septum are the most painful, but most effective.

So, there it is. I could imagine this working for a pre-gig situation, or literally any scenario where you want the crap in your stuffed sinuses to gtfo. I'd definitely love to hear some feedback on it, if anyone else tries it. It worked better than any nasal spray or decongestant ever did for me. Sometimes the weirdest things are the best.

TL:DR- Had stuffed sinuses. Gf tweezed a nose hair. Presto change-o, I can breathe. Do this if you need to clear your sinuses, but it has to hurt to work.",,False,,t5_2rlcx,False,,,True,t3_qpsvl,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/qpsvl/a_weird_but_good_tip_for_any_singer_with_stuffed/,

I'm sure other vocal coaches teaching different styles will help someone attain a good voice but reading SLS testimonials leads me to believe it's some sort of elite way of singing :S 


I would like to know how to sing, but I'm not great. I am fine with singing the melodies of songs, but it does just sound like different pitches of speech. Very boring, no strength, not much range, no vibrato, etc. My mom and dad are both performers and both have great singing voices but I worry I don't have anything close to this. My brother has tried singing for a while too but doesn't sound great either, same problems as me.

I don't want to perform, even sing publicly, just have a good shower voice:) It's very difficult finding male only choirs around my town too for practise, and about as hard to find a vocal coach.

I have a request, and if this is in the wrong subreddit, please let me know.

Every October, a group of friends and I go to a cottage, where we split into teams, and compete in various feats of strength, games, and other various challenges while drinking.  It's called 'Octoberman'.

This year, I would like to have a custom opening ceremonies song, and thus, I have written some lyrics, to be sung to the tune of Amazing Grace, accompanied by bagpipes.  [Example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V84STSWVp3g)  Problem is, I'm a terrible singer.

So, I'm asking you for help.  I will leave this open until the end of August, and although I can't pay much, I am willing to purchase **3 months of reddit gold** to the entry that I choose.  I'm not looking for professional quality, just a decent singing voice.  Passion is a plus!  :)

Ideally your entry has the bagpipe accompaniment, however if not, I should be able to figure out a way to record the two together.

The lyrics; (I'm also no poet, so if you'd like to improve it, please do!)

**Octoberman the time has come
You've counted down the days
Giveth thyself unto the booze
The trophy shall you raise

You'll clash with foe from dawn to dusk
Two brothers by your side
So grab your nuts and bring your beers
And take the field with pride

The paddle boat will cause great pain
The boulder toss brings fame
There's ladder golf and football toss
And definitely shame

Octoberman the time has come
You've counted down the days
Giveth thyself unto the booze
The trophy shall you raise**

I've always gotten fatigued very quickly and my throat hurts a lot when I sing, even though I'm not in bad shape -- it turns out I've been using twice as much effort to sing, and placing pressure predominantly on my larynx and in my throat and mouth instead of in my lungs and diaphragm. I've been trying for MONTHS to get the tension out of my neck and tongue, which invariably tighten up EVERY time I sing and especially when I try to sing higher notes. I don't know how to release the tension! Part of the reason I developed it, I think, is because I'm very self-conscious about my voice -- I have a really nice one, but kids in chorus when I was younger used to tell me I was too loud and I started constricting my throat to dampen the volume and not let as much sound come out. Also, I don't like making mistake so when I'm trying higher notes -- the ones I'm not as confident in that are out of my natural range-- I don't really 'go for it' because I'm afraid it will sound bad and just tail off. I also don't want to annoy any neighbors if I practice in my apartment so even when I tell myself to just sing and if someone has a problem they'll tell me, I keep subconsciously making my voice quieter which for me means constricting the throat and having everything hurt AND having bad tone.

I know that singers usually start at an early age and that I lack of simply everthing, but as soon as I dared to let music get back into my life, it just claimed everything.

Also, since I don't have the copyright to the vocals on the remixes I've done of Adele, Gotye etc, I can never release those remixes. What I'd like to do is turn the music into my own track and have a vocalist sing over them, creating a new track that would be all our own....

The faculty of the music department said that it was my best yet, and I've heard lots of good feedback from my colleagues, but I'm tempted to just leave the music department all together and never sing again.

My voice has developed exponentially since my first semester, but I'm still worlds behind most of the other vocal majors in our tiny music department. It's incredibly disheartening, and I'm not too sure my voice teacher (a mezzo) really understands my voice or how to help me grow (she hasn't classified me past ""some kind of weird soprano"", which is lovely). There has been a colleague who made a comment about 'how nice it is to have an actual alto singing alto instead of shitty sopranos like ShittySoprano!' among other rather kind remarks. Said colleague and my voice teacher would also run 20 to 30 minutes over into my lesson time every week which was *totally* acceptable and something I appreciated. 

On that note, let me say that the head of the music department *and* our choir director have both said I *am* the alto section- and it has absolutely nothing to do with my skills as a soprano and more with the fact that they needed altos when I came into college and had 6 years of ensemble alto experience. If nothing else, I make a damn good alto. 

I just feel as if I'm not going anywhere. I'm not a performance major, so as long as my juries are good enough that I'm not put on probation I'm realistically fine, but I want to sing pretty soprano arias and art songs instead of pieces with a low(ish) tessitura that shows the ugliest parts of my voice as a means of building up the area around my passagio.

So, here's the backstory.  I've been an avid musical theater fan since childhood, but never had the confidence to sing in public.  I played pit orchestra and did makeup in high school to be a part of the musicals, but never got a role because I always choked in auditions.  Finally, in college, I forced myself to face my fears and took the lowest level voice class, where I had to sing in front of a class of 5.  Loved it, took a year of Women's Choir, and private voice lessons (classical/opera.)

I know that although I don't have the best singing voice, I have a good enough voice to be in the chorus of a show, or maybe a small part.  I auditioned for Chicago at my local community theater last year, but I bombed the dance audition.  

This year, they're doing The Music Man.  I want to be in the ensemble so badly.  I've never been in a musical, and it's one of the things I've wanted to do most for my entire life.

In choir I'm a first soprano, but when I get nervous (like when I'm singing alone), I'm more of a 2nd soprano.  Please help me think of a song to sing for my audition.  I'm too nervous to choose one on my own.  I'm better at character pieces than ballads.  Any advice you can give would be appreciated.  Sorry if this isn't the best place to post.

Now as you can imagine, I freaked out a bit. I wondered if my range would stay that high, or what. Long story short as I continued to be sick my range dropped down as per usual and now that I've recovered my range is again sitting right about up to an F4.

Has anyone had this type of thing happen to them? Does this mean that I could increase my range up to a B5 if I really work at it? I don't know. Mainly I just want to know if this was a freak accident or if range increasing upon getting sick just sometimes happens.

I've been debating posting here for awhile.  Tonight I decided that was silly because you all seem very nice and I'd like to get better if possible. 

Here's the story in a nutshell: years ago I had a couple people tell me never to sing again, and listened to them for a couple years.  My wonderful roommate decided to break me out of that shell, and although he's musically talented, he's not much of a teacher.  He thinks there's something wrong with my intonation, and I'm inclined to agree-when I sing, it feels more or less natural, but when I listen later I think I sound pinched off.  It's hard for me to tell since it's my own voice.  He's given me plenty of generic advice-""sing from your diaphragm"" and ""relax when you sing,"" but none of it seems to work well.  The best success I had was when he told me to sing like I was speaking the words on pitch, but I can't seem to recreate that.

Obviously I need to work on pitch and tempo as well, but I feel like I've been making some progress on those over the years.  The intonation thing on the other hand... not so much.  Any advice would be appreciated.

I wanna jam it wid you. (I wanna CLEAN UP WITH YOU)
We're jammin', jammin', (change all ""jammin"" to ""CLEANING"" and ""jam"" to ""CLEAN"" everywhere in the song)
And I hope you like jammin', too.

Ain't no rules, ain't no vow, we can do it anyhow:
I'n'I will see you through,
'Cos everyday we pay the price with a little sacrifice, (BECAUSE EVERYDAY WE MAKE A MESS WE BUT IF WE CLEAN THERE WILL BE LESS)
Jammin' till the jam is through. (CLEANING TILL THE CLEAN IS THROUGH)

We're jammin' -
To think that jammin' was a thing of the past;
We're jammin',
And I hope this jam is gonna last. (AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN CLEAN UP FAST)

No bullet can stop us now, we neither beg nor we won't bow; (NO BLOCKS CAN STOP US NOW, continue bob's lyrics)
Neither can be bought nor sold.
We all defend the right; Jah - Jah children must unite: (change ""jah-jah children to ""TIGER CUBS,"" I call my class tiger cubs, like our mascot)
Your life is worth much more than gold.

We're jammin' (jammin', jammin', jammin')
And we're jammin' in the name of the Lord; (maybe change to AND CLEANING IS ITS OWN REWARD)
We're jammin' (jammin', jammin', jammin'),
We're jammin' right straight from Yah.

Yeh! Holy Mount Zion; (HOLY DRAMATIC PLAY)
Holy Mount Zion: (HOLY BLOCK CENTER)
Jah sitteth in Mount Zion (JAH SITTETH IN LIBRARY)
And rules all creation. (AND NOW IT'S TIME TO CLEAN UP)

Yeah, we're - we're jammin' (wotcha-wa),
Wotcha-wa-wa-wa, we're jammin' (wotcha-wa),
See, I wanna jam it wid you
We're jammin' (jammin', jammin', jammin')
I'm jammed: I hope you're jammin', too. (jammed = CLEANING)

Jam's about my pride and truth I cannot hide (...PLAY DOUGH I CANNOT HIDE)
To keep you satisfied. (JUST SHOW ME THAT YOU TRIED)
True love that now exist is the love I can't resist, (TRUE FRIENDS THAT NOW EXIST, HELPING YOU I CAN'T RESIST)
So jam by my side.

We're Jammin' (jammin', jammin', jammin'), yeah-eah-eah!
I wanna jam it wid you.
We're jammin', we're jammin', we're jammin', we're jammin',
We're jammin', we're jammin', we're jammin', we're jammin';
Hope you like jammin', too.
We're jammin', we're jammin' (jammin'),
We're jammin', we're jammin' (jammin').
I wanna (I wanna jam it wid you) - I wanna -
I wanna jam wid you now.
Jammin', jammin' (hope you like jammin' too).
Eh-eh! I hope you like jammin', I hope you like jammin',

I finally figured out how to lift my soft palate and lower the back of my tongue while singing (mostly on an ""ah"" syllable), but when I do so, it sounds like I'm singing from the back of my throat. It sounds richer and less strained, but very muffled/damp, almost like I wouldn't be able to pronounce anything (which is something else I kinda struggle with, but I think proper sound production should come first).

Are there techniques or exercises that will bring the sound forward and make it clearer? Or should I just not lift/drop my soft palate and tongue that far? I've always heard that you should emulate a yawn to open your throat, and that's exactly what I'm doing.

I've always noticed that my resonance is best pretty low (Low F - second-line-on-a-bass-staff F) and have been wanting to carry it up. I'm a bass/baritone, so the extreme top of my range is around the F above middle C, but the last octave in it sounds pretty weak and airy (not falsetto).

Maybe I'm comparing myself too harshly to people like Thom and Matt Bellamy from Muse, but when I sing, it just doesn't measure up.

Whenever I try and sing in falsetto, my throat tends to fatigue and my voice is just too... squeeky? I can manage some melodic lines between verses in other songs when I feel like throwing it in, and it sounds fine then, but singing? Nope.

Not sure if I should upload a soundcloud link or not, I'm assuming you all have tips or sites I can use to learn and practice up to be more on the level of thom and matt without a sample.

I'm a tenor (lyric tenor I believe) with an extension up top making my effective range about A2-F#5, sometimes G5 on a good day with enough warmup. Now this is more or less natural, I haven't had much in the way of formal vocal training, but I'm just now beginning to study with a classical teacher. R&amp;B music is my favorite genre, but I haven't been able to find any overly competent R&amp;B vocal coaches in my area. 

Anyways, I'm wondering whether I would be able to extend my range even further? Some people claim that Michael Jackson could go up to F6 and the guy in the video below, Tonéx, can go up to C6 or C#6. I really love those counter tenor-esque highs that these guys get and would love to be able to do them one day. 

I suppose I'm just asking what a realistic expectation of myself would be.

Here's a video of Tonéx doing some vocal riffing, plenty of it in the higher ranges.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txgFhz0zpJ8
'

The second thing is that since I'm training with a classical teacher, I don't know how to approach the subject of extending my range to those counter tenor-esque highs (if possible). I've never heard that type of voice from any classical voices. Does anybody know what type of tenors Tonéx and Michael Jackson are? Leggiero tenors? Lyric Tenors? Also, what type of voice functions are they employing to get that high? *Are they actually using ""counter tenor"" technique and singing in their falsetto or is it head voice?*

By rehearsal or performance time, though, I start losing volume around an F.  My lower range in particular, while still perfectly audible (and definitely not vocal fry) starts sounding very breathy.

**The first link doesn't work. Instead go to the spreadsheet view and click on the form drop down and click ""show summary of results."" That will bring you to the same place.**

I got a lot of comments. A lot just telling me how cool this was and a lot addressing some concerns over the poll. I'm going to go through some of the comments here.

&gt;Minimize the last question to just specific genres, too many options.

This makes sense to me. Perhaps I should have done this question where the only choices were the main reddits in each genre just because it would have been a huge issue to do every music reddit, but giving just these ones didn't exactly work.
&gt;Add keyboards as an instrument, distinguish between electric and acoustic guitars.

I got a couple of comments like this. It makes sense in practice, but the amount of instruments out there is basically infinite. I screwed this question up though. I got a few ""other"" answers for things like mandolin and such. I'm not sure whether it would be better to make this question have another choice as ""alternative string instruments"" or instead of listing guitar as a choice, list non-orchestral string instruments. I'd like some input on this.
&gt;Make globally specific. Need to add ABRSM as well as K-12, which is the system we use in England. :) - lovepiano

Good point. Will do.
&gt;Add private schools to the education section. I went to post secondary for audio engineering, but I dont technically have a bachelors so I put nothing.

Is this something like a trade school idea? Was not aware of this choice.

&gt;It might be interesting to add some questions about those controversial topics; ""tube amps or solid state?"" etc, to build a general consensus. Add a third option along the lines of ""doesn't matter"", in each case, of course.

I would like to add this question. Perhaps people could start making a few questions they would like answered?
&gt;The ensembles playing in section doesn't seem to relate to anyone playing in pop, rock, metal, or country bands.  It looks just like school stuff.

This was probably the aspect most commented on. I didn't want this to be interpreted this way. I have always used ""ensembles"" as a general descriptor for musical groups. Please know that the word ensemble doesn't have a higher meaning that only college chamber ensembles can use. I meant for that answer to also relate to garage bands and such. The reason I used the word ensemble is because it tends to have a broader meaning then just band. However, the second aspect of this question people didn't like was that there really wasn't a choice for volunteer groups. I will add both volunteer with audition and volunteer without audition to the choices in the next revision.

If you have a dying question you need answered bring it up here.

So onto the results that were interesting;

1. 65% of everyone who answered plays guitar in some fashion. That's pretty remarkable to me, especially seeing how piano only clocked in a 49%.
2. A lot of you guys are band leaders. What happened to the socially awkward penguin persona everyone in Reddit is suppose to have?
3. The most popular genre subreddit is jazz? What in the world? I truly did not expect this at all. The second most subscribed was classic rock which seems much more in line with what I think as most musician's viewpoints.

1. I make sure to be relaxed through the abdominal muscles. Then I start breathing in extremely slowly until my ""survival instinct"" takes over and breathes in for me. This is then a breath made by/with my diaphragm.

2. Then I start singing warmup and try to breath out as little as possible with every breath and relax my larynx (highly important and most people sing with a high larynx which is damaging to the vocal apparatus) and simultaneously take conscious control of diaphragmatic breathing.

Now I'm pretty comfortable with my head voice and it's really extended my range quite a bit after learning it. I still have issues with timing around the bridge between head and chest but I guess that comes with skill and practice.

But my head voice sounds nothing like my chest voice. When you hear the guy in the video singing in his head voice though, he retains a lot of that chest voice timbre.  This leads me to believe that I am doing my head voice wrong.
 
It's very clearly not a falsetto, and the vocals are very well supported by airflow to the point I can produce a very clean timbre and tone up to a very high range.  However it sounds very girly (not nasally, breathy or throaty), it just doesn't carry over the manliness of the chest voice.

I've been singing for almost a year now, and have also had a few lessons (about five I think) over the course of some months. The singing is going well, I love it and I'm improving really fast. One thing that bugs me though is that when I'm not singing, tension seems to build up in my neck and voice. So if I sit behind my computer for some hours, my voice will be weak and noisy, and won't feel free at all. This definitely has to with my posture of course (I do have some forward head), but it's so extreme. When my voice feels free, it's quite loud and low; a low E sounds good if I'm relaxed (on vacation for example, away from computers. A few weeks ago I was away with a big group of people and more than one person told me I have a really low voice), but when it's tense, which is often, my low range is really crappy, which sucks because I sing bass in a choir. It also bothers me when I speak really, it's very hard to speak up sometimes and I sound weird.

My voice is pretty easily affected by everything really, you know how people tense up when they play something difficult on piano or whatever? It's usually the shoulders but I also tense up in my throat. I also do this when I have five minutes left on a written test, when something scary happens when I'm driving, you name it. I recognize it and try to consciously relax when it happens but I want this problem completely gone..

If it's only a bit tense then I can free up my voice by humming and lip trills, singing in general, but if it's too tense then it's difficult and singing doesn't feel good and especially doesn't sound good.

So I guess this is related to both stress and posture, does anyone know how I should work on it? I hate it, having a free voice, even when speaking, is such a pleasure, I feel great when that ""happens""",,False,,t5_2rlcx,False,,,True,t3_1khz0k,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/1khz0k/i_have_problems_with_tension_building_up_in_my/,

I found this sub about 10 minutes ago and I was just excited. I need help.

I'm 22, female, and I consider myself an alto as well as soprano. Now, I've never had any lessons, so I'm nothing awesome and I know that. However, I started looking into it, I just hope they're not super expensive to take part in, eek. So it'd be REALLY neat if I could get some lessons in.

Anyway, I don't have a mic (because I don't have the money for a decent one). I do have a camera though, but we all know it's nothing in comparison to a great mic.

**My questions is:** Would it be stupid of me to upload a video via camera of my singing to get critiqued? (I'm too shy right now to actually be on video, so I'd be a skuzz and just set the stupid camera down, I know, it's weird. )

I'm very shy about singing, but I have confidence in myself, I think I'm alright. I somehow gained enough confidence to sing for a few people at a house party a few weeks back, and a friend of mine (as well as maybe..2-3 others) who was on American Idol (and made it to Hollywood!, but didn't get any further, lol) told me I sounded beautiful, so it boosted my confidence to a whole new level. Just because he sings in a band and everyone melts over his voice. To be told ""Oh man, that was beautiful..."" by someone like that, after you nervously pour your heart out into a song, nothings ever made me feel so good.

I'm seriously, seriously not trying to brag- I'm just positive some of you must know what that felt like...right? Singing is one thing I think I'm good at...I guess I'm just trying to branch out here.

Thing is I have never performed for anyone in my life, not even my parents or girlfriend, they dont even know I sing, lol. The reason is I am not confident in my voice at all. When I record myself and listen I am not happy with it and this hinders me from preforming. Ive sent it to a few of my friends and they say that I am pretty good, but I cant believe them since they are my friends and I cant trust they are giving their honest opinion. So what does r/singing think?

After my first lesson this Monday I spent a lot of time doing the usual; worrying that I couldn't get up very high, concerned that I only have really one true octave, maybe some slight spillover, trying to find my range by looking at videos online, etc.. I realized though after some helpful advice from this subreddit that I shouldn't worry about that yet. Since I went into lessons with absolutely no training I shouldn't try to peg down a particular range since it'll likely expand and change. So I'm trying to stop worrying about that. My question is about high notes that get sung in musical theatre songs. Ideally I want to expand my range to G4 since that's where all my favorite parts hit their high point. However, when I listen to and follow along with sheet music for particular songs I get confused. It seems like when recordings hit that high G (along with other notes like F and E) the singer doesn't appear to be nearly as high as a piano high G. Am I mistaken to think that hitting a high G means hitting the EXACT same note as the piano, pitch and all, or am I just not trained enough to spot how high it actually is? Either one wouldn't surprise me. Furthermore, I'll hear recordings of people demonstrating a baritone range (I know it's bad to watch youtube videos on the subject) and their high notes, while matching the same note, are quite a bit different sounding from the piano. In short, nothing seems to be as high as the actual piano notes when I play them. Is this how singing actually works, or are you supposed to get to the exact same pitch?

It has always seems a bit petty to me - not intentionally, just the fact it doesn't seem to require as much 'gusto' as chest voice.

I'm kind of struggling to see exactly what the head voice is, and if it is what I think it is, then mine is very squeaky initially. Is this symptomatic of a beginner head voice?

Also, there's another example which I'd like to know if it's chest or head voice as it's always been out of my range. Always thought it would come in time, but maybe it's just my technique and lack of head voice.

&gt; April 20, 2013: Why Do We Push?

&gt; One consistent issue that many teachers confront is that of pushing. But what does pushing mean? Pushing, as I explain it, is directly related to the employment of too much air pressure through the larynx and vocal folds. This use of too much air pressure usually results in a distortion of tonal quality, imbalance in registration, loss of high range, and general body tension. Even though a singer’s sound may be big in a smaller room, it rarely carries in the theater or opera house because the tone has an element of ‘shrill’ as opposed to ‘resonant’.

&gt; I tell my students that before I knew much about singing, I was competing for the title of Mr. ‘Push As Much Air As Possible”. I am quite surprised that I have vocal folds left to tell you the truth, especially singing tenor for almost 20 years on a closed throat. When the acoustical space or pharynx is closed, the singer is then faced with the challenge of forcing air pressure as a desperate attempt to increase volume. When too much air pressure is used, the laryngeal position is usually too high.

&gt; But WHY do we push? Is there a concrete reason? The first thing that comes to my mind is that we are listening too much to our own sound. Good singing can feel quite internal. When the sound is correctly produced inside the pharynx and inside the head, the singer usually gets less volume of sound. I call it the ‘inside sound’ which is not what the audience gets at all. Convincing a singer to ‘feel instead of listen’ is NOT an easy job and it requires patience and fortitude to correct this fault of over-listening. I tried for years and years to ‘hear’ my own sound and it led to more and more pushing of the voice.

&gt; One BIG red light in a voice lesson is when a singer begins a sentence with ‘it sounds like’. I always stop the singer and reiterate the need to feel instead of listen. I learned from Allan Lindquest to 'feel instead of listen'. He probably said that about 50 to 100 times per lesson. I am still convincing myself to do the same thing today and I constantly speak about this to my students. Listening to inside tone as a guide is useless and actually takes a singer backwards in their process, because the inside sound is a false barometer of the true sound. What sounds good to the singer is NOT beautiful to the audience. What sounds good to the audience does NOT sound good inside the singer’s head. Often the sound is described as harsh (due to the ring factor) or far away (less present).

&gt; I consistently refer to a master class I presented in London several years ago. I was working on a lot of frontal vibration with the open throat and the forward arched tongue position as in the NG. Up close the sounds I made were not beautiful, but the recording, which was done from the back of the theater, reflected a warm, dark and ringing baritone sound. This was such a great lesson in vocal acoustics and how the law of acoustics works in the theater. It was a real view of learning that what is beautiful in the theater is often NOT beautiful inside the singer’s head or even up close. This is why as teachers we must train our ear so that we guide our singers toward the theater sound, NOT the sound in a small room.

&gt; Several years ago I had a student who sang with a world famous baritone at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York. The question put to me was, “How did he sound in the theater, because it was such an unusual sound up close?” My response was, “He sounded terrific in the theater!” So many singers who sing on ring are considered to have a harsh tone up close, yet in the theater the voice warms and develops a fantastic color. 

&gt; Some singers push air pressure when they get in a dry or dead room or theater. There is one theater in New York that is notorious for the lack of feedback. The statement so many singers say to me is “I always push in that theater!” When we refrain from pushing for more sound, we often reap the rewards of a good performance or audition. But this take trust in our voices to do this.

&gt; Some young singers make the mistake of listening to recordings of dramatic singers and then imitate what they think the singer is doing to produce the sound. A true dramatic voice does not have to push to make dramatically exciting sound. But if young singers start to imitate the dramatic sound and he/she happens not to be a dramatic voice type, then the push reflex will absolutely engage. I have dealt with several young singers who have had to go through about a 3 years realignment process from over-producing their voices muscularly. 

&gt; Personality and Pushing: Another factor in the push reflex is the personality. If we have an aggressive personality, then it is easy to trigger the ‘fight or flight’ reflex in singing. The result is the pushing of too much air pressure. We must temper our personality involvement in the music in order to find balance in our voices. For a singer who is laid back, he/she might need to engage more body energy or more emotional involvment in order to develop a more connected sound.

&gt; Learning to teach or sing for the theater instead of for the studio is a critically important part of vocal training. Congratulations to those who study this aspect of singing training and work to understand it more and more. It takes courage to understand that we do not have to make a huge sound for it to carry.

A bit of background - I have to fill in for our band's absent singer - usually I play guitar or bass. 
Right now it's mostly for rehearsal purposes, so it's not so scary!
I do have some vocal training, choirs etc, but all classical stuff. 

We play rock, and my problem is with sounding out words like ""world"" and ""heart"" (the '-art' ending...hehe fart.) 

On top of it, I seemed to have adopted a sort of generic North American/Canadian-y accent after having lived here for a long time, but my natural accent is very neutral, slightly BBC-English. 
With words like ""heart"" and ""world"" - when speaking, I tend to drift between North American and English pronunciations (haarrrt, worrrld vs haaht, wuuld) ...I moved a lot growing up, and this sort of happens. It also seems to get influenced by the context and situation...SO... yeah. When singing for a pop/rock song,  I get very conscious of this and then usually mess it up and sound contrived... More word examples: car, dear..etc... 

I'm rambling a little, so I'll stop. Hope I made my point.

My vocal teacher ""assigned"" my fach to be a mezzo, as the tone of my voice is very gothic and deep, very much like a mezzo, but I have the range of a soprano, starting at A3 to (presumably) F6 in practice.

So, does anyone have tips for healthily controlling vibrato or bringing it back so that it's not center stage over and above tone? I'll try to post a recording later for critique if anyone wants to give me more specific advice, but I don't know how to work my fiancé's voice recorder so I have to wait until he's home to figure out how to do it.

in terms of words, i leave everything to you. you can sing about anything you want. Since the content of the singing is not that important, the important thing is the feel in house music.

EDIT: Since Michaelalias mentioned it below; Even though it's not absolutely indespensable, recording with a microphone would be nice! If you only have your headset to record, and still want to give it a try, i will of course give it a listen!

Edit2: Wow! Thank you so much guys, I really wouldn't have thought there would be so many people responding and actually considering singing for me!

Since many of you already told me that they will try to put something together and send it my way, but i sadly will only be able to pick one vocal for the song, I've decided i will put your own singing on the song, mix it down and send it to you. So should your singing not end up on the final version, you will at least have your own personal house song to listen to, and get some comprehension and gratitude for the time and effort that you put in. Now this could take some time depending on the number of people eventually sending me their take, so in the end you'll have to have some pacience with me :)

She lost her husband to cancer not too long ago, and has managed to keep her head high through all of this. She has the most wonderful little boy I have ever met. He is sassy in that way that only a small child can be, and he is going to grow up to be an amazing person, just like his mother.

I will give you full credit, or whatever you need from me as I am not really interested in broadcasting this song at all, just playing it at a wedding. So anyway, here is the song:

[Lie, Lie, Lie](http://indeedgoodsir.bandcamp.com/track/lie-lie-lie-remixed-and-rearranged-by-kyle-blakley)

That's me on the cello, which has since evolved into a full orchestra version. Obviously the song is for a man, but I would be open if a nice lady is interested. Also, if there is any interest I would be down for doing another song as well, but Lie, Lie, Lie is the song I would like to start out with.

So, I've been singing in school since middle school (about ten years now) in a general choir setting, and as a member of a few audition-only groups at school and the Pittsburgh Pops.  I've had to stop singing because of grad school and time/location issues.  I'm in the process of moving back to Pittsburgh currently, and I've been offered the opportunity to sing in a semi-professional setting.  I'm worried that I'm somewhat rusty after barely singing at all for 7 months and I was wondering if anyone had tips for easing me back into the mix of things.

Does anyone know any tips to aid healing?,5,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/13x8me/15f_ive_damaged_my_throat_does_anyone_know_any/,"Note: There is, I am told, no damage to the vocal chords themselves - according to the specialist, the problem is in the muscles of my throat. This is, I gather, a good thing.

I suppose you need background? How I did this damage in the first place? Well, last year, my voice dropped. A lot. I became a lady tenor, really fast. The alto part in choir was too high for me, but, not wanting to cause trouble (because I was too proud, in other words, to admit that I was incapable of singing any female part) I said nothing. Ow. (Ow!) And, on top of that, I'd been playing the oboe in the school senior concert band and picking up the bassoon in junior. I wince just reading it. (Owww...)

 When school drew to a close last June I finally went to our choir/band teacher and told him that there was no way I could do any of these things anymore becuase I had, for the first time, actually had to stop singing/playing in class because it hurt too much. I have been 'resting' since then. The pain has stopped acting up all the time, but it still does when I talk for longer than usual. I can now play the oboe for a grand whopping seven minutes, the bassoon less. A specialist recommended seeing a speech therapist, but... we can't really afford that. Even a little bit of advice (besides the oh-so-general 'rest and be careful') would thrill me right now. I cannot describe to you how much this scares me. This will go away, won't it? 

Won't it? 

And there will be no need to inform me that I have been stupid. I have done that sufficiently, knowing that I am a supercilious and self-centred idiot. Excuse the wall of text; I have no idea what I'm doing at this Reddit thing and I was unsure of how much information you needed. Thank you for giving me a few minutes of your time.

Really, the style of singing I want to be able to do is that rougher, raspier/more gravely kind of voice but I really don't know where to begin, would you all be able to help me out/answer some questions?



1: I always hear people saying this style of singing damages your voice, yet some of the artists I've provided have been singing like this for years ( Disturbed has been around sine 1999 ) and their voice sounds the same. How I see it, that means there's a right way and a wrong way to do this. What's the right way?



2: How would I go about finding an instructor for this style of music/rock music? I live in the middle of nowhere ( upstate New York ) and have no idea where to begin looking, or how. 


3: I'm willing to put as much time and effort into this as possible, I'd love nothing more than to make a living off rock music. ( Yes, I have back up plans, of course. ) I have an afters school job; 1 3/4 hours a day, $8 an hour, 4 days a week, so I do have some of my own money to use for lessons. 


4: My other main goal other than developing this singing style is to learn to play guitar and sing at the same time; I'm guessing that's just a pure ""practice makes perfect"" thing?

If you didn't do quite well enough in the initial audition, you had to do an individual second audition.  I had to do a second audition.


It essentially boiled down to the head voice faculty member asking me to do older, more simple repertoire that I haven't touched in years.  She told me my voice was immature, and all of my pieces were much too advanced for my level.  I shouldn't be singing them for at least 15 years.I've been studying voice for 6 years.  I got into the class, but only under the guise that she would assign me easy repertoire (no opera scenes, jazz and musical repertoire only).  


While I know I have a ways to go, I was not expecting to be told to start over.  It was painful and heart breaking.  I didn't know how to cope initially.  But after a little cooling-off period where I reassured myself that yes, I like my voice, no, I don't want to be a professional opera singer, yes, I'd like to take this class, and yes, I want to keep studying a variety of music, I have begun to regain my footing and my confidence.

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this, but I am a vocal performance major, I have an hour-long senior recital coming up in April, and I need help picking some repertoire that will be both fun and challenging. I am 21 years old and a fast-learning mezzo-soprano with a great ear. Some things I have done well with in the past are ""A Chloris"" by Reynaldo Hahn, ""i carry your heart with me"" by John Duke, ""Deh vieni, non tardar"" from Mozart's Le Nozze di Figaro, ""Liebst du um Schonheit"" by Clara Schumann, and ""Mandoline"" by Claude Debussy. I am really good at love songs and opera arias and have a pure classical voice with a lot of control. I'm definitely doing more pieces by Reynaldo Hahn and am thinking about some Liszt lieder, and am playing the role of Susanna in Le Nozze di Figaro this year so I'll probably do something else from that. I'm looking for something that will push me, both new things and things that aren't done much anymore. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know! :) 

Edit 1: My range is about a G#/Ab below the treble staff to the B (C on a very good day) above the staff. 

Edit 2: There is a lot of discrepancy as to what voice type I actually am. I was a low alto in high school when I didn't really know how to use my voice, and throughout my whole undergraduate career I have been singing higher and higher things. But I have the tone of a mezzo and mezzo things are what I prefer singing, mostly for consistency - if I'm having a bad day vocally, it's hard to even get above a high G.
