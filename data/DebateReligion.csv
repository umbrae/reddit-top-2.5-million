Nor is it limited to comments; [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/122wah/to_atheists_please_quit_using_starving_children/) is a recent topic that made a claim and sparked a large amount of debate, yet was voted into the negatives.

I know that it's been endlessly repeated, but apparently it is necessary to say once again:

**THE DOWNVOTE BUTTON IS NOT A ""DISAGREE"" BUTTON**. 

The only time that any of us should be pressing ""downvote"" here is when someone is detracting from the discussion by inappropriate behavior such as trolling, spamming, or excessive rudeness uncoupled with a legitimate response.

Similarly, the ""upvote"" button is for those who are adding to the conversation, *even if we disagree with them*.

Even if you don't do this elsewhere on reddit, please try to do it here.

A theist's perspective.,166,14,188,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/kvvyn/what_do_you_respect_about_atheists_a_theists/,"I'll go first. There's been a great deal of bad blood going on in this subreddit in the last few days, and I thought I'd kick off my participation here (as a Catholic) by pointing out a few things I really admire about non-theists who are willing to engage these kinds of questions. 

1. Maintaining and advancing a system of morality absent of a religious justification. Seriously, to navigate our daily struggles with our fellow humans in a compassionate and graceful manner, without the hope of heaven or the fear of hell, is really bad-ass.

2.  An admirable emphasis on reason, which is often accompanied by a firm grasp of the principles of logic.

3.  Atheism is usually associated, in my experience, with extreme generosity in extending tolerance/regard towards all beings. The best example of this was Carl Sagan's depiction of chimpanzees in *Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors.* How secure in your own dignity as a Homo Sapiens do you have to be to extend a form of personhood towards our primate cousins? Pretty damn secure, that's how.

Anyways I'm happy to be here and I hope, even if our arguments are contentious, that we all at least come away with more mutual respect. 

EDIT: I am moved by the spirit shown by atheists here, especially considering that I'd been hoping to drum up participation from theists in particular. If we can go forward in this spirit, I have high hopes for this subreddit, and look forward to a fruitful dialogue.

1356431721.0,145,self.DebateReligion,15f0kr,[Meta] I believe DebateReligion is becoming a circlejerk.,207,62,371,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/15f0kr/meta_i_believe_debatereligion_is_becoming_a/,"I would like for you all to consider what I have to say before agreeing or disagreeing with the topic I'm bringing forward.

I believe that the comments in reply to ""To Christian"" topics that reach any degree of popularity follow a very straight forward format and I believe that it is not conducive to discussion on the topic. 

I am going to give a few examples for you to consider from the last few days and I would like for you to just scan through them independently and see if they match up with what I'm saying. Again, the prerequisite for this type of behavior is popularity and investment in the topic. Let's begin:

[To Christians: Why would God have sent his son to die? How does this action cause humans sins to be forgiven?](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/15cnp8/to_christians_why_would_god_have_sent_his_son_to/)

[To Theists who believe in doom for non-believers; do you understand why someone might not hold your beliefs? If so, wouldn't your god also understand? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/158gst/to_theists_who_believe_in_doom_for_nonbelievers/)

[To Christians: Do you believe in a God who will send you to Hell for not believing in him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/15chu4/to_christians_do_you_believe_in_a_god_who_will/)

I'm going to hold off there for now because there are so many smaller posts to wade through that I'm taking too much time.

There are several ways that these types of topics are addressed and the most upvoted comments follow a basic format:

* Short (no indepth analysis)  
* Written by someone who does not adhere to the belief in question  
* Often condescending  
* Often framed as ""Good luck finding Christians to answer this"" or ""Here comes the cognitive dissonance"" or ""Now watch as they justify condemnation of all unbelievers.""

I may have a skewed view of this but I believe that when a debate starts downvotes should be rare, even when the person speaking is advocating for something heinous like mass genocide, justified rape, or other such horrors.

I believe this is the best route to take because when positions are stated there is very little justification that can be provided for *any* viewpoint.

Let me give an example of what I think you'll see in topics (the hell ones especially):

The ""inquisitive"" submitter asks Christians to justify some aspect of the faith that appears to be immoral.

The top comment says something like ""Well, Christians will just say that God knows everything and that he's right about everything so nothing he can do is wrong.""

This receives many upvotes because it's easily digested and fits into a preconception that most of the readers already possess. Note that such comments will not really address the topic and that the person making the reply will not be able to elaborate because they don't actually follow the belief system in question.

A few more posts will be made of similar nature.

Further down someone from the faith will mount a defense. This will be met with a good number of downvotes and people will defend such downvotes for several reasons including 1) The reply didn't provide a sound enough response. 2) This is a cop-out. 3) The person replying holds terrible views.

I would like to address these points.

**The Easy to Digest Post**   
*Why condescension and brevity are rewarded* 

* **I've reached the same conclusion, the logic is solid:** Bear with me as I explain this. When we enter into a discussion and are met with short points we tend to gloss over the shaky foundations of points that we agree with and scrutinize the points we disagree with. It's quite easy to understand. If I am discussing 9/11 conspiracies with people and I hear someone make a counterclaim against the conspiracy theorist I'll be very likely to nod my head with what they say. I mean, I've already reasoned my way to their point so I assume that their point has been established in the mind of other observers as well. So a short point that says ""You're assuming God is moral."" Is easily digested by many of the atheists and skeptics who frequent this board. Take [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/15chu4/to_christians_do_you_believe_in_a_god_who_will/c7l88zp) example to illustrate the point. To someone who agrees this logic is very easy to follow. They've all heard Christians who talk about atheists ""choosing"" to go to hell. They personally would never choose to go to hell. So the argument is therefore ridiculous and even though this point detracts, if anything, from the conversation, it gets upvoted because it fits the preconceptions of the majority of readers.

* **Inherent frustration leads to acceptance of condescension:** I frequent various political subreddits and the same behavior appears in those that we see here. People get frustrated hearing the same lines over and over again that they'll downvote anyone who expresses the opinions they hate and be condescending to that authority figure that they are at odds with (because they've had to be faced with what they despise so very frequently). So when someone is condescending the reaction by many people who face similar frustrations is to upvote because it fits a paradigm. But of course this is not conducive to discussion at all. 

**The Downvoted Answer**  
*Why the inherent frustration leads to offhanded rejection of juxtaposition*

* **Someone may provide a counter-perspective but the lack of time leads to downvotes:** You'll notice this if you're aware of it. Imagine you're in a subreddit that strongly disagrees with your position on a given issue. Someone makes a blanket accusation against your position so you decide to respond. You can't provide the whole justification for your position so you answer the question directly from your position. What unfolds is that people downvote you for not backing your position. Well of course you couldn't back your position fully, you were directly responding to the question. Pointing out how the logic wasn't valid if the worldview was different (or something similar) but you can't provide the entire justification for the alternate world view because...quite frankly...that's a daunting task even if you *have* the time. So debatereligion, being a primarily atheist populated subreddit, downvotes contrarian positions because the person holding their opinion has to make generalized statements at the beginning to save time and to start discussion. It may be that the position has no foundation at all or it may be that the position is of such strength that you convert after reading the replies. Regardless, at the beginning you have no way of knowing which it is without making unfair assumptions regarding the submitter.

* **The classic 'I disagree therefore I downvote' problem:** This is true of any subreddit, not just this one. It would be nice if it wasn't so prevalent given that the mods have removed the downvote button but alas people still go through the trouble. I believe many people too easily jump to the conclusion that the opposition is being irrational when really not enough has been discussed. A downvote is practically inevitable because the person holds a different view, sees the problems with the argument from the onset and, without given the opponent time to respond, assumes that there is no logical answer for their counter-argument.

**tl;dr:** Observe posts in the future and watch for this: upvoted answers by people not of the faith in question that are short, condescending and/or distractions from actual debate on the topic.

&gt;That Christianity might be both true and terrible is something that Christians refuse to entertain.

If this religion were true, here is what we have to live with.

* Our lives are miserable and evil, tainted everywhere by sin. Only in our death do we have an opportunity to escape.
* We are pawns in a war between a god and an army of demigods (angels), and Satan and his army of demons. Satan is constantly trying to corrupt us.
* When we die, we have two possible fates. The most likely is that we’ll end up in Satan’s clutches, which means an eternity (Forever! Endlessly!) of pain and agony and grief, tortured in a lake of fire.
* If we win the god’s favor, we get to spend an eternity (Forever! Endlessly!) servilely worshiping this deity.
* We have a purpose. It is to be slaves to god. That’s right, under Christianity we are all slaves to a omnipotent, omniscient master.
* In some Christian sects, everything is predestined. Your efforts are futile, your ultimate fate in heaven and hell is set. No amount of struggle will change what will happen to you.
* In other sects, you have free will, and can influence where you end up. Unfortunately, the exercise of your will is irrelevant except in your ability to follow arbitrary and peculiar rules: you may not masturbate, for instance, and you must avoid eating certain foods. You are free to obey god’s capricious whims, or not.
* Your god loves you so much that he will kill his own son for you. But there’s a catch: you have to believe that god is the kind of guy who would murder his own son (and worship him for it!), ot you will go to hell.
* Your god is the kind of monster who would exterminate just about every living thing on the planet because they were wicked. But at the same time, it’s dogma that every one of us is a wicked sinner. The axe is always suspended above your neck, the only thing keeping it away are the fancies of a tyrant.
* This god is not a moral being: he has advocated rape, genocide, the murder of children, slavery, and blood sacrifice. The purpose of these horrific acts? His glorification.

If this is the case, should we not be downcast and dreary, living under the thumb of this god?

1372132783.0,104,self.DebateReligion,1h0mh5,To all humanoid and other Jedi: Why does The Force endorse child-slavery and slave-racing and gambling and organized crime and smuggling and unfair labor practices and indefinite detention and murder of messengers and innocent soldiers and genocide and extra-judicial killings?,151,47,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1h0mh5/to_all_humanoid_and_other_jedi_why_does_the_force/,"Why do you claim your scripture is 100% good and consistent and that the way of The Force is the truth? 

Your scripture is filled with inconsistencies and illogical storylines. So many films and books are arbitrarily declared ""canon"" and other ""EU""...which life form makes these decisions and on what rationale? So many ""editions"" are released with changes to the story...how could any logical life form in this Galaxy take seriously the idea that these events were inspired by The Force?

But worse yet, in so-called canon are so many simply evil actions instructed and endorsed and condoned by the Force.

Your messiah was born to a slave-woman. When your prophet found the boy he could have killed the slave-trader and freed all the slaves. But instead he decided to endanger the child's life in a criminal racing enterprise run by none other than the Hutts -- the very embodiment of evil and corruption. Your Jedi Knights who could have wiped out the Hutts and ended a major source of evil in the Galaxy, yet you choose to co-exist and even negotiate with them.

Your messiah's mother was abducted and abused and killed by sand-people, leading the boy to the Dark Side. If The Force is all powerful then why had it simply not allowed this to happen -- make the sand people lose her in a sand-storm and direct her back to her dwelling? Why does the all-powerful Force allow the death of billions through wars and slavery and oppression?

Why did you not address the complaints of the workers on the moons of Naboo in a timely and respectful fashion? Are protests for better labor conditions deserving of military action? Why did the Jedi Council never address the issue of indefinite detention without trial of persons in the spice mines of Kessel? Why does the Jedi not once use military force against the Hutts and others to wipe out slavery in the Galaxy? The same Jedi Knights who defeated the Mandalorians could have stopped slavery at whatever the economic cost to the Galaxy. Clearly the Jedi have one law and morality for the people who must cower in fear before the, and another for their own behavior.

Your apostle Han Solo gunned down in cold-blood an innocent messenger who was only trying to collect on his master's debts. Versions of your scripture differ on who shot first -- another inconsistency. Still it was a situation that could have been settled without murder. No doubt tons of death-sticks and other illegal drugs were smuggled by this Han Solo and have destroyed many lives yet you call him a hero.

Why your 2nd messiah Luke was attempting to escape from the Death Star, many innocent soldiers who were only following orders were killed. Your prophet Obi-Won could have taught the boy how to distract the guards, the way he himself did, instead of killing them.

Why did the Rebels not give a 1-hour warning to the soldiers on the Death Star so they could have evacuated it before it was destroyed? There were many innocent civilians and Rebel prisoners aboard who could have been saved. If The Force is all powerful why couldn't it have transported all the Rebel prisoners down to the moon of Yavin? Why was there a victory and medal ceremony afterwards with no mention of the innocent lives lost?

Have you ever consulted with people of the Galaxy and attempted to modernize your religion? What is the use of holding on to 10, 000s of years of dogma? Why can't Jedi marry? In fact there are books dealing with the early-times of the Jedi that state that some Jedi were married. What is so wrong with love and sex and marriage? Wasn't it the Jedi's anachronistic views on love and marriage that led to your first messiah becoming Lord Vader? These are clearly wicked teachings that have no place in a modern Galaxy.

A simple question a child could answer is is that if Light Side of The Force exists then why does it allow oppression and suffering. Either it can't stop or it won't stop it. In either case the best you can say is it is useless to The Galaxy. But it has also shown itself to be immoral, corrupt, dangerous and evil.

It seems to that the Sith are much more logical and consistent and practical in their teachings. From my point of view the Jedi are evil.

1362172754.0,97,self.DebateReligion,19hhmp,To atheists: A list of logical contradictions inherent in common theistic claims,126,29,180,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/19hhmp/to_atheists_a_list_of_logical_contradictions/,"I'm going to try something a little bit unusual, here. I'd like to create a comprehensive list of contradictions inherent in the most common theistic claims and responses put forward here. Now, a lot of these will be Christianity-specific, because more of the theists arguing in this subreddit are Christians than any other religion, but I'd like to include contradictions in non-Christian arguments as well.

My goal in doing this is simple, although I understand the implementation is a complex undertaking. I want a handy reference that can be used to put a stop to position-jumping. From my decidedly atheistic and anti-theistic perspective, a lot of the defense of religion involves taking a position that seems to resolve a given contradiction, but actually just moves the contradiction to another topic. **I want that to stop**. I want to force theists to examine their belief structures **as a whole**, and see if they can resolve all of the contradictions therein simultaneously, rather than constantly shifting the focus from one fine point to another.

To that end, I will include in this list cross-references from each topic to common theist answers, and the contradictions that arise in turn from those answers.

This will be a skeletal framework starting with just six of the most common logical contradictions I've recognized, and a few of the places where they apply. I would like atheists here to help identify and cross-reference others to flesh this out.

And theists? I would like to challenge you to escape **all** of the contradictions this post will eventually contain.

---
Part 1: The contradictions
-
---

1. **The omnipotence paradox** - There are things God logically can do that contradict each other.
2. **The omniscience/free will paradox** - Omniscience entails determinism, which contradicts libertarian free will.
3. **The perfection paradox** - Why does a perfect being want or need anything? Why does a perfect being create imperfection? Is it even logically possible for imperfection to arise from perfection?
4. **The Euthyphro dilemma** - Is it good because God says so, or does God say so because it is good?
5. **The logical problem of evil** - An all-powerful and perfectly good god is contradictory to the existence of evil and suffering. Also: The evidential problem of evil.
6. **The creation paradox** - Who/what created the rules by which God abides? Also: Who created God?


---
Part 2: The claims
-
---

**The Free Will defense** -- In response to the logical problem of evil.

*Summary*: It is logically possible that a greater good is served by the existence of the free will to choose evil or harmful behavior.

*Implied contradictions*:

1. **The omniscience/free will paradox** - On its face, the incompatibilist free will used in the Free Will Defense is contradictory to God's omniscience.
2. **The omnipotence paradox** - The Free Will Defense implies that God is incapable of improving upon his imperfect creation, which leads us to...
3. **The perfection paradox** - Why did God create beings with imperfect willpower to resist temptation? There is no logical contradiction in including in his creations libertarian free will and the perfect willpower to always choose good.

---

**Argument from objective morality** - In response to the logical problem of evil.

*Summary*:

There are objective moral truths. God is the only logically possible source of these truths. The logical problem of evil fails if there is no such thing as evil, which would be true under the relative morality entailed by atheism. Therefore, the logical problem of evil is actually an argument for the existence of God.

*Implied contradictions*:

1. **The Euthyphro Dilemma** - God is not actually a logically possible source for objective morality. Objectivity means ""true regardless of a subject's individual feelings, imaginings, or interpretations."" If God is an agent capable of feelings, imaginings, or interpretations, then morality arising from him is subjective.
2. **The creation paradox** - If God is an agent that is capable of feelings, imaginings, or interpretations, then any truly objective morality that exists would come from somewhere else. Where?

---

**Omnipotence definition argument** - In response to the omnipotence paradox.

*Summary*:

Atheists are going off a bad definition of ""omnipotence."" Omnipotence means God is capable of anything logically possible that it is in his nature to do. God can't make square circles or perform other logical absurdities.

*Implied contradictions*:

1. **The creation paradox** - From whence did this law of logic that restrict's God's power arise?

---

**False dilemma argument** - In response to the Euthyphro dilemma.

*Summary*:

The Euthyphro dilemma is a false dilemma, using a poor definition of goodness. Goodness is actually better defined as something along the lines of ""conformity to the nature of God."" God's nature is the very standard of value.

*Implied contradictions*:

1. **The problem of evil** - Responses to the problem of evil and to the Euthyphro dilemma are ultimately viciously circular with one another. If goodness is defined as ""conformity to the nature of God,"" how does a universe this perfectly ""good"" being created contain any evil? The **Free Will defense** is usually raised here, which leads us back to other contradictions.
2. **The omnipotence paradox** - Per common modal logic arguments, that which is conceivable is logically possible. I can conceive of a possible world in which a creator deity can engage in acts that it considers evil (*a la* maltheism). If God cannot do so, we are confronted by the omnipotence paradox again. If anything God does is instead by definition good, then we have reached Divine Command Theory, which falls upon the horns of the Euthyphro dilemma again.

---

**First Cause argument** - In response to the creation paradox.

*Summary*:

God is the very first cause. He is perfect, timeless, simple, and fully actual. Only such a being could stop the vicious regress implied by causality. Logically, a First Cause must exist, and it must have the attributes we commonly describe God as possessing.

*Implied contradictions*:

1. **The omniscience/free will paradox** - Setting aside the question-begging of the First Cause argument, it entails a deterministic universe of cause-and-effect. There is no rational way to simultaneously accept the First Cause argument and accept the Free Will defense, which is incompatible with determinism. Accepting the First Cause argument is tantamount to giving up on morality and free will.
2. **The perfection paradox** - A First Cause implies that there was a ""time,"" for lack of a better word, when God wanted or needed to create the universe.

---

**Humans brought about their own imperfection** - In response to the perfection paradox.

*Summary*:

God is perfect, and his creation was or is perfect. The imperfection of humanity does not disprove that. As agents with free will (uh oh), we chose imperfection. We didn't have to, and God did not choose it for us.

*Implied contradictions*:

1. **The omniscience/free will paradox** - This one is pretty blatant. Again, the same problems arise with free will running counter to God's omniscience. And the great Circle of Circular Reasoning continues... Circularly.

---

That's a start. It's by no means complete, so I'm hoping other atheists will help me expand on or clarify what's already there, and fill in the gaps. After all, that's where God hides... ;)

I'll admit I got this from the front page of /r/atheism.  Not surprisingly, there is no good answer given there.  I suspect there aren't any, but I am interested if anyone here has one.  
  
One idea proposed is that there has to be some sort of punishment for sin, otherwise God is not just.  But it is not just to punish someone for the sins of another, so that doesn't work.  
  
The next thought was that God loves people so much that he took the suffering himself (in the person of Jesus) so they wouldn't have to.  But this doesn't explain the necessity for torture and death.  If he loved people so much, he could have forgiven them without his son dying.

At face value, it doesn't seem like much.  Religion as an insurance policy almost makes sense.  Except its not so simple in practice.

*Jesus, the Messiah and Word of God ... for Muslims too!*

Muslims see the God of the Old Testament and the New as one God. The see Jesus as the Messiah, the word of God. Much like the ""Let there Be Light"" of the Old Testament, Jesus was a fiat of God created of God in the womb of a virgin. 

""Translation of the Holy Qur’an, surah (Chapter) 3, ayat (verses) 45–47, reads, 

&gt;&gt;Behold! The angels said: “O Mary! Allah gives you glad tidings of a Word from Him: his name will be Christ Jesus, the son of Mary, held in honor in this world and the Hereafter and of (the company of) those nearest to Allah; “He shall speak to the people in childhood and in maturity. And he shall be (of the company) of the righteous.” 

&gt;&gt;She said, “O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched me?” 

&gt;&gt;He said: “Even so: Allah creates what He wills: when He has decreed a Plan, He says to it, ‘Be,’ and it is!” 

In a theological nutshell, Muslims believe Jesus to be a Word of Allah, a Messiah, born by virgin birth to Mary (Maryam) and strengthened by the Holy Spirit. Muslims believe he performed miracles from the cradle, conveyed revelation to humankind in fulfillment of previous scripture, healed lepers, cured the blind and raised the dead, all by the will of Allah. 

They also believe Allah raised Jesus up at the end of his ministry. Muslims further believe a time will come when Jesus will be sent back to vanquish the Antichrist. Following this, he will eradicate deviant beliefs and practices in all religions, which will include correcting those who consider themselves to be following his teachings as Christians, but who in fact are astray. He will then establish submission to God’s will (again, the definition of Islam) throughout the world, live an exemplary life, die, and shortly thereafter will come the Day of Judgment.""

Brown, Dr. Laurence B.  MisGod'ed (p. 65-66) 

*Doctrinal Differences - the Trinity and Blood Atonement*

The difference is two fold:

1) The Trinity - Muslims believe only God is God. Jesus is the word of God, the Messiah and will come in the end time. They just do not believe he is coequal with God. As Jesus himself says, “My Father is greater than I” (John 14:28), Following the Bible and Jesus, they believe that assigning co-equals with God is a great blasphemy.

""Indeed, how could substances with opposite polarities (i.e., mortality/immortality; with beginning/without beginning; mutable/immutable, etc.) possibly exist in one entity? (For example, Jesus is mutable, changing with age; God is immutable, never changing.) Why did Jesus Christ ascribe his miraculous works exclusively to God and not to any divinity of his own, if he was in fact a partner in divinity? And why did he testify to having received his gifts from God if he and the Creator are co-equal? (For relevant verses, see John 3:35, 5:19–23, 5:26–27, 10:25, 13:3, 14:10, Acts 2:33, 2 Peter 1:17, Rev 2:26–27.)""

Brown, Dr. Laurence B. (2008-02-22). MisGod'ed (p. 47-48). 


2) Blood Atonement - If God wanted to forgive sins, why didn't he just do it, as Jesus himself does several times in the New Testament? If God wanted to forgive sins, why didn't he just forgive them? Why did he ""have to"" kill his son? Is he not all-powerful? Does he lack the power to forgive everone's sins at once the way he forgave several individuals in the New Testament and Old? 

God does not need sacrfice to forgive sin, even in the Old Testament: ""If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land."" 2 Chronicles 7:14 Practitioners of Judaism will verify that sacrifice is not needed to forgive sins, which is why there are still practicing orthodox Jews although no sacrifices can be offered in the Temple of Jerusalem at this time.

Although there are different variations in details, all Muslims agree that the crucifixtion of Christ was a crime, not a necessity. Instead, Muslims believe God raised Jesus into heaven and never lets true harm come to his prophets. Some believe that Jesus was criminally crucified so the evildoers could seal their fate in rejecting God's prophet, then God rose Jesus from the  dead and ascended him into heaven. Others believe God made a miraculous body double to suffer in place of Jesus, raising him in to heaven first. The point either way is that blood atonement is not needed. Christ was crucified by human evil, not by God.

I believe that Blood Atonement and the Trinity are both questionable, unbiblical doctrines. Furthermore, they show an illogical and unjust God, which is blasphemous. Muslims believe in the one God of Moses and Jesus, but believe, as is obviously true by the schism and bloodshed of history, that these revelations became corrupted and misused for political purposes. God sent a message to the prophet Muhammed (pbuh) to show the unchanging truth of one God, and re-establish the people of the earth in submission to him and to return to true worship and monotheism, challenging the pagan doctrines assigned to God by the Christian church.

*On Muhammed (pbuh) - His Mission and Authenticity*

As for Muhammed (pbuh), while I've advanced the theory that he might have had temporal lobe epilepsy, like many other mystics in history, the fact remains that an illiterate Middle Easterner began spouting detailed Old and New Testament Bible stories.  He was illiterate, so he didn't have any access to extensive study of Hebrew or Christian scriptures, and no translation of the New Testament was actually made into Arabic until long after Muhammed's (pbuh) death anyway, and was only in the hands of the very wealthy then. Furthermore, if he were going to parrot oral stories to give himself authenticity, he would have kept roughly the same details - instead he changes the details and derives alternative theological explanations, as outlined above, and makes them explicit. Furthermore, these speeches were delivered publicly in the midst great emotional and physical distress, not composed calmly by a scholarly consulting of many sources in some reflective state of mind. 

As for Muhammed's (pbuh) lack of miracles, he himself pointed out that Jesus had numerous signs, and yet was rejected by most anyway. Many Old Testament prophets, like Muhammed (pbuh), were warners and correcters. The revelations of Moses and Jesus were long ago corrupted by alteration, political intrigue, and bloody schism. God never leaves people without guidance - those who have open ears and hearts! There are more than enough signs in the Bible to believe in God, for those who will listen. God chose Muhammed to show the unity and clarity of God's revelation to people over time, and he chose to do it in a time in history when the words of God could be printed in a book and kept intact and secure.

Allah is the Arabic word from the same root as Elohim, Eloi, Eloah, and so on. Allah is the ancient name of God. This is not a different God being referred to by Muhammed - it is the same God as that of the Old Testament, the same God who sent the Messiah, Jesus, and the same God to whom Jesus cries out on the cross, the very same name. 

*Returning to the truth of revelation*

By considering the above, how the trinity has no evidence in the Bible and goes against the oneness of God stressed in the Bible, and how blood atonement is not found in the word of God, but is illogical and implies an unjust and cruel God, it would seem that Christianity does not represent the following of God and the prophets, but has gone astray. Furthermore, Christians suggest that those who reject the trinity and blood atonement, whether because they are illogical, unbiblical, or unjust, or because they are a child born in a foreign culture, they will suffer in hell. So God makes people to suffer in hell? Muhammed tells us in God's revelation that anyone who loves and worships the one God of the universe and does good to others shall be rewarded on the day of resurrection. This is more consistent with a just God and the Bible. To love God and do good is a path open to everyone of any time and place. Even Jesus himself shows repeatedly how the Samaritan is often closer to God than the Jew. God loves those who love him and do good. Christianity perverted the revelation of God for political control and wealth. Islam is a reversion to true faith.

""However, in seeking the truth, we must be prepared to encounter a Jesus at odds with two thousand years of false preconception and canonical corruption, the real Jesus in conflict with popularized notions, media profiles, and modern Christian teaching. Could Jesus be so contrary to personal and societal constructs that he will openly oppose the churches built around his existence? If so, then popes and priests, parsons and pastors, bishops and cardinals, evangelists and monks, ministers and messianic pretenders may all find Jesus condemning them just as he condemned the Pharisees in his homeland. In other words, a Jesus may surface who will disown those who claim to follow in his name, just as he said he would, as recorded in Matthew 7:21–23: ""

&gt;&gt;Not everyone who says to me, “Lord, Lord,” shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, “Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name, cast out demons in your name, and done many wonders in your name?” 

&gt;&gt;And then I will declare to them, “I never knew you; depart from me, you who practice lawlessness!”

Brown, Dr. Laurence B. (2008-02-22). MisGod'ed (p. 67). 

**tl;dr** The main point of my argument regarding *any* theory whatsoever of Christian atonement is this: 

1. The common point of all Christianity is that Jesus had to die for some reason or another to do something or other for us.

2. In the Muslim version, Jesus is a prophet of God, made by the very word of Allah, who gave many signs and miracles urging repentance and submission to Allah, and then was ascended into heaven. The crucifixion and how it appeared to be can be discussed, fancied about, etc, but it ultimately doesn't matter. Why?

3. Because. **A God that *needs* anyone to die to make his will be in any way is neither all-powerful nor all-good.**",,False,,t5_2snuc,1344726832.0,,,True,t3_y1xxo,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/y1xxo/to_christians_the_trinity_and_blood_atonement_are/,

1343870146.0,91,self.DebateReligion,xje5f,To Theist Philosophers: Intuition is not a great tool for determining truth,108,17,240,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/xje5f/to_theist_philosophers_intuition_is_not_a_great/,"This post is aimed at a variety of theistic arguments, which all seem to share a common thread: The use of intuition to support key premises.

Let me present a basic example of why it can be bad. 

Premise 1: If I impart impulse into an object along its axis of travel, it will increase velocity. Support: All of our experience with moving objects.

Argument:

1) If I impart impulse into an object along its' axis of travel, it will increase velocity.

2) A photon is an object

3) If I impart impulse into a photon along its' axis of travel, it will increase velocity

Now this is an argument that, up until we could observe very small scales and very high speeds, would have been very intuitive and difficult to disagree with. And yet it is wrong. Because our intuition as humans is developed off of our experiences with the everyday world. But if we are talking about deities, intellect and universe creation, our experiences with the everyday world may not apply. 

Lets look at the most recent example posted here: The Kalam Cosmological Argument (see [SinkH's infographic](http://i.imgur.com/31quP.jpg) for a truncated version).

For this post lets focus in on one quote in particular

&gt;The past cannot be infinite no matter how many universes there are. If it were infinite we would have to traverse an infinite amount of time to get to today

On the surface this seems like an intuitive reasonable assumption. 

However as is usually the case with intuition, if we look at the actual science of the universe, we see this is not true. In this particular case it is because time itself is a part of the 'fabric' of our universe. If our universe were to collapse into a singularity, time would collapse right along with it. If our universe collapsed right now, it would have taken in total, zero time. 

To go with the analogy in the infographic: imagine there is a number line starting at 0 (universe 1). And this universe ends at 5 on the number line. The ""next"" universe will not start at 6, but rather at zero again. This is because the number line itself (representing time) will collapse right along with the space dimensions of the universe. To have an infinite past, you would need a meta-number line which survives the collapses and continues to ""count.""

Another way to put this is that time must be conserved across universes in order for there to be an actual infinite past. However the science of the big bang has shown us that this is not the case. 

As you can see, intuition is not a reliable tool when we are discussing weird topics such as infinities and space-time.

Lets look at another example: evolution.

In particular lets look at Plantigna's argument that naturalistic evolution cannot provide humans with the ability to form accurate beliefs.

Without delving too deeply into the argument, lets look at one of its main supports. 

There is this idea that because evolution selects for survival foremost, not accuracy, that therefore it doesn't select for accuracy at all. 

This is often backed up with some example of complex animal cognition. Eg: A leopard could mistakenly think a cliff is actually a poisonous snake while another leopard perceives it as normal. Both would result in the leopards avoiding the cliff, and thus not falling to their death. Therefore evolution wouldn't select for the leopard that correctly identifies the cliff over the one who thinks it is a snake, because both will have equivalent survival orientated behaviors.

The problem here is three-fold. First of all when we use intuition, we generally use far to broad of strokes. In this case, only focusing in on the one interaction with the cliff (whether the leopard falls or not) does not tell the whole story. If you expand to think about millions of leopards using millions of cliffs in a myriad of ways (shelter, escape, pursuit), it becomes clear that correct identification (useful in *all* instances) will yield better results then misidentifications which happen to be useful in one or few instances. This is an issue of thinking to linearly or simply.

The second problem is thinking only in terms of direct relationships. Eg: Either survival and correctness are directly linked, or they aren't linked at all.

Such absolutes tend not to exist in nature. In this particular case, while evolution does select foremost for survival, survival itself is correlated strongly with correct sensory identification. What this means is we expect most of our senses to be accurate most of the time, and most conclusions drawn from those senses should be accurate, most of the time (things like: Im sitting in a chair, Ow that burned me, etc).

And this is exactly what we find when we look at human intellect. Humans can't always identify a bird at 300 meters, but we are pretty good at facial recognition. One of these two things is more important to our survival. 

And finally, the third problem is thinking in a macro scale. Like our photon example above, macro rules don't necessarily apply to the micro scale. 

In this case the problem is looking at a fully formed animal brain and asking ""how would it form correct conclusions."" This is jumping the gun. The correct process would be to look at a single celled organism and understand how it interacts with the world. Look for the issues you are claiming to find in the leopard brain in the single celled organism. If you don't find them there, move up to simple multi-celled organisms and repeat until you reach complex animal brains. In this way you can see how complex neural networks can form and be the result of simple chemical signaling. Each step up in complexity building on the accuracy and efficiency of the last. 

Looking at an end product (like a human brain) and intuiting that evolution could not select for such a brain to be accurate is skipping all the intermediary steps which explain exactly how that accuracy arises. 


So in conclusion:

* Intuition is not a good source for supporting your premises when talking about certain subjects.

* Things like infinity, micro-level physics and biology, and space-time are inherently un-intuitive. 

* Generally the problem with intuition is it invites equivocation and 'thinks' in too broad of strokes.


Oh and one final aside:

It is perfectly reasonable to say something like ""I find that much of philosophy is a useless venture."" Or ""Philosophy is a less rigorous form of mathematics.""

The usual response to this is ""But that statement *itself* is philosophical by nature"" and then that person leaves it at that, thinking they have made a salient point.

But they haven't. I never said all philosophy is wrong (which would be self-refuting) nor did I say that philosophy is *never* useful. Telling me that my statement is technically philosophy is a non-answer. It doesn't address my point, and adds nothing to the discussion.

Eg: ""Philosophy is generally non-rigorous; many arguments get by because of the inaccuracies and tricks of our language"" 

""That statement itself is PHILOSOPHY!"" 

""Yes, so what? That doesn't affect the content of what I wrote.""

Great. That very may well be true. But shouldn't we pause for a moment and think about WHY that might be true?

From my own experience, I've never been depressed directly because of my belief. I've never had some existential crisis over whether or not I'm right, or whether or not there's a god. I don't feel ""purposeless"" without religion. I have a great life, I feel fulfilled with my personal and professional relationships, and am generally pretty happy.

But I do get depressed sometimes. I'm depressed because if I ever wanted to run for President of the United States, I'd have to lie about my atheism to get the public to accept me. I'm depressed that certain people would think less of me or stop talking to me because of my beliefs. I'm depressed that I don't have a good relationship with my parents because of religious differences.

Basically, I'm not depressed because of atheism. I'm depressed because of the societal status of being an atheist.

----

In this essay I argue that pure faith is the worst possible source of beliefs, that unfounded beliefs lead to survival-unfriendly and hence immoral actions, and that therefore religions are by nature immoral.

## Human minds are moral computers

Contrary to what some primitive religions claim, primates, apes and especially humans are not depraved and wicked by nature. Under normal, stress-free conditions, many animals show moral behavior such as [altruism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism_in_animals), [empathy and reciprocity](http://atheistuniverse.net/group/avm/forum/topics/news-thread-empathy-and). We see stuff like defense of the weak, [fairness, and cooperation](http://www.livesofanimals.org/2010/11/02/monkey-co-operation-and-fairness/). Humans, of course, have the most complex and wide-ranging evolved moral features. Some clever experiments have even managed to demonstrate [moral behavior in infants](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/09/magazine/09babies-t.html).

Non-[psychopathic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy) humans, therefore, tend to act morally: they try to do what is best for their own survival and that of others around them. For a while, psychologists had trouble explaining on purely evolutionary grounds why [humans are even kind to strangers](http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/07/31/why-are-humans-so-nice/) but [recent experiments](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/07/20/1102131108.abstract) help to explain this too.

While much of animal behavior is mostly reaction to their environment, humans have superior abilities of planning and abstract thought, allowing them to tackle [complex projects involving large numbers of actors](http://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/introduction.htm). The human brain is adapted to make complex rational decisions to determine the optimal actions for accomplishing its goals. At a pragmatic level, a human's whole life can be seen as one instance after another of considering, planning and performing actions that lead to human thriving, welfare and happiness; mostly his own, but where possible also those around him.

All that said, evolved human morals only get us as far as pack survival; a few ""human pack"" behaviors tarnish the ""noble savage"" idea a bit: [blind obedience to authority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment) can have bad consequences, and the same goes for [in-group bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-group_bias) and [pre-emptive attacks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7XuXi3mqYM) (remember the Operation Iraqi Freedom?). So what do we stand on when we make such judgments?

Because of our ability for abstract reasoning, we've recognized that morals are about well-being and harm. We can extend our evolved moral code by examining our behavior in terms of well-being and harm. It turns out that essentially all the actions we consider ""good"" is helping ourselves and/or other people to be healthier, happier, more secure... better. Actions we consider ""bad"" injure or otherwise harm people, or make them unhappy or insecure. [Sam Harris examines this in considerable depth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKwxPh8iWJc). Modern societies, therefore, give a lot of thought to what could be done to ensure the well-being of people in societies. Animals too, while we're at it - they can feel too, so they should at least get some consideration. Popular awareness of moral issues keeps improving. We've meanwhile even assigned [stages to moral development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development). 

Getting back to the human brain: you could say it is a biological machine for observing its environment and gaining knowledge from it, reasoning with that knowledge and considering and planning actions. As Richard Carrier explains in [Sense &amp; Goodness Without God](http://books.google.com/books?id=oFdMzq56qyEC&amp;dq=CARRIER&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;source=gbs_gdata) (pp. 181-185), it generally does a good job both of perceiving reality and reasoning with it. The proof (grossly simplified) is in human survival: If the brain failed at either task, humans would have been eaten by tigers.

## Garbage in, garbage out

But apart from often working less than rationally thanks to its emotional component, biases and inherent limitations, the human computer shares a ""fatal weakness"" with other computers: [The quality of its decisions depends on the quality of its data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_In,_Garbage_Out). Given a smoothly working rational process, the ""best"" decisions require the best data, i.e. a collection of knowledge (or beliefs) that most closely mirrors the reality of the world. In general, *there is no set of incorrect, i.e. reality-defying beliefs such that a human operating on those beliefs can reach ""better"" decisions than on the most realistic beliefs available,* just like there is no alcoholic drink that will make us a better driver than being sober. If we accept that humans try to act in a ""good"" moral way, then the most moral possible human behavior requires the most realistic possible knowledge of the real world.

## The moral obligation to truth

William Clifford's essay [The Ethics of Belief](http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/w_k_clifford/ethics_of_belief.html) illustrates how it is every human's moral obligation to assure himself of the truthfulness of his beliefs. Highly recommended reading!

Alan Sokal says similar things in a different way:

&gt; If you are sloppy about evaluating evidence, then you are ethically liable for the mistakes that you’ve made. [ ~45:00 mark ]
The main point is … it’s important when you make claims about factual matters in the world, to understand clearly what is the evidence on which those claims are based and to and try evaluate that evidence as impartially as possible. [ ~45:50 mark ]  

&gt; Source: &lt;http://colinmarshall.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=404357&gt; 

So if someone ignores or rejects the best available evidence -- or worse, they preemptively reject it -- then they are making an ethical error, not just a factual one.

## How to find the truthiest truth

How can we arrive at the ""truest"" truth possible, the most credible assertions about reality? Let's look at what epistemology has to say about our mechanisms of quality control for beliefs. This is pretty standard philosophic fare, but I'm taking the following list from [Sense &amp; Goodness](http://books.google.com/books?id=oFdMzq56qyEC&amp;dq=CARRIER&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;source=gbs_gdata) (pp. 53-60). Here, in descending order of reliability, are the methods of discovering truth, with summarized explanations:

1. **The method of reason.** Within the realms of logic and mathematics, reasoning leads to the broadest, most complete and most consistent success. Basically, a proof based on reasoning, unless it contains errors, leads with certainty to a solidly correct result. Alas, pure reason only works this way on abstract concepts. Out in the real world, we need other methods:

2. **The method of science.** Science is actually a collection of methods that take all the other methods of finding the truth and works very hard at quality control to achieve the highest standard of truth about reality attainable outside the method of pure reason.

3. **The method of experience.** ""Seeing is believing,"" so this method is ""better"" than anything that comes below. But human observation is open to some errors, such as hallucination or misperception, that make one's own experience less reliable than experience validated by scientific investigation.

4. **The method of history.** If we can't observe an event ourselves, as is the case with historic events, our best bet is to apply critical historical analysis on reports from the past. We look for the most reliable sources and corroborate their information with other information, and that's the best we can do for past events.

5. **The method of expert testimony.** If we don't ourselves have direct access to sources of information, we can consult experts for their knowledge and interpretation. That's essentially applying methods 2 through 4 second-hand. This method can be strengthened by ensuring our expert has the qualifications, agreement with other experts and so forth.

6. **The method of plausible inference.** If we have incomplete facts, it's permissible to try to reach generalizations from those, if we're careful. Inductive logic, extrapolation, and interpolation of evidence and facts is how this is done. Sometimes this is the best we can do, but where one of the above methods is available, we should scrap our results for those from the ""better"" method.

7. **The method of pure faith.** To quote Carrier: ""... refers to basing beliefs solely on tradition, hearsay, desire or mere speculation. That is, faith in this sense is trusting what we are told, or just 'guess' or want to be true, without requiring any proof. In other words, believing an ungrounded assertion.""

The wording of this last and least trustworthy method of arriving at ideas about the world of course leads us into... religion. 

## The dubious truthfulness of religions

For the purpose of this discussion, religions satisfy [this simple dictionary definition](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=define%3A+religion): 

&gt; *The belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, esp. a personal God or gods.*

That handily includes the Abrahamic faiths, Hinduism and a few others, but excludes some forms of Buddhism and Taoism that are essentially philosophies and do not involve supernatural entities.

There is no way to prove the supernatural claims of religions, because if they were available for verification they would be part of the natural world, and thus not supernatural. At their most honest and when pressed for proof, all religions break down to admit: ""**you've got to have faith.**""

In other words, the ideas of religion come to us via the weakest of all the seven methods listed above!

Outside of pure faith, there is no reason to believe that Yahweh or Vishnu pre-exist the universe, any more than Zeus or Thor or Ra. On the other hand, the [anthropology of religions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology_of_religion) yields strong evidence that religions (and their deities) are the inventions of humans:

&gt; In 1841, Ludwig Feuerbach was the first to state the anthropologic principle that every religion is created by the human community that worships it.  

## Faith-based beliefs and their effect on moral behavior

Thus, when we include religious claims in our belief systems, we run a high risk of including false information, especially when such claims contradict information that we arrive at by one of the other methods. On a basis of *false* beliefs we cannot act *more* morally than on beliefs based on reality. *Any* of the other methods of arriving at knowledge are better suited to yielding correct data than pure faith is.

So what happens when we accept beliefs on faith? Let's look at Christianity simply by expedient of it being familiar to me and a majority of readers. Here are a few examples, of beliefs once held by earlier, less enlightened Christians:

* **Women are less valuable than men, and should be subservient to them.**  
Today we consider such an attitude as misogyny.
* **Raising obedient children calls for corporal punishment.**  
[Evidence-based research](http://www.repeal43.org/docs/Gershoff%20meta-analytic%20review%3A02.pdf) shows that children who were routinely beaten tend to grow up to be violent, often criminal adults.
* **Black people are tainted by God's punishment, and fit to be slaves.**  
Biology yields a more plausible explanation for skin color, and modern society has realized that the concept of slavery is immoral.
* **Jews are the murderers of Christ and therefore evil as a group.**  
This Christian idea has led to a lot of antisemitism and persecution.
* **Black cats are witches' familiars and/or demons, and bring plague.**  
Another faith-based idea, though not biblical, ironically led to large-scale killing (a genocide, if you will) of [one of Europe's few defenses against the plague](http://ezinearticles.com/?Cats,-People,-and-the-Black-Plague---Those-Who-Kept-Cats-Survived&amp;id=161249).
* **Belief in Protestantism/Catholicism is so abhorrent that its practitioners must be converted at all costs or killed.**  
This belief led to [the European wars of religion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_wars_of_religion) and more.
* **Gays are an abomination and should be stoned.**  
This view is still held [uncomfortably close](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/30/rick-warren-refuses-to-co_n_373605.html) to ""modern"" societies.

These are all beliefs that were held, on faith, by the majority of Christians; some Christians still hold some of these beliefs today. Most of us consider the actions advised by these beliefs immoral, and condemn them. So it's easy to see that, in this indefinite Christian past we're looking at,  beliefs held on faith led at least some people to act in ways we now consider immoral. All else being equal, people without these beliefs (at that time) would have acted more morally than those with.

## Where do our morals come from?

Many, but not all, of these old, ""evil"" ideas come from the Bible. Those of us who consider these ideas ""bad"" and outmoded are obviously not applying the Bible as a standard and source of our morals. Where, then, do our morals come from? Simply put, societies learn - often from what works and what doesn't. So in terms of morals, we've often applied methods 2-6 and kicked faith-based method 7. But having already discarded the Bible as an authority in many cases, why not honestly take the next step and discard it in all?

The Bible contains a few universally recognized morals, attributed by Christians to Jesus: ""Do unto others"" is the best known example. Of course, this particular idea arose [long before Jesus](http://www.keen.com/documents/works/articles/spiritual/the-evolution-of-the-golden-rule.asp), and it's meanwhile been refined into [Kant's Categorical Imperative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative). Because of its few useful lessons, many Christians consider the Bible an invaluable moral reference. My guess is that this essentially comes down to lacking study both of the Bible and history.

## The future of morality

I think it would be conceited to believe that we and our societies have arrived at the pinnacle of moral consciousness. Rather, I predict that the past trend will continue and societies will jettison even more Biblical morals. In other words, I'm convinced that, just as today's society condemns some of yesterday's Biblical morals, so will tomorrow's society condemn some of today's.

Why wait for this future when we can move to act more morally (and improve the human condition) today?

## Conclusion

Because faith-based beliefs are epistemologically of the lowest quality, Christians and other theists stand only to gain from kicking them to the curb. Until they do, they will always run the risk of acting less morally than people who base their beliefs and actions on reality.",,False,,t5_2snuc,True,,flair,True,t3_jdqxj,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/jdqxj/to_theists_religions_are_inherently_immoral/,

Allow me to make an admission: I don't know every detail about how the human brain works. I just don't. I know a lot, since it's the kind of topic I like to research, but there are huge swaths of knowledge I just don't possess.

Similarly, I don't have a comprehensive grasp of physics. Oh, I have a solid layman's understanding -- I could give you an overview of why the speed of light seems to be the absolute speed limit without making Lawrence Krauss smack me around, for instance -- but he knows a lot more than I ever will on the subject.

And while I'm not at all bad with evolutionary biology, its not like I'm comparable to real evolutionary biologists.

But I don't need to be an expert in all of these fields to be skeptical of claims that amount to little more than the idea that God hides anywhere there is a lack of knowledge. When theists insist that materialism of the mind is disproved because we can't explain every little detail about how the mind works (yet), there is no onus on me to accept that as anything more than the transparent attempt to shift the burden of proof that it is. No, I can't prove beyond all doubt that the mind arises from purely physical processes, but I don't have to. The onus is on the theist to show that **non**-physical processes of the mind exist. In much the same way, I've no need to display absolute knowledge of the workings of time and space to reject theistic claims regarding their origins as unproved, nor have I a need to possess perfect knowledge of evolutionary biology to contest ""intelligent design.""

That isn't to say I haven't greatly enjoyed delving into these topics when they inevitably arise, and it's not to say there isn't benefit to be gleaned in tackling the questions theists raise to try to counter our skepticism.

But make no mistake: Those questions are attempts to shift the burden of proof, to make skepticism defend itself, because there are no good responses to an atheist merely asking for evidence to back up theistic claims.

I think it's a good idea to remind ourselves now and again that the skepticism with which we regard theism doesn't actually need defense.

So I'd like to take a different tack, and see if I can maybe learn something along the way.

When I see a cosmological argument, this is what it looks like to me:

* P1: A premise proposing that there is an infinite regress of some sort.
* P2: A premise proposing that infinite regresses are impossible.
* C: A conclusion resolving that the infinite regress must therefore halt somewhere.

1. Am I wrong? Are cosmological arguments not essentially structured with two contradictory premises this way?
2. If I am wrong, is there a simple, clear, unambiguously and unequivocally worded way of expressing a cosmological argument that does not rely on such a contradiction in any way, shape, or form?
3. If I am right, is it actually valid to use two mutually contradictory premises if, for example, both can be shown logically or empirically to be true? I thought the principle of explosion ruled such things out, but I, again, must accept the possibility I'm wrong.

**Life Itself**

---


First we suffer the traumatic experience of being pushed through a vagina, a task that people used to often die undertaking, and we enter life as if shot from a cannon towards a brick wall littered with rusty nails. In America alone, 87 babies a day are born with a  coronary heart condition, 80 with a genital tract defects,  27 with cerebral palsy,  12 with downs syndrome, 11 with fetal alcohol syndrome and the list goes on. Over 121 children each day are born in America alone with something extremely wrong with them. That is 1% of the population blighted before their lives have been begun. Over 44,000 a year in the United States alone.

Assuming we survive being born, we are then subject to the most appalling of ailments; childhood leukaemia, haemophilia, sickle cell anaemia , multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, Parkinson’s. These horrific things attach themselves onto us and kill us with remarkable ease and from the earliest of ages. The survival rate for living beyond the age of 16 was minute post medicine. 

And it doesn’t get better with age: beyond the age of 30, our teeth start to go, it becomes more likely we contract even more forms of cancer (prostate springs to mind), our vision slowly gets worse as does our memory. So not only can we not see, we forget the blurry objects. It makes Noah’s 950 year life span all the more impressive.

**Universal Problems**

We’re the only species on the planet to suffer from epilepsy and a fear of the dark. To be fair, I think we’re the only mammal that actually ‘fears’ the dark beyond impulse. And this occurs in the tiny part of the electromagnetic spectrum we can actually see. We can’t detect magnetic fields either; ionising radiation fields, radon, CO, CH4 and CO2 all have the potential to kill us and we can’t sense them without the aid of technology.  So you’ll forgive me if I don’t praise the eye as some wonderful creation of God.

None of this is helped by the numerous imperfections with a perfectly health body; our thumbs aren’t as good as they could be, our pre-frontal lobes are too small, our adrenaline glands are too big, our balance is terrible, our senses are stunted and I have managed to poke my own eye out before. What the fuck?

We’re extremely inefficient too; we exhale almost all of the oxygen we inhale, the fact we’re warm blooded means we need so much more energy just to function and we spend roughly 1/3 of life comatose.  A crocodile can eat a chicken a month at twice our weight and be absolutely fine. Probably awake more, too.

It astounds me that a creator would make our mouth the input source for water, food and oxygen. This makes it certain that a small amount of us will die each year from choking. It makes it certain that accidental death will occur, usually among the young. 

And why oh why are our sex fun time organs right next to our anuses? What type of engineer puts tools essential to both entertainment and survival next to a sewage system?

I'm guessing they don't teach these parts in church:

When a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod so hard that the slave dies under his hand, he shall be punished.  If, however, the slave survives for a day or two, he is not to be punished, since the slave is his own property.  (Exodus 21:20-21 NAB)

You would think that Jesus and the New Testament would have a different view of slavery, but slavery is still approved of in the New Testament, as the following passages show.
 
Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear.  Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ.  (Ephesians 6:5 NLT)
 
Christians who are slaves should give their masters full respect so that the name of God and his teaching will not be shamed.  If your master is a Christian, that is no excuse for being disrespectful.  You should work all the harder because you are helping another believer by your efforts.  Teach these truths, Timothy, and encourage everyone to obey them.  (1 Timothy 6:1-2 NLT)
 
In the following parable, Jesus clearly approves of beating slaves even if they didn't know they were doing anything wrong.
 
The servant will be severely punished, for though he knew his duty, he refused to do it.  ""But people who are not aware that they are doing wrong will be punished only lightly.

This might not go over so well with majority of readers but it needs to be said and I wanted to get an opinion of how many people feel the way I do.

I’ll start be creating a word and defining it so it’s easier to write out the rest.

A **Dit**: Someone who is unable to understand a view point other than their own.  A person who misunderstands/manipulates knowledge to conform to their view point.

Growing up I use to think people of other faiths were dits, soon after I realized; people of my faith have a lot of dits. Finally I realized I was a dit myself. I have been working/learning to understand the bigger picture of things and not be a dits. It’s a continuous process.  I respect a lot of people on this sub reddit, I understand their view point and find them to be rationale and intelligent. These people consist of atheists, agnostics, theists and everything in between. 

This is where I’m starting to see a problem. Atheism is on the rise and in a lot of ways it has established itself as the “rationale” belief (lack of belief) or the right way of thinking. I think with this sort of idea in the back of people’s head, especially the new atheists on Reddit, it has given them a false sense of pride and blindness. Before I continue, I’m not saying this about all Atheists, just some. It’s funny because for the longest time, atheists have been the ones to call out people of faith as being blind and unable to think rationally but now I realize, as a belief system or way of thinking grows, no matter how rationale the idea may be, a lot of the followers will remain dits.

In the past few posts, especially the ones that have been about a specific religion, I have seen these extreme atheist/agnostic dits come in and spam thinking they are raising great points. A lot of it has to do with purposely taking things out of context, misreading posts, pointing out/leading the discussion in targeted way, raising cliché points that have nothing do with the topic of discussion or simply saying zingers/ one liners that they know will get up votes. The worst part of it is, there are enough of them and they keep up-voting these posts creating false sense clarity. It’s not that bad right now but I have a feeling it’s going to get worse as this subreddit grows. 

**Please note**: I don’t want raise a debate of atheism VS theism. I’m pointing out the way the respective “followers” of beliefs are acting. I wanted to see your thoughts on this.

As such, pantheism denotes the idea that ""God"" is best seen as a process of relating to the Universe.[2] The central ideas found in almost all pantheistic beliefs are the view of the Cosmos as an all-encompassing unity, reverence for the Cosmos, and recognition of the sacredness of the Universe and Nature.",,False,,t5_2snuc,1340236749.0,,flair,True,t3_vajz3,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/vajz3/pantheist_question_to_an_atheist/,
1331328811.0,72,self.DebateReligion,qpflj,To all: A gentle reminder that equivocation makes for a poor argument,84,12,312,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/qpflj/to_all_a_gentle_reminder_that_equivocation_makes/,"**TL;DR:** Equivocation is bad. Michael Jackson is bad. Equivocation is Michael Jackson.

(Bonus points to anyone who realized immediately that my equivocation was on the word ""bad"")

***

I'd like to urge everyone here to take a few moments and examine the arguments we're using to make sure there aren't any unintentional equivocations.

Equivocation is the use of a word or phrase that can be interpreted in multiple ways, without specifying which meaning you intend to use. For example, if I say ""light bulb,"" am I referring to an incandescent source of visible light, or a bulbous plant start that doesn't weigh very much? Most people would assume the former without context, but if I take advantage of that by *implying* the former while actually *meaning* the latter, then I am equivocating. If I'm making a joke -- ""Is that a light bulb?"" ""No, it's actually a very heavy bulb!"" -- then that's fine. But if I'm trying to make an argument in favor of my position, then I'm undercutting myself and rendering my argument invalid.

Equivocations are **formal** fallacies, albeit subtly. Take the following syllogism, for example:

1. All *A* are *B*
2. All *B* are *C*
3. Therefore, all *A* are *C*

This is valid, but only if *B* is unambiguous. If *B* is ambiguous, then it looks like this:

1. All *A* are *B(1)*
2. All *B(2)* are *C*
3. Therefore, all *A* are *C*

This kind of fallacy is called *quaternio terminorum*, and it kills the argument that relies on it dead, because it breaks the syllogism it is part of.

Now, as an atheist, I'm admittedly biased in my perceptions. Off the top of my head, I can only think of theist arguments that use this tactic. But that doesn't mean atheists don't make the same mistake. I've probably made it myself, and I'd prefer not to. Nevertheless, I must use a theist example here, although I'll happily edit this post to include an example of atheistic equivocation if someone could point me to one.

The theistic example I'd like to use is the formulation of the Kalām cosmological argument presented by William Lane Craig:

&gt; 1. Whatever begins to exist must have a cause.

&gt; 2. The universe began to exist.

&gt; 3. Therefore, the universe must have a cause.

Whatever one thinks of the second premise -- personally, I find it incoherent, as it's not clear the universe ""began"" in any sense that could be associated with linear time -- I would instead like to focus on what I perceive as an equivocation by omission. That is, the argument equivocates first by leaving out key elements that would clarify its meaning (and render P1 directly at odds with P2); and second by conflating two different meanings under the same word to produce a superficially valid syllogism.

If P1 is expanded to include what William Lane Craig has omitted, it reads like this:

&gt; 1(b). Whatever begins to exist ***ex materia*** must have a cause.

""Ex materia"" means ""out of material."" In other words, creation of a thing out of another thing. Carpentry, for instance.

This is what he means, although he doesn't explicitly say so. *Ex materia* creation is the only type of creation with which any member of the human species has any familiarity, and the only one for which P1 could therefore be a sound empirical premise. But by leaving it out, William Lane Craig is able to move on to P2, where the other half of the equivocation lies. Again, let us include what he has omitted:

&gt; 2(b). The universe began to exist ***ex nihilo***.

Now, before any supporters of WLC get upset, I know he's on record as saying that it could have been *ex materia*. This brings us to ask, why didn't he just say so from the start? The answer, of course, is that even more so than with *creatio ex nihilo*, it is unknown and unknowable whether or not the universe could be made of something pre-existing. The premise is demonstrably unsound if he specifies *ex materia*, so he must hedge and say it ""might"" have been:

&gt; 2(c). The universe began to exist either ***ex nihilo*** or ***ex materia***.

2(b) doesn't work with 1(b). 2(c) hints at *ex materia* creation to make it superficially compatible with 1(b), but is unsound. That leaves him with little choice but to implicitly equate *ex materia* and *ex nihilo* without making it explicit. In other words, equivocation.

I recognize that I'm not single-handedly going to convince many -- or any -- regular theist readers here that William Lane Craig is arguing from formal fallacies. The most common defense I've seen is that it is valid to roll *ex materia* and *ex nihilo* creation into one. If you accept that, great. But please understand that to most atheists, it just looks like word games.

Now I'd like to open the floor to theists and atheists alike to discuss other fallacies of equivocation. I'm particularly interested in atheist equivocations, as I haven't been able to come up with one. If you'd like to argue in favor of the Kalām, by all means, go ahead, but you're going to need a damn good reason to make *ex materia* and *ex nihilo* synonymous enough to validate WLC's syllogism. Now that I perceive a formal fallacy in it, it really does appear doomed to me.

The basic things to consider with any argument are: is your argument *logically valid,* is it *sound,* what *fallacies* if any prevent it from being as such, and *just what kind of argument is this anyway?*

**Validity**

To begin, consider the following argument:

1. If George Bush is an idiot, then George Michael is king of the moon.
2. George Bush is an idiot.
3. Therefore, George Michael is king of the moon.

How many different kinds of logical fallacies did you count in that argument? The answer: one, and it isn't ""ad hominem."" By the time you're done with this short guide, you will be able to say clearly and precisely what is wrong with this argument using the simple language of logic, and what's best, you won't have to memorize a long list of named logical fallacies or need to know any Latin terms at all in order to spot the problems with the above argument.

To begin with the most basic atom of logic, this argument is technically *valid.* All it takes for an argument to be valid is for its conclusions to logically follow from its premises, usually by adhering to one of the *[basic rules of inference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rules_of_inference)*; in this case, it is a valid form of *[modus ponens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens)*. Modus ponens is kind of reasoning you use most often in the real world and it takes the form:

1. If x, then y. [Or, y follows from x.]
2. X is true.
3. Therefore, y.

The basic rules of inference take very intuitive forms. For example, simplification:

1. X and Y.
2. Therefore, X.
3. Therefore, Y.

Addition:

1. X.
2. Therefore, X or Y. [Non-exclusive ""or.""]

Hypothetical syllogism:

1. If X, then Y.
2. If Y, then Z.
3. Therefore, if X, then Z.

Disjunctive syllogism:

1. X or Y.
2. Not X.
3. Therefore, Y.

These are just some of the general forms of logical inference, and any argument that satisfies these forms is what we call ""valid,"" and any argument that does not satisfy one of these forms is invalid. For example:

1. If Socrates is a man, then Socrates is mortal.
2. Socrates is mortal.
3. Therefore, Socrates is a man.

This inference is not valid because it does not satisfy any of the necessary forms of inference- it is modus ponens with one step backwards. This brings us to the first of the two major categories of logical fallacy: the *non sequitur.* All of the logical fallacies with names that you've heard belong to one of two and a half major categories: the *non sequitur,* the *false premise,* and *equivocation.* I treat equivocation as a special case because equivocation can be thought of as *both* a non sequitur and a false premise, but we'll get there when we get there. For now, lets talk about the *non sequitur.*

As you've seen, all logical arguments take the form of a conclusion derived from premises. In these examples, the premises are the numbered statements and the conclusions are the statements beginning with ""therefore."" When building an argument, you are trying to make it so that *the conclusion is true in virtue of the premises.* Since arguments have these two simple features, namely, premises and conclusions, the only way arguments can logically go wrong is for a premise to be false or for the conclusion to not follow from them.

(Note that if a conclusion ultimately does not follow from the premises, that does not make the conclusion necessarily false- only heretofore undemonstrated.) 

**The non sequitur**

The *non sequitur* is the subset of logical fallacies explaining why a conclusion does not follow from premises *even if all the premises are true.* In the above example, there is a fallacious ""affirming the consequent:"" it simply does not follow from ""A is a B and all Cs are Bs"" that ""A is a C."" If you think about A, B, and C as venn diagrams, you will easily be able to see that there is no necessary overlap between them.

But this subreddit is about debating religion, so let me give you some examples of *non sequiturs* that we should *all* be trying to avoid:

1. Religion is evil.
2. Therefore, religion is false.

This is a *non sequitur* type you might call the ""appeal to consequences,"" namely, the assumption that whatever has negative consequences must be false. One could build a very effective case for Holocaust denial if this type of inference were not a *non sequitur.*

1. The universe looks very complicated to me.
2. Therefore, the universe was designed by a preternatural superintelligence.

You could call this kind of fallacy the ""appeal to ignorance"" or the ""appeal to personal incredulity."" The argument exposes its falsehood when you realize that, in order for it to be true, it would require an additional, very odd-sounding premise like ""2. Whatever looks very complicated to me must have been designed by a preternatural superintelligence.""

1. Historically, some participants in a certain ideology have done evil things.
2. Therefore, all aspirants to that ideology will do evil things.

Call this a ""hasty generalization"" if you like, or whatever other name you want for it. The trick to arguments of this sort is to think about what kind of third principle would be required for the argument to become *valid* (in this case, something like ""2. Participants in ideologies always act like other participants in that ideology""), and a good rule of thumb is that, if the additional hidden or necessary premise sounds as odd as the examples I've given here, you've probably got a rickety argument on your hands.

The important point, though, is that for purposes of logic, *the names of the fallacies don't matter.* You might have spent some time looking at skeptical websites trying to memorize list upon list of fancy, Latin-sounding names, but this is unnecessary. Most of the time, the only thing you'll have to know how to say is ""that doesn't follow,"" meaning that there is a *non sequitur* afoot, or ""that premise is false,"" which is coming in greater detail. You can memorize all the ""ad thisses"" and ""post hoc ergo proptor thats"" all you want, but you are just cluttering up the debate with terms that are unnecessary and that can be explained in plain language much more easily.

But if the conclusion does follow from the premises, as in, if you have a conclusion or series of conclusion following from a series of premises (I can't think of any particularly useful argument that would have only one premise) and those conclusions follow according to one of the basic forms of inference, your argument is *valid.* But what happens when you get an argument that looks like the original example, about George Bush and George Michael?

**Soundness and the false premise**

The next big hurdle for an argument to overcome before we should accept it is the hurdle of ""soundness."" An argument is ""sound"" only if the conclusion follows from the premises *and* all of the premises are true. Take a more religion-sounding version of a patently absurd, logically valid argument:

1. If Muhammed and Jesus walk into a bar, then Satan is a leper.
2. Muhammed and Jesus walk into a bar.
3. Therefore, Satan is a leper.

It should be plain to anybody except ""[Jesus and Mo](http://www.jesus-and-mo.net]"" fundamentalist literalists that both of these premises are false: Jesus and Muhammed never walked into a bar together, and even if they did, there is no reason to think that their doing so would entail that Satan is a leper. This is the *false premise* category of fallacies, and it means just like what it sounds like: whether the conclusion follows from the premises is irrelevant because at least one of the premises is false.

In the primordial argument about George Bush and George Michael, the only fallacy was the *false premise,* and whether it applies to just 1 or both 1 and 2 is I suppose a matter of perspective, but there was no ""ad hominem"" in that sentence. The ""ad hominem"" is the fallacy I see being most widely abused in arguments about religion, not in that people use them too much, but quite the opposite: most people think the ad hominem is something that it isn't. For example:

1. If Averroes is insincere, then we shouldn't take his declarations seriously.
2. Averroes is insincere.
3. Therefore, we shouldn't take his declarations seriously.

Now remember, the only way arguments can go wrong is by false premises or *non sequiturs,* (or by equivocation; we're getting there), and this argument is formally valid. But whether its premises are true or not is an *empirical question,* not a logical one- we need to actually know more about Averroes and his sincerity to figure out how much we accept this argument. Put another way, *not all insults are ad hominems* and *not all ad hominems are insults.* The *ad hominem* is any kind of false premise that extrapolates more from somebody's character than is warranted. To wit:

1. Adolf Hitler was a vegetarian who loved animals.
2. Anyone who is a vegetarian and loves animals is an alright guy.
3. Therefore, Hitler is an alright guy.

Now, this is a *positive* description of someone and not an insult but it is still an *ad hominem.* Why? Because its second premise falsely extrapolates wildly beyond what we can say with truthful certainty or confidence about vegetarians who love animals. Whether such is the case in the first argument about the Pope being an idiot depends on your definition of ""idiot,"" which brings us to the trickiest, single-term class of fallacies called equivocation.

Consider the following argument:
1. If men and women aren't the same, they shouldn't be treated the same by the law.
2. Men and women aren't the same.
3. Therefore men and women shouldn't be treated the same by the law.

Now this is an argument that *appears* to be valid and *appears* to have two true premises, but there is some fancy footwork going on with its vocabulary that should be making you suspicious. There is a term that repeats in the argument ""the same,"" that seems like it could cut several different ways that all bear quite powerfully on the outcome of the argument. In the second use, ""the same"" seems like something like ""equality under the law,"" but in the first and third uses, ""the same"" seems more like ""biologically identical."" 

As is the normal test for a fallacious equivocation, lets see if we can swap around these parsed definitions and still get a good argument:

1. If men and women aren't biologically identical, then they shouldn't be treated as equals under the law.
2. Men and women aren't biologically identical.
3. Therefore, they shouldn't be treated as equals under the law.

Now the argument is still valid but that it is sound (namely that its first premise is true) now seems much more dubious, but you haven't changed any of the key terms in the argument: you have added *no new information whatsoever* to the premises, you've just been more specific about what the premises *mean.* The argument as presented was relying on a turn of phrase, a bit of clever wordplay on the word ""same,"" to noodle your way into a position that, on further examination, is quite a bit less airtight than the ""sameness"" formulation suggests.

I put the equivocation in a kind of its own because it isn't *really* just a false premise, and it's *sort of* a non sequitur, but it makes more sense to think of it as both, because usually when you find an equivocation, it means that the conclusion is being invalidly inferred from a premise that is false anyway, though in the above case it functions just as a false premise. 

[This example is borrowed from Anthony Weston's ""A Rulebook for Arguments,"" 3rd edition- you can buy it for [one cent](http://www.amazon.com/Rulebook-Arguments-Anthony-Weston/dp/0872205525) on Amazon, and it is an excellent thing to keep handy for when you're trying to have a formal debate].

To sum up, then, when people start slinging around ""logical fallacies"" and their fancy Latin names, remind yourself that you are really only trying to answer three questions:

1. Are the premises true?
2. Does the conclusion logically follow from the premises?
3. Are the terms in the argument being used consistently?

If the answer to all three is yes, then get out your ""concede"" tag, because the argument is inescapable. If the answer to 1 or 2 is ""no,"" then slap a ""disagree"" on that sucker because you've got yourself a ringer. If the answer to 3 is ""no,"" go with your ""clarify"" tag because something smells fishy.

**Kinds of arguments**

*1. The basic inference.*

For the purposes of very basic logic, arguments come only in three general forms. The first is the kind of argument that, for lack of a better name, I will call ""basic inference."" These are arguments that go like:

1. Premise asserted as true.
2. Premise asserted as true.
( and so on )
3. Conclusion.

Most arguments are of this kind because they are usually the only kinds needed, and the other two names I'm going to throw at you would be considered by most logicians to be mere subspecies of ""basic inference."" I'm separating them because I think that there is some nuance to them, and because I think that having a separate terminology for them is useful.

*2. The reductio ad absurdum.*

This is a term that you may have heard used before, and you probably heard it used incorrectly. It is not a fallacy, even though it sounds like it must mean ""reduces to absurdity,"" but what it actually means is ""reduction *to* absurdity."" It is a kind of argument where you-

* take something that you want to show is false,
* assume that it is true *just for the sake of argument,*
* show that something contradictory or absurd would follow from that something if it were true.

For example, suppose that you're a Problem of Evil kind of person. *I'm* a Problem of Evil kind of person. This is generally speaking the most common and most powerful tool in the atheistic arsenal. Whether you buy the argument or not, I think it's a very simple, very easy-to-understand demonstration of the three structural elements of the reductio ad absurdum. To wit:

1. Let's say God exists.
2. If God exists, then there are no instances of gratuitous, purposeless suffering.
3. But there are instances of gratuitous, purposeless suffering.
4. So something's wrong here. Either God's existence doesn't entail that there are no instances of gratuitous, purposeless suffering (""not-2""), or God doesn't exist (""not-1"").

And that's the argument. The atheist would say that 4 shows that either God is not perfectly good (since his existence wouldn't entail a lack of gratuitous evil) or that God doesn't exist, the theist would say that God's existence is compatible with what *appear to us* to be instances of gratuitous, purposeless suffering. (Myself, I prefer my problems of evil not to go this way, but to [start from the suffering and look upwards](http://teapotatheism.blogspot.com/2010/02/simple-statement-of-moral-inadequacy-of.html), but you get the idea.) Arguments of this kind can be either very simple or very complicated, and you can probably see their close familial relationship with arguments of the normal logical type. 

The trick to these is to just remember the title: you are trying to *reduce to absurdity* some premise that someone wants you to accept; if a contradiction follows from something, it could not be true.

*3. The conditional proof.*

These arguments are very similar to the *reductio* in that they begin by assuming something that hasn't been demonstrated, but this time, think of it as a general exploratory venture into what *could be* if a certain proposition were true. Take a logical expansion of some of the Qur'anic rules of war:

1. If you have treaties with the unbelievers, then honor those treaties unless they attack you.
2. If they attack you, you must attack them back and your obligations to honor your treaties to them are voided.
3. If you attack the unbelievers, do not transgress limits, and a fifth share of the booty belongs to orphans.

This is a pretty complex series of propositions. The conditional proof is where you just throw in another premise *assumed to be true just to see what happens,* usually with the purposes of either clarifying an argument or proving that some conditional statement is true.

Suppose that, on these Qur'anic rules of war (this list is by no means complete) you want to prove that, if the unbelievers attack you, then you should attack them back and not transgress limits:

1. If you have treaties with the unbelievers, then honor those treaties unless they attack you.
2. If they attack you, you must attack them back and your obligations to honor your treaties to them are voided.
3. If you must attack the unbelievers, do not transgress limits, and a fifth share of the booty belongs to orphans.
4. The unbelievers attack you. [assumed for conditional proof]
5. You must attack the unbelievers. (from 4 and 2)
6. Do not transgress limits. [from 3 and 5]

Now, since we have reached the conclusion we were trying to reach, we close off the conditional assumption because we got what we need out of it. We can now validly say:

Seven. If the unbelievers attack you, you must attack the unbelievers, and do not transgress limits. [from 4, 5, and 6]

Note that this does not say that you must attack the unbelievers and not transgress limits, just that these things are true *just in the case that* the unbelievers attack you.

The conditional proof, true to its name, can only yield you conditional statements because the only point of the proof is to explore the hypothetical consequences of an assumption. This would be useful for you just in case that assumption happens to be true, or just in case your argument is very complicated and needs clarifying.

1368089857.0,69,self.DebateReligion,1dzpbs,To Muslims: What do YOU think are the causes of Islamic violence in contemporary times and what can be the solution(s)?,86,17,167,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1dzpbs/to_muslims_what_do_you_think_are_the_causes_of/,"Hello.

In our present day and age, we are seeing Islamic violence all across the world. *When I say Islamic violence, I mean violence that uses uses Islam and Islamic scripture as a justification, not violence done by people of the Islamic faith.* 

It can be said that in the 60s the Muslim world was more liberal than what it is now, and consequent political causes have caused this degradation. 

My question is, 

a) Can a genuine exegesis be given to support Islamic violence? By genuine I mean internally consistent

b) Why is the enemy being seen as non Muslims as a whole instead of certain forces? I refer to terrorism aimed at Christians in parts of Africa (Boko Haram), Islamic terrorism in India (LeT) etc

c) If the enemy is seen as non Muslims as a whole, why are there frequent blasts in Pakistan targeting Shias and Sunnis?

d) Regarding mullahs who give out frequent fatwas against homosexuals, or women or authors etc, do these people do it to keep a power base, or do you think that they are genuinely believing in what they say? This ties in with question 1

Lastly, what can be the solution?

Thanks and let me know if something is unclear


Edit: Apparently people have decided to nitpick by pointing out that there are Muslims outside Afghanistan and that there is more than one country in the Middle East. In light of these shocking revelations, I'd like to point out that in the context of contemporary Islamic violence, which this thread refers to, the Middle East is the hotbed. So I mean that region when I talk about what it was in the past. I only mention Afghanistan to a commenter asking for proof of my assertion since it is the easiest to find.

Certainly you'd like to have who might be considered to be the smartest person to exist in the last 100 years on your side in an argument, but on a basic level it shouldn't matter. The source of these arguments (from any side) seems to be a fallacious appeal to authority. If X was very intelligent and believed Y, then Y must be true. Does this make sense?

Again, I won't say that I'm not interested in the truth of Einstein's personal beliefs (he was a fascinating individual), but I'm certainly not interested in vigorously arguing to convince others of what his beliefs were.

These arguments quickly deteriorate into quoting wars and unfocused discussion, and they don't leave any room for progress. So, the next time this discussion flairs up, politely direct the initiator to examine certain rhetorical fallacies (the fallacious argument from authority), and remember that it might be more interesting to discuss your own conclusions, rather than those of others.

To qualify as an *explanation* of a phenomenon, the statement in question must convey some sort of additional information. Otherwise, it simply becomes a restatement the phenomenon with new words.

Let's take a silly example. I take a piece of paper, write somebody else's address on it, apply a stamp, and put the paper in a special box. Some days later, the paper appears in the mailbox of the person whose address I wrote on it. What happened?

Explanation: an organization called the Post Office employs people as mail carriers. These people routinely check the special boxes for paper labeled with an address and a stamp, and they then take these papers to other people who figure out where they need to go, and pass them along to other people, and so forth in a chain until it arrives at its destination.

Not an explanation: the Post Office delivers the paper.

Why isn't this an explanation? It is, after all, true. However, it conveys no additional information. The use of the term ""the Post Office"" here presupposes that I already know what the Post Office is, and if I knew that, I'd *already* know how the paper got from the box where I dropped it off to the mailbox of the addressee. The phrase ""delivers the paper"" is just a restatement of what happened. This explanation could be rephrased as ""Blahblah did it"" and convey the same amount of information, i.e. nothing.

I propose that supernatural explanations *always* fall into this second category. Here are some examples from what I've seen in here. Note, please refrain from cries of ""that's not what I believe!"" These are all things I've seen people argue, and are intended to be examples, not some claim that every religious person thinks this way. Examples:

How did life arise?  
* Explanation: the usual stuff about evolution and abiogenesis and such.
* Example supernatural non-explanation: God created all these species. Or, God guided evolution.
* Discussion: this doesn't actually convey anything new. It just states that some entity (which we may as well call Blahblah) did what happened. It's just a longer and more convoluted way of saying ""life arose"".

What resulted in the Gospel accounts of Jesus rising from the dead?  
* Explanation: the human capacity for self-deception, psychology of apocalyptic cults, Jesus was never actually dead, just plain fictional writing, etc.
* Example supernatural non-explanation: Jesus actually rose from the dead.
* Discussion: there's a bit of new information here, namely, that what was written actually did happen. But there's no real information about just what occurred, so it's still extremely weak. Jesus rose from the dead, but what happened, exactly? Again it comes down to ""Blahblah did what happened"".

How does qualia, consciousness, intelligence, etc. happen?  
* Explanation: something about emergent behavior from the actions of individual neurons, although honestly, the first two don't have any satisfactory explanation at the moment.
* Example supernatural non-explanation: a separate thing called the ""mind"" is the seat of consciousness.
* Discussion: again, no new information. The supernatural version boils down to ""consciousness happens"". It doesn't explain, it simply restates.

It looks like theists, in the ongoing debate versus atheists, have developed a new trendy argument for their case.  This argument is basically that atheists couldn't possibly understand the theist position if we haven't read the entire works of Aquinas, Craig, or (take your pick).


This is a bit unfair, considering that, too often, atheists are asked to provide cosmology lessons and give full details on the Big Bang Theory as if we've all got PhDs. Simply because we don't fall for the claim that deities exist, we're expected to know *everything* for some reason.  The fact that nobody knows everything is often overlooked, and the intellectually honest ""I don't know"" somehow suggests to the theist that the existence of deities must be the explanation for anything we don't know (even though, historically, this has never been shown to be the case).


So if I attack something like the Kalam Cosmological argument, and point out its first flaw, which is in the very first premise, I am told I must read William Craig's books to get a better explanation.  The flaw, if you are wondering, is that there's been nothing in the entire course of human history that actually just begins to exist anyway -- everything is merely a reconfiguration of matter and energy from a previous arrangement.  So to say ""Everything that begins to exist..."" turns the entire argument into an ""IF"" statement, leaving the theists back at square one.


If I read Craig's books, though, this will somehow make sense of it.  It will explain that the first premise *doesn't actually mean what it says*.  This is something we see quite often, especially among Christian apologists, with the bible.


Despite having read 3 versions of the bible from front to back, there isn't one thing I could post about it without some theist telling me I'm taking it out of context.  This holds true even if I independently post two sides of a contradiction (If I posted them together to point out the contradiction, I'm accused of not having read the bible).  Anyway, I'm beginning to go off topic here, sorry.


An atheistic argument, that is one for the side of not accepting the claim that deities are real, is generally pretty simple.  The entire atheist view can be summed up in one or two sentences.  When an atheist says they aren't convinced due to a lack of evidence or reason to, that's what it means.  However, when someone who *loves* to repeat himself in formal debate like Craig famously presents a reworked ancient argument as ""Everything that begins to exist has a cause..."", he's got to sell you a book to tell you what he really meant.


So now, theists are trying to convince us and everyone else that the reason we don't believe in mythological creatures is because we didn't take Theology at the university.  It doesn't matter that doing so would still not present evidence, or that their arguments should just stand on their own.  It doesn't matter that I've read the quran, the bible, have a Hindu friend who shares her beliefs with me, or have even once been a theist myself.


And for those Christians who buy into Craig's ""philosophy"", why are they taking his books so seriously in regards to their faith anyway?  I was always under the impression that the bible was the inerrant and complete word of God.  Since when are we supposed to complement it with Aquinas, let alone Craig?

I'll admit I'm not smart enough to flatten this silliness on my own, but I'm fairly confident it will be flattened like all the other arguments used in the past (which theists will ever deny having ever made in the past *ahem* Pascal's Wager *ahem* anyone named Hovind).  So what will be next?


**TL,DR:**  No.  No TLDR for you.  This is smaller than a WLC book, you can read it. lol


**EDIT**:  **Concede**.  Apparently, it's of popular opinion that even after reading various religious texts, websites, watching debates and interviews with apologists, educational programs, and having discussions with theist acquaintances, I would still be completely oblivious and ignorant to any apologetics unless I took time out of my schedule to read a stack of books.  It's suggested that I'm just asking for too much from opponents when I request brief explanation in place of a link to a book.  Because of this, I'll no longer touch on the subject of advanced theological ""philosophy"" until I read some more books.  I am assuming, they will contain pretty much the same excuses and explanations I've already heard in other forms of media from the same people, but for the sake of not wasting my time, I hope to be proven wrong.

*No.* No. No no no. No no no no no no.

## **Longer answer...**

Many theists on this forum attempt to justify faith (used in the context of holding a belief without sufficient evidence) by asserting that it takes faith to believe in science. There are two things wrong with this statement I believe; the first ignoring the magnitude of faith and the second being the assertion it is required at all.

****

**The first issue:**

Faith is not a pathway to truth, as many of you have heard me say before. This can be seen empirically by the contradictory and mutually exclusive beliefs all held through faith. It call also be seen logically, for reliance upon evidence to support a belief makes a belief truth sensitive, as that belief can be shown right or wrong depending on the evidence reality presents. A belief that is not reliant upon evidence is a belief does not have to reflect reality at all.

So, knowing that faith is not a pathway to truth, any belief system which utilises it should (assuming truth is wanted) utilise it as minimally as possible. Some people believe that it takes a leap of faith to attain something more than a solipsist's perspective, but it should be obvious that the infinitesimal ""leap of faith"" required to attain a belief that reality exists objectively is non comparable to the rather large leap of faith required to believe not only in the existence of an all powerful, non physical, atemporal, intelligent agency outside of time and space, but to also believe you know what this entity wants and expects you to do and think.

****

**The second, more important issue:**

Does science take faith at all? I have never understood those that assert it does, so maybe I will miss my mark, but here, hopefully, is an explanation as to why it does not.

The two most often misunderstood points on this topic are foundational premises and mathematical axioms. Science, or more strictly, the pursuit of truth through the rigorous scientific process we have in place, declares nothing to be certain, but this is also often overlooked.

**On foundational premises**, many people do not understand what when, for example, Euclidean geometry is utilised in a theory, the theory implicitly becomes founded on the applicability and correctness of Euclidean geometry. There is no faith that Euclidean geometry is true and that it applies to the theory, that is one of the foundations, and if it is shown wrong (as it has been in many theories, such as relativity) then that theory is discarded. Having a premise to a theory is not an act of faith, it is a way to lay down the foundations for a possible explanation and build up a model which can be tested.

**On mathematical axioms**, I find it helps to ask people to imagine axioms like word definitions. They simply provide a base set of descriptions we can use to form sentences (equations, models and hypothesises) and by themselves are not correct or incorrect. Those models can be tested to see if they make sense, and if they do not, and if the mathematics from axiom to model are correct, then it necessarily follows that one of the axioms is inapplicable. Then one of the axioms is removed or changed, a new model developed and then tested again.

**On the scientific method:** Another tactic often used by theists is that we have to have faith to trust in the scientific discoveries presented to us. And once again, this shows a lack of understanding of the scientific process. Science is not just the scientific method, that is simply correct experimental procedure. Science incorporates all manor of error checking methods, including peer review and corroborating evidence. In order to be published (read credible) a report must undergo review. Data, experimental methodology and conclusion are checked by scientists in the field unknown to those who wrote the report. Similarly, those reviewing the report are not told the identity of the author(s). Conclusions are ensured to flow from the data, and the data itself is (except in the case of uncontentious / past data) attempted to be reproduced (note that depending on how easy it is to reproduce data it may be done independently after review). When data cannot be reproduced (such as cold fusion), the report loses all credibility. Other methods come into play, such as testing axillary hypothesis, secondary confirmation of evidence (for example, one can use a thermometer to measure temperature, but one can also use black body radiation, and the two results should match), etc. So when I trust results from a scientific journal, I am not placing faith in unknown individuals, for I understand the process of scientific review, and I know that it is generally reliable. As a concession, I know it is not infallible, but that is precisely why contentious results are not accepted as truth until extraordinary evidence is presented from credible (and multiple) sources (read up on general relativity and how long it took to be shown correct).

I must point out that all theories in science, all methodologies, are open to being proven wrong or ineffective. Science is the ultimate tool we have in ensuring our beliefs lie in accordance with reality. If a theory does not make predictions, if it cannot be vindicated or contradicted by reality then it is *not a scientific theory*. Because of this, and because of the rigorous review process, it most certainly does not take faith to accept scientific claims as our best descriptions of reality.

****

Apologies for the wall of text, but I hope it wasn't too dull a read, and I hope that ""you have to have faith in science"" is never uttered in these hallowed Reddit halls again.

This would be a problem if anyone actually read the FAQs. I was provoked to write this after the straw man that broke the camel's back : one fallacy too many.

In this thread, I hope to brief outline the most common fallacies and give an example of each. To save a smidgen of time, I've indented all the 'examples' instead of saying ""and an example of this is"" 15 times.

---

**Informal Fallacies**

---

So named because ""Formal Fallacies"" involve logical branches : they come out of syllogistic or modal or otherwise boring arguments. 

1. **Begging the Question**

One we're all familiar with : BtQ is when the conclusion of an argument is assumed by one of the premises. 

&gt;God must exist.

&gt;How do you know?

&gt;Because the Bible says so. 

&gt;Why should I believe the Bible?

&gt;Because the Bible was written by God. 


2.  **Burden of Proof** 

And the shifting thereof. Defined by the quotation ""I needn't prove my claim. You must prove it false.""

Here, the biggest problem is first establishing who has the burden of proof. Usually one picks the case which is the more ""unordinary"" of the two. 

&gt;God exists.

&gt;Prove it.

&gt;No one has ever been able to prove he doesn't exist. 


3. **Equivocation**


This is the event where someone inaccurately or unjustly compares two things, often by the use of a misleading term. My favourite example is

&gt;A feather is light

&gt;What is light can't be dark.

&gt;Therefore, a feather cannot be dark.

Although a nice little example, you're more likely to see it here in form of an emotional argument comparing Jesus to Hitler or Judaism to the Nazis. 

4. **Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc**

This is Latin for ""after this, therefore because of this"". Simply, the false claim that  X happened then Y happened; therefore X caused Y.

&gt;More and more young people are attending high schools and colleges today than ever before. Yet there is more juvenile delinquency and more alienation among the young. This makes it clear that these young people are being corrupted by their education.


---

**Red Herring Fallacies**

---

1. **Appeal to Emotion**

This is when a *pathos* appeal is made instead of (not and with) a proper argument. The key emotions to look out for are : fear, flattery, pity, ridicule, spite and wishful thinking.

&gt;I lost my left leg as a result of a drunk driver running me over on my 16th birthday. My girlfriend died in that accident. In reading through these comments, I am quite disturbed to see the apologetics response of ""perhaps that person needed to have that experience"". Anyone who feels that way needs to take a long hard look at themselves. Disgusting.

Yeah, prime example. I think it was also the most upvoted comment in that thread.

2. **Ad Hominem** 

This is when you attack the man, or woman, *instead of the argument*. Notice that you can attack the person and their argument without committing a fallacy. This often takes a more subtle approach here : postions are dismissed because of the holder's beliefs.

&gt; ""What do you know? You're a Scientologist."" 


3. **Straw Man**

I always thought that was one word. Anyway, it is defined as an argument based on a, intentional or not, misrepresentation of the rival's opinion.

&gt;C: We should give children ice cream after every school day.

&gt;D: That would be rather bad for their health.

&gt;C: Do you want our children to starve?

4. **Tu Quoque**

The argument says a position is invalid because the proponent fails to act in accordance with his position. It would be like dismissing a Devil's Advocate's proof because he was DAing. 

The one I get a lot is : 

&gt;""You're a nihilist. You can't believe that 'x' is immoral.""

First, yes I can. Second, he ignored the position. 

---

**Faulty Generalisations**

---

1. **No True Scotsman**

For this one, I suppose I can just give you the example that named it :

&gt;Alice: All Scotsmen enjoy haggis.

&gt;Bob: My uncle is a Scotsman, and he doesn't like haggis!

&gt;Alice: Well, *all true* Scotsmen like haggis.

2. **Cherry Picking**


Everyone knows what this is. They must. Yet we still see it all the time. I'm not even sure I need to give an example. I think it is pretty self explanatory. 



---

**Miscellaneous One**

---

1. **Black Swan Blindness**

Not one that I had heard of, but certainly one I'd see : it is when the argument ignores a low probability, but high impact, events in order to down play the role of chance and under represent risks. 

&gt;The nuclear power advocate who takes care never to mention the fact that the stations sometimes blow up and take the surrounding area with them.

I'm going through a lot right now, and I need the opinions of more than the few people who influence my life on an regular basis.  (Please bare with me as I try to put my feelings and questions into understandable words)

My husband recently admitted to me that he has decided to become an atheist.

(When we married 8 months ago we were both ""Christian"", were married in a Baptist church, and attended church every week.  While my thinking doesn't necessarily line up with baptistic doctrine, that is just where we were attending church at the time) 

Right now I'm not sure of much regarding Christianity/spirituality/religion, except that there is some kind of greater being.  I guess I am a theist, because I believe that there is a God/gods/SOMETHING.  That the world didn't come from nothing, and that our souls continue somewhere (be it heaven or hell) after we die.

Last week he just refused to go to church with me - and when I pressed he blurted out that he had become atheist.  After reading some books and other information (like posts on reddit) my husband has decided that there is no God/gods/deity and has labeled himself an atheist.  He came to this conclusion on his own, and never included me in any of his soul searching.  I find this unfair because when he married me WE were Christian, WE shared the same values, and now HE has decided (after what he claims to be months of searching) that he no longer shares those values, and in fact believes the opposite.

Now to talk about the title.  With my very limited knowledge of atheism I made the claim that I feel like my husband can't really claim to be an atheist.  

He came to me and made the claim that there is no God/gods/deity.  He has absolutely zero information/proof/ANYTHING to back up his new ""beliefs"".  He kept trying to point out things he had read on reddit, but there was still never any REAL information backing his claims.  His only ""proof"" was just his own opinion.

I think it is unfair for him to label himself as an atheist and waltz around claiming that there is no higher power when he has zero proof to back up his claims.  I told him that I think he is agnostic, because he doesn't believe that there is a higher power, but that he can't go around claiming that there is no deity because he can't prove his statements correct.

He then became angry with me and started shouting that he DOESN'T HAVE TO PROVE ANYTHING.  That he can walk around making absolute statements like ""There is NO GOD"" and does not need to have any kind of proof.  And in the same breath he told me that I CAN'T make the statement that ""There is a God/gods"" because I have no proof.  That the burden of proof lies with ME.

I don't /understand/ why I am required to prove him wrong AND myself right?  He said that this is how debate works.  I say that he isn't being fair.

Obviously a lot of people identify as atheist, but I don't understand how they can.  How can you make the statement ""I am an atheist, and I KNOW that there is NO GOD.""  When you don't even have a shred of proof to back up your assumptions.  Isn't it more correct to make the statement, ""I'm agnostic, I don't believe in a God/gods/higher power.""  Because then the individual isn't making claims incapable of being proved, just stating their own beliefs.

I want to share my thoughts on the subject and get everyone's input.

Many of you here are smart people. Many of you know what a fallacy is and if I told you an Argument from Majority was a bad argument, you'd tell me that was obvious. But what else are we accomplishing by upvoting comments we agree with or state our opinion?

It's not as simple as that, I know. Upvoting these commonly shared opinions at least gets them in the limelight, it's a quick way to get our information out there. However, there is a time and a place for that that makes it more appropriate than other times.

We have a system, we start our threads with To: X. This X could be atheist, christian or anything else. The author has in mind a question or comment to an opposing worldview and he wants to hear how they rationalize it. We need those rationalizations at the top, no matter how much we disagree with them. They best serve the purpose of the thread by exposing exactly what the author has come to debate.

If we go ahead and upvote a comment made by a poster who was NOT originally addressed by the author, who is guessing the answer, playing devil's advocate, even if they can well represent a typical answer given, we lose the ability to debate someone real who would put forth that answer themselves and we could possibly misrepresent them. We should be doing what it is within our powers to let those being addressed by the author to express their defense. That is what we want in the limelight.

I want to propose a way to look at upvoting and downvoting. If a thread is listed:

To: Christians. You upvote Christian replies to the OP. Doesn't matter how much you disagree with them, you just do it, so long as their reply is relevant to the question authored.

When someone rebuts the statements given by the christian, NOW is the time to upvote the counter-arguments you think are really good. These are the statements we want the Christian to address. Again, if a Christian replies to that rebuttal in a relevant way, we upvote it regardless of disagreements. This creates the best back and forth dialog we can achieve.

This creates an order in the debates:

Authors Question to X,
X's reply
Best rebuttal to X,
X's best rebuttal to that,
And so on so forth

And this is far better than many of the current:

Author's question to X,
Opposing worldviews opinion on the question,
Agreement,
Agreement,
X's rebutal.

Despite using christian in my previous example, it applies to anyone the author is addressing. If a theist is addressing atheists, it is up to the theists to upvote atheist replies to the top.

Human babies are pathetic in comparison. If ""knowing god"" is such an important trait, why isn't it instinctual and instead must be inefficiently taught by fallible parents?

Humans are born with the knowledge of how to breathe, how to chew and swallow, among other abilities. Yet if a baby was never told about God, they would never have any indication such an entity existed.

God thought it was important enough for a mosquito to instinctually know how to bite you, but not important enough for a baby to have instinctual knowledge of God?

1347355673.0,64,self.DebateReligion,zp9c8,"To Atheists: why the ""God is a monster"" arguments are on shaky ground",140,76,389,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/zp9c8/to_atheists_why_the_god_is_a_monster_arguments/,"I'm sure we know what I'm talking about. summed up most succinctly here by Dawkins;

"" The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.""

Here's the problem; 

- in the atheist worldview, there are no objective standards of right and wrong. Our concept of morality is merely an evolutionary construct, an illusion that gives most of us the impression that 'evil' and 'good' are 'real' standards. The standards are actually subjective; people do not universally agree on right and wrong, and moral attitudes alter throughout our history. (If any atheist would like to attempt to explain how there could be *objective* right and wrong, please do so). 

- Thus, OT God is only unpleasant as he appears to you *at this current point of our evolution/history*. Go back a couple of thousands of years, and a God as described in the OT may be suddenly 'good' by the majority of subjective human standards - because the standard has changed. And in a million years the standard could shift again, so that what we now consider 'good' about god is then viewed as 'evil', and vice versa. God could be described in the future as being a 'monster' not because he condemns homosexuality (for example), but because he didn't condemn it strongly enough; or he offered forgiveness of sins etc. 

- as such the argument *requires* objective standards to be real, to carry any weight. And if it requires objective standards, it requires an explanation for how/where those objective standards come from. And thus the atheist making this argument ties himself in a knot. 

A similar process can be used against the ""we're really badly designed"" argument, which is essentially the same; just replace 'good/evil' with 'good/bad design'. 

---

**edit:** as usual, someone else sums it up better than I could;

""My argument against God was that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust. But how had I got this idea of just and unjust? A man does not call a line crooked unless he has some idea of a straight line. What was I comparing this universe with when I called it unjust? If the whole show was bad and senseless from A to Z, so to speak, why did I, who was supposed to be part of the show, find myself in such a violent reaction against it?... Of course I could have given up my idea of justice by saying it was nothing but a private idea of my own. But if i did that, then my argument against God collapsed too--for the argument depended on saying the world was really unjust, not simply that it did not happen to please my fancies. Thus, in the very act of trying to prove that God did not exist - in other words, that the whole of reality was senseless - I found I was forced to assume that one part of reality - namely my idea of justice - was full of sense. If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never have known it was dark. Dark would be without meaning.""

1340924735.0,66,self.DebateReligion,vrlv0,To Jews and whoever else: A rebuttal and commentary on Namer98's list of Messianic Prophecies,77,11,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/vrlv0/to_jews_and_whoever_else_a_rebuttal_and/,"Hello /r/debatereligion.  We've probably all seen Namer98's list about Messianic prophecies and how they stack with Jesus.  But I have never seen anyone try to take it on.  So, today I decided to try.  Namer98, and some points of my own representing that side of the argument, is in bold.





**The whole world will worship the One God of Israel Isaiah 2:11-17**

Isaiah 2 contains no references to a person.  Isaiah 2:11-17 in particular is explicitly talking about the Day of the Lord, when all men will cast down their idols and worship only God.  This is a prophecy about judgement day, not the Messiah.

Isaiah 2's beginning message can be read as being fulfilled in Jesus, or in the process of being fulfilled via Jesus.  The opening message starts by talking about how people from many nations will worship the God of Israel on Mount Zion.  53% of the world, I believe, currently worships what they believe to be the God of Israel and almost all of these various religions (Minus the Samarithans) believe Mount Zion to be a holy place and frequently make pilgramages there.  This is largely the result of Jesus spreading the Abrahamic God throughout the nations.

**Knowledge of God will fill the world Isaiah 11:9, Jeremieah 33:31
(This means irrefutable evidence. Knowledge, not faith.)**

**Isaiah 11**: Namer98's belief that this means evidence over simple knowledge of scripture and the ways of God confuses me.  I accept that this could be a part of the original Hebrew, but the internet is coming up empty about it.

Isaiah 11:9 reads:


&gt;They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain, for the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea. 

As discussed earlier, this is referring to people revering Mount Zion, which a good 53% of the world currently does.  This was fulfilled in or through Jesus, or is currently being fulfilled through Jesus.  It also refers to people knowing about God, which again, 53% of the world know about the God of Abraham, probably only because of Jesus.

(This one is definitely referring to a Messiah figure - earlier it references a specific person, “The Shoot of Jesse.”)

**Jeremiah 33:31**:   My Bible doesn't have a Jeremiah 33:31.

Jeramiah 33 does contain several Messianic prophecies, but nothing relating to knowledge.


**The Jewish people will experience eternal joy and gladness Isaiah 51:11**

I see no reference in Isaiah 51 about the Messiah or any specific person.


**Nations will recognize the wrongs they did to Israel Isaiah 52:13-53:5**

I see no reference to a person besides the Servant of God, who is usually regarded as Israel.  I see nothing about the Messiah.

**The peoples of the world will turn to the Jews for spiritual guidance Zechariah 8:23**

I see no Messiah in Zechariah 8.

Besides, what else are we doing on Reddit?  Namer98 is my most upvoted user on Reddit.  He is very highly respected.  Likewise Rabbi's are regularly consulted by Christians and Muslims seeking a deeper understanding of scripture.

**Weapons of war will be destroyed Ezekiel 39:9**

I do not see a Messiah in Ezekiel 39.

**All of the dead will rise again Isaiah 26:19**

I do not see any Messiah figures in Isaiah 26


Now, the obnoxious part for me to comment on, the part of Namer98's list which is unreferenced.

**The Messiah will be a warrior king.**

[This article](http://www.livius.org/men-mh/messiah/messiah_07.html) talks about it some.  All of the references are from tradition, not from scripture.  I do not see an explicitly warlike Messiah in scripture, or in the Oral Law, only in the Midrash and Targum, which everyone agrees is not the height of Authority.

**He will also be preceded by Elijah.**

This comes from Malachi 4:5:

&gt;See, I will send the prophet Elijah to you before that great and dreadful day of the Lord comes. 

I do not see Messiah in Malachi 4.


**He will be a human, born of a young woman,**

Jesus was human.  Jesus was born of a young woman.  This isn't an issue.  The issue is the mistranslation of the verses found in Matthew that use “virgin” instead of “Young women” and that is a different discussion entirely.
 


**Problematic verses from Namer98's list:**

**All Israelites will be returned to their homeland Isaiah 11:12**

This is definitely referring to a Messiah figure, and I really can't make any case for Jesus doing this.

**Also, Ezekiel 40-42 lists exact specifications for a third temple as a building, not a person.**

I can't really speak on this.  I know that Ezekiel talks after these verses about a figure Ezekiel called “the Prince,” but I have heard speculations as to whether this is meant to be Messiah or not, and I'm not sure whether this is meant to be connected with the “Third Temple” verses.  I believe Rashi said he is the High Priest of the Third Temple, so I am tentatively declaring these verses non-messianic in nature.

**Another verse I previously discussed, Jeremiah 33, also has a prophecy about the Messiah which cannot be identified with Jesus.  They are talking about the Eternal Throne of David.**

Trying to be transparent with you people.

Anyway, **TL;DR: Many of the verses from Namer98's list do not appear Messianic in nature and do not necessarily exclude Jesus.**

While it is important to raise awareness among people who may have incorrect assumptions about the beliefs of a particular group, if you say nothing else, then you have not really answered the question.

It is not some random thing we all decided to recently make up and force on everyone like many of the apologists like to claim.

As most of us on here seem to understand, under the normal (and long-established) definitions of atheism, atheists are the group made up of **1)**  those who withhold belief as to whether a god exists (making no claim that he does or doesn't), as well as **2)** those who believe there is no god.  This is the entire group of people who do not affirm ""a god exists"" as true.  As I already mentioned, there are some people who are dead-set that only the 2nd definition is ""really"" atheism, so, for the proof that they are completely wrong about this being some sort of revision:

I've got a huge collection of documents in which I've collected citations for this fact, so I'll just show you a few excerpts of what I've found over the past few years.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, for the dictionaries.  To lay some groundwork, let's look at the meaning of the term *disbelieve*:

* [Dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/disbelieve): to have no belief in; refuse or reject belief in

* [Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/disbelieve): : 1. to hold not worthy of belief : not believe, 2. to withhold or reject belief 

* [Wiktionary](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/disbelief): Unpreparedness, unwillingness, or inability to believe that something is the case. 

* [American Heritage Dictionary](http://www.answers.com/topic/disbelief): Refusal or reluctance to believe.

Okay, so now that that's established, let's look at *atheism* (we already know that one subsection of atheists claims there are no gods, and no one disagrees with that, so I'm only going to quote the definitions relevant to the definition that people like to claim is somehow fake or made up by reddit atheists):

* [Dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/atheism): disbelief in the existence of a supreme being or beings

* [Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/atheism?show=0&amp;t=1325653972):  a disbelief in the existence of deity

* [Wiktionary](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/atheism) : Rejection of belief that any deities exist (with or without a belief that no deities exist)

* [American Heritage Dictionary](http://www.answers.com/topic/atheism) : Disbelief in or denial of the existence of God or gods

In case anyone wants to try to claim that these dictionaries are all in on the atheist conspiracy to redefine the word, I also have a list of the definitions from editions published in the 1800's as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, for some reference books:

**New Dictionary of Religions**:  ""Atheism: Disbelief in the existence of any Gods or of God. This may take the form of: (a) dogmatic rejection of specific beliefs, e.g. of theism; (b) scepticism about all religious claims; or (c) agnosticism, the view that humans can never be certain in matters of so-called religious knowledge (e.g. whether God exists or not). An atheist may hold belief in God to be false, irrational, or meaningless.""

**Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy**: ""Another meaning of ""atheism"" is simply nonbelief in the existence of God, rather than positive belief in the nonexistence of God. ...an atheist in the broader sense of the term""

**The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy**:  ""Either the lack of belief that there exists a god, or the belief that there exists none.

**Encyclopedia of American Religious History**:
""Atheism, literally the absence of belief in God, has always been a minority viewpoint in American culture.""

**Encyclopedia of Unbelief**:  ""If theism is the belief in the existence of God, then a-theism ought to mean ""not theism"" or ""without theism."" Actually, there is no notion of ""denial"" in the origin of the word, and the atheist who denies the existence of God is by far the rarest type of atheist — if he exists at all. Rather, the word atheism means to an atheist ""lack of belief in the existence of a God or gods."" An atheist is one who does not have a belief in God, or who is without a belief in God.""

**The Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences**:  In its narrowest sense the term atheist applies to one who categorically denies the existence of any gods. But in its wider sense it properly applies also to skeptics, materialists, positivists and **all other who do not accept the claims of theism**

**The Encyclopedia of Philosophy**: ""On our definition, an 'atheist' is a person who rejects belief in God, regardless of whether or not his reason for the rejection is the claim that 'God exists' expresses a false proposition. People frequently adopt an attitude of rejection toward a position for reasons other than that it is a false proposition.""

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I might as well include some of the historical atheists too.

**Charles Bradlaugh** - *The Freethinker's Text Book* (1876): ""Atheism is without God. It does not assert no God. The atheist does not say that there is no God""

**Annie Besant** - *The Gospel of Atheism* (1877): ""The position of the atheist is a clear and reasonable one. I know nothing about God and therefore I do not believe in Him or it. What you tell me about your God is self-contradictory and is therefore incredible. I do not deny 'God,'""

**G.W. Foote** - *What Is Agnosticism?* (1902): ""Refer me to one Atheist who denies the existence of God.... Etymologically, as well as philosophically, an A-Theist is one without God. That is all the ""A"" before ""Theist"" really means.""

....among others.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have a large collection of quotes from early atheists in the 1700's and 1800's further corroborating that this is what they meant, but I figured why not skip those and move on to people the apologists might respect more:  theologians.

**Richard Watson** - *A Biblical and Theological Dictionary* (1831): ""Atheist, in the strict and proper sense of the word, is one who does not believe in the existence of a god""

**Robert Flint** - *Anti-Theistic Theories* (1885): ""The atheist is not necessarily a man who says there is no God. What is called positive or dogmatic atheism, so far from being the only kind of atheism, is the rarest of all kinds. ...every man is an atheist who does not believe that there is a God, although his want of belief may not be rested on any allegation of positive knowledge that there is no God, but simply on one of want of knowledge that there is a God.""

His other book *Agnosticism* (1903): ""The word atheist is a thoroughly honest, unambiguous term. It means one who does not believe in God, and it means neither more nor less.""

**Thomas Chalmers** - *Natural Theology*: ""Judging from the tendency and effect of his arguments, an atheist does not appear positively to refuse that a God may be. ...His verdict on the doctrine of God is only that it is not proven. It is not that it is disproven.""

The idea in Judaism is that you DONT have original sin; that God did not create some complex system involving a complicated plan just to glorify himself in the end. Afterlife beliefs are disputed, however, unlike christianity, you aren't damned to eternal torture for believing the wrong idea. You will be tried on your intentions and what is truly in your heart if there is even an afterlife at all(like i said, SOME Jews dont believe in a conscious afterlife or any at all).

Judaism believe in no Devil, there is one called HaSatan who is a district attorney of sorts for God. Yahweh metaphorically can order him to go out and tempt people and report back with results, HaSatan is part of his divine council. Their God did not create angels with free will, he would not bother to let some anti-god exist and disrupt his plans since he is omnipotent. 

(Note: I am not a jew, but have lived with many for so long that I can relate so deeply to them. I am jewish on my Paternal side so technically I cannot inherit it.)

SO how can Christians explain the huge gap in beliefs between ""Im a depraved monster full of sin who needs salvation or I will go to hell"" and ""You do not have original sin, and there is no eternal hell, maybe a temporary punishment after death if there is a Heaven""",,False,,t5_2snuc,1344606117.0,,,True,t3_xxe5h,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/xxe5h/to_christiansdo_you_realize_judaism_is_not/,

1337625277.0,64,self.DebateReligion,txv74,"To All: Criticism of religion is not only justified, but imperative",82,18,122,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/txv74/to_all_criticism_of_religion_is_not_only/,"Many atheists will find this statement at the very least understandable, if not entirely uncontroversial.  Some may choose not to speak out, and have reasons for doing so, and they would fall into one the categories I will lay out below, but overall I suspect that those who don't follow any religion find it more acceptable to be critical of religion.

However, I addressed this To All for a reason.  Even for the religious, criticism of religions *other than your own* is a more justifiable position to take than tolerance.  Most people today *want* to be tolerant; the religions of the world have (with the exception of Islam, and even then most Muslims may still wish to be more tolerant than the ""official"" position requires) renounced doctrines stating that infidels and especially apostates deserve death.  It's still there in the holy books: Quran 4:89, Deuteronomy 18:20, Acts 3:23.  But most people don't really *believe* that everyone not of their religion deserves severe punishment.

The thing is, the rationale for this tolerance falls into three main groups:

* The Machiavellian: It wouldn't be politic to proclaim my religious superiority, so I will make soothing noises and let people think what they want, hoping that my faith will slowly and quietly triumph as the centuries pass.

* The Eisenhowerian/Romneyan: ""Our government makes no sense unless it is founded on a deeply held religious belief - and I don't care what it is"" or ""Freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom.""  Basically, it doesn't matter which religion you swear allegiance to, as long as you have *some* religion.

* Benign Neglect: Religion doesn't really help us, and it's a historical legacy that we don't need any more.  But lots of people like it, and it's a long-standing tradition, so we can't just ask that people *discard* it.  We can afford to simply wait for it to slowly die out, sometime in the distant future.

There is one further category, a rather sad one: those who do not criticize religion, *particularly* their own, for fear of their own safety.  They suspect that not only are the religions of others false, but their own is as well; however, they dare not speak their minds, because to do so would cost them something important.  Sometimes it's family or friends, or a place in a community, or a job; sometimes, as in Mecca or Cairo, it is one's very physical safety or even one's life.

But this means that the tolerant are brought into, against their will, a conspiracy of silence that has swept the world.  Either they secretly believe that most of the world's population is wasting their life believing in a delusion (remember, no one religion has a majority), but are either too tenderhearted or too devious to say so, or they believe that even their own religion is a delusion, but *fear* to say so.  There are, perhaps, a few who do not fall into these groups: those moderate, tolerant believers who follow and support their particular tradition because it is *their* tradition, and *somebody* should stand up for it even if we don't know which religion is actually right.  But even they have reduced their religion to the equivalent of a sports team, not believed because it's the best, but the best because it's believed.

If we care about honesty, if we are interested in the truth, if we are to genuinely be supporters of the positions we hold, refusal to criticize religions in which we do not believe is unjustified.  Our social norms are appalled when, say, Mel Gibson professes his Catholic faith by noting that his wife, who is a far better person than he is and doesn't deserve hell, will nonetheless suffer eternally because she's Episcopalian and the ""pronouncement from the chair"" is that Episcopalians are going to hell.  It certainly, in my view, makes him an insufferable jerk, but he's *honestly professing* his faith.  The religious, and even some atheists, cringe at Hitchens characterizing the Catholic Church's policy as ""no child's behind left,"" or Dawkins describing the Old Testament god thus:

&gt;The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.

But they are *being honest*, expressing their opinion that religion is not something to be accepted and tolerated, but outdated and morally bankrupt superstition that should be subject to the same criticisms as any other idea.  I see no reason why people should be silent when they think that most of the world believes in a delusion.

My personal reaction to the story the first time around was actually boredom. Kind of an ""oh, that situation must suck for her"", but not much more thought into it.

Today I was shocked to hear the [""overwhelmingly negative"" listener reactions](http://www.npr.org/2012/05/01/151795104/letters-a-minister-who-lost-her-faith). These are people who actually bothered to write into NPR and tell them how offended they were that there was a story about an atheist and how horribly this person handled their situation.

I went and dug up the original story and reread it. I am at a loss as to what she could have done differently or why it was offensive.

- Is it offensive because she should not have told anyone she was an atheist and continued her job to receive a paycheck and/or keep the peace in the community?
- Is it offensive that she didn't come clean sooner? (I don't know her situation, but what if she couldn't afford to lose the job?)
- Is it offensive because she was a minister and therefore supposed to be above doubts. If a minister can lose her faith, couldn't anyone?

It got me thinking... does the very existence of an atheist threaten faith? Is that the heart of this issue, and the fact that she is a minister is just salt in the wound? Are people afraid of doubting themselves, and is that why more people don't react with love and acceptance, as her christian husband did? What does reddit think?

**EDIT: SUMMARY**

My conclusions from this post are that atheists overwhelmingly think atheism alone is the reason people are offended, whereas christians think the reasons people are offended are because the woman in the story was in the wrong in how she handled her situation and/or that NPR is biased and there should have been a christian weighing in on the story as well.

Note: as I read it, of the 4 complaints, one purely complained about bias, one purely complained about the article being about atheism (or defended christianity against a perceived attack), and the remaining two had elements of both.

It seems most people agree that the news was a bad way for the congregation to find out, though we seem to be split on atheist/christian lines between whether the situation is cut and dry (that she was purely in the wrong, no sympathy is required for her) or more complicated (that it would be hard to know what to do in her shoes, some compassion is required for her).",,False,,t5_2snuc,True,,,True,t3_t2rtj,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/t2rtj/to_all_why_was_this_npr_story_offensive/,

The Kansas House on Wednesday [advanced legislation](http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2012/mar/28/house-gives-preliminary-ok-bill-supporters-say-pre/) that would allow a religious defense to discriminate against gays.

&gt;State Rep. Lance Kinzer, R-Olathe, defended his bill, saying it was meant to make sure government could not infringe on an individual’s religious beliefs.

&gt;“Free exercise of religion is at the core of who we are as a people,” Kinzer said.

&gt;Davis asked Kinzer if under Kinzer’s bill an apartment owner could cite his religious beliefs to fight a complaint if he refused to rent to a same-sex couple.

&gt;“That is generally correct,” Kinzer said.

This is wrong, full stop.  It is in no way religious discrimination to not give people the right to discriminate against other groups; no one has the right to act in a discriminatory manner, and I'm not sure why any moral person would *want* that right.

The bill was approved 89-27.  This is not a small margin.  This means that the majority of voters in Kansas elected representatives who support a religious exemption to anti-discrimination ordinances.  Most people in Kansas are in favor of representatives that are willing to argue for *carte blanche* to mistreat others.  This does not support the claim that ""moderate"", ""liberal"" believers are the majority; it appears, rather, that at least in Kansas, extremists are the majority.  And I'm not aware that there's anything special about Kansas.

There is no valid justification for this bill.  No one would even suggest it, if it were not for the fervent belief that god cares what people do with their naughty bits.  This is a religiously-motivated bill, and it is explicitly in support of religiously-motivated discrimination against a minority group.  You may say ""that's not what I believe"", but that is not a defense; significant numbers of people *do* believe it, and they believe it for *the same reasons* that you hold your beliefs.

Either yes or no, God no longer is omnipotent (or so runs the argument). The supporters of this argument incorrectly define omnipotence as ""the ability to do anything, be it possible or impossible"".

This is just flagrant word-abuse. Omnipotence means the ability to do all that is logically **possible**. For example, God cannot make a square have 3 sides. 

If you don't trust me, here's a quote from Aquinas on the matter:

&gt; Nothing which implies contradiction falls under the omnipotence of God.

and C.S. Lewis:

&gt; His Omnipotence means power to do all that is intrinsically possible, not to do the intrinsically impossible. You may attribute miracles to him, but not nonsense. This is no limit to his power. If you choose to say 'God can give a creature free will and at the same time withhold free will from it,' you have not succeeded in saying anything about God: meaningless combinations of words do not suddenly acquire meaning simply because we prefix to them the two other words 'God can.'... It is no more possible for God than for the weakest of his creatures to carry out both of two mutually exclusive alternatives; not because his power meets an obstacle, but because nonsense remains nonsense even when we talk it about God.

I hope this effectively stops the use of the omnipotence paradox on this subreddit.

Through them I gradually began to realize just how ubiquitous cognitive biases are in the attitudes that people hold, and how skepticism is the best known tool for reducing those biases.

But it is not sufficient to merely learn about [cognitive biases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) in the abstract. What's needed is a storehouse of examples to draw upon--ESP, homeopathy, Loch Ness, alien visitations, cargo cults (John Frum), mass hysteria, channeling, astrology--which, taken together, form a foundational justification for being skeptical. The sheer numbers of people who are attracted to these things tells us something very important about human psychology.

Learning about those examples and the pitfalls they entail is what finally motivated me to use the tools of skepticism on my own beliefs. Without that knowledge, I don't think I would have bothered investigating because I had no *reason* to be skeptical.

Embracing skepticism does not mean becoming an ideological naysayer. As Sagan explains, the goal is ""the marriage of skepticism and wonder"", that is, ""an openness to new ideas, no matter how bizarre or counterintuitive, and the most ruthlessly skeptical scrutiny of all ideas, old and new.""

But it got me thinking. 
To me, Paganism sounds more viable than Christianity, if you think about it. Let's take one form of Paganism, Sun Worship, and strip both religions down to their bare forms. 
1.) Sun Worship, worshipping the sun as if it is a divine deity. 
2.) Christianity: Worshipping an unknown being who has never been seen as a deity

For Sun Worship to be true, the Sun just needs to be divine. We already know the sun exists, the only assumption needed is that it is a divine power. 

For Christianity to work, we need to;
1.) Assume that there is a higher being, who can see and watch everything we do
2.) Further assume that said higher being possesses divine powers, controls our lives and is the creator of everything. 

I just thought that it seems very strange, when you strip both down to what they truly are, Sun Worshipping is worshipping that big glowing ball of fire in the sky, Christianity is worshipping a mystical old man with a beard who lives in the clouds and has never be seen.

Gapminder stats. x-post r/atheismplus,68,9,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1cb7hz/if_you_want_to_debate_equality_in_religion_here/,"Gapminder is a great place that draws population data from numerous world databases and makes it searchable and graphable.

I thought it might be worth injecting some evidence back into the current debate about Islam/Islamophobia etc. I have made no judgements here, the evidence is provided for your perusal.

[Hans Rosling](http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html) is the brain and face of Gapminder, and gives awesome talks. He has a half dozen at TED.

But for us it means we have a ton of data at our fingertips.

For example, [here is a graph](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=t1YAVXUoD3iJKy2mSq2Padw;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=tyeSLo9Zpmw_e05IR3EoReg;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=lin;dataMin=0;dataMax=93$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=0;dataMax=23$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) of the **murder rate of women**, with colour coding of countries by religion. 

In the setting of the recent discussions about Islam, the things to notice are twofold. 

The top about ten countries are Christian (even the 2 white bubbles as per Wikipedia). The highest Islamic country is at number 15 if I counted right. The entire top 30 contains about 5 Muslim majority countries.

The other thing to notice is that there is a strong trend between murder of women and poverty. A few outliers to be sure, but the trend is real.

The same relationship between religion and **general murder rate** holds [in general](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=tBrbR3BlR_12WlTIlSTpu6g;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=tZgPgT_sx3VdAuyDxEzenYA;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=lin;dataMin=0;dataMax=98$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=0;dataMax=131$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) although the poverty correlation is weak.

Of course, there is other data that is relevant. **Female literacy** [lags in the impoverished Muslim majority countries](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=0AkBd6lyS3EmpdE8xR0dUWDI4ME02SjQ5bi1NYnFHN0E;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=24;dataMax=115$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) slightly more than Christian or ""Eastern Religion"" majority countries.

I remember some talk recently of Islam in some areas being against **vaccination** (well, because the US used a fake vaccination program to find out where Osama bin Laden lived in Pakistan). But is it true that Muslim majority countries vaccinate less? [Nope](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=txVTyScWObTBNuMmkNtLh1w;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=0;dataMax=99$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=).

Female foeticide is a big problem in highly patriarchal societies, perhaps **gender ratios of children** it could be a decent indicator of gender conflict? The [data suggests](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=tfWSVJPJHn3u7e_7MUaCbnw;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=88;dataMax=121$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) that in the impoverished world Muslim majority countries are indeed having more male babies delivered, but (and this surprised the hell out of me) are no more unbalanced than *rich* Christian nations.

Of course, India and China are in a far worse position, which is a known and urgent problem. 

Also surprisingly, **age at first marriage for women** is [pretty even](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=t4eF8H_jq_xyKCUHAX6VT1g;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=13;dataMax=34$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) across religions. A few more Muslim majority nations right down the bottom end, but there is almost no difference.

**Whether women work** [does show a significant difference](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=rOXvRa2ZC2oXqBn7gz62IMg;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=7.8;dataMax=86$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=), the lowest rates are almost exclusively in Muslim majority countries.

This was after we'd discussed Luke 9:27, Mark 9:1, and Matthew 16:28, which all have Jesus declaring that ""some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.""

These passages, my two Evangelical acquaintances defended by saying they pertained to the resurrection, which the disciples are said to have borne witness to in Acts 2. For me, this raises the serious question of ""How can the kingdom of Christ still need to come if it was already dispensed through belief in Christ back at the moment of resurrection?"" But I didn't think to ask it then.

Instead I brought up [Matthew 24:3-35](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+24%3A3-35%2CLuke+19%3A41-44&amp;version=NIV), wherein Jesus outlines a series of cataclysmic worldly events signalling the end-times, which he firmly states will happen before that generation passes away (24:34). And then these folks just stopped the conversation.

Now, I've seen this passage defended once as an indication that members of that generation are still among us, as spirits, but this really beggars belief when you look at lines 33-35, where Christ stresses the veracity of his words; to believe in a spirit generation still lingering on earth, you have to believe that Christ was being an intentional trickster with words he wholeheartedly endorsed.

I understand that acknowledging that Christ (or at least, the anonymous writer of Matthew) was wrong in his prophesying would completely undermine his divinity for some--but if he was wrong about something as vital as the time frame of his general return, wouldn't that be a pretty good reason to question his divinity?

At the very least, how on earth does a Christian sustain belief in a present-day Second Coming of Christ when it was so clearly supposed to happen in the first century A.D.?

And even if we accept the Jesus answer and move on, Jesus clearly told us to give away all of our possessions. Christians reinterpret that to fit their worldview.  Jesus also spoke negatively about divorce and remarriage, but Christians only seem to protest gay marriage, not second marriages.  
I hear Christians omit entire passages and books of the bible, ignore others, and strive to acquire possessions despite being told directly by Jesus not to.

Matthew 21:18-22

""18 Early in the morning, as Jesus was on his way back to the city, he was hungry. 19 Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, “May you never bear fruit again!” Immediately the tree withered.

20 When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?” they asked.

21 Jesus replied, “Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and it will be done. 22 **If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.**”

To me, this one doesn't seem like a contextual explaining or a metaphor. In that sentence Jesus explicitly states that having belief is all you need and you WILL receive WHATEVER you ask for in prayer.

You could potentially save millions of souls.",76,23,379,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/l9n09/to_christians_a_test_to_prove_that_not_only_is/,"The bible says many times that prayers will always be answered.

&gt;Matt 7:7 - *Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you*

&gt;Matt 21:22 - *And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.*

&gt;John 14:13,14 - *And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.  If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.*


Now, of course, there's a problem with me doing the test myself, as I don't have faith, even according to the bible:


&gt;John 9:31 - *Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.*


However, there are many people with at least a little faith, and those here with a very strong faith would be at an unnecessary advantage, because all you need is the amount of faith of a ""mustard seed.""


&gt;Matt 17:20 - *And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.*


Now, given the obligation of many Christians to spread the word of God, one would think that you're also obligated to show an unbeliever like me the way.


So, my proposition is for any Christian here to move Mt Rainier.  Ever since I used to visit my grandparents in Washington, I've love Mt Rainier.  It's simply beautiful.  I'd really like if it was with me here in Ohio, but since we only need to perform a test, I will be satisfied with moving the mountain, say, 50 feet in any direction (except up, because I'd hate for people to be killed when it came back down).


I know that despite Jesus making very clear that prayers will be answered, that he doesn't just answer the whim and demand of everyone.  You need a good selfless reason for praying for it to be answered, correct?  How about saving souls from eternal torment in hell?  Wouldn't that be sufficient reason?


&gt;Matt 28:19 - *Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:*


The reason why this should work is because you wouldn't be doing this to prove it to yourself or any selfish reason, but to potentially save the souls of millions of atheists around the world, not to mention theists of other religions.  Praying to move a mountain and actually have it happen would save so many souls from eternal torment, especially those who depend on logic.  It would be considered by most to be conclusive evidence that prayer does work and God does exist, and that the one you worship is the only one and the right one.


I hope you understand that I can only consider anyone who takes this post as mockery as lacking faith.  Additionally, anyone who says ""this is impossible"", obviously doesn't trust their word of God and would not be ideal to carry out this experiment.  However, being that there are many Christians in the world, many of whom are exceedingly devout, I imagine that there would be many people available to pray simultaneously.  This should greatly increase the effectiveness of the prayer.


I am dead serious here, but suppose I *am* being a smart aleck.  Suppose I *am* guilty of mocking.  Wouldn't it be worth simply doing a prayer to save millions of souls from hell, even if I don't take it as proof?  I can only see your participation as a selfless act of kindness, even if you assume I'm trying to be offensive.


So, simply put, the test is to pray to move Mt Rainier, or any mountain of your choice, using the power of prayer alone.  My hypothesis is still that God does not exist, so anyone with at least a mustard seed of faith, please help me carry out this test.


**Edit:**  While I do appreciate the funny, I would like to see some Christian responses to this and actually see if I will get some participation.  If any of these funnies are coming from Christians, however, then I am thoroughly disappointed at how flippant they are about the eternal condemnation and damnation of so many people on earth.

**Update:**  So far, not one Christian has offered to help save souls and take me up on this challenge.  The common response seems to be that they are not supposed to test God.  Please read the OP and understand that you *will not be* testing God, you will be saving souls.  I, on the other hand, would be testing for the *existence* of God.  My search for that noble Christian who isn't here to give excuses continues.  

Try this:  *""I have faith in you, Lord, and I have compassion for the souls you could lose to damnation.

(2)	According to Christian doctrine, every human being is born already guilty for the actions of two people who lived thousands of years ago, and the way to absolve yourself of guilt is to place it on another god/person, who lived centuries ago. Any just moral system should be based on individual responsibility, in which each person is responsible for, and only for, the good or evil they do.

(3)	Christian doctrine is focused on what happens after we die, rather than this, the only life that anyone knows for certain we have.

(4)	To the extent that Christian morality is based on the Bible, it preserves a primitive moral system of arbitrary taboos, in which what matters is what a person eats and what kind of sex they have, rather than on equality and compassion.

As a Christian, the atheist perspective is easy to imitate. As atheism is technically the non-belief in something, I don't have to do anything to become an atheist. I already know/accept there is no observable evidence for God. I know there is no physical evidence that Jesus was the son of God. So what do I have to do to become an atheist? 

stop going to church? stop believing in god? how does one do that? do I have to verbalise something or can I just 'give it up'? Can I become an atheist right now, like this instant? how does that happen?

See, the issue comes up with non-theists ask, ""why doesn't God just show himself to everyone and let them make the choice on the matter?"" And the Christian reply pretends like God didn't do that a million times over in the Bible. 

I've read the Bible cover to cover and I have to say, there was NEVER any question of God's existence. Faith as now defined by Christians would have been laughed at by virtually every single character in the Bible. You could probably keep them laughing by then telling them that God showing himself must certainly have violated their free will. They'd be quite confused by the notion, I'd think.

From the beginning you had characters talking to God. Regardless of where you think the literal part of Biblical history began (be it Adam and Eve, or Abraham, or Moses, or King David), they all had no doubt in his existence. Here's my key observation: it was always about allegiance, loyalty and worship of God. Again, not his existence. The whole issue with God's ever-tumultuous relationship with the Jewish nation was that while they knew he existed (I mean, cmon, you had the ENTIRE nation hear the voice of God booming through the clouds) for a fact, they still had to choose to be loyal to him. And what happened? Yep, there were times they weren't loyal to him, times they went for other gods and mingled with foreign nations in violation of God's command. But if you ask a Christian today, it seems like somehow knowing about God's existence for certain violates your ability to make a decision on the matter. But I see nothing about that in the Bible. 

In Revelation it talks of a last test involving Satan being let out and causing a final test of allegiance (whether literal or metaphorical, when taken into context with the whole Bible, the theme of allegiance still remains). From the beginning then you had everyone from Adam and Eve conversing with God, Abraham talking to God and even bargaining with him, you had Moses receiving visions and having powers, heck the other nations acknowledged Yahweh and even Pharoah and his army didn't deny him - they just thought their gods were better. And all through this you had people who talked to God that were still subject to failure like King David. You had Jesus performing great miracles (and the evil Pharisees denouncing Jesus even though they saw these miracles first hand, again that allegiance issue comes up again), you had his disciples resurrecting people and healing them, and even Thomas while doubting was given a demonstration. Jesus was seen ascending to the heavens. As my title mentions, *even the demons believed in God* (James 2:19) yet they still exercised their choice to align themselves with Satan.

Yet, now I hear a brand spankin' new definition of faith by Christians. Faith that God even exists in the first place! After all this, I don't think I am rude in saying that idea is absurd. Is there are reason for this beyond God's new found apparent absence? Or is there a good argument as to why knowing God exists for certain now suddenly breaks free will but didn't for those millions of Jews on Mt. Sinai?

If Heaven truly awaits us in the afterlife those of us that are devout believers or lived an upright life should be ecstatic when moment arrives. Its like an eternal trip to a never ending thrills Disney World. When we loose  family members or friends that lived righteously we aren't happy for them.

**EDIT**
I think excited was a poor choice for wording...
In my question I dont mean why dont Christians kill themselves or act recklessly to bring about death more quickly. I understand the viewpoint that life is a gift. To act out recklessly or dangerously is taking that gift for granted. What  Im trying to get around to is that in the full of Life it seems the thought of going to heaven and meeting God is meet with exuberance but when the actual moment is approaching or upon us it is meet with hesitation. It just struck me as a little odd. It seems to me that people hold tight to Life no matter what their faith is. For the most part IF they didnt have to die and could change things, they would. If their family members could resurrect them, they almost certainly would.

""Everyone"" wants to go Heaven, which is a good thing, most if not their entire life is spent working towards that end and we all realize we have to die. But death is so often meet with such sorrow, pain or dread. IF you believe in an afterlife then death is merely a transition. That a few years weighed against eternity is very nearly nothing. If eternal bliss and happiness awaits us then death should be meet with at the very least a smile, but Ive seen very few people accept the thought or news of death with a smile.

To paraphrase, Elijah challenges the people of Israel to an experiment to test the existence of Jehovah vs. Baal. The prophets of Baal call upon him to burn their sacrifice. Elijah mocks them because Baal does not respond, sounding a great deal like a snarky atheist.

Then Elijah ""doubles-down"" and has water poured all over his sacrifice and calls to the Lord, asking him to prove that he is the one true God. God obliges, sending fire to consume the sacrifice, the altar, even the stones and water.

The Israelites see this obvious supernatural event and realize that, indeed, the Lord must be the one true God, shouting ""The LORD is God! The LORD is God!""

And then the prophets of Baal get slaughtered.

In that spirit, I'd like to challenge the resident theists as follows:

1. Pick any trait you believe God possesses which can be logically argued for.
2. Describe that trait in plain, unambiguous English, abstaining entirely from defining any words in ways that are uncommon in the language. This means that if the argument doesn't work without a specific, uncommon word definition, you must **unpack that definition and explain it explicitly**, rather than relying on the atheists knowing what you mean.
3. If someone takes issue with one of the words you've used, you must replace that word with an explanation thereof.

I fully expect replies to this post to be verbose. Similarly, the challenge to atheists will result in equal verbosity:

1. Use plain and unambiguous English to discuss the concepts the theists present, **not** the word you think the theist might be describing. For example, you won't be discussing ""omnipotence,"" because theists won't be presenting ""omnipotence"" to you. They will be presenting detailed descriptions of traits. Respond to **those descriptions**, not to the word you think they're describing.
2. If the theist has accidentally provided an ambiguous or ill-defined word or phrase, respond by pointing that word or phrase out and having them unpack it. **Don't** start arguing for or against the trait they've described until you are both comfortable that ambiguity has been sufficiently stamped out.

For the purposes of this challenge, I would like to ban the following words:

* God (yes, I don't want to see it as either a noun or a proper noun anywhere in the comments below)
* Omnipotence
* Omniscience
* Omnibenevolence
* Omnipresence
* Free will

I am open to suggestions for additional entries to the list.

**Edit**: A lot of interesting discussion below, but I think some people are missing the point. I'm not looking for definitions so much as full explanations of concepts. For instance, if I were a theist attempting to describe free will without using the term, I might say something like:

&gt; I believe we live in a universe where we are active agents capable of making choices that are not pre-determined by our brain states and the laws of physics.

Or maybe I wouldn't, because that frankly looks like a completely indefensible position, and I'd get pilloried for it. But you see what I'm getting at; rather than saying ""I believe we have free will"" and arguing for it based off a definition I have in mind, I have stated **that definition** as my position, without naming it ""free will.""

If it helps, imagine that every word people might disagree on the definition of becomes ""blignarb"" when you comment, so you have to completely avoid using those words and instead unpack the concepts that those words mean to you.

""Faith is belief without sufficient evidence"".  Given that definition, a theist either must contend that they either:

**A)** Do not have faith

**B)** Do not have sufficient evidence

A) would obviously grind on most theist's skin as having faith is said to be a virtue.  B) is pretty much conceding the debate.

It's not just atheists of course, but other clear examples exist in theism, such as defining omniscience as ""maximally knowledgeable"" or omnipotence as ""maximally powerful"".  This is too convenient because it basically establishes an eternal moving goal post of being impervious to attack.  If anyone comes up with a meaningful objection to either trait, the convenient definition just turns into ""Well, God has all powers except for your meaningful objection"" or ""God knows all propositions except for the ones you object to""

Only 2 of the 10 commandments are laws (murder and theft) so why should gay marriage be illegal? Should saying ""oh my god"" and disrespecting your parents be illegal as well?

Another question I have about this is that if only god can judge, and Jesus died to redeem everyone of all sins, then why does it matter here on Earth what type of behavior they partake in?

Egotistical people (most of us or all of us) tend to overreact when they feel disrespected or wronged and experience the urge or desire to ""pay back"" the perceived transgressor with a retribution even greater than the perceived disrespect or injustice. The ultimate example of this, in human terms, is the individual who ""goes postal"" and  kills everyone in sight. Such a person has gone ""the full Yahweh"" (as in ""the full Monty"") fully expressing the wrath of an angry, vengeful god.

Yahweh overreacted in Eden by punishing Adam and Eve for slighting him by rejecting His advice. The ""sin"" of Adam and Eve cannot exactly be said to be disobedience as Adam and Eve had no concept of right and wrong. As such, Yahweh's reaction to Adam and Eve's disregard of His advice can be said to be nothing more than the overreaction of an egotist who was butt hurt over not being treated like He was God.

Sure, He is (allegedly) God. But why is this alleged God so incredibly petty and vindictive?

It's ironic. This God who is love is the original hypocrite. The first practitioner of ""do as I say and not as I do"". He expects us to endlessly forgive those who transgress against us without placing any condition upon the transgressors. Meanwhile, this God who is love is planning the most horrific eternal fate imaginable (unimaginable, actually) for billions of people whose only crime has been to be a descendant of Adam. And all out of spite.

I don't see how an omniscient, omnipotent deity could create a universe that would cause Him to get so butt hurt.

All we can do is anthropomorphize God. It's our only context for deciphering the motives of other beings who are said to be ""in our image"". We know that we humans do not like to get angry. But we also know that egotists like to/cannot help but to feel superior to their fellow human beings. So God does not like to get angry. But God *does* like to feel superior to his creations some of whom, in there ability to be altruistic and forgiving, morally surpass the Christian god of wrath.

I understand that the Christian response to this will be that we do not understand God's justice. Indeed. Who can understand the ""justice"" of willing that billions of people sin (Romans 5) when supposedly sin is the one thing God cannot tolerate? Who can understand the justice of a being who supposedly cannot tolerate the presence of sin, yet he allows the serpent into his perfect Eden and enters into a friendly wager with Satan over the question of Job's loyalty? Through Satan, the Christian god punished Job in advance for a sin he did not even commit.

Job 2

3 Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though **you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason**.”

4 “Skin for skin!” Satan replied. “A man will give all he has for his own life. 5 But **now stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face.**”

6 **The Lord said to Satan, “Very well, then, he is in your hands**; but you must spare his life.”

7 So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head. 8 Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.

Even we humans can be mature enough to say, ""Fool me once, shame on you"" Fool me twice, shame on me.""
But the Christian god, though fooled twice, was too egotistical to admit it or apologize for harming Job without reason. Ego projections are like that. 

Did Job get even the slightest apology from the egotistical god? Hell, no. Job got this...

Job 40

40 The Lord said to Job:

2 “Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him?
    Let him who accuses God answer him!”

Egotists cannot admit to making a mistake. All they can do is rage about how great they are. Hey. He's ""almighty"". He *must* be right. All the time.

There is no ""justice"" in this equation. Only blind, infantile rage that the supposed ""loved one"" does not/may not ""love"" the Christian god (aka: kowtow to His every whim).

The Christian god is nothing more than the projection of an egotistical human being. Next time you overreact because you feel disrespected. Check yourself. You may want to enter into a deal with Satan and go ""the full Yahweh"".

All in it needs an explanation for it's ""beginning"". Not just the universe, but for everything, right to the first thing, and what made that first thing possible.

The theists would now insert their chosen God as the ""first thing"", and the reason he is possible is because he is eternal. He requires no explanation, as he always was and always will be.

My problem with this, is that this ""God"" must be at least as complex as the universe. Especially considering he has the power to create one. If you subscribe to the fact that he intervenes, hears prayers, knows all and sees all, he becomes more and more complex as we go.

The point is, with a God that exhibits such complexity, with mind that can fine tune so many factors of a universe to hold life, how can he possibly be the ""first thing"" that needs no explanation? A thing capable of constructing such perfectly tuned mathematics must be at the very least, as complex as me or you. At the most, more complex than the universe itself.

So how do you defend that he needs no explanation, and can be eternal if something as simple as say, the Quantum foam, not be the simple eternal thing? (I am not posing that it IS, it's just an example of something moderately simple that things come from)

This basically boils down to ""Why does God, and all his complexity NOT require a creator, when the universe and all it's complexity **must necessarily have a creator**?""

**Edit:** So far, I find this to be the nail in the God Hypothesis coffin, as it were. Nobody as of yet has weaseled out of this. God is an Engineer, a physicist, a biologist, an architect, a mathematician, an amazing critical thinker, and more. Not only is he all these, he is an EXPERT at all these. He designed everything from the quark to the atom. How they look aesthetically, to how they act/react to each other and other things. On top of all that, he manifested all this stuff literally from nothing. This is not the work of simplicity. If we're going to posit a creator that is complex enough that he can do all of this, why not cut out the middle man, Occam's Razor style even, and give credence to the fact that maybe there are some basic, fundamental laws of physics that are eternal and responsible for universe creation?

**Edit: This is my first run at composing this into actual premises. Feel free to pick it apart**

1. God is simple.
2. The universe is complex, and needs an explanation for it's existence. God is that explanation, he is simple.
3. God has some sort of data input/output device. A ""mind"".
4. This ""mind"" is composed of many parts. Critical thinking, physicist, mathematician, architect, biologist, artist. ect.
5. God has special powers, including creating absent any time parameter, and manifesting something from nothing at will.
6. Therefor contrary to 1, God is complex, composed of many parts, even if they are not physical.
7. Therefor, God requires an explanation for his existence.

**Conclusion:** *God needs some sort of ""mind"" in which to receive data, and output data. There needs to be a way he can ""know"" things, and a way he can consider those things, then act upon those things.*

*This ""mind"" that God has to have, is (potentially) infinitely complex. Yet, somehow God is simple, even with this unbelievably complex thought pattern. I posit that, given the enormous complexity of the mind responsible for ""fine tuning"" an entire universe from literally nothing, couldn't possibly be the ""first thing"" that is eternal.

With the exception of the few gnostic theists and atheists out there, most of us are simply weighing the evidence for and against different worldviews.

It is often assumed here that theists hold the burden of proof/evidence.  People here have often said that the burden is born by the person making a positive claim.   Such conversations usually involve [astronomical teapots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_teapot), the [Flying Spaghetti Monster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster), unicorns, fairies, or what not.

However, I believe the truth is that the burden of proof/evidence lies with anyone making a claim, positive or negative.  If I claim that the Christian God exists, I have to back it up with evidence.  If I claim the Christian God doesn't exist, then I still need to back it up with evidence.

To quote philosopher Paul Chamberlain
&gt;It is logically erroneous to assert that positive truth claims bear a burden of proof while negative truth claims do not. He says that all truth claims bear a burden of proof, and that like Mother Goose and the tooth fairy, the teapot bears the greater burden not because of its negativity but because of its triviality, arguing that ""When we substitute normal, serious characters such as Plato, Nero, Winston Churchill, or George Washington in place of these fictional characters, it becomes clear that anyone denying the existence of these figures has a burden of proof equal to, or in some cases greater than, the person claiming they do exist.""

I was driving to a birthday party with my not-quite-two-year-old daughter yesterday when we passed some anti-abortion protestors on the side of the road. I live in Northern Virginia which is generally fairly liberal and secular, so I don't see this kind of thing much... well, at all. This is the first time ever.

Anyway, along with their signs saying abortion was murder and God heals, they had some *delightful* (/s) before-and-after pictures, showing idealized fetuses in the womb, and gory aborted fetuses from the same stage of pregnancy.

I have to say, seeing the gory after-products of medical procedures at 10 in the morning with my young daughter is not my idea of a good time.

It amazes me that just about anything related to religion (or at least Christianity) gets a free pass in this country. Can you imagine if I protested against circumcision showing graphic pictures of the aftermath of such procedures? Protesting against hysterectomies showing bloody uteruses? How about protesting against torture by showing graphic pictures of torture victims? I'd probably get chased off the street, perhaps the police called on me, maybe even an indecency charge against me. Well, the simple fact that nobody ever does these things is enough to show the difference, really. Only abortion gets a free pass, and only because it's been made into a big religious issue.

Sometimes the question is raised in here of why atheists care at all about religion, and why we bother to debate. Well, there's one answer. Religion is a horribly corrupting influence. So many behaviors that we'd find completely unacceptable suddenly become at least tolerable when you do them for religious reasons. Mutilating newborn infants and showing random drivers pictures of medical procedures would never be tolerated outside of religion.

Anyway, just had to vent, because I found it pretty unpleasant to see these things, but not in the way they intended.

1325196447.0,52,self.DebateReligion,nvec5,To creationists: A brief primer on the theory evolution,54,2,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/nvec5/to_creationists_a_brief_primer_on_the_theory/,"With all the arguments back and forth about evolution, I thought creationists could gain from some understanding of what the theory of evolution actually is.

At its core, evolution is the theory that organisms continuously change and adapt to their environments over successive generations, by way of mutation and selection, genetic drift, and genetic draft. For the purposes of this discussion, let’s stick to mutation and selection, as the other topics are more esoteric.

Evolution is possible because of variation within species. Take humans, for instance: You will never see two humans whose [phenotypes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype) exactly match, even with identical twins. There will always be some variation, because no two organisms grow under exactly the same conditions. Even with extremely close genetic matches, environmental factors will minutely (or not so minutely) alter how given phenotypes are expressed. Case in point: Queen bees come from the exact same larvae that worker bees originate from. They are genetically the same. But give a bee larva [royal jelly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_jelly), and suddenly a whole new set of phenotypes are expressed. She gains an entirely different morphology.

Let’s say we’re looking at a population of blue-colored, flying beetles. Thanks to some variations in the genes in charge of coloration (**mutation**), they range in shade from a slightly lighter blue to a slightly darker blue.

Now one day, while our population of beetles is happily munching on some leaves in the forest, a predator species moves in. This predator favors the lightest-colored beetles, and when given the choice between two, will always eat the palest one.

In short order, paler blue beetles start disappearing. At first, it’s merely a matter of predation; if you’re pale, you are removed from the population by going down the predator’s gullet. But within a few generations, paler blue beetles become far rarer. Only the darker colored ones survive to breeding age, and pass on their genes (**selection**).

So more time passes, and eventually the beetles -- now nearly black -- have returned to their prior levels of population, having adapted to the predation.

But they’re not out of the woods yet. A new predator comes along, this time one that doesn’t care about coloration. Instead, it prefers the smallest beetles; the rest are too big to fit in its throat. And it tracks prey by movement when they fly. Wings which had been beneficial now make them more likely to get caught. Suddenly, only the biggest, fastest maturing, black beetles that spend more time crawling (**mutation**) can successfully reach mating age (**selection**).

Then the climate changes. Only big, black, crawling beetles that can get across puddles without drowning (**mutation**) successfully reach mating age (**selection**).

Then a predator who attacks from above shows up. Only big, black, crawling, swimming beetles with wide fields of vision (**mutation**) successfully reach mating age (**selection**).

Then the climate changes again. Food becomes scarce. The predator who prefers small beetles disappears. The one that attacks from above becomes very common, and starts picking off the big ones. Larger size, which had been a beneficial trait, becomes a drawback, and the most beneficial trait becomes eyes that are now almost completely migrated to the top of the beetle’s head. Now we have tiny, black, crawling beetles, with vestigial wings and the beginnings of eye-stalks (**mutation**) successfully reaching mating age (**selection**).

Now extrapolate that process over hundreds of millions of years.

Each change is due to minute variations in the genes of the beetle. If the original population of blue, flying beetles had been homogeneous, they would have died out. And sometimes, they do. There are evolutionary dead ends, animals that couldn’t adapt to their changing environments fast enough. The population doesn’t have enough variety in their genomes to begin with. But in the case of our example population, minor variations conferred enough of an advantage over time to significantly alter the population -- probably to the point where they would not be capable of mating with the original blue beetles.

And what about those originals, anyway? They could still exist, in other habitats that weren’t as affected by beetle predation or climate change. Species diverge [regularly](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v429/n6989/abs/nature02556.html) due to isolation of populations. We can see that happening now.

So the next time you consider using a line like “if we come from monkeys, why are there still monkeys,” consider the last time it would have been a survival trait for your ancestors to hang around in trees flinging poo at each other. The answer will vary greatly from humans to monkeys.

***
Obviously, there’s way more to it than that. This is just a very, very, very brief overview of just one of the processes behind evolution. I urge creationists not to stop here. Read the works of evolutionary biologists. Go through TalkOrigin’s [evidence list](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/). Try to understand the theory you dismiss before you dismiss it.

**Kalam**:

1. Everything that begins to exist has a cause

2. The universe began to exist

3. Therefore the universe has a cause

Analysis of the cause shows it to be timeless and spaceless (since its outside time and space), powerful enough to cause a universe, uncaused, eternal and personal since personal agency is the only thing we know of which can be an uncaused cause and opt to cause things at one point in eternity.

**Fine Tuning**:

1. The physical constants of the universe exist within a very narrow range that is necessary for the development of intelligent life (or any complex structures in some cases)

2. This is either due to chance, natural necessity or design

3. It is not due to chance or natural necessity

4. Therefore it's due to design

1. If God does not exist, then objective moral values do not exist

My question is how does a viewpoint that life begins at conception coincide with the fact that half of all conceptions are aborted by the body, normally because the body senses something wrong with the fertilized egg and doesn't allow it to implant onto the uterus, instead having it slough off during a woman's period.

Not every egg aborted by the body is going to necessarily be unable to be born. From an evolutionary standpoint organisms would not want to go through something like pregnancy if it resulted in offspring that did not live long enough to reproduce, and for this reason it is likely that bodies evolved to reject fertilized eggs if they noticed any abnormalities, even if those abnormalities won't necessarily prevent a live birth. My questions specifically are:

* Do you view it as okay for the body to reject fertilized eggs as not being viable, keeping in mind that the body is not perfect at determining viability? If not, do you believe we should develop drugs which prevent this from occurring by forcing the body to allow fertilized eggs to implant?
* If you do believe it is okay for the body to abort an unfertilized egg due to genetic problems with the egg, then does the same hold true for aborting fetuses that will have terminal illnesses that kill them in the first few years of their life, such as in Tay-Sachs?
* Do you differentiate between emergency contraceptives that work by stopping implantation vs. abortifacients that work by terminating established pregnancies?
* How important during pregnancy is it to avoid things which can lead to miscarriage and developmental problems? While I realize most would agree that alcohol and smoking are clearly wrong during pregnancy, what about other contributing factors such as obesity, or eating fish(due to mercury)? Should an overweight women loose weight before she gets pregnant, or is the additional risk of miscarriage not significant enough to warrant delaying pregnancy.

I do not mean to offend anyone with these questions, and apologize if some of these appear to be leading or presumptuous.

Empiricism is the only way to know anything.",70,18,375,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/zl6yf/to_all_ok_ill_just_say_it_empiricism_is_the_only/,"Most skeptics say something like ""empirical evidence is the best method we have of obtaining knowledge, but there are other ways of knowing things."" Bold skeptics sometimes go as far as saying ""empirical evidence is the only good method that we *currently* know of for obtaining knowledge... but we might find other ways in the future."" I am going to go even farther, and say ""empirical evidence (gathered through our senses) is the the only way one can ever know anything."" There is no other way of knowing.

**What about math, logic, and reason?**

As an empiricist, I would say that math, logic, and reason are still valid forms of obtaining knowledge, but that they rest totally upon empiricism. The only reason math is useful at all is because we know it corresponds with reality, and the only reason we know math corresponds with reality is through empirical evidence. One apple plus one apple equals two apples. With lots of repeated experiments and some extrapolation, we can discover how addition works in general. And from there, how operators work in general, and how functions work in general, and we can create a sound basis of mathematical truths to reason from. We can even talk about imaginary numbers - numbers that do not exist in reality - and learn truths about those numbers without reference to direct empirical evidence. And we can do all that only because the sound basis of mathematics was established by empiricism. 

Rationalists say that math and logic are based on apriori, self-evident truths. I disagree. It is not apriori obvious that ""p-&gt;q, q, therefore p"" is an incorrect argument while ""p-&gt;q, p, therefore q"" is a correct one. This is an incredibly common and intuitive mistake that people make all the time. Let us not rest our epistemology on such shaky grounds as intuition. Let's test our logic and make sure it works.

**What about a hypothetical other way of knowing, something better than empiricism and better than science, that might be discovered in the future? Why close the door on such a methodology?** 

I'm not closing the door on such a methodology, but I am making a claim about it. If such a methodology is found, then it must be vetted by empiricism. The evidence must show us that our new methodology works, and if the evidence shows us that, we can use our new methodology as if it was a starting point because it has a sound empirical basis. 

For example, imagine that we did empirical tests of ESP and found that some people do have extra-sensory perception. And those people can reliably demonstrate it, in test after test after test. Then strict empiricists are justified in using ESP as a new method of knowing things, because ESP has been empirically shown to be a reliable methodology.

**How do you establish that empirical evidence is a good epistemology, without resorting to empirical evidence?**

... I'm not sure. For now, I take it as an assumption. That might be the best I can ever do.

But that does not mean that empiricism is self-defeating. Because nearly everyone agrees that empiricism is *a* good way of obtaining knowledge - if not the only one - my assumption is not really under fire. Once I have agreement that empiricism is one of the possibly many good ways of obtaining knowledge, it follows that any other candidate way of obtaining knowledge can be shown to be reliable or not reliable through the use of empiricism. That's the beauty of empiricism: it works on other methods of obtaining knowledge. The good candidates can be vetted by empiricism. Therefore, we lose nothing by saying ""empiricism is the basis for all of our knowledge.""

The thought process, as I understand it, is basically that the gospels are not written in a way that indicates they were made up, and various details point to them describing truth, not fiction, therefore what they describe actually happened.

I find this claim to be interesting since it makes such a concrete claim, much more so than most religions. It goes beyond the typical touchy-feely type of thing you get from religions, the inner experiences, the supposedly inherent truths, etc., and actually tries to make historical claims from real documents. I don't find the argument to be all that compelling, but just the fact that it exists is really interesting. This isn't my first post talking about it either.

Anyway, I was reading this article about, of all things, Super Mario Brothers and the question about just what its North American release date was. Here's a link to the articlre:

http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/167392/sad_but_true_we_cant_prove_when_.php

To summarize the article, Super Mario Brothers is perhaps the most iconic video game ever made, but nobody is quite sure exactly what its North American release date was. The author of the article does some substantial digging and comes up with a few pretty decent guesses, but no definitive proof.

So here we have this incredibly important cultural icon that's still widely played today, has spawned numerous sequels and spinoffs, and is a household name. There are a huge number of living eyewitnesses to the event, as well as substantial documentation from both biased and unbiased sources, and yet we *still* can't quite know for sure precisely when this thing was actually released.

If we can't even pin down details of the release of perhaps the most important video game ever created less than 30 years after the fact, how can we possibly know the truth of Jesus's death with such confidence that we can count his resurrection as being a more likely explanation than the gospels being incorrect?

Edit: a lot of repliers are attacking the idea that Jesus's resurrection is uncertain because of missing details, and comparing it to disbelieving in SMB entirely because we can't pin down the release date. I'm not sure where things went wrong, but that's not my reasoning at all. I'm simply saying that, if we can't figure out details of something so recent, so important, and so well attested, then if we look at something so ancient and poorly attested, why should we believe a particular fantastic detail claimed?

It was a pretty big year:

1. The Higgs Boson
2. The Curiosity Rover lands on Mars
3. Most human genetic variation is rare and the deleterious variants arose recently, during our expansion out of Africa
4. The sequencing of fetal genomes using noninvasive procedures, from fetal DNA floating in the mother’s blood
5. The teleportation of entangled quantum particles over a large distance: 50 miles
6. The synthesis of XNA, a new polymer that can carry information and evolve via a form of selection
7. A private company, SpaceX, launched and orbited its own spacecraft, and delivered it to the International Space Station
8. Discovery of an Earth-size exoplanet orbiting a nearby star, Alpha Centauri B
9. The reaching of Lake Vostok, an Antarctic lake, which required drilling through more than 2 miles of ice; this may lead to the discovery of unusual forms of life
10. Government policy has started to end invasive research on chimpanzees in the U.S.

Now, it has been said rather often that religion is also an attempt to find things out about reality, that it also provides us with knowledge much as science does.  To ensure I'm not using weasel words here, some citations:

&gt;The question of truth is as central to [religion's] concern as it is in science. Religious belief can guide one in life or strengthen one at the approach of death, but unless it is actually true it can do neither of these things and so would amount to no more than an illusionary exercise in comforting fantasy. - John Polkinghorne

&gt;Likewise, religion in almost all of its manifestations is more than just a collection of value judgments and moral directives. Religion often makes claims about ‘the way things are.' - Karl Giberson and Francis Collins

&gt;Science is not the only way of knowing. The spiritual worldview provides another way of finding truth. - Francis Collins

&gt;The topic is the claim on the part of many Christians that faith is a source of knowledge or information about the world in addition to reason. - Alvin Plantinga

&gt;On balance, theism is vastly more hospitable to science than naturalism, a much better home to it. Indeed, it is theism, not naturalism, that deserves to be called ‘the scientific worldview.’ - Alvin Plantinga

&gt;The ultimate test of faith must still, and always, be its truth; whether we can prove it or not, the reality of the perspectives it brings us, and the changes it puts us through, must depend in the end on it corresponding to an actual state of the universe. - Francis Spufford

So, perhaps I'm simply not dialed in to the theological research program, but I've somehow missed religion discovering or accomplishing anything lately.  We've had time now to reflect on the past year; what new things did religion add to human knowledge in 2012?  What major breakthroughs and accomplishments did it have?  Or are these respected philosophers and theologians simply wrong about religion?

I am the parent of two small children, ages 5 and 2. Today, my heart is absolutely broken; it is difficult to put into words the horror a parent feels at the death of a child, let alone the monstrous murder of one. There is an empathetic unity all parents feel with one another, if they are not monsters themselves, a deeply ingrained imperative at the core of our beings, demanding that *children not be harmed*, no matter whose child it may be. Even when they aren't our own, we feel it keenly when children die.

On a day like today, I envy those who hold fast to a belief that there is a life after this one, that death is not the end. It used to soothe my heart to know that however traumatic their deaths, children who suffer and die go to a better place afterward.

I am not allowed that soothing balm anymore. When I am confronted by the deaths of children, I can't avert my eyes and assuage my grief by telling myself stories about how their spirits have reached another stage of existence. I can't make myself believe they still exist anymore. Today, I genuinely wish I could.

But the inexorable drumbeat of logic in my head won't let me. It tells me those children aren't in pain, which is good, but it also tells me all the potential they had for a lifetime of experience is gone. There is no afterlife. There is no do-over. Five, six years, that's all they got.

So I will do what I can here, while I can. I will donate money to mental health services that are designed to stop these tragedies before they start. I will donate to child protection services designed to end cycles of abuse and violence that often lead to these kinds of tragedies. I will donate to gun control advocacy groups. I will do all that is in my power *here and now* to affect change for the better *here and now*, because I don't believe there is anything that comes after.

However much I might, right now, wish I did.

I'm always forced to distinguish the category that someone would belong in when I bring it up due to the counter-intuitive nature of asking ""are you into advancing humanity and technology, except *really hard?*"" I mean, who isn't into having faster computers and an easier way of doing something [with no repercussions for said ease]?

That's where the fun begins, though. I've met atheists and theists alike that heavily disagree with me on the subject(s) of transhumanism due simply to the movement's supposed lack of ethical or moral guidelines.

 For those of you not in the know, [transhumanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Transhumanism) is a cultural movement that believes we should be overhauling our progress as a people. In a more specific sense, it is technologically-based and focused on the prospect of human-engineered evolution.

It's a community with specific aims in advancing things like [cloning](http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml), [biomechatronics](http://biomech.media.mit.edu/research/research.htm), [life extension](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_extension), space colonization, robotics, artificial intelligence, and a general aim in improving technology and humanity, while ensuring we have a future. 

There are various conflicts with this outlook. Specifically in religious criticisms but a large group of secular organizations oppose transhumanism, as well. I'm guessing almost everyone here is on board with space exploration (unless you're economically opposed to it) and advances in prosthetics but I'd put money that there will be a variance in r/DR's opinion on reproductive cloning, life-extending medical procedures and especially artificial intelligence [due to it's image in popular media, no less].

Transhumanism is without a doubt going to become more popular, whether it continues as a group or it's singular ideas influence more mainstream outlets. Thanks in part to some media (specifically literature, film and games) it has already become a topic of discussion, and thanks to advancements in STEM fields it is a much more relevant topic for the average Joe than it was even twenty years ago. 

**To Theists:** Do you think the supposed haphazard morality and lack of spirituality in transhumanism is enough to argue against it as a cultural movement? Are there any subsets in the movement that you agree with independent of the others? What's your concern with the possibility of life-extension and using embryos for scientific research?

**To Atheists:** Are the [lack of] ethical concerns in transhumanism worse than the possible benefits?

1341320380.0,50,self.DebateReligion,vz5n4,To Atheists: How did you overcome the need for a benevolent force?,63,13,184,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/vz5n4/to_atheists_how_did_you_overcome_the_need_for_a/,"First of all, let me clarify that I don't think all theists need a crutch or any kind of support, nor do I believe that all atheists are materialists free of superstition.

Let me also state that this post will contain a lot more questions than the title suggests, but I feel they are related.

That being said, how do you overcome the fear of the idea that there is nothing else out there? That praying won't help? That even in times when we're most alone and vulnerable, all we have is what our physical bodies can give us? That there are no angels, no objective morals set out in some book? That no matter how far we get in life, we might not get anything, or get killed by a random mugger?

There seems to a huge difference between conscious resolve to be an atheist and the unconscious rejection of God. For many people I know are ""stress theists"", i.e., they are theists when under stress, or in a general vulnerable position.

For both fearless atheism and fearless theism seem to be equally difficult positions to maintain. Right now I wish to confine the discussion to the atheists.

So tell me, how do you form your morals, how do you find the motivation to work for something and most importantly, how do you overcome the fear?

1340674170.0,45,self.DebateReligion,vlsfa,To theists: What's the difference between mocking someone who believes Elvis is still alive and someone that believes that someone 2000 years ago said he was God.,85,40,317,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/vlsfa/to_theists_whats_the_difference_between_mocking/,"I don't see why religious faith is some sort of safe house from ridicule. We see people that think that Elvis still alive, people that burn people at the stake because of witch craft, adults that still believe and have faith in Santa Claus and the tooth fairies. But all of a sudden when it comes to deities, people suddenly get uptight and 'offended'. That these modern religious beliefs have some type of immunity.

Sam Harris makes the analogy of someone that believes Elvis is still alive. If you mention this in a normal conversation or at a job interview or whatever, you will learn quickly that people think it is a crazy idea and you probably won't get the job and you probably won't become close to many sane people.
 

Religion wouldn't be so popular if it wasn't some sacred belief that you're *not allowed* to treat like every other crazy belief. People deserve respect, but ideas...not so much. [hitch nails it](http://imgur.com/4AMit)




Look at /r/conspiratard . They are constantly and relentlessly making fun of ridiculous conspiracy theorists and reddit isn't up in arms about what assholes they are. What's the difference?
   


I'm not a huge fan of /r/atheism, but I''l use it as an example. People usually get very upset at the fact that some of it's posts that make fun of religion. I'm just saying that they are justified in doing that, unless someone proves me wrong. Also, ridicule and insult are not the best way to convert people but that isn't the point of this thread.


EDIT: Elvis was just an example, no need to focus on that. I think you get the underlying point I'm conveying.

The moderation team has changed their mind and is now implementing the following, more strict system for ensuring a friendly debate climate.  Not coddling - you'll still get sharp arguments, but not publicly ridiculed, either.

As a result, the moderation team at /r/DebateReligion is pleased to announce:  

DEMI-MODS - a corp of r/DR users who will be given post level moderation rights.  This means they will be able to approve, remove, and mark as spam posts and comments.  This new corp of demi-mods will be drawn from the community with no numerical limit, and ANYONE who is interested can ask to be a demi-mod.  The new demi-mod will be probationary, until they have demonstrated that they will use their new power in a responsible manner.  (Never forget the gospel of Uncle Benjamin.)  Demi-mods will get a silver star.

WATCHMODS - obviously, if we are going increase the number of people who have the ability to muck up the sub, we need to keep a closer eye on exactly what these demi-mods are doing.  So, the second new corp will be WatchMods.  They have no actual moderator permissions, but they are able to see and read the mod mail, the mod queue, and the mod log. Anyone can be a watchmod, just ask.  WatchMods will get a green star.  Who watches the mods and demi-mods?  The WATCHMODS!

Also, since we anticpate this swelling our moderator ranks hugely, we have created a private subreddit specifically for the r/DR mod team to communicate and have meta discussions.  Those who become demi-mods and watchmods will be invited to this private sub.

This is experimental!  If this whole idea goes totally sideways and breaks the community, then the programs will both be discontinued.  However, we fully expect this initiative to make the sub more friendly, productive, and to raise the level of discourse even higher.

The mods will create two posts for applying to be a demi-mod and watchmods.  Once those posts have fallen off the front page, msg the mods to apply to be a demi-mod, or to become a watchmod.

Along with the demi-mods and the watchmods, the moderation team at r/DR is pleased to announce:

New post and comment content rules!

Since the moderation is going to be heavier, and done by more people, we feel it needed to standardise some rules to guide demi-mods as they police the tone of the subreddit.

This thread is for taking suggestions and comments from the community about the proposed new rules.

With no further ado:  the proposed new rules

- Posts and comments insulting or attacking a particular person or group of people may be moderated.

- Posts which criticize an idea or belief using derogatory or profane language with no redeeming thematic purpose may be moderated.

- Posts which contain gratuitous profane language may be moderated.

- Only the Mods can ban users.  Demi-mods do not have any power to ban users.  Users will be banned based solely on the opinion of the mods.

Basically, think of it this way - if Richard Dawkins or William Lane Craig won't say it from the lectern in a formal debate, you shouldn't say it here, and you should expect it to be moderated.

(Please note the use of the word *may* in the above rules.)

The Messiah is a person who will live up to a series of prophetic expectations and partake of an era marked by particular characteristics. In absence of such being the case, Jesus cannot possibly be the Messiah. 

&gt;The whole world will worship the One God of Israel. Isaiah 2:11-17, Isaiah 40:5, Zephaniah 3:9

Currently large swaths humanity do not worship the One God of Israel. 

&gt;Knowledge of God will fill the world. Isaiah 11:9, 45:23, 66:23, Jeremiah 31:33, Zechariah 3:9, 8:23, 14:9,16, Ezekiel 38:23, Psalm 86:9

Note that this is *knowledge* of God - not simply unsubstantiated faith in God. Even amongst the faithful, such knowledge is rare. 

&gt;All Israelites will be returned to their homeland Isaiah 11:12, 27:12-13, Ezekiel 11:17, 36:24, Deuteronomy 30:3

Though there are more Jews today living in the Land of Israel than there have been since the exile began nearly 2,000 years ago - there is still a large diaspora consisting of millions of Jews. 

&gt;The Jewish people will experience eternal joy and gladness. Isaiah 51:11

The Jewish people have been historically subject to a great degree of persecution (the Holocaust, the Inquisition, pogroms, etc.) and while generally our condition has improved, we are still a perpetual target. 

&gt;Nations will recognize the wrongs they did to Israel. Isaiah 52:13-53:5

While modern Germany as a nation-state does much to repent of its history (i.e. the Holocaust), various states and human institutions with much blood and guilt on their hands, to this day either remain silent, white-wash/cover up history, or in some perverse instances even exult in it. 

&gt;The peoples of the world will turn to the Jews for spiritual guidance. Zechariah 8:23

While there is today an emerging interest in observance of the Noahide laws (the Torah's universal laws of man), there still has not been an en masse turn towards learned Torah observant Jews for guidance in spiritual matters.

&gt;Weapons of war will be destroyed. Ezekiel 39:9

One need only momentarily consider the trillions spent on arms by nations such as the U.S., China and Russia as well as the existence of an immense military industrial complex to realize that this is not the condition we find ourselves in today. 

&gt;A person’s genealogical/tribal membership are transmitted exclusively through one’s physical father. Numbers 1:18, Jeremiah 33:17

Jesus whose alleged sketchy genealogy is maternal cannot possibly be a verifiable descendent of the tribe of Judah. 

&gt;The Temple will be rebuilt. Micah 4:1, Ezekiel 40-42, Isaiah 2:2-3, Malachi 3:4, Zechariah 14:20-21,

The Third Temple is not a metaphor, it is not symbolic of a man. There will be an actual physical building where all of the ritualistic components that the Torah commands be implemented, will be administered by Leviim (Levites) and Kohanim (Priests). 

&gt;World Peace: Isaiah 2:4, 11:6, 60:18 Micah 4:1-4, Hosea 2:20

The list of ongoing military conflicts is too long to list here. One can hardly pick up a newspaper or hear a news report without being informed of the latest battle, bombing, strike, etc. 

&gt;Christianity claims that Jesus ""Fulfilled the law,"" i.e. the law is abrogated and need not any longer be observed. 

Deut. 13:2-7 concerns the ""false prophet"" - if one arises who attempts to draw the Jewish people away from Torah observance then he is to be identified as such. The Torah's commandments are an eternally binding covenant with the Jews, God is not a whimsical being subject to a willy nilly changing of the rules - ""God is not a man, that He should lie; neither the son of man, that He should repent"" (Num. 23:19)

&gt;All Jews will embrace Torah observance. Ezekiel 37:24, Deuteronomy 30:8-10, Jeremiah 31:32, Ezekiel 11:19-20, 36:26-27.

It is fairly obvious that as the situation stands today, lamentably only a very small percentage of Jews live in observance of the Torah. Secularism has widely been embraced by Jews and some even go so far as deeming such virtuous. 

&gt; Jesus cannot be a part of God, not him, anybody or anything. Deut 6:4. 

The idea of the Messiah actually partaking of divinity is anathema to Torah Judaism. God is ONE. His oneness is inviolable and is not that of a compound unity (like twelve eggs make one dozen, or three divinities make one god). 

&gt;The law is eternal.

Exodus 12:14, 12:17, 12:43, 27:21, 28:43, Leviticus 3:17, 7:36, 10:9, 16:29, 16:31, 16:34, 17:7, 23:14, 23:21, 23:31, 23:41, 24:3, Numbers 10:8, 15:15, 19:10, 19:21, 18:23, 35:29, Deuteronomy 29:28, and that there are no references to it ever passing away. 

To summarize ([H. Melakhim Ch. 11](http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188356/jewish/Chapter-11.htm)): 

*In the future, the Messianic king will arise and renew the Davidic dynasty, restoring it to its initial sovereignty. He will build the Temple and gather the dispersed of Israel. Then, in his days, the observance of all the statutes will return to their previous state. We will offer sacrifices, observe the Sabbatical and Jubilee years according to all their particulars as described by the Torah...*

*If a king will arise from the House of David who diligently contemplates the Torah and observes its mitzvot as prescribed by the Written Law and the Oral Law as David, his ancestor, will compel all of Israel to walk in (the way of the Torah) and rectify the breaches in its observance, and fight the wars of God, we may, with assurance, consider him Moshiah. If he succeeds in the above, builds the Temple in its place, and gathers the dispersed of Israel, he is definitely the Moshiah. He will then improve the entire world, motivating all the nations to serve God together, as Tzephaniah 3:9 states: 'I will transform the peoples to a purer language that they all will call upon the name of God and serve Him with one purpose.' If he did not succeed to this degree or was killed, he surely is not the redeemer promised by the Torah.*

The Messiah will basically be a human religious leader and a warrior king born of a *young woman.* He will **not die and come back, rather he will live a mortal life within which he fulfill the prophetic expectations.** [Bar Kochba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kochba) (who led the rebellion against Roman occupation), was once considered as a messianic candidate. However, [once he died](http://imgur.com/a/N1kbb) and thus failed to live up to the aforementioned expectations, the Sages effectively shrugged and said ""oh well... he wasn't it."" To borrow a phrase ""The God of the Hebrew Bible sends the messianic king to accomplish his end, not to follow a two-part script in which the hero tragically dies and the words 'to be continued' suddenly appear on the screen.""

1360264763.0,48,self.DebateReligion,182x2s,To all: A quick primer on evolution for creationists,55,7,153,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/182x2s/to_all_a_quick_primer_on_evolution_for/,"&gt; **Kingdom**: *Animalia*

&gt; **Adaptation within kind**: The first of what we call ""animals"" appear in the fossil record about 542 million years ago, at the very start of the Cambrian explosion. They were of a kind with the earliest fungi and plants; that is to say, they were all eukaryotes. Individual early eukaryotes were remarkably similar to one another, with only minor differences in detail.
&gt;&gt; **Phylum**: *Chordata*

&gt;&gt; **Adaptation within kind**: One group of those simple early creatures adapted to its environments by elongating and thinning. Not terribly different from its cousin animals, really, but that long, thin, flexible body definitely gave it some advantages that it passed on, in some circumstances. No new structures, of course. Just the adaptation of some of the body's cells into a sort of primitive backbone. Other early animals adapted to different environments in different ways, but you can't really say we've moved outside of kind just because one group has thinned and lengthened and another group -- say, echinoderms -- has not. Those early echinoderms stayed shorter and a little thicker, by the way, but the ones that survived to breed eventually emphasized other traits I won't go into.
&gt;&gt;&gt; **Class**: *Synapsida*

&gt;&gt;&gt; **Adaptation within kind**: Those chordatas really had some success with that whole ""backbone"" cluster of cells thing they had going on, so they emphasized the heck out of it, adapting it to all kinds of different purposes. Still, it would be pretty hard to say they were no longer of a kind with other chordatas just because they happened to have a particular gap in what we'd call the ""skull"" part of that bony structure. And really, it could be argued that this wasn't the best adaptation that could have happened for them, because only one small group of them survived.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Class**: *Mammalia*

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Adaptation within kind**: Really, mammals weren't that different from their synapsid cousins, especially those in the therapsid subclass. By then, they all had backbones, bilateral symmetry, they were all tetrapods, and so forth. Differences were fairly minor, detail stuff. I mean, what's the difference if your fur is thicker or thinner, or if you're larger or smaller? After all, on the one hand we have gigantic dogs like Great Danes, and on the other, Paris Hilton keeps a dog in her purse. But they're both dogs, of course. Mammals adapted some cells to perform various minor functions that, given their environment, were marginally better suited for survival even than the other therapsids (we're not even talking cousins here, we're talking brothers and sisters).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Order**: *Primates*

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Adaptation within kind**: And sure, some of those mammals adapted that old chordata ""backbone"" cluster of cells in different ways to allow for things like standing upright (boy was that long, thin, flexible body useful for survival!), but primates share a lot more similarities than differences with the other mammals. I mean, all you have to do is look at how similarly that collection of hard cells we call ""bones"" is laid out when you compare primates to other mammals, and you can see it's quite obvious we're still within kind, here.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Family**: *Hominidae*

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Adaptation within kind**: The differences at this level of granularity are even harder to see. The ""great apes"" are so similar to one another and the ""lesser apes,"" when you put them side by side it's hard to even see a difference. I mean, what's really the difference between a modern gibbon and a modern bonobo, other than size?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Tribe**: *Hominini*

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Adaptation within kind**: Some members of the hominidae family adapted separately. The ""panini"" tribe got a little hairier, a little better at climbing trees, and so forth. Today, we call this group of great apes bonobos and chimpanzees. There's another tribe of great apes called gorillini that's so similar it's hardly worth mentioning at all. Contrast the panini with the hominini, and there's hardly any difference. Homininis stood a little taller, had slightly larger craniums for their body mass, and weren't as hairy. All really minor variations. In fact, it's kind of hard to de-tangle exactly where paninis, gorillinis, and homininis adapted differently from one another, since they're so darn similar and have such overlapping periods of time in which they lived.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Genus**: *Homo*

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Adaptation within kind**: Talk about splitting hairs. So many of the differences between these particular groups of great apes almost seem arbitrary. One group has nominally bigger chests. One group has nominally bigger heads. They are all only slightly less hairy than other hominini, and aren't as good at climbing, but they all use those highly adapted backbones of theirs to support clusters of cells we call ""hands"" to use tools of one sort or another, they all spend most of their time upright, they eat the same kinds of things, and so on. An early member of this genus, *homo heidelbergensis*, seems to have adapted in two nominally different ways (one of which was called *homo neanderthalensis*) but it's readily apparent from DNA tests that they were so similar, those two supposed ""branches"" of adaptation within kind interbred. And their kids? The *eukaryotes* with well developed *chordata* backbones, *synapsida* skulls, *mammalia* body features, *primate* characteristics, *hominidae* behaviors, in the *hominini* tribe, called modern *homo sapiens* are hardly different at all, biologically, from the ones that preceded them.

Obviously I've simplified this a great deal. I've left out subfamilies and superfamilies, the incremental adaptations that led to things like eyes, fur, feathers, and scales, and a great many other details. I focused on the backbone because it's a component of animal development that is visually, obviously similar across a wide range of species. But rest assured, all of it is similarly incremental and obvious in nature.

The point of all this is to explain to creationists that when they say they accept ""adaptation within kind,"" or their version of ""micro evolution,"" what they are actually saying -- whether they realize it or not -- is that they accept evolution. **All** evolution is adaptation within a kind. If you accept that minor variance can occur within a population, you accept evolution.

There are veritable mountains of evidence for evolution available at your nearest library or bookstore, if you have the intellectual rigor to learn what evolution actually is, rather than attacking straw-man versions of it. You will understand afterward that ""adaptation within kind"" is synonymous with ""evolution by natural selection.""

There's really only one way to attack evolution once you actually understand that, and that is by attacking the age of the Earth itself. That is similar folly, however, unless you understand the science that indicates an old Earth. And I contend that any of you who permit yourselves to understand what evolution and the geological sciences actually indicate about the age of the Earth will either need to reject science itself rather than continue to claim it supports your beliefs, or reject creationism.

1351604897.0,46,self.DebateReligion,12c59a,An argument against abortion,82,36,537,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/12c59a/an_argument_against_abortion/,"1. It is wrong to take the life of an innocent human being without proper justification.
2. Abortion takes the life of an innocent human being without proper justification.
3. Abortion is wrong.

To believe that abortion is not wrong, you must argue against premise 1 or 2.

Starting with premise 2, because that is the one that is most often attacked first.

* Abortion kills *something*.

This seems obvious to me. If the thing inside of mom isn't alive, growing, developing, taking resources, etc, then there would be no reason to try to get rid of it. It is exactly the entity's ""aliveness"" that is causing the mother distress in the first place.

Not to mention any medical doctor you ask is going to refer to fertilized egg, embryo, fetus, infant, etc as a living thing. No one with any medical training what-so-ever thinks that these things aren't alive in a biological sense.

* That *something* is not a part of the mother.

Medically, we are dealing with two separate entities here. This is clear by checking the DNA. It is also clear when considering the fact that mother may die and the child survives or vice versa. This is the whole reason we have the ""save the mom or save the baby"" dilemmas in medical situations with pregnant women.

* That *something* is another human being.

Again, this seems obvious to me. If it is not a human being, then what is it? When two living things of one species reproduce, you get the same species. Presumably, then we have no reason to doubt that the product of human reproduction is another human. Biologically, an embryo is a human being in the earliest stage of development.

* That human being is innocent.

A child inside the mother's womb is about as innocent as you can get. The child has no understanding of right and wrong, lacks the mental capacity to understand consequences for his or her actions, and does not really have any opportunity to commit any crimes.

Many people may try to claim that the baby is not innocent because he is an invader, or a parasite. However, the child did not perform any action prior to being formed by the mother's body. The child did not make any choices to form in her womb, it was the mothers own body that caused his or her formation, so the child is innocent of any invasion.

* The justification usually offered for abortion is insufficient. 

""Proper justification"" would be justification that we would usually accept for taking innocent human life. Here is a test to see if someone's justification for abortion is sufficient or not. Apply the same justification they give for killing an unborn human being to a two year old. Does it still seem justified? If not, then chances are the justification is insufficient.

For example: She had an abortion because the pregnancy was a product of a rape. She killed her two year old because he was a product of a rape.

She had an abortion because she wanted to focus on her career. She killed her two year old because she wanted to focus on her career.

She had an abortion because she didn't want to be a single mother. She killed her two year old because she didn't want to be a single mother.

You get the idea.

Once the second premise is shown to be sound, many people want to go back and revisit the first premise. This should scare you. If the first premise is defeated, we are in serious trouble. It is attacked by way of the personhood argument. The goal of which is to say that there are some innocent human beings that it is not wrong to kill. History is littered with the wreckage of this idea.

* What is the difference between a human being and a person?

The argument usually goes something like this. Not all human beings are persons, and only persons are valuable. This raises the question, what's the difference? During the Nazi reign of Germany they had a designation that illustrates this idea. *Lebensunwertes Leben*. Life unworthy of life. The Nazi's euthenized those who were given this designation. It included people with serious medical problems, mental disorders, and people of races that the Nazi's deemed inferior.

Most people who argue for the personhood argument abhor this kind of thing. But still the question is, what's the difference and how do we know? There are four key areas where an unborn human being differs from other human beings.

* Size and appearance

Does the way someone look or the amount of space they take up increase or decrease personhood? Do short people have less value than tall? Ugly people less than beautiful people?

* Level of development

Do children have less value than adults? Should we be ageists? What about people with developmental issues? If level of development decreases a human being's personhood, why should they be cared for? 

* Environment and location

How much moral significance is there to a 7 inch journey down the birth canal? When I cross the street do I lose my personhood?

* Degree of dependency

If this is the key difference then infants still are not persons. They depend fully on their parents and will not last long at all without their care. Shoot, most teenagers these days are fully dependant. 

All of these things seem to be completely insignificant when determining a human being's value. So again, what is the difference between human beings and persons? What is it about human beings in the earliest stages of development that makes them ""life unworthy of life""?

It is my view that there is no difference. That nothing makes these little human beings unworthy of life. The value of personhood is found in each and every human being, regardless of size, stage of development, their dependency, or location. Human beings are inherently valuable. Their value comes from what they are, not from any outside requirement.",,False,,t5_2snuc,False,,flair,True,t3_12c59a,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/12c59a/an_argument_against_abortion/,
1351455607.0,45,self.DebateReligion,128g2l,Why I care about religion,62,17,187,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/128g2l/why_i_care_about_religion/,"People in here often ask why atheists bother to debate religion. If there are no consequences to one's beliefs, then what does it matter? For example, many Christians have a legitimate reason to try to convert people, believing they will suffer if they don't have the right religion. But why do us atheists bother?

I had a realization the other day that really clarified my own thinking about it, and since it's such a common topic here, I wanted to share.

I was at a party the other day, and overhead a man and a woman talking about having babies, and in particular about the sex of the babies. Do you want a boy or a girl, etc. Fairly mundane stuff.

At one point, the woman said something like: ""I knew before $DAUGHTER was born that she was going to be a girl. You know how sometimes you just *know* something?""

And I got to thinking, how does somebody get such a bizarre idea, that it's possible to know the sex of one's baby by through feelings? As far as I know, such a concept is not supported by any actual evidence. But it's a pretty common idea even though it has no legitimate support. How does such an idea survive and thrive when it's just not true?

It occurred to me that confirmation bias gets passed down through generations. An individual could come up with the idea that they can guess the sex of their baby through confirmation bias. I don't know how often this would happen on its own, but it'll happen occasionally.

But then once one person has this idea, it'll tend to spread. It will trigger confirmation biases in other people too. They'll start trying to guess the sex of their own babies, and the successes will naturally be accepted while the failures are ignored. Eventually, the whole idea can become embedded in the culture.

This is one example of what I'll term ""magical thinking"". I would define ""magical thinking"" as anything where A is believed to cause B without any solid evidence or plausible mechanism of action, or in the face of evidence to the contrary. Besides feelings-based baby sexing, examples would include:

* Common superstitions of all kinds, like throwing salt over your shoulder when you spill some, having bad luck from breaking mirrors, fear of black cats, etc.
* The idea that the results of die rolls are inter-dependent, e.g. that if you haven't rolled a 20 in a while, you're more likely to roll a 20 now.
* Gamblers' ""systems"" of all sorts.
* Homeopathy.
* Political beliefs of all kinds.

And of course the great granddaddy of them all, the reason I'm posting this here in the first place: religion.

If one's religious beliefs are harmless, why do I care about them? Because acceptance of magical thinking leads to more magical thinking overall, as far as I can tell. (This belief may itself well be magical thinking! But I think I have a plausible mechanism of action, at least.) Religion is exceptional in this regard because it's perhaps the only form of organized magical thinking which it is not only widely accepted but also widely considered to be above criticism. If somebody uses a homeopathic remedy for an illness, it's generally acceptable (if quite possibly rude) to point out that such remedies are indistinguishable from water and work no better than a placebo. But if somebody prays for an illness, it's usually completely unacceptable to point out that such actions are indistinguishable from talking to one's self and work no better than a placebo.

In short, religion represents a nearly untouchable reservoir of contagious magical thinking. And while the magical thinking of religion itself is often harmless (although often not!), by legitimizing magical thinking, it leads to other, more harmful kinds. In a society where certain kinds of magical thinking are beyond criticism, it becomes harder to point out why *any* kind of magical thinking is wrong.

And so we get alternative pharmacies selling water to cure diseases, politicians promising completely ridiculous things, anti-vaccination movements, and on and on. And why wouldn't people fall for this stuff? They have respected community leaders preaching the same *kind* of thinking, even if not exactly the same thinking, as part of their supposed ultimate truth.

I don't bother to argue with people who believe in homeopathy or other junk science, because once they get that far they're basically beyond hope. I do sometimes argue with people who engage in magical thinking when it comes to politics, conspiracy theories, etc. Debating religion is, for me, just another branch of this general theme of combating magical thinking.

**Kalam Cosmological Argument** - An equivocation on the first premise between the creation of new material and the rearranging of already existing material.  The equivocation renders the first premise unproved.

**Fine Tuned Universe** - Having only one sample of physical constants means that we can neither determine a probability or margin of error for these constants, and hence they may be very probable or incredibly imprecise

**Argument from Objective Moral values** - Objective moral values exist without appealing to God if using the definitions of ""help vs. harm"" for good vs. evil.  If we're using ""ought vs. ought not"" theistic morality is equally impotent at finding objective moral values

**Anslem's Ontological Argument** - There is a difference between imagined and perceived beings/traits.  Because the argument doesn't demonstrate to begin with whether we are imagining God's greatness is real or imaginary, we can't say if it's truer for greatness to exist, such that imagined greatness would not necessarily exist.

**Aquina's First Way** - Asserts that a prime mover is ""entirely actualized"" without sufficient reason for it.

**Plantinga's Ontological Argument** - Any ""possible worlds"" are necessarily fiction or fact.  Everything within those worlds is necessarily fiction or fact.  If God exists in a fictional world, then He is a matter of fiction as are His traits that might suggest He must exist in all worlds.  Something nonexistent isn't free to entangle with existing things.

1341981811.0,45,self.DebateReligion,wdbk0,To Christians and Jews: The Exodus myth. There is no archaeological evidence for the Exodus but in fact mounds of evidence to reject it.,72,27,252,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/wdbk0/to_christians_and_jews_the_exodus_myth_there_is/,"About 15 years ago, a friend asked me if I wanted to look at a video about Bible archeology. I eagerly accepted. The tape was interesting but what was most profound about this experience for me was the clear statement near the end that there was in fact no historical or archeological evidence that the Israelites were ever enslaved in Egypt and there was no evidence of any exodus from Egypt. Since it was the first time I had heard this, I filed this controversial idea away until I could get more confirmation and then form an opinion. I wish I had been able to keep the video or remember who produced it. This finding would destroy one of the major foundation blocks of the Christian and Jewish religion. It is not to be taken lightly or dismissed out of hand if it comes from reputable archeologists.


I offered to lend the tape to a Christian friend who I thought naturally would like to view a video on this topic. I was wrong. This person had no interest in viewing a video on Bible archeology. Religious people often refuse to learn about their religion. Learning new facts complicates faith.



I grew up hearing much of the religious misinformation claiming that archeology "" proved"" the bible. The religious claims of early archeologists saying that the city of Jericho was conquered by Joshua was frequently announced along with other isolated examples. It was as if the existence of a particular spring, river, or building proved the entire Bible. The reasoning was akin to saying that since Athens existed, the stories about Hercules and Zeus must have been true. With regard to Jericho, I read other articles from later studies that used better dating methods that clearly showed that Jericho had been destroyed long before the mythological Joshua would have come along and tried to take the city.



The controversy surrounding the alleged enslavement and exodus is not new. Sources dating back to 400 BCE already contained conflicting accounts of the Israelites' origins and supposed expulsion from Egypt because they were diseased (1). As early as 1100 CE, a church father noticed radical errors in the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible or ""Old Testament"") and concluded that Moses could not have written these accounts (2). Of course, the church, in the fine tradition of Christianity, threatened to kill this man if he did not retract this finding.



Recently, the archeologists Israel Finkelstein (Tel Aviv University) and Neil Asher Silberman (director of historical interpretation, Ename Center for Public Archeology and Heritage Presentation, Belgium) summarized the archeological findings and latest corrections regarding the historical origins of the Jewish nation. In their words, ""The process that we describe here is, in fact, the opposite of what we have in the Bible: the emergence of early Israel was an outcome of the collapse of the Canaanite culture, not its cause. And most of the Israelites did not come from outside Canaan - they emerged from within it. There was no mass exodus from Egypt. There was no violent conquest of Canaan"" (3).



Finkelstein and Silberman point out that there is still no evidence for the existence of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Lot, Moses, and Joshua. There is no evidence that Jewish people existed as an identified people that were enslaved in Egypt. There is no evidence that over 600,000 men (plus women and children - the number could have been over a million) had an exodus from Egypt and wandered in the desert for 40 years. According to the Bible, 38 of these 40 years were actually spent encamped at Kadesh-barnea. This area has been turned upside down for decades, looking for even a tiny piece of pottery from this supposed time. It is not likely that this many people would have lived here this long and not left archeological evidence.



The archeological evidence contradicts the Biblical theme of Joshua taking control of the Israelites from Moses and conquering Canaan. For example, the Egyptians had a strong presence in Canaan at this time, yet the Biblical accounts make no mention of this. The story of Joshua sweeping through Canaan, conquering three cities is refuted by the archaeological evidence that these cities were destroyed over a 1000 year period and that Jericho was destroyed even before Joshua could have conquered it.  The Biblical themes of the origins of Israel are myths. Like the gospel accounts of the New Testament, they were fabricated in later times and inserted into earlier times as a tool of religious and political propagandists (2, 4, 5).



One thing is certain. If a god existed, it could not be the god of the Bible or any religion claiming origins from the Bible. Any self-respecting god of average wisdom would not want to be held responsible for inspiring such a collection of myths and ridiculous sayings.



You may also want to review the [NOVA 2-hour program](http://video.pbs.org/video/1051895565/) aired on 11/18/2008 on the lack of evidence for the Exodus and the origins of the Hebrew Bible on the pbs.org site. It caused quite a stir. Someone recently informed me that Gerald Aardsma is still attempting to revise Biblical chronology. Scholars have not taken his work seriously. The scientific community has yet to find support for his beliefs in Noah’s Ark/the Flood, the Exodus, creationism, etc. The study of genetics has clearly disproven the Adam and Eve myth.

I'm talking about the *existence* of atheists, the atheists themselves rather than their actions.  A couple of recent events have indicated that many people think that this is indeed the case.  A bus ad reading simply ""Atheists"" [has been rejected](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2012/03/21/bus-company-again-rejects-ad-reading-simply-atheists/), first because the bus company doesn't “accept ads which could be deemed controversial or otherwise spark public debate.”  So apparently, in their judgement, even when not expressing a message at all, the word ""atheists"" is controversial.  They confirmed their decision, saying “We will not allow our transit vehicles or property to become a public forum for the debate and discussion of public issues...""  Simply saying the word “Atheists” is apparently a discussion and debate just by itself.  Side note: the company is perfectly willing to run ""God Bless America"" on their bus tickers.

Secondly, and more directly related to offense taken by Christians, is an ad that the Dallas-Fort Worth Coalition of Reason has been trying to run in theaters before movies.  The ad was first accepted, and then Christian customers complained that it was offensive, and so it was rejected.  Then another theater picked it up, and Christian customers were offended, and [it was rejected again](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2012/04/06/atheist-family-ad-rejected-by-texas-movie-theater-again/).  What is so offensive about noting that happy, diverse families who do not believe in god *exist*?  The ads are not in fact anti-religious, they are not critical of religion in any way, they don't even mention atheism.

I'd probably separate the books under various headings like this (just an example):

**Atheist**  
God is Not Great  
End of Faith  

**Christian**  
The Bible  
Reasonable Faith
The World of Jesus and the Early Church  

**Philosophy**  
Consciousness Explained  
Philosophy of Mind

And so on and so forth. What I'd love to see from the folks in here is a list of the books they'd like to see referenced. Ideally, we'd have a great selection of must-reads from every point of view and, if possible, reads from a contrasting point of view (if we have a book that argues that there is historical evidence for a divine Jesus, we would also have a book by someone like Ehrman that argues there is not enough evidence to claim Jesus was divine, for example). 

I can probably pick a decent selection of books that argue against a theist view, but I'm quite certain that I wouldn't be able to represent other points of view that well (thus the post asking for your help). What I'd really like is your *must read* books along with links to somewhere to read and/or purchase those must reads. I'd like them, obviously, to relate to the topics we find in here. They do not have to be books or even all that long. I'd personally prefer the reading list to be representative of expert opinions, but I'm sure we can decide what should and shouldn't go on the list as we go. I'm leaning away from including blog links or links to youtube vids for the sake of brevity, but maybe a selection of some very excellent ones would be good.

My goal is to help everyone be more well read on the subjects we're debating. I know there are a ton of things I need to read up on and understand better and I assume many people in here feel the same. I think the quality of our debates in here would go up if people were well read on their own points of view as well as the points of view of others. Also, I want people to challenge their beliefs. Christians, will you read Ehrman with an open mind? Atheists will you read William Lane Craig or Craig Evans with an open mind? Dualists, will you read Dennett with an open mind? Monists/elminitivists will you read Fesser with an open mind?

So I'm hoping there are more Christians here who do believe in demonic possession...

I was reading the bible and it seems like one of the symptoms of being possessed by a demon or Satan is turning away from God. For example, in Luke 22:3, when Satan possessed Judas, he started to plot against Jesus. Also in 1 Timothy 4:1–5, Paul states that people who were Christians then turned away are now devoting themselves to demons. 

Does this mean that atheists might be actually be possessed by demons? If that person is possessed, are they really responsible for becoming an atheist since Satan or a demon is feeding them lies?


**EDIT:** For full disclosure, when I told my parents I don't believe anymore, they became completely convinced I have been possessed by a demon.  Is there any way I can test if they are correct? And if they are mistaken, why do you think they are wrong?

Words have a lot of multiple meanings, and even here where we're pretty thoughtful about definition, there's still a large amount of baggage and confusion and assumption about many of the words that we use here.

 I propose that when posters wish to they may invoke a taboo within a thread, meaning one or more words are forbidden to be used, forcing everyone inside to actual explain what they mean instead of relying on what may be the unfounded meaning of loaded words.

For example: To Theists: Describe how the universe began. Taboos: God and its synonyms, creator, creation, intelligence.

To all: Describe what morality is. Taboos: Morality, right wrong, ought, should.

I think this may help skip past a lot of ""common sense"" to let us really examine those concepts that are so central to us that we take their definitions for granted.

So he sees all possibilities and what will be on a timeline that is not limited like our own.

Let's take these hypotheticals:

* Bob will finally give Christianity a chance when he's 80, and convert, and be saved. But Oh no! He gets hit by a car and dies an atheist at 50. To Hell he goes, forever.

* Mary is a 45-year-old Christian. If she were to live to age 50, she'd start to have doubts, and eventually lose her faith. But hey! She chokes on her dinner and dies today, as a Christian, so she goes to Heaven, forever!

I hope you see my point here. Why does whatever essence of ""us"" that we're judged on ""freeze"" at our moment of death, and hold *for eternity,* when it was just due to unfortunate (or fortunate) luck that we died when we did, and our exact same ""soul"" would have been elsewhere if we'd simply lived a few years longer on Earth? Why infinite punishment/reward for something so finite?

And I hope nobody gets pedantic and says, ""How do we know Bob would have converted at 80?"" That's beside the point. Surely conversions happen at old age for some people, and we'll assume for this argument that Bob would have been one of them, had he not died early.

Is there a line that should be drawn somewhere, even if not via any law but some kind of common courtesy agreement?

I think that it provides a beneficial service that CAN be used as a weapon but the intention is to be helpful. Ideally the world won't have a 'broken leg' and can walk without a crutch but I see the crutch as beneficial during the healing process.

I think about religion all the time, and while I don't believe in a deity, I think that religion serves a purpose that is rooted in the human condition. Human's  have a natural fear of the unknown, a need for meaning, and a craving for power. Even if you yourself don't individually subscribe to one of these points, these themes are evident through history and contemporary society. I believe that religion was the initial form of 'science', to explain the unexplainable and the original code of laws to create order in an orderless society. Archaic, yes, crude, yes, but evil? I would say no.

Religion has been used as a tool for power where, people who have been ""contacted by God"", state that religion demands someone pays a tithe to get into heaven, to kill others in order to reclaim the Holy Land , to oppress a class of society. It is easy to look at these and say, ""Religion is bad"". But what religion has also done is provide hope to those who have no alternative form of hope, to give people a reason to act benevolent to others, to create a commonality between classes that may have never been united otherwise. You can look at this and say ""Religion is good"". Religion has both positive and negative aspects to it but ultimately what it comes down to is that religion is a **tool**. And like any tool, it can be used for good and it can be used for evil depending on the **people** who use the tool. 

I think the people who say that violence is caused or influenced by video games are silly. Yes, video games may influence you to be violent but it is not the cause and the appropriate fix is not to ban video games. The problem lies within the people and culture around the individual. People who become religious neither become bigoted and hateful nor become loving and altruistic because of religion but rather the people around them that influence them.

What bothers me is that the topic of religion has become similar to sports where people choose one side over the other and bond over that side without thinking of the opposition. It's nice to have emotional support on an issue you feel strongly about but at the same time, this emotional response can cause an individual to abandon logic in order to support their own side. 

My plea is for people to look at both religion and atheism as a product of humanity and not something that is good or bad but something that just ***is***.

The whole story about God sacrificing his son seems to originate from a pretty anthropomorphic point of view. In the course of time, there were thousands of fathers, brothers and sons (and mothers, sister, daughters of course) sacrificing themselves for their families. 

The difference is, as opposed to those people sacrificing themselves for their families, with his direct line to God and all, Jesus knew for a fact that Heaven awaits him in the afterlife and that God exists. 

From God's point of view, couldn't he create a messiah every other week if he wanted? Obviously it was Gods plan to sacrifice Jesus from the beginning, God already knew that when bringing him into this world. Being God and all, he also knows that good things await Jesus in the afterlife, so he wouldn't really need to feel bad about it. 

To formulate my question in a different way: Who wouldn't sacrifice himself for his family or even other fellow human beings if you could be 100% sure there is such a thing as heaven and you'd get a straight entry ticket with your sacrifice?

That being said, I really have a hard time understanding why Christians seem to be obsessed with the sex lives of other people. The verses used to condemn gay people are always nestled in larger passages that include context that gets ignored willingly, or are modern translations of words that do not mean what we necessarily interpret them as meaning today. If you believe that being gay is a sin because of the Bible (I personally don't), why is it any worse than any other sin? Why do we have discussion and religious groups backing legislation against the ""sin"" of having a gay lifestyle and not other sins like, say, divorce or adultery (which is just as bad, according to the Bible).

Why do we beat this topic to death in the Christianity sub-reddit? There isn't thread upon thread about divorce, adultery, disobedience to your parents, kissing your wife when she's on her period, or in general, what your neighbors are doing in their bedrooms (heterosexual anal sex, BDSM, etc...)

Really, I've been trying to figure out for as long as I've considered myself a Christian why THIS issue is something Christians seem to obsess over. Again, even on this subreddit, the same questions about homosexuality are brought up again and again and discussed to death. Why are we SO into judging our neighbor for homosexuality, but nothing else? Should we be judging others at all for what they do in their private lives? Sin or not, why is it OUR business and wouldn't it be between them and God? Somebody else's homosexuality does not harm you in any way, so why does it constantly have to be discussed?

I realize by just asking this question, I'm bringing up a discussion, which is a bit ironic, but why can't Christians just butt out when it comes to the sexual orientation of their brothers and sisters? The Bible talks about many other ""sins"" and rules more than homosexuality that we never discuss, as a whole, so WHY is this issue cherry picked and shoved to the forefront as a major issue? Can't we just live and let live?

I apologize for the poorly written question (series of questions...) - feverishly banging this out at work! Oops! Back to my job now :)

EDIT: I was not just talking about gay marriage - I was speaking of gay people and their lives in general, though marriage is certainly part of life, I suppose!

EDIT 2: Just as a personal anecdote, my sister-in-law and her husband are extremely right wing fundamentalist Christian types. His sister is gay.  He will not allow his young children to have ANY interaction with her at all, ever, simply because she is gay.  In addition to marriage and using the bully pulpit to scream about homosexuality, THIS is the kind of crap I'm talking about. Obviously, he's extreme, but I don't think he's the only person like this out there. The rest of the family are a bunch of sinners - shoot, he's divorced and cheated on his wife before, but treats his sister like she's some kind of child molester who will corrupt his children just because she's gay.

**Established Premise:**

Often an argument begins with an established premise, that is an agreed upon notion that allows the argument to take place. This premise is not up for debate itself, it is just a ground for the debate to take place on. For example

    Is time travel ethical?

Would be a debate based on the premise that time travel is possible, whether or not *it is* is outside of the scope of the debate. 

**Established Context**

    If time lines are immutable and no matter your actions in the past you can't change the present, are all 
    your actions while time travelling through the past ethical?

This debate not only has the established premise that time travel is possible, but context that time lines are immutable. Whether or not time travel is possible or time lines are immutable is outside of the scope of this debate.

**Applying this to religious debate**

    Why would God damn people to hell?

The premise is God exists. This debate can not be won by refuting his existence. Although without context, different interpretations of God are possible.

    Why does the Christian God damn people to Hell?

The premise is the Christian God exists as he is described in the Christian bible, this is not up for debate. Rationale from other religions is irrelevant in this context. Also assumptions like *""God is just, therefore he won't send a good person who doesn't believe in him to Hell""* are incorrect based on the premise. The premise is that the Christian God as described in the Christian bible is *both* just *and* will send you to Hell. Whether or not both of these things are true is outside of the scope of the debate. 

[Edited: Corrected - thanks LiptonCB] Expect mostly answers quoting religious text, as you have asked a question to be justified within the scope of the Christian belief system.

**Wording your argument**

If you want to have a debate about a particular aspect of God then word your argument accordingly.

    If the Christian God damns good people to Hell, he is not just.

The premise is God's justice is debatable and the part of the bible that says he is just may be incorrect. This opens the floor to different views of what constitutes justice that are not restricted to the Christian belief system. 

[EDIT]: If you wish your argument to be the basis for debate on the topic of God's existence, then word your argument accordingly.

    The bible says God is just and loving, but he damns good people to hell for not worshipping him. This is 
    neither just nor loving. These indiscrepancies prove at the very least the Christian God doesn't exist as he 
    does in the bible and cast doubt on him existing at all.

There is no established premise on the existence of God. Therefore, in this debate the Christian God's nature and existence are debatable. The argument is not applicable to the gods of other religions. The definition of just and loving are debatable. Whether this constitutes proof is debatable.

**TL;DR**

Debate based on premise. If you disagree with the premise then view the debate as hypothetical or start a new debate about said premise rather than arguing outside the scope of the debate.

If we keep these things in mind, our debates will be a more fruitful learning experience and more engaging intellectual experience for all.

However unrelated to my creed, I've taken an introductory Cosmology class. I accept the idea of the Big Bang and evolution, however I am having difficulty understanding the logic of the beginning in the eyes of an atheist. 

As far as I understand (which isn't much) the smallest known 'unit' is the sub atomic particle (again, this could be wrong, please correct me if so). I know we have no definite answer to the question of beginnings, but isn't it believed that these subatomic particles suddenly (and still do) pop into existence, and caused a chain reaction that formed the Big Bang?

If so, I can only see a few possibilities for these sub atomic particles:

* They are capable of their own creation and caused the Big Bang

* They have always existed and caused the Big Bang.

* Something existed before the subatomic particle, but then again, it is the same argument: these either caused their own creation or existed eternally. 

Can anyone find a flaw in my understanding?

If not, then I cannot comprehend how these sub atomic particles can suddenly create themselves or be eternal. I don't understand how atheists deny the existence of God because these two features are illogical and impossible, yet argue that a natural 'matter' has the exact same properties. Verily, by definition of a God, he would be capable of existing eternally unlike a natural feature of our universe.

I have spoken about this to an Atheist friend (who is also ignorant in Cosmology) and his argument is only that something may have come before the subatomic particle causing the reason for it to pop into existence. Even still, the argument persists: is this unknown substance eternal or capable of creating itself?

Would it not be logical to commit suicide as a way to ‘fast track’ your way to oblivion?

My question is based on these premises:

• There is no governing supreme being

• Death is final

Summary of my thought process:

• Assured myself completely of my disbelief in a God after seeing the Hubble, Ultra Deep Field image.

• Enjoyed life more than ever following this realisation

• Still enjoy life

• Study philosophy at University, made me question deeper

• Started to subscribe to a nihilistic outlook on life

• Still subscribe to this

• Against the odds I still find the Universe a fun place to be for the most part.

• I arrive at my question

As far as I am concerned, the consequences of my actions only last as long as the people who remember them. This is the same for knowledge also – The knowledge I gain will be with me until I die and no longer.

If I live a happy life or a sad life, when I die I will be indifferent. I will not know or care about whether or not my life was good or bad.

An analogy I thought up...

You are given 3 wishes by a genie – instead of going through the troublesome act of choosing 3 wishes. You could just wish once, - ‘I wish that I was content and did not need or want to use my 2 other wishes’

– For me, the first wish is analogous to death as it leaves you in a state of voluntary oblivion when it comes to choosing wishes.

PS. I think it is important for me to state that I do see ‘oblivion’ as an attractive prospect. Although I think this, I don’t think I am suicidal in the traditional sense. I am happy.


EDIT: This Isn't supposed to be a conversation of the moral consequences of suicide.

1316960583.0,44,self.DebateReligion,kqume,Thoughts from the mods,59,15,440,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/kqume/thoughts_from_the_mods/,"TL;DR - are you kidding?  If you don't want to read anything longer than a sentence or two, why are you bothering with r/DebateReligion?

So, to answer the first question:  Yes, I have read the threads discussing adding a theist moderator.  I have purposefully avoided commenting in those threads so as not to influence the discussion.

Before I discuss my personal opinion on some of the things brought up, I want to share with you some observations.

Reported posts and comments:  Every report has been a comment made by (someone who appears to be) an atheist criticizing religious belief.  And yes, most of the reported comments are in the 'troll' category:  they are getting reports because they do not treat the idea of religious belief with the 'proper' decorum and respect.  My guess is that all those reporting are theists, though I don't have any actual data on that.   I do find it interesting that posts treating atheist ideas with derision and/or disrespect never seem to get reported.

Calls for a theist moderator:  No one has complained to the mods at all about the moderation.  No one has articulated a decent reason for a theist mod.  The only thing that keeps being said is something along the lines of it 'providing a sense of balance.'  When pressed, no one has any details on what they would expect a theist moderator to fix.

Now, on to my thoughts/opinions:

The issues that HAVE been raised:  I'll start with the claim that a theist mod will make theists feel more welcome and increase the amount of activity theists contribute:  the only way they could so is to take a very active role by removing posts that in their opinion are unfairly critical to theist ideas.  There's an obvious problem here:  how can you enforce this nebulous idea of 'respect' for theistic thought without practicing censorship against atheistic thought?

Why don't theists post more?  Well, many of the comments others have made agree with my thoughts on the issue:  They don't have any real answers, reason, logic, or even consistency.  Theists cannot stomach dissenting thought.  They simply have no answers that don't sound stupid with more than 30 seconds of intelligent thought.

Now, I have said more than once that I refuse to practice censorship.  If you want to call atheists poopyheaded bigots, and it gets reported, I will not delete the comment.  If you want to call theists lame-brained morons with no capacity for freedom of thought, I will not delete the comment.  As long as the comment is on topic and is not spam, I'm going to allow it.  My position as moderator does not give me the right to silence any side of the debate.  I am not the 'tone police'.  I am not here to enforce any kind of 'rules of polite conversation.'  I find the very idea revolting and antithetical to open debate and discussion.

The idea was that not having downvotes in this sub would encourage more theists to participate in the discussion.  However, removing the downvote buttons has taken from the community the means for it to police itself.  While I agree with some of the arguments made for removing the downvote buttons, I feel it's a mistake.  Further, I think the fact that the objective (encouraging theists to participate) is not being met (even though we have capitulated with their demand that theists not have to face any consequence for making bad arguments) demonstrates that disabling the best tool for the community to police itself is a mistake.

And now that they have that, and still are not able to win an argument, or even get the 'proper' respect they feel they deserve for their foolish ideas, they are demanding that someone who agrees with them be given power to use force (censorship) to ensure they get the respect they feel (wrongly, in my opinion) their opinion deserves.

Now, while it may seem I am being rather harsh when discussing this, please understand:  I'd have the same opinion of atheists asking for protection for their own ideas from so-called disrespect and criticism.  

Ideas DO NOT **deserve** respect.  PERIOD.  Ideas are given the respect that is earned by their character.  If *you* feel an idea warrants respect, then **you choose** to treat it with respect.  That doesn't mean **anyone** else is **required** to offer that idea any respect.

Now, *people* deserve a minimum level of respect.  That minimum level of respect (in my mind) is that you allow them the freedom to have their own ideas, and to express them.  Beyond giving them the opportunity to present their idea, (because that is the respect due a person) you do not owe **the idea** any respect.  You do not have to listen, you do not have to read it, you do not have to do anything but allow them the same right you have to present it.

If you have wrapped your ego so tightly into an idea that any criticism of that idea (no matter what the tone) feels like an attack on you personally that is **your** problem.  Offense cannot be *given*, only *taken.*

Now, to sum up:  I do not feel that we need a theist mod.  I personally don't feel we need **any** more mods.  There just isn't enough traffic to require more moderation.  (pconwell added lanemik today purely for help with the CSS and flair.)

For the most part, I'm the only one who does any of the non-CSS mod stuff:  checking spam and reports, approving or removing posts.  There really isn't very much, and I almost ALWAYS approve posts that have been reported or have been caught in the spam filter.

My guideline is pretty simple:  always error on the side of freedom of expression.  I would rather be wrong by letting someone speak, than be wrong about silencing someone.

So, I'm not going to continue belaboring my point:  I will not be seeking out a theist mod at this time. (If ever.)  If you disagree with any of the moderation, send a message to the mods, or make a post about it so the community can discuss it.",,False,,t5_2snuc,False,,mod,True,t3_kqume,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/kqume/thoughts_from_the_mods/,moderator

Anti-Theism and Anti-Clericalism has produced plenty of killings through history, specially after the enlightenment period.  A number of these examples would be the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror, Spanish Revolution by part of the Republicans, October Revolution (Russia) and the communist rules afterwards.  

Clearly the motives to kill the clerics were there association with power during the French Revolution, but we must keep in conscience that this is one of the major critics that we anti-clericalists present against religion. 
 For the Spanish and Soviet revolution, to say that these were not under the name of anti-theism but under under the name of communism, would be a clearly misinformed statement, for it completely ignores why the communist are opposed to religion.  Karl Marx was against it for it is used as manipulation by the powerful and rich to maintain the people calm and submissive. They considered religion to be seen as negative for human development.   These views are clearly anti-theistic, for their own reasons.  
For the Spanish Revolution, Mikhail Bakunin was also an influence if I am not mistaken.  Bakunin, an anarchist, was also a clear anti-theist. Bakunin argued that ""the idea of God implies the abdication of human reason and justice; it is the most decisive negation of human liberty, and necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind, in theory and practice."" Consequently, Bakunin reversed Voltaire's famous aphorism that if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent Him, writing instead that ""if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish Him"".

I also see many of the same people recommend books by Craig because they feel he has some of the best arguments for Christianity. Here is what I know about Craig: 

1. Craig states that evolution and the Bible are compatible and that creationism is not necessarily true. However, in none of these did he directly accept anything. 
2. Craig states that ID is an alternative to evolution ([source](http://www.apologetics315.com/2009/11/william-lane-craig-vs-francisco-j-ayala.html)).
3. [Craig states that evolution could not have happened naturally](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9h-hmlMz5c). This is a blatant rejection of science, it is akin to saying ""It is a fact of physics that planets can not naturally orbit around the sun and therefore require God. (as proof I have two biologists throwing really big numbers around).""
4. Craig is a fellow at the [Discovery Institute](http://www.discovery.org/csc/fellows.php) and [ISCID](http://www.iscid.org/fellows.php). As most probably know DI was one of the main players behind the modern ID movement and they came up with the ""teach the controversy"" nonsense. 

So what we have is a vague statement saying he might be accepting of evolution, a flat out rejection of natural evolution and significant involvement with known pseudo-scientific organizations. His statements and actions seem inconsistent on at least two levels. On one hand he says that evolution is compatible with the Bible, then he claims that evolution could never have happened without God, then we see him involved with the intellectually dishonest nutcases who are trying to get ID into schools. 

I'd also note that pinning Craig down as believing anything can be a challenge. He has been known to take whatever stance gets him past the point at hand. [Here is an example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePc2tHtxC-k).

With that said, why all the respect for this guy? I can understand getting behind CS Lewis as one of the best defenders of the faith as he was well spoken and consistent in how he saw the world.

Based on my conversations in this [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/171jiy/to_all_science_cant_be_used_to_answer/), I’m not so sure that’s true. Here are two cases where it looks like agnostic atheists are actually making a claim: 

1. Several people expressed confidence that the specific, claimed gods of modern religions do not exist. (Although they allowed for the possibility of some god of another description to possibly exist.) These people do seem to be asserting a claim that certain gods do not exist. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/17lvin/to_atheists_santa_and_god/c86pemy) is an example (although I’m not sure if that poster would describe him-/herself as “agnostic” atheist).

2. And others said they were not absolutely certain, but had **some degree of certainty**, that god(s) do(es) not exist. Some people argued that because they’re not **certain**, they’re not making a claim. But that doesn’t make sense to me. Even if you express some degree of certainty, you’re making a claim. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/171jiy/to_all_science_cant_be_used_to_answer/c820s7n?context=4) was my response on that point (the person I’m responding to had just insulted my grasp of epistemology):

&gt;Really? So when climate scientists at IPCC assign percentages to how certain they are about their conclusions (e.g., “very high confidence” = 90% certain), what they really mean is: “We don’t know if climate change is going to happen. We’re not making a claim about climate change.” ?

I think many agnostic atheists **do** actually make claims about god’s (or gods’) existence. When they do, they need to argue for those claims rather than evading that responsibility by asserting the ""burden of proof"" is on theists. Alternatively, they can take the position which truly makes no claims about god/s existence, that of pure agnosticism: “I do not know if god exists one way or the other, and I express no degree of certainty about atheism or theism.” (As an aside, I dislike the four dimensional model of a/gnostic a/theist because it excludes this position.)",,False,,t5_2snuc,False,,,True,t3_18r85w,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/18r85w/to_atheists_i_think_some_of_you_are_making_a_claim/,

I contend that this is fairly easy to do because when you reduce everything into a couple nice catchphrases you end up making a statement that is hard to attack.

I would compare it to a salesman who comes up to you and wants to sell you aluminum siding, he opens his pitch with ""Aluminum siding is great.  Don't you want to save money and protect the environment?"" This is actually the kind of language that you're taught in most sales jobs.  The idea is to phrase things so that objections seem absurd.  What, you don't want to save money and protect the environment?

Similary you're not going to see a lot of people object to mercy, compassion, and forgiveness.  I'm sure we can even dig up some examples where the bible supports all of that.  But the problem comes down to that these buzzwords simply don't have any meaning to them until you flesh out how they're to be followed, at what cost, and to what extent.

An easy [example](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:38-42&amp;version=NIV) comes from the sermon on the mount in which Jesus seems to be instructing us to reward anyone who sues us with more than they ask and to lend to anyone.  If this isn't hyperbole (and I see no reason to think it is hyperbole), then this is completely awful advice and a quick way to depart from your material wealth.

The conclusion I get from all of this is that it's too easy to paint things nice and rosy with buzzwords but when it comes down to real decision making, we have to look past said buzzwords and actually reason these things out.

I suppose that was only part of the point I was getting at. If we are to believe on more than just faith alone, and God acknowledges that we should be given *some* amount of evidence in order to believe in him, why not just give us enough evidence to convince everyone?

If God is omniscient, he would know with 100% certainty, down to the last digit, how many believers he'd have at any given point in time as a result of whatever evidence he chooses to give us. Therefore, if he gives us limited evidence, he is directly deciding how many believers will result, and hides from the rest, denying them the evidence he knows they'd require in order to believe.

So, what's the point? Why not convince everyone that he is real, then let us decide to follow or defy him? Wouldn't that be a better example of ""free will""?

Don't you have 'faith' that your senses are accurate?"" and so on responses.  But I think we know what is meant in the context of religion, when one says ""I believe it not because I have evidence, but because I have faith.""  It's nuanced, it's subtle, and yet we know what we're talking about.

The problem is, I don't think *anyone* really means it.  Even the most faithful of the faithful recognizes the power of evidence, and craves it to justify their beliefs.  The ""leap of faith"" is an absolute fiction.  It is most often Christians, at least in my experience, who appeal to faith as a justification for their beliefs, and yet there are constant betrayals of this declaration.  What are supposedly fulfilled prophecies if not *evidence* that one's belief is justified?  Why make *new* prophecies if it is not a key component of the belief system that evidence for its truth will be provided in the future?  And what of miracles?  If belief were truly based in faith, then the apostles would not have had to *prove* their veracity by appealing to the miracles they could perform, and Jesus would not have had to *do* anything amazing to be accepted as the son of god.  And for that matter, go back to the Hebrew Bible, and witness the many times in which god *showed* his power, to prove with clear evidence that Yahweh's commands should be followed, or to demonstrate that a given prophet was actually favored by god.  Islam is much the same, with prophecies fulfilled, prophecies made, and even (incorrect, but still presented) claims that *clearly* the Koran is the word of Allah because it describes embryology in detail.

At every turn, the religious reach for evidence to justify their beliefs.  If the Shroud of Turin, rather than being determined to be a forgery, had *actually* been reliably dated to around 29 or 30 CE, and shown to be consistent with the cloth workings of the region, and so on, what Christian would have simply turned away in disinterest, knowing that their beliefs were not based on crude evidence that the stories were true, but rather on faith?  What Jew would not feel justified in the truth of their beliefs if *Raiders of the Lost Ark* were a documentary?  Without question, the Raëlians think there *is* evidence for their beliefs, as do all the other people who promote ideas of intelligent design.  And the tradition goes back as far as we might care to look.  When accusing women of witchcraft, it wasn't just any old woman who was accused.  No, they had to *look* like witches.  If a man became convinced that the cats making noise near his home were witches, and went out and injured one, the old woman you accused had to be one with a similar injury.

It is an incredibly rare person who denies the utility of evidence for supporting belief.  We all seem to not only know that evidence is powerful, we seek it out whenever we can, and will use even the flimsiest of evidence to support our preferred beliefs.  Only when there is *no* evidence to be had do some of us fall back on faith as a justification, and even then the slightest intimation that there *is* evidence will be grasped at hungrily; observe Jesus' image on toast or water stains or snack food.  Observe [Sanal Edamaruku](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2012/07/05/indian-rationalist-still-in-hiding-after-debunking-miracle/), who showed that a ""miracle"" of a statue of the crucifixion dripping water from its feet was the result of a leaky sewage drainage system, and is now in hiding because the Catholic church wants him *arrested* for breaking the spell of their delusions.  There is no ""leap of faith"", because the faithful admit almost constantly that evidence-based justification is not across some chasm, but kept quite comfortably within reach.  There are no ""separate magisteria"", for no believer would ignore the situation if empirical science showed support for their religion.  Faith has no utility to justify belief, and even those who try to use it as such know this.

TL;DR - Not even those who try to use faith to justify their beliefs think that faith actually *works* as a belief justification.  They appeal to evidence constantly, and always have, as their own holy books attest.  They will accept even flimsy, terrible evidence if they think it supports their beliefs, because even that provides (or seems to) a stronger justification than faith.  Faith is useless for belief justification, and we all know it.",,False,,t5_2snuc,1341505879.0,,,True,t3_w2yr3,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/w2yr3/to_all_the_uselessness_of_faith/,

So a Moderate Christian (username is coolcrate) says:
I'm an episcopalian and I really get annoyed when I see post after post about how bad, hypocritical or just generally stupid athiests think Christians are, and some just because we believe in Jesus Christ. I understand that some Christians are hypocritical and some say hateful things about other religions and atheists. I personally think that anyone and everyone has a right to believe whatever they want to, and shouldn't be discriminated against for what they believe. I'm not saying that people who are christians are innocent in this case, I'm just saying not all of us are bad. I just think it's very annoying how much anti-christian posts are on r/atheism. I know you don't believe in any god, but what is so wrong about believing? I understand that some things in the Bible are radical and unnecessary in todays world. I personally believe members of the homosexual community should have as much rights as anyone else in America. I may not agree with the whole bible, but I do believe in Jesus Christ. While I would never try to force you to join my religion, I might have a friendly debate on beliefs, which the posts from r/atheism never have. I just want the hate posts about Christianity to stop. 

Atheist response: You've just demonstrated why I can't respect your belief system and what is wrong with this belief. And let me be clear, I wouldn't discriminate against anyone/lose respect simply because we disagree. Explanation: The bible will often tell you what to believe, what to do, how to live, etc. When you say, ""I understand some things in the Bible are radical and unnecessary,"" you admit to rejecting areas of the bible based on some other, contradictory source of values/morals, e.g. accepting gays. And I assume you wear mixed-fabric clothing, reject slavery, support women's rights, reject capital punishment for silly ""sins,"" etc. But why do you call these parts radical or unnecessary (and these parts are in the old and new testament btw)? How is it that an all-knowing, all-powerful god dictated the writing of a book that lost so much relevance in what's basically a fraction of a blink of an eye in history? I reject these parts because I know better. This isn't the work of a morally profound god. And judging by your thoughts on gays, you know that too. But this also applies to Jesus. It's actually not easy to find support for Jesus' existence, let alone his godliness. His best ""evidence"" is the bible. But if I know better than to rely on the bible for some basic rules, what am I doing relying on it for the most unbelievable part of all? Answer, I don't. I'm honest about the fact that I don't accept God's word - I judge it. But what do you do? Because when you reject certain parts of the bible on your own, and accept other parts, it sounds like you can't say anymore than, ""I accept Jesus because I like how that part sounds."" And that's what's so wrong about believing. It's a mixture of dishonestly, ignorance and silliness. That's your right, sure. But it's still dishonest, ignorant and silly. 

UPDATE: From the comments author (Mexihanz6):

A lot of you missed my point entirely (here’s looking at you, gregorwogdog).  I certainly don't respect fundamentalists for their fundamentalism.  I think an unwillingness to change ones mind under any circumstances is a pretty good sign of unreasonableness, and isn't something to be respected.  I also recognize the vast majority of Christians are moderate Christians, and I'd rather have them running around than Jesus Campers, evangelicals and Westboro.  But my response doesn’t even address problems with fundamentalism, because that wasn’t the issue.  Now, to explain my response... I think it's a pretty fair statement to say the source for the Christian religion is the bible.  The bible contains passages in both the old and new testament that reasonable people, including moderate Christians like coolcrate, wholly reject.  Coolcrate then asks, what's so wrong with believing?  THAT is what I answered.    The problem with believing in Jesus while rejecting parts of both the old and new testament is that you admit you have a bad basis for accepting Jesus.  It simply doesn't make sense to say, ""Jesus is God, and I have faith in this because the bible says so, but the parts about not cutting hair, covering my head, giving away my wealth, not eating unclean animals, etc., those parts aren't to be taken so seriously.""  Why dismiss the disagreeable parts and then accept the parts about virgin birth, death and resurrection, revelation, heaven and hell?  Answer: There really isn’t a good reason.  And that’s the problem with Coolcrate’s belief.  Coolcrate is either being dishonest about what he/she is doing (admitting he/she rejects the source of his/her belief, but believing anyway) or is ignorant of the fact that he/she is doing this.  That doesn’t mean there is no middle ground Christianity; it means the middle ground contains some inconsistencies that aren’t being addressed.

One debate tactic we've all witnessed in this subreddit is the argument from solipsism. Basically, it goes like this:

*Atheists make baseless assumptions, too. The assumption that our senses are providing more-or-less accurate information about our world is a baseless one. So there's nothing any less valid about theistic assumptions -- i.e., faith -- than atheistic ones.*

If I see that argument again, I will claw my eyes out. I really will.

The problem with it is two-fold. First, solipsism itself is a fundamentally useless position. Without the assumption that our senses are functional, we can't even be sure we're debating with anyone, and that applies equally to theists and atheists.

But that's not even the worst part. Consider the following questions:

* How do you know you've ever read your holy book?
* How do you know you've ever listened to a religious instructor?
* How do you know you've ever talked to anyone about your religion?
* How do you know you've ever received any valid information about your religion through your senses in any way, shape, or form?

When you make an argument from solipsism, it damages the case for theism far more than it damages the case against it. Atheists make one layer of assumption about our senses. Theists have an additional layer of assumption; after the assumption that their senses have fed them information about their religions, they must then assume that the information is true, without any sensory corroboration.

That is, unless you think your understanding of your particular religion was divinely imparted to you by God through a means other than your senses. And not only don't I know anyone who thinks that, I'm pretty sure that believing God taught you your religious beliefs is a good reason to seek the help of mental health professionals.

by

William K. Clifford

Above you can find the full article (its not that long) but I will quote some highlights. 

&gt;And no one man's belief is in any case a private matter which concerns himself alone. Our lives are guided by that general conception of the course of things which has been created by society for social purposes. Our words, our phrases, our forms and processes and modes of thought, are common property, fashioned and perfected from age to age

&gt;[N]o belief held by one man, however seemingly trivial the belief, and however obscure the believer, is ever actually insignificant or without its effect on the fate of mankind.... Belief, that sacred faculty which prompts the decisions of our will, and knits into harmonious working all the compacted energies of our being, is ours not for ourselves but for humanity. It is rightly used on truths which have been established by long experience and waiting toil, and which have stood in the fierce light of free and fearless questioning.

&gt;If a man, holding a belief which he was taught in childhood or persuaded of afterwards, keeps down and pushes away any doubts which arise about it in his mind, purposely avoids the reading of books and the company of men that call into question or discuss it, and regards as impious those questions which cannot easily be asked without disturbing it -- the life of that man is one long sin against mankind....

&gt;""But,"" says one, ""I am a busy man; I have no time for the long course of study which would be necessary to make me in any degree a competent judge of certain questions, or even able to understand the nature of the arguments."" 

&gt;Then he should have no time to believe.

I would like to hear everyones thoughts on the ethics of belief.  Is it wrong, immoral, bad (however you want to phrase it) to harbor beliefs that you are not willing to challenge?

It doesn't matter how much you want something to be true. It doesn't matter how ugly or awful an idea is, if it's true then that's how it is.

Religions almost always seem to be incredibly human-centric. In the Abrahamic religions, God created the world (and perhaps the entire universe, depending on one's interpretation) just for us. Morals are handed down by the creator of the universe as a code to live by. I'm less conversant in other religions, but they seem similar. Karma ties our fate to the goodness of our behavior, god or the gods are perpetually granting humans favor or disfavor, etc.

Compare this to the typical atheist viewpoint: we are ape-descended life forms on an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of a completely unremarkable galaxy which is just one of about a hundred billion known to exist, in a universe which is cold, uncaring, completely indifferent to human life, and literally unimaginably vast. Concepts like morality are just a result of evolutionary pressure and the advantages of cooperation, retaliation, conformity, etc.

So, why aren't there religions with this attitude? Or, do they exist and I don't know about them? It seems like a weird qualitative gulf. Does the concept of religion inherently involve not only supernatural elements but ones which are directly involved in our lives?

It seems to me that the ancient Greek religion(s?) somewhat approached this. The gods did their thing and didn't care too much about humans, except when they enjoyed screwing with us.

A fictional example might be the various cults from the Cthulhu mythos. There, you have humans worshipping entities far beyond them who mostly don't care about humans and have more important stuff to worry about. Humanity isn't special and the universe mostly fits the idea of being huge, cold, and indifferent.

In short, religion generally seems to place a weird emphasis on humanity even though, by all appearances, the universe does't care about us at all.

1364225443.0,39,self.DebateReligion,1az6uw,To theists: Argument against both versions of omnipotence,51,12,156,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1az6uw/to_theists_argument_against_both_versions_of/,"One of the things that keeps coming up is the 3-O god's attributes, specifically omnipotence. A common response to claims that omnipotence is self-refuting is that atheists are operating off of a flawed definition of omnipotence.

So I would like to propose here that both versions of it entail problems for theism.

---
Version 1: True omnipotence 
---
---

**Definition**: Princeton's WordNet search gives a simple, clear-cut definition of omnipotence as ""having unlimited power.""

I don't think many theists disagree that this version of omnipotence is problematically self-refuting. When atheists ask questions like ""can God create a rock so heavy even he can't lift it,"" this is the version of omnipotence that they're attacking. And make no mistake, such questions are effective, because they show that this definition of omnipotence is both simplistic and logically flawed. A ""yes"" answer yields a god who can do logically impossible things, refuting logic itself, and a ""no"" answer yields a god who is limited after all.

So it is perfectly sensible for theists to use a different definition of omnipotence. However, that version suffers from other serious flaws.

We will call this version ""omnipotence(a).""

---
Version 2: Logically possible omnipotence
---
---

**Definition**: Roughly, ""having the power to perform any logically possible and non-contradictory or self-defeating act."" This version of omnipotence explicitly excludes logically impossible acts, like creating square circles, married bachelors, or rocks so heavy that God can't lift them.

We will call this version ""omnipotence(b).""

This is the version of omnipotence I would like to focus on for the purpose of this argument, since we are all largely in agreement that ""true omnipotence"" is a flawed concept.

So walk through this with me.

---
The argument
---
---

**Argument definitions**:

* (Definition) ""Everything"" is defined as all matter, all space, all time, all natural laws described by physics, all logic, all reason, and any other philosophically recognizable real or abstract object.
* (Definition) An ""omnipotent(a) being"" is one that is capable of logically impossible acts.
* (Definition) An ""omnipotent(b) being"" is one that is capable of any logically possible act. Conversely, such a being is **not** capable of any logically impossible act.

**Argument**:

* (Premise 1) God is an omnipotent(b) being.
* (Premise 2) God created everything.
* (Premise 3) God is not subservient to anything.
* (Conclusion 1) Per P2, God created the rules of logic that restrict his power to the logically possible.
* (Conclusion 2) Per P3, God is not actually restricted by the rules of logic that restrict his power to the logically possible. He can rescind them at will.
* (Conclusion 3) Therefore, God is actually an omnipotent(a) being.

---
Predicted criticism
---
---

I doubt most theists will contest *P1*, as that is the version of omnipotence they want to use. But *P2* is difficult to attack, because if God did not create everything, then something -- namely, logic -- precedes him. And *P3* is even more difficult to attack, because if God is subservient to anything, then there is something greater than God.

*C1* is entailed by *P2* and is unavoidable unless you exclude logic from the definition of ""everything,"" which is an untenable answer unless you make logic part of God, which carries with it a whole raft of other problems. *C2* is entailed by *P3* and is similarly unavoidable unless, again, you exclude logic from the definition of ""everything.""

Furthermore, if you counter *C1* and *C2* this way, you have God's behavior restricted by his own nature, and end up with a regressive loop wherein God cannot change his own nature, but must somewhere be restricted from doing so from outside himself. It looks something like this:

1. **Q**: Can God change his nature?
2. **A**: No, his nature prevents it.
3. **Q**: Can God change the rule that his nature prevents it?
4. **A**: No, his nature prevents it.
5. **Q**: Can God change *that* rule?
6. *Etc., etc., etc., ad infinitum*.

It's a vicious logical regress solvable only by excluding God from logic... which brings us back to omnipotence(a).

---
Conclusion
---
---

I propose that what we've seen here is a problem entailed by omnipotence(b) applied to the creator of everything. God can either create everything **including** logic, possess omnipotence(a), and be susceptible to ""heavy rock"" style questions, or he can create everything **excluding** logic, possess omnipotence(b), and be susceptible to ""who created God/who created restrictions on God"" style questions.

You can work harder to try and convince me, or you can ignore my right to self-determination and legislate over my head.

And when it comes to legislating the morality of a holy book, can Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, etc. claim to represent anything but a human authority?  You can spend all the time you like studying scripture and its history, but it is all ultimately predicated on the idea that someone's God came down and spoke (one way or another) to the authors of said scriptures.

But how is this *justice?*  How is justice served by the punishment of an innocent, even if that innocent volunteered?  I don't consider this to be in any way just; if an innocent person is punished for a crime they did not commit, however selfless they may have been in agreeing to take that punishment, **justice has not been served.**  Yet this appears to be the *core belief* of Christianity.  If I reject the validity of Josh's sacrifice, then there's not really any point to Christianity.

You often hear religious people say that belief in God is just a choice that is left up to us. This argument is commonly used when they are asked to provide evidence of their God. If God just reveals himself to us, then God is messing with our gift of freewill. But I believe they are confusing the proper application of freewill. The concept of freewill ought to refer only to choosing between doing the good or bad deed in a certain situation. However, you cannot apply freewill to belief, one cannot ""choose,"" to have knowledge of something (ie: Jesus is God.) Theists often confuse rejection of God with rejection in the *belief* in God, until humans have true knowledge of God and objective morality,  then they can be judged justly.  If that does not convince you, then I will show you the consequences of leaving belief in God up to choice.


There are many religions and supernatural versions of reality a human is disposed to. This human does not know the objective way to choose the right religion, he can only guess. This is where the problem lies: if the human does not have an objective basis on which to choose the right religion, then you start having [young women dedicating their life to prostitution because 'God' wills it of them](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GFaN9-1iz0),, [martyrdom for God](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks), the Indian caste system, human sacrifice to God, [conflict in ideologies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades) etc, and all of these evil acts are justified because of ""free will."" Similarly, if I use my freewill to believe that omniscient aliens on Pluto are sending me messages to crack open people's skulls to free them of a brain eating parasite, then I am not accountable to God because he is giving me the freewill to believe whatever I want to. Also because I *believe* that the aliens are omniscient and therefore moral in whatever they command. On the surface, leaving belief in God up to freewill sounds fine and dandy (choosing to the right way to salvation) but are ignorant to how badly it cuts the other way.


God not revealing himself to us is actually proof of his non-existence. If he is benevolent and cared about the human race, then he would not let humans make up their own morality and watch them be destroyed by it. He created his humans in a natural environment and knows that they are going to ponder the existentialism of the universe and also knows that they will give supernatural explanation for this curiosity. By not letting them in on what the what the true nature of the universe and it's existence is, he is responsible for every act committed for the supernatural's cause (for examples, see above.)  He is a source of evil and suffering and therefore not benevolent.

If 'virgin' had been intended (bethulah) could have been used instead (the ambiguous English word 'maiden' illustrates how easy it can be to slide between the two meanings). The 'mutation' occurred when the pre-Christian Greek translation known as the Septuagint rendered almah into ... (parthenos), which really does usually mean virgin. Matthew (not, of course, the Apostle and contemporary of Jesus, but the gospel-maker writing long afterwards), quoted Isaiah in what seems to be a derivative of the Septuagint version (all but two of the fifteen Greek words are identical) when he said Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, 'Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel' (Authorised English translation). It is widely accepted among Christian scholars that the story of the virgin birth of Jesus was a late interpolation, put in presumably by Greek-speaking disciples in order that the (mistranslated) prophecy should be seen to be fulfilled. Modern versions such as the New English Bible correctly give 'young woman' in Isaiah. They equally correctly leave 'virgin' in Matthew, since there they are translating from the Greek.""


ISAIAH' S REFERENCE: (Septuagint Version)


Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, Isaiah 7:14 has been interpreted to mean the person called Jesus Christ.


The facts are that, at the time when the Jewish nation was divided into Judah and Israel, the king of Syria joined with the king of Israel to make war against Ahaz, king of Judah. He and his people became alarmed.


Isaiah assures him in the 'name of the Lord' (the cant phrase of prophets) that the two kings will not succeed against him and delivers the words quoted above. In verse 16 he specifies the timing before this child shall know to refuse evil and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest (Syria and Israel) shall be forsaken of both her kings.


Perhaps Isaiah had someone already in mind for in the next chapter verse 2 he says I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son Jebereshiah and I went unto the prophetess and she conceived and bare a son.


Isaiah was proved false and Ahaz was defeated as related in the 28th chapter of Chronicles II.


If this is not enough evidence that early Christians tried to forge OT prophecy 'fulfillments'  in order convince Jews that Jesus was the Messiah; then what evidence would convince you? What evidence would convince you that Jesus of Nazareth was just a normal man and that his divinity was just added on by the early Christians? The virgin birth prophecy is one of the most important in the gospels, why would the holy spirit not protect it's integrity, further more, why would Jesus *expect* his logical and rational humans to still believe in him/not leave the belief when they gain access to this information?

A few entries later, the Blogger clarifies her husband did spend some time in jail, and later she let him return to her and her children's life in forgiveness. I cannot parse if more abuse has happened after the husband's jail time.

***

- Is Susan, the anonymous poster morally justified in contacting the police?

- A commenter, Elizabeth, tell Susan that ""you are WAY out of line!!!"" Does anyone agree with Elizabeth? Is her opinion clouded/justified by her religion?

- Is there any statistical evidence that religion will properly reform the Husband and he will not relapse? As the blogger Ponder Woman writes:

&gt;""Susan says about the past being the best indicator and predictor of future actions is absolutely true if Jesus is void of power to change a human heart and light out the blackness in a sinful, abusive soul.""

- Later Ponder Woman writes, 

&gt;""Susan, you have gone WAY out of line here. My children have NEVER been abused."" 

And yet a few comments away Ponder Woman also admits 

&gt;""...our daughter was with us through those dark years. Just because our children did not suffer abuse does not mean they were not affected through the abuse that happened in their parents marriage.""

Help me out here.,49,6,171,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/xdzcc/heres_the_thing_i_dont_get_about_christianity_and/,"There are so many views on the story of Christ; from Catholicism to the various forms of Christianity; Evangelical, Protestant, Lutheranism, Baptists, etc...  Not only that, but then the message changes from preacher to preacher depending on where you are.

My point being is that I find it incredibly odd that the story and message of one man changes so much; it's pretty much interpretive.  What I don't get is how someone can notice this and not think it's strange.  Let's compare this to science.  You have a textbook that different classes use (like the bible), and you've got different teachers (different pastors), and those teachers will have different lesson plans, projects, and homework assignments (pastors with different sermons, songs, and worship).  Here's where it gets different, no matter how you teach it, science doesn't change.  It is always out there, completely indifferent to what you learn in class, even if your teacher makes a mistake.  In religion, everyone has their own view on this confounding and complex subject.  If you ask a hard question, you can't just ""flip to the back of the book"".  A theist will answer you, but it starts with the following words ""I think..."".  Every time.

What is the one truth, the one way, that we can all agree on?  You have to do this and you have to avoid this to get into heaven.   Everyone has their own take on what they think it means, but that should have no effect on the actual outcome.

Personally, I'm an atheist for many reasons.  One thing I have is that if religion were real, shouldn't it be something amazing where you can go out into the world and learn about religion without having to use a book written hundreds of years ago?  If all the books in the world were destroyed, including science books, and everyone forgot everything and we had to start over, would religion come back the same way?  Would we even know who Christ was?  I can assert that we would not, and I'm sure something else would come about instead.  You can't say the same for science.  We wouldn't get it right the first time around probably, like last time, but in the end, we could get right back to where we are now by studying the world around us.

So, why doesn't this glaring bit of crazy stick out to theists?  I have my own ideas that revolve around people loving what religion does for them instead of loving the religion itself, causing them to justify their own ideas, mashing them like playdough to make it fit their own reality so they can continue accepting the religion in strong opposition to what the rest of world says is true (oh, suddenly this or that passage is a metaphor, or a parable, or not meant to be taken literally, or a miss-translation, or ""here's my interpretation that makes it kind of make sense"").  Think about how much the rules have changed over the years, evolving to stay current in a world that is ever expanding, with theists having to sink further and further into a delusional world of their own making so they can continue to be comforted by the security blanket that is God.

The culture of the earliest Israelite settlements is Canaanite, their cult objects are of the Canaanite god El, the pottery is in the local Canaanite tradition, and the alphabet is early Canaanite. Almost the sole marker distinguishing Israelite villages from Canaanite sites is an absence of pig bones.


**The Exodus story gives several clues to a late 7th , early 6th century authorship**

A. Israel’s alleged home in Egypt, ""the land of Goshen"" is a name derived from Geshem, a 5th century Qedarite royal family name, not Bronze Age Egypt.

B. The Exodus writer gives no name of any Pharaoh at the alleged time of Joseph or Moses. The Exodus author’s avoidance of king/pharaoh names suggests the objective is something less then an accounting of datable, historical fact.

C. The Exodus writer does name the ""Philistines"" stating God would ""not lead them through the land of the Philistines"" (Ex 13:17), but archaeologists have determined the Philistines did not begin to appear in Canaan until the late 13th century and did not establish themselves governmentally until the 10th century BCE.

D. The Exodus writer is ignorant of the Egyptian forts in northern Sinai or the Egyptian strongholds in Canaan, especially in the 15th to 13th century BCE when Egypt became the dominant power of Middle East.


**No signs of national chaos or collapse**

All of the dates put forward by advocates of the historicity of Exodus fail to correspond to any period of national weakness or chaos in Egypt, as would be expected by a series of disasters.


**Was An Exodus Even Possible in the Late Bronze Age 1550-1150 BCE or Time of Raamses II ?**

 The traditional Exodus date of 1447 BCE falls in the reign of Tuthmosis III or Amenophis II. Egypt’s hegemony throughout Canaan continued through the Late Bronze Age until challenged by The Sea Peoples invasion of the 10th century.

The 14th century el-Amarna 400 letters of the cuneiform archive found at Tell el-Armarna in Egypt describe in great detail social, religious, political, military, demographic conditions both within and between these nations. In addition 10,000 cuneiform tablets were found at Boghazkoy , Asia Minor. The letters and tablets make no mention of an ""Israel"".


The Merneptah stele (upright stone slab) dated 1207 BCE is the first mention of ""Israel"" found in Egypt describing Raamses II’ son, Pharaoh Merneptah’s campaign into Canaan in which a people named ""Israel"" were soundly defeated. Apart from this lone military encounter which in itself contradicts the Wilderness account, it seems incomprehensible that 2-3m Israelites could be unknown to literate people who seem to take note of all circumstances in their sphere of influence.

**No sign of the Israelites in the wilderness**

Modern archaeological techniques are no longer limited to trowels and brushes. Satellite imagery and ground-penetrating radar are just some of the sophisticated equipment utilized enabling archaeologists to trace even the most meager remains of hunter-gathers and pastoral nomads all over the world. Indeed, the archaeological records from the Sinai peninsula discloses evidence for pastoral activity in the 13 century BCE era and the Hellenistic and Byzantine periods.

In the case of Israel, the search is not for a ""needle in a haystack"". The bible documents the locations. The years of archaeological searching only affirms that (especially Christian)archaeologists anticipate being able to find artifacts from 2,000,000 Israelites. Yet, repeated surveys at Kadesh-Barnea where Israel spent 38 of its 40 years have not provided the slightest evidence of an Israelite encampment. Ezion-geber, a camping place of Israel has not produced a trace of evidence. Twenty years of intensive excavations at Tel Arad (Num 21:1-3) where Israel allegedly did battle with King Arad has provided no Late Bronze Age remains. Tel Hesbon, the site of Hesbon (Num21:21-35) where Israel allegedly did battle with the king of the Amorites provides no Bronze Age remains.


**Summary** 

The evidence for a largely indigenous origin of Israelites is overwhelming. The Exodus story was probably written five to seven hundred years after it was supposed to have happened. The Egyptians have virtually no records of the Israelites, none of the biblical plagues. There is no sign of national weakness or chaos in Egypt at the proposed dates of the disasters wrought by Yahweh. Egyptian records from the late Bronze Age and the reign of Raamses II contradict the Exodus account. No archeological evidence of 2-3m Israelites in the wilderness despite knowing the locations from the Bible.

All the above indicates that the exodus was not a historical event.

1.) Mom goes to heaven and is in paradise
2.) Her beloved son is tortured in hell forever and mom knows of this

The only way around this is that God has to do some pretty serious violence to Mom's knowledge, or even memory of her son.

* Both claimed to be messengers of god
* Both claimed to have revealed sacred scriptures via divine revelation
* Both claimed that their scriptures completed the Torah and the Gospels.
* Both scriptures contain both a confirmation of the Torah and Gospels, yet at the same time a completely new kind of theology.
* Both prophets are believed to have committed miracles, and people around them to have witnessed supernatural things.
* Both of them derived, from their claim to prophethood, a very high status and power among their followers.
* The followers of both prophets endured much hardship (migration among other things) in their names and showed a willingness to entrust their lives into the hands of these prophets.
* Both prophets claimed that their religion gave them the right to several wives and so took many wives. This and many other things have led non-mormons and non-muslims to think of them as immoral and as bad role-models. (This is not *my* claim, but it's something I often hear about both prophets)
* Mormons and Muslims of today point to the unlikelihood that anyone would have made up such amazing and awe-inspiring revelations on their own. Especially anyone of simple origins.

**An important smilarity**

I have heard several muslims state that when they read the Quran, they just *know* that it's the word of god. In fact, the Quran challenges anyone to write something of similar beauty and elloquence.

Mormons tend to display a similar self-confidence. The Book of Mormon invites us to pray to god with complete faith and with our entire hearts, and god will reveal to us that the book of mormon is true. Many mormons claim that they therefore *know* the thruth of mormonism.

There seems to be a moderate positive effect of religious involvement on health, even when possible confounding variables are controlled, and this link seems to be causal *(Ellison &amp; Levin 1998; Thoresen, Harris, &amp; Oman, 2001; Chatters, 2000; Levin, 1994; Levin &amp; Chatters, 1998)*. For example, frequent religious attendance is associated with an increase of 7 years in life span, which is roughly equivalent to the health benefit of not smoking. Religious people have significantly lower rates of cardiovascular disease *(Seeman, Dubin, &amp; Seeman, 2003; Levin &amp; Vanderpool, 1989)*, in older adults there are less problems with regard to stroke, cognitive decline and the like *(Maselko, Kubzansky, Kawachi, Staudenmayer, &amp; Berkman, 2006; Van Ness &amp; Kasl, 2003)*, and religious individuals are more positive about their own health status, recover more quickly from illness *(Koenig, George, &amp; Peterson, 1998; Daaleman, Perera, &amp; Studenski, 2004)*, and cope better with chronic pain *(Idler, 1995; Idler &amp; Kasl, 1997a, 1997b; Cohen &amp; Pressman, 2006; Kirby, Coleman, &amp; Daley, 2004)*.

Likewise, research has found a positive relationship between religiosity and mental health *(Larson et al., 1992; Koenig, Hays, et al., 1999; Hall &amp; Brokaw, 1995; Corveleyn, 1996; Koenig, 2001a; Rippentrop, Altmaier, Chen, Found, &amp; Keffala, 2005; Moberg, 2002a; Merrill &amp; Salazar, 2002)*. Attempts to find a negative relationship between religion and mental health have largely failed *(Newberg, Wintering, Morgan, &amp; Waldman, 2006)*. Some examples: religion seems to account for 5-7% of life satisfaction, which is similar to the effect of physical health *(van der Lans, 1996; Ellison, 1991; Levin &amp; Taylor, 1998)*. Religious people are 30-40% less likely than the average person to get an addiction disorder *(Koenig, 2001a; Plante &amp; Sharma, 2001; Hatchett, 1999; Strawser, Storch, Geffken, Killiany, &amp; Baumeister, 2004; Musick, Blazer, &amp; Hays, 2000)* and individuals who are not religious are 20-60% more likely to become depressed at some point *(Smith, McCullough, &amp; Poll, 2003; Koenig &amp; Larson, 2001; McCullough &amp; Larson, 1999; Eliassen, Taylor, &amp; Lloyd, 2005; cf. Kennedy, Kelman, Thomas, &amp; Chen, 1996)*.

These are some of the major findings - obviously if I dump everything the post will be too long and that doesn't foster discussion, but this is the basic gist.

The exact nature of the causal link is less clear and still being debated. But the general picture seems to be that religion fosters social support, relational harmony, spiritual support (the sense that God is supportive), promotes a healthy lifestyle, positive beliefs and emotions etc. For example, one model *(Levin 2003, 2001, pp. 71–72)* suggests that (1) religious commitment and identification promotes (2) healthy behaviors, social support practices, and beliefs, which then lead to (3) positive emotions and associated physiological effects.

One should not forget that these results are large group averages and won't be reflective of every single religious individual or group. Nonetheless, these averages do clearly show that the anti-theist Sigmund Freud was wrong to associate religion with pathology, instead of with mental and physical well-being.

1337358317.0,38,self.DebateReligion,ttfyn,To All: A long-winded clarification on what nihilism is.,49,11,151,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/ttfyn/to_all_a_longwinded_clarification_on_what/,"Yesterday, I started a whimsical discussion about how atheists should realize that they're also nihilists. The resulting deluge of commentary led me to realize that there are a lot of different understandings of what nihilism is. I'd like to attempt to describe it here.

Let's start with atheism, which is merely the lack of belief in the existence of a god. Expand that to encompass all concepts of supernatural intelligence or an original creator - none of that exists. Assume for a moment that the universe began as a natural event, occurring from merely the laws of physics and not from the will of any intelligent entity. Continuing on from that, it would follow that everything that happened after the creation of the universe is similarly borne of natural occurrences:

Stars form and die. Planets form. Life begins as an improbable-yet-natural occurrence. Life evolves. Organisms develop various abilities, including the ability that they refer to as ""thinking."" None the less, organisms simply contain nothing but atomic particles combined in complex structures and all of their experiences and feelings are the result of chemical, atomic and energy reactions.

Notice how, in this model, everything is simply the result of other things that happened before it, and it all started without agency.

Now let's look at the words ""meaning"" and ""purpose."" Both imply that there is a value that something is imbued with, intentionally, by an intelligence.

I'm not going to explicitly define intelligence here to anyone's satisfaction. I think we all have a good idea of what it means, though. The ability to think, to learn, to reason, to realize, to simulate, etc. The most important aspect of intelligence, however, is agency. That is, the thing that does the thinking is motivated by itself.

Now, here's the kicker: Because, at any one moment, our reality is nothing but the sum of all the events before that moment, and these events are subject to unintelligent laws of physics, it then follows that we are not intelligent, but rather we are experiencing the illusion of being intelligent. We lack the agency necessary to fulfill the requirements of intelligence. In turn this means that no intelligence actually exists.

In sum, it also means that no meaning or purpose exists.

**That realization... that reality... is nihilism.**

Now it's time for a nihilism FAQ:

Q: If there is no meaning or purpose, why don't you kill yourself?

A: This is a question that people ask because they think nihilism is an angsty/emo/depressive argument. It isn't. Nihilism is an observation of reality. There's no emotion or distress attached to it. Thus, I am capable of enjoying my life, even while knowing that there is no purpose to life.

Q: What motivates a nihilist?

A: We are still biological entities. Our bodies need food, comfort, pleasure, friends, etc. It's not like once you realize that there is no point to anything your body just shuts down. We've always been slaves to our biological urges. Even people who claim to have transcended them are still just listening to their biological urges, they've only convinced their selves that their urges come from another place.

Q: Why don't you adopt a purpose?

A: There is a distinction between objective and subjective purpose and meaning. I acknowledge that there is no objective meaning or purpose to anything. I also acknowledge that any subjective meaning or purpose that I assign to something is only valid within the scope of my own mind. In this way, I do have a purpose, but I do not think that this purpose is somehow more important than it is.

How do you justify this?,55,15,239,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/pxbp0/to_christians_i_can_make_a_very_strong_argument/,"*This was written in response to a different thread and my purpose changed to making a standalone post roughly halfway through the writing. I also had to heavily edit it to get it under the character limit. As a consequence of these some of the language will likely be awkward.* 

I am going to make the argument that even if the only parts of the NT a Christian believes to be authentic and true are 1-3 they are almost certainly still guilty of cherry picking.

1. Christians believe Jesus lived, died for their sins, and rose from the dead. If you don't believe that Jesus died for your sins and rose from the dead three days later you are not, by definition (as defined in the NT), a Christian.

2. This aforementioned definition was largely codified by Paul (the founder of the Church); you can't call yourself a Christian because you've met the requirements as given by Paul and not take his other teachings as authentic and true. Well, I suppose you could but then, in my opinion, you've failed to explain how you aren't a cherry picker.

3. Christians belief the sayings of Jesus as represented in the bible are authentic and true. I think it's pretty safe to say that this is more or less universally true of all Christians; If you don't believe Jesus' own teachings then there's probably not a lot of point identifying as a Christian.  

**Concerning (1)**

How does one justify the belief that the OT is not literally true (because it's full of crazy stories like Jonah and the Fish, Sodom and Gomorrah, the Plagues of Egypt, the Creation story, Noah's ark, etc.) but still hold the fantastic belief that Jesus *died and rose from the dead*? To me this seems like the very definition of cherry picking.

**Concerning (2) Paul's teachings on women in the Church**

Paul says here that women *shouldn't even talk* in church. Women talk in most churches every Sunday. Does singing count? If you walk into any church on Sunday you'll find a hell of a lot of women singing praise songs.

&gt;""As in all the churches of the saints, the women should keep silence in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be subordinate, as even the law says. If there is anything they desire to know, let them ask their husbands at home. For **it is shameful for a woman to speak in church**"" (1 Corinthians 14:33-36)

Here he says that women shouldn't ever teach men and again reminds them to shut the hell up.  Any church with a female pastor, any Sunday school class taught by a woman, or any bible study led by a woman is in violation of this.

&gt;""But **I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man**. She must remain silent."" (1 Timothy 2:12)

And here he says women need to bear children. So women that don't have children (are you screwed if you're barren?) aren't listening to Paul.

&gt;""But she will be delivered through childbearing, if she continues in faith and love and holiness with self-control."" (1 Timothy 2:15)

**Concerning (3) Jesus' own teachings**

**Sinning**

This one comes first because Jesus views on sinning will be important later. Whether or not Jesus meant this literally (I'm inclined to say no) isn't the point here. The point here is that any time Jesus says that something is a sin he doesn't just mean ""Don't do it"", he means **""No, seriously, don't fucking do it.""**

&gt;""But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. **If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away.** It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell."" (Matthew 5:28-30)

**On the OT and the Law**

Jesus flat out says that you need to obey OT law in all its ridiculous glory (no mixing ~~fabrics~~ wool and linen for example). To be fair Jesus has very ""liberal"" interpretations of OT but still, you can't out and out ignore it. So cherry picking the OT is a no-no, and that's straight from the mouth of the big man himself. 

&gt;""Do not think that I [Jesus] have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.  I tell you the truth, **until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke or a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.""**  (Matthew 5:17-18)"" 

To put this next quote in context YSK that the belief in Jesus' day was that Moses literally wrote the first 5 books of the bible himself (even though his death/funeral is included in one of them, go figure) and was more or less the boss mode Jew you always listened to; his teachings were the final authority in Jewish law - how to interpret them wasn't always unambiguous but you never ignored them.

&gt;Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: ""The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.  So you must obey them and do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach.""  (Matthew 23:1-3)

**On Divorce**

Jesus stance on divorce is more or less ""don't do it"" (I've had to omit Matthew's version where he makes this more clear due to length). Adultery is a sin and we've already gone over Jesus' stance on sinning. It's worth noting that teachings that show up in more than one place are generally given more weight; there's also a version of this in Mark (it's considered certain that Luke/Matthew both had copies of Mark but that's not generally taught in Church).

&gt; ""**Every one who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.**"" (Luke 16:18)

Mark's version:

&gt; And he said to them, ""Whoever divorces his wife and marries another, commits adultery against her; and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery."" (Mark 10:11-12)

**On Forgiveness and Violence**

Here Jesus makes it pretty clear that we shouldn't commit violence for pretty much any reason; at least, in my mind, if you aren't allowed to punch someone that punches you it doesn't seem like it's okay to ever punch someone. This is an important one considering that (in the US at least) most republicans seem to both Christian and very pro-war. I realize this is a huge generalization, bite me. The point is that any Christian that commits violence or condones it goes against Jesus' teachings.

&gt;""You have heard that it was said, 'eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.' But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. **If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.""**  (Matthew 5:38-39)

**On Material Wealth and Possessions**

Last but not least, Jesus' teachings on wealth and material possessions; I really, really don't understand how mega churches ignore this one - oh wait, I think it's called cherry picking like a motherfucking pro.

&gt;""It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God."" (Mark 10:25)

Again, same story, again, teachings that show up in more than one place are generally given more authority.

&gt;""And when Jesus saw that he became sorrowful, he said, 'How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of heaven. For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."" (Luke 18:24-25)

If you don't sell your possessions you're a cherry picker. Of course, I welcome any attempts prove me wrong.

&gt;""**Sell your possessions and give to charity**; make yourselves money belts which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near nor moth destroys."" (Luke 12:33)

In fact, don't even try to make money in the first place; it's a waste of time. Source: the creator of the universe.

&gt;**""Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth**, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where you treasure is, there your heart will be also…No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon."" (Matthew 6:19-24)

**Conclusion**

I'm sure some of these points can be proven wrong but unless you can prove all of them wrong I posit that you are guilty of cherry picking in the first degree. The points on Paul are the shakiest considering that he almost certainly didn't write 1 Timothy but that's not really the point, the point is that it's in the NT and most Christians ignore it. If you don't believe in the inerrancy of at least the NT then it's difficult, in my opinion, to accept many Christian teachings.  How do you figure out what's right and what's wrong?  Isn't it still cherry picking if you do decide certain parts are wrong? Why would God allow teachings into the NT that are false?  On what authority can you throw out certain teachings in the NT?  These kinds of questions are difficult to answer.  If you admit that you cherry pick the NT then I think you need to address at least a few of these or you're essentially building your own religion tailored to suit your needs without justification.

**Notes**:  I know my tone is flippant and I don't mean to offend, this is just my personality.  I tried to make 1-3 as close to the core of what it means to be a Christian as possible; I realize that I've made some sweeping generalizations and that some of these probably don't hold for all Christians (except, I would argue, 1). If you don't believe any of 1-3 can you at least address why you don't and/or attempt to answer some of the questions I've raised in the conclusion?

**TL;DR:** Read the very first sentence, read the first sentences of 1-3, don't read every bible verse (just check out the bolded stuff); this kind of post doesn't TL;DR well but that will give you an outline of my argument.

**Edit:** To clarify: I'm not saying that cherry picking is inherently wrong.

1329053786.0,38,self.DebateReligion,pm0my,Some thoughts about the complaints about stereotyping r/atheism,46,8,246,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/pm0my/some_thoughts_about_the_complaints_about/,"1. In this forum at least, stereotyping has to stop, period. It is standard debating etiquette to present your opponent's viewpoint in the best possible light, and that precludes falsely attributing fallacies to him/her. A caricature is a strawman, hence should be avoided.
Maybe a good way to deal with this problem is to try to avoid making sweeping statements about large groups, eg. add disclaimers like ""some"" or ""most"" or ""a part of"" or ""generally, ..."" or ""sometimes, ..."", instead of just saying ""atheists think this"" or ""all Christians believe X"".

2. Part of the problem is caused by the inherent tension that is present in the stance that is often claimed by atheists, ie. that atheism is just ""a lack of belief in God/gods"", it's not a position/claim/belief itself. Nonetheless you want to present your own arguments and positions in debate with others on the topic of religion. Personally I have no problems with this but it shouldn't be hard to see that this is often confusing for others.

3. Another tension that is somewhat related to this and is perhaps [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) specific is the inherent moral ambiguity of the discussion about religion. On the one hand there are all these accusations toward and complaints about religion that usually litter the frontpage of [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) which obviously have a moral component (implicit is ""this should not be happening"" or ""this is evil/not good""). On the other hand, suggestions to change the behavior of the subreddit itself are usually dismissed out of hand (there's even a [part of the FAQ that explains this](http://en.reddit.com/help/faqs/atheism#ShouldntwebemoreAandlessB)), and some atheists (though I have no idea of the exact numbers) will flat out admit that they are moral relativists or nihilists. In the latter case (relativism or nihilism) you are obviously standing on shaky ground to criticize the behavior of others.

So I'm going to try again.  Hopefully I won't say anything that pisses people off, and there will be a more productive discussion.

Moderating content:  So, let's say we try this, and any posts that don't use a respectful enough tone about the subject matter get removed.  There is only one way I will do this:  The moderator is **NOT** the one making the final decision about what gets removed.

So, here's the plan:  If you think something doesn't follow the guideline on the sidebar (Under the heading ""Be nice to one another"") report it.

If any post/comment gets enough reports, it gets removed.  No review, no appeal, no second chances.

If you get enough posts/comments removed, you get banned from the sub.

The only question that remains:  How many reports is enough?  

Pick a number.  

Sorry, that number is wrong.

Either:

It's too low, and one person will be able to silence people by using sock-puppet accounts and reporting a comment enough times to get it removed.  (Don't like someone, and want them banned from the sub?  It won't take more than a few minutes a day to get them banned with a few sock-puppet accounts if they comment regularly.)

It's too high, and no post/comment ever gets enough reports to get removed.  So, absolutely nothing has changed, and now the people who were complaining about tone in the first place can complain that the bar was set so high it doesn't do anything, and since the mod is an evil anti-theist he did it on purpose.

This is why I don't want to start moderating content beyond removing spam and badly off-topic posts.  

The crux of the issue:  no method for enforcing the 'Be nice to one another' rule will satisfy everyone.  The question then becomes ""What is the best way to enforce this rule that will please the MOST people?""

YOU, dear reader, have the option of not responding to the inflammatory posts, the insulting comments, etc.  If you don't like the way someone is referring to your cherished beliefs, *then quit talking to them.*  You are under **no obligation** to feed the trolls.

The majority of our 1,666 subscribers are reasonable, articulate, intelligent people.  (Yes, this does include the theists.)  The majority of the posts and comments are worthy of discussion.

I'm not unreasonable.  I'm not going to become a dictator and demand that this sub be run as my own personal fiefdom.  But I'm also not going to cave to a minority so as to stifle expression.

So, if you have an idea for change here, suggest it.  If you want more moderation based on content, put forth a plan for how to do it, and let the community refine or reject it.

Personally, I don't think anything needs to be changed.  I'm not going to take any action without an overwhelming number of members of this community asking for it.  So far, it does not appear to me that there is an overwhelming number of people asking for content moderation.

It appears to me that it's a minority who wish to stifle expression to protect their delicate sensibilities.  Even with the shit-storm I started yesterday, the majority of responses was to leave things as they are.  (And that I'm an asshole, but this isn't about me.)

People want more theists in this sub-reddit.  I agree.  An echo-chamber is fun at first, but gets boring very fast.  No one reads this subreddit because they just want their beliefs reinforced.  Everyone here wants their ideas and beliefs challenged.

So, my charge to you:  Go recruit more theists, of all kinds.  Post in the various religious subreddits and link back to this subreddit.   Ask people who make interesting and insightful comments in other subreddits to come join us here.  Send e-mail to luminaries of religious thought in the real world and ask them to join us here.

For theists specifically I ask:  When a post is put up asking questions to theists, RESPOND.  Ignore the atheists answering for you, and create good content.  If you don't have 'debate skills' or you lack the foundational knowledge to rebut, go get it.  Bring your A game, and post your best arguments.

1375129161.0,40,self.DebateReligion,1jasmy,To Theists (mainly Christians): Please stop saying atheists who were once believers enjoy turning away from God.,62,22,128,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1jasmy/to_theists_mainly_christians_please_stop_saying/,"I'm surrounded by Christians in my professional life as well as in my personal life. I used to be a believer; however, after going through about two years of a very painful deconversion process I now consider myself an agnostic atheist. 

There are a couple of things some theists (mostly Christians) say that really rumple my feathers. One is saying that I was never a believer in the first place and that's why I was able to 'turn away' from God. Fine, if that helps you to sleep at night, keep thinking that way.

The second is when someone says that atheists/ex-believers *enjoy* turning away from God. That they revel in their sin and want nothing to do with God. To this I give them a resounding ""Fuck You!"" because you don't know what you're talking about.

I'm not going into a long drawn out story about my almost 2 year deconversion process but let's just say it was a very painful process and I did not go willingly into disbelief, I fought and pleaded with God to give me something to hold onto my faith. I got nothing. Two years of crying out to God with all of my being and I got nothing.

The question is, ""Do some theists (mostly Christians) say these things to squelch their own doubts, or does it make them feel superior to think that atheists are enjoying their ride to hell?""

What's the explanation here?",46,9,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/110vwp/i_dont_understand_how_people_are_saying_ot/,"The way I was taught the Bible made sense internally and I felt like I could piece the puzzle together even if I didn't believe it. But being on this subreddit I hear a lot about x being not literal and what not - and that such literalism is a new phenomenon. Well, in my understanding it throws a wrench on the following things:

In the NT Jesus lineage is written twice, one apparently from Mary's perspective and the other from Joseph's. Luke 3:23–38[1] and Matthew 1:1–17. We know well why these are in there, even if they aren't necessarily historically accurate, they're there to give claim to Christ's legal and patriarchal right as the messiah. They specifically mention characters like Noah and Adam and Enoch and Abraham (though I think Abraham is literal, I think) to sort of piece it all together. This falls right in line with the fact that Christ was supposed to tie in to the OT prophecies in Psalms, Jeremiah, Isaiah, Deuteronomy and others (not disputed...I don't think but I wouldn't be surprised). So to me, right there, the OT is taken extremely seriously. 

So now as to events like Noah's flood and Sodom and Gomorrah, which are highly in contention and are thus made metaphorical, I have the follow quotes which make it hard for me to see in terms of how the people in that time viewed it:

http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2011:48-51&amp;version=NKJV (Here Jesus mentions Abel as sort of a first victim of injustice...the son of Adam and Eve, mentioned right alongside Zechariah, which as far as I'm aware was also viewed as a literal person).

http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2017:26-32&amp;version=NKJV (Here Jesus speaks of both Noah's flood and Sodom and Gomorrah as a warning example, I guess you could say ""well he's using them as allegory"" but it's strange for him to say ""as in the days of"" as if it were a real event, you and I would never say ""just like that time when Goldilocks ate their porridge"")
 
http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19%3A4-6&amp;version=NIV (Here Jesus is using the Adam and Eve story [well, quoting the phrase directly from Genesis 1:27] to make his point, would seem odd if Adam and Eve is a complete metaphor)

http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A39-40&amp;version=ASV (And of course Abraham, kind of rounding the picture out for us)

http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+24%3A36-39%2CMatthew+24%3A50&amp;version=NIV (again using historical language, ""before the flood"" and ""in the days of"")

-------

Now for Peter:

http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+3%3A18-22&amp;version=NIV (This one is pretty important, see where it says ""he went and made proclamation...to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah"" this is referring to those disobedient ""sons of men"" who took wives for themselves and made the Nephilim, it apparently says a literal Jesus rose up and then made proclamation to these literal imprisoned spirits who were disobedient (historically) long ago when (historically) Noah's flood occurred, right?)

But to me this was always the most striking one:

http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+2&amp;version=NIV

*4 For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell,[a] putting them in chains of darkness[b] to be held for judgment; 5 if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others; 6 if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly; 7 and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the depraved conduct of the lawless 8 (for that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)— 9 if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to hold the unrighteous for punishment on the day of judgment*

This is written in such non-allegorical language its hard for me to fathom that he's being figurative here. I think, if it were figurative, we'd know exactly what to replace when he mentions these events, but as far as I know, we don't. 

Not only that, the entire passage is written conditionally. IF God had not done x when x happened. Its hard for me to comprehend something being figurative when you're being conditional about it. The entire point of that passage is God *did those things and those things happened* so you can put faith in him. 

Why would he be trying to inspire faith in the reader by using things that never happened? 

I'd post more quotes but I think we get the point (for example, I just remembered that Paul spoke about Adam and Eve as fact and mentioned Jesus as clearly being the redeemer for that). This is how I was taught and it made sense to me at the time, anything else and it makes the Bible look quite disjointed and really makes the NT look flimsy especially in passages above where it sounds so strong.

1348436408.0,42,self.DebateReligion,10cyfm,To All: Inter-faith conversion tropes you've noticed within your faith; let's see how similar they all are.,43,1,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/10cyfm/to_all_interfaith_conversion_tropes_youve_noticed/,"As my flair would suggest I have a background with the LDS church, still attending with moderate regularity but looking into others faiths at the same time. Within the LDS church there are many stories of inter-faith conversion, usually from a more moderate Christian sect to it. *But here are a few of the common tropes within my religion.*

* **The U-Turn** A devout Christian scholar who has looked into the Mormon faith with a Book of Mormon marked up with a red marker noting historical and canonical non-parallels to his own denomination. One day an inexperienced LDS missionary approaches him with a heartfelt testimony which prompts a change of heart a few weeks down the line, and, eventual conversion. This is certainly the most circlejerky of them all. 

* **The Fulfilled** An affable struggling mother who never really felt connected with her faith, not seeing eye to eye with some doctrine, tending to always believe some concept Mormons hold.(usually about some moral point, which, by it's absence, marks a subtle note about how seemingly nobody to convert to the LDS church after personally deciding doctrine contradictory or just arbitrary) 

* **The Booster** The low income foreign single adult/family/youth/whoever who was living an upstanding life that was only magnified upon joining the church.

* **The Spontaneous** The person who found their life taking a wrong direction. Be it gangs/drugs/general discontent. He started to look into religion and happened to find the LDS church(chalked up to divine intervention). Similar to this vein is the individual who was completely unsure what to join and called on divine intervention for the direction to look. (That latter type of convert is particularly romanticized with the LDS church, which, knowing the presented story of Joseph Smith, makes a lot of sense.) I expect this to be the most common one. 

* **The Holy Black Sheep** The son/daughter who goes against his/her parent's orthodox wishes and joins the church, often eventually turning them onto to it by association. (extra heartstring points for when he/she is exiled from family interaction/basic human dignity.) 

These are just a few of the common ones I've seen within the Mormon faith, I was just wondering both how they contrast with other faith's and how prevalent they are within all of your sunday classes/casual discussions/church media(this category *especially* large within the LDS church). Atheists are especially encouraged to reply, those contrasts and similarities will probably be the most interesting.

**EDIT:** 9 upvotes and no replies? I made this to try and open up a dialogue, how do the examples above compare and contrast with the ones you've seen within your faith. I'm open up to anything you have to say on the topic.

It seems like the main criticism of ""religion"" as a whole is that it encourages suspension of critical thinking, but *not all religion does this*. I'm thinking particularly of Protestant Christian traditions, that not only *in action* questioned and broke off from and reprimanded authoritarian Catholicism for its hypocrisy (and contains many sub-groups today who also broke-off from previous authorities based on critical analysis) but also *in teaching* promotes ideas like

* beware hypocrites (Luke 12:1)
* beware false prophets (Matt 7:15; 2 Pet 2:1)
* the ""gospel"" is to be examined critically (Gal 1:9)
* not every spirit or prophet is to be trusted (1 John 4:1)

When negative case-studies of religions are considered (Jihad, faith healing) it seems that in every case there is the ""religious"" idea, and on top of that is another idea that is the actual cause of the harm. In the case of Jihad it is that those who are different from us should be warred against. In the case of faith healing it is that medical care should be denied.

The case is made that those particular negative examples would be reduced or eliminated by lack of faith, but would they not also be reduced or eliminated, or *more so*  by a positive faith that encourages questioning and criticism as part of that faith?

I know this because when my wife and I were not married and had sex, she used to feel guilty because ""the Bible said it was wrong."" We continued having sex though, because we're human and that's what humans do. She also feels guilty when she doesn't attend Church regularly.

1337871514.0,40,self.DebateReligion,u2tn2,"To Christians: Why I, as a gay man, find the story of Sodom brings up a moral point",47,7,124,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/u2tn2/to_christians_why_i_as_a_gay_man_find_the_story/,"So, when a lot of people hear the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, they usually think it's about how wrong being gay is, but there are a few flaws that I found that end up leading to a different point of view.

Most Christians have heard the story of how an entire town tried to have sex with 2 angels and ended up being destroyed. If you don't, then that was a basic recap.

The problem with it is that, first of all, God had made a deal with Abraham that if there were at least 10 righteous people in the city, then they will be spared. That doesn't cause a problem until you think of how the people that tried to rape the men were all called ""men and children.""

Considering that about 50% of a given population is female, it makes you wonder why they are never mentioned. When I do further research, I remember that ""man"" has been used to describe ""human"" before. With that being the case, I could say that women were also involved in the raping process. Heck, if the kids were there, why not bring the whole family. **Please not the *HEAVY* sarcasm in that sentence.** With women being involved, that would mean that homosexuality couldn't have been the cause, because both of the angels were men.

If it wasn't homosexuality that was the downfall of Sodom, I would have said that it was rape that was the cause. People who call gay people Sodomites seem to forget that they are calling them similar to an entire town that tried to gang bang 2 angels. The rape even continues over in the same chapter when Lot's 2 daughters basically date raped him.

However, when I include what Jesus said about Sodom in Matthew 10:14-15, I notice he compares the sin of Sodom, not to homosexuality, but to inhospitality, which is completely different from the idea of raping an angel.

That's about as far as most people for gay rights get on the issue of Sodom, but there is something historical that could combine it. Back then, it was considered an ultimate sign of humiliation to be raped anally. This was often done after someone won a battle or a war. I delved deeper by looking at all 7 passages from the Bible mentioning Sodom. They are:
Isaiah 1
Jeremiah 23:14
Matthew 10:24-15
Luke 10:7-16
Jude verse 7
Jeremiah 49:18
Ezekiel 16:49-50

Both Matthew and Luke refer to the sin of Sodom being inhospitality, which I've already mentioned.

In Isaiah 1, Judah is constantly compared to Sodom, but homosexuality was never brought up. I mean, seriously, if that chapter was written today, you could see it as smack talk and just replace any mention of ""Sodom"" with ""Communist"" or a synonym for a cigarette. Except no mention of homosexuality.

In Jeremiah 23, the only reference to Sodom's sin being sexually related was adultery. It does mention several other sins, though. They lie and strengthen the hand of evildoers.

2 Peter 6-8 says that Sodom was destroyed because it was ungodly, unprincipled, and lawless. No mention of being gay.

Jude verse 7 is where some would hit a snag. The verse does say in its English form that the sins committed were a bunch of sexual no-nos such as fornication, perverted sensuality, and finally, the first mention of homosexuality.

However, this book wasn't originally written in English, it was written in ancient Greek. The Greek version of homosexuality in that verse was ""sarkos heteras."" This can be translated to ""other flesh."" This could be a reference to homosexuality, but with the fact that there were also women in Sodom, it wouldn't be logical to assume that was it. Technically, angels aren't human, so having sex with one could be considered bestiality. Angels could be considered other flesh, so it fits.

Ezekiel 16:49-50 is another big one. It states that the sins of Sodom were arrogant, overfed, uncaring, didn't help the poor, laziness, and did an abomination in front of him. Most people think that this is a reference to being gay, and therefor makes being gay wrong, but there are 2 things wrong about this notion. The first is that the abomination is never technically mentioned, and there are several abominations mentioned in Leviticus. Heck, working on Sunday is an abomination. So is eating shrimp and wearing mixed fibers.

But considering homosexuality is already an abomination in Leviticus, I'm going to assume for arguments sake that it's referring to being gay. It still never mentions it as a sin, because the word used for abomination originally had a different definition. An abomination is something that was considered against cultural norms. Technically, Jesus went against cultural norms of the time by teaching to turn the other cheek.

What is everyone's thoughts on this?

So, **TL;DR** Sin of Sodom was inhospitality by an entire town of both men and women trying to gang bang 2 angels; abomination originally meant against cultural norms; the Greeks didn't have a word for homosexuality, but word transliterated to homosexuality could refer to bestiality. Thoughts?

Given that morality is divine.,43,4,228,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/rv6eb/to_theists_what_do_you_think_about_the/,"One can do surgery and disconnect the medial pre-frontal cortex from the rest of the brain which would cause the person to no longer feel empathy.  More so, they would no be able to sense pain or suffering in others, which would leave them a clinical sociopath.  Their reactions to others would turn self serving and they would be much more prone to behavior that is harmful to others.

What does this say about Morality being anything other than a conditioned biological response?

How can morality be absolute when everyone is one pill away from a total shift in what would be considered moral behavior.  Even more so, doesn't it them mean morality is subjective?  Declared by the cultural and clinical standards of the time and place?  

""But murder is bad, that is absolute!""

No.  Not even in modern society is that true.  You can kill someone to save yourself, we kill criminals all the time (morality of that is debatable), if you had to kill one person in cold blood to save twenty from dying, would it be morally acceptable to do so?  What about War?

Now take into account not all brains are equal.  Some people have natural disabilities, some people are born with naturally dysfunctional empathetic centers (psychopaths, sociopaths), some people have damaged centers via physical trauma or drug use.  If morality is a divine constant how are these people supposed to follow it when they can't even properly perceive it?

You have a large pile of pebbles and your repeatedly take a pebble from thepile and put it in one of the buckets at random.  If you choose the buckets with equal probability then you would expect them all to grow at about the same rate - after distributing 10,000 pebbles all the buckets would have about 100 pebbles in. 

Now imagine that you repeat this experiment, but the probability of selecting a bucket is proportional to the number of pebbles in it, so a bucket with two pebbles is twice as likely to get another pebble as one with a single pebble.   After 10,000 pebbles you will find that distribution of pebbles in the bucket will follow a [power law distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law_distribution).  a few buckets will have far more pebbles than the others, and most buckets will only have a handful.  The power law means that tiny differences between the buckets becomes magnified over time.  This is sometimes known as the 80:20 rule (approximately 20% of the buckets will have 80% of the pebbles, and vice versa), or a [Pareto Distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution).  We see this distribution in any situation where several entities are competing for a resource, and getting that resource increases their ability to get more.  For example the size of cities, personal wealth, traffic to a website etc all follow this rule.   Any competent programmer can model this on a computer in a few lines of code, and if you run the simulation several times you will find the same distribution each time, but the buckets with the most pebbles will be different each time.

Now imagine a world with 100 competing religions - they all start off small, with say a dozen followers.  It is clear that the more followers a religion has the easier it will be for it to gain new members - it will have more income, more people proselytizing, and more ""brand recognition"".  It is inevitable that some religions will grow larger and come to dominate while others will stagnate or die completely (since in this scenario people can leave religions as well as join them, and when a religion has zero followers it becomes extinct).  However the religions that come to dominate do so purely because of the power law, not because those religions have any greater truth than those that wither, but simply through luck.  If you wound back time and run it again you would still have a few large dominant religions, but they would have different names and beliefs.  

This is why I dismiss any arguments that because a religion has been around for a long time or has billions of supporters then it must have some element of truth.  If you could turn back time and re-run the last 2000 years you would just as likely be worshipping Mithras or any one of hundreds of other gods.

What I'm doing here is combining several arguments and actually applying them within the context of the religion at hand.

I do this because I feel these arguments are that much stronger in the company of one another and that they to some extent can ""feed off"" one another and in another sense make for a cumulative case.  Furthermore it seems that arguing them within the context of a religion adds real ""meat"" to the arguments rather than falling back on abstractions.  

I'll try not to Gish-Gallup or appeal to ridicule, but honestly the best responses to my arguments can be bulleted in a few sentences each.  I'll gladly provide such a response if desired. And even with neutral wording, I don't think we can help but find some of Abrahamic theism absurd. 

**Without further ado:**

It would seem that God made the universe about 14 billion years ago, he makes our sun and earth 9 billion years later amongst 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (actual estimation) other stars in our universe and that's not including the 2 generations of stars that have died preceding that point in time. 

God let earth's inhabitants suffer from the elements and each other (*argument from natural evil*) for about 600 million years (age of complex life).  Then didn't make man until 300,000 years ago (all this is *argument from scale*), and didn't do anything with them until somewhere in the last 15,000 years.  

From there he assumedly keeps tally of how many sheep, goats, and pigeons are sacrificed for what seem obviously to be absurd and arbitrary laws ([example](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+15&amp;version=NIV), *argument from unjust law*) and does so for several thousand years.  

For no explicit reason, God concludes that that's been enough and instead decided to come down in a birth that accurately fulfills a fabricated prophecy based on a bad translation from Hebrew into Greek (*argument from dishonest authorship*).  He doesn't start a ministry until the end of his twenties and his ministry lasts a whopping 3 years, in all of which He doesn't bother to write down anything for Himself and any details about him preceding his ministry can fill a paragraph and a half (*argument from mystery*) . This climaxes in having himself tortured for a weekend to clear things up. (*argument from incoherent narrative*).  This is followed by another 2,000 years of anticipation built upon stories that have only vanishingly different degrees of hardiness in their arguments from that of other religions. (*Argument from confusion*)

So I've got a handful of actual arguments that I can lay out in syllogism as need be, but suffice it to say that I hope this can offer a good idea as to why I consider the God of Abraham so implausible.  If the stories behind Christianity, Judaism and Islam were true, that would mean that so much of what I consider fact, and so much in the ways by which I derive knowledge are so off that I have almost no basis for any knowledge at all.

The notion, as I understand it, is that religious people are human beings, no better or worse than anyone else, and ought to be treated with civility - but religion is a corrupting influence on the world and that it ought to be ridiculed as much as possible. You're not attacking anyone, you're attacking an idea.

But of course, this idea didn't originate with the New Atheists, did it? How many of you non-Christians out there - especially (and I hate to stereotype) those of you living in the US Bible Belt - have been told that ""Jesus loves you as a person more than you could ever imagine - but your beliefs are the product of a godless and depraved mind!"" (or at least, something along those lines)? I think, especially when it comes to hot-topics like religion, people feel the desire to deride the other person's standpoint (after all, for many, their religious beliefs, or lack thereof, is a very personal thing and a fundamental part of their identity, and being told that it's wrong tends to raise our hackles a bit) while still feeling the obligation to treat the other person with respect.

So we all end up falling into this ""Love the (non)believer, hate the (non)belief"" boat, where it's okay to brutally attack someone else's perspectives so long as you don't attack the person themselves.

But you know what the result of that is? Of the atheist who mocks and ridicules religion? Or the theist who condemns the unbelief of others?

*People stop listening to them.*


Let me use an illustration. Let's say someone bailed on your dinner reservation for two, so you ask a co-worker to come along so you're not sitting there by yourself. When you arrive outside of the restaurant, he takes a look at you and says, ""Man, you dress like a hobo."" You get inside, sit down, server comes up, you order your drink, and he looks at you and says ""Wow. You must have a severely underdeveloped palette."" Later on, one of your favourite songs comes on the radio, and your co-worker just looks at you and says ""You have got terrible taste in music.""

As you're leaving, he can tell you're upset, and asks you why. You say ""The entire night, you've done nothing but belittle me."" He laughs, and says ""My boy! I haven't belittled you! I've got nothing but respect for you! I've just belittled your opinions. Because they're wrong.""

There are a couple of questions we could ask at this point: Is he right? Maybe. Could you learn and benefit from talking to him more about it? Probably. Are you going to talk to him more about it? Almost certainly not. Why not? Well, frankly, because he's an asshole.

So you stop hanging out with that guy. So what does he do? He goes and finds people who already agree with him. People he doesn't have to criticize. That's how we see these great echo chambers like the American Religious Right or even /r/atheism rise up, because the people within the groups have become so hostile towards beliefs that conflict with their own that the only people who will talk with them are those who already agree with them, reinforcing their own position. Intellectual incest.

So, no, you are not obligated by law to be respectful of a religious belief, or lack thereof. Yes, I know that whatever perspective you have, it can be tempting to just rip a new one off of someone who makes a stupid argument.

*Christians view God as good. How do you come to terms with the character of god as depicted various parts in the old and new testament?*

We judge people by their actions, like, how we treat other people, what we strive for, what are goals are and how we reach those goals, etcetera.

Using this kind of reasoning to the God character in the bible, I find it hard to come to the conclusion that this is a benign deity. 

Looking at just one part of the old testament, the great flood, and taking in what is supposed to literarily have happened; the deliberate attempt (and success) to *drown everyone*, mothers and fathers and children and the elderly, simply because they have not lived up to rules that most of them can not even have known existed.

To me, this particular story doesn't describe a just and moral being. But I guess not all christians take the flood as a literal event, but this is far from the only event in the bible where we can read about a god that seem hungry for human blood and suffering.

The crucifixion is viewed by christians as an act of love by God, and a proof that God is good. But, viewed as what is supposed to have happened, I find it really hard to draw that conclusion.

While I do understand the general idea of sacrifice/suffering to save others (like a solider throwing himself on a grenade to save his fellow brothers-in-arms) I find the story and interpretation of the crucifixion a bit... odd.
The crucifixion is, after all, a blood torture sacrifice of a conscious suffering human being, that is supposed to act like a loophole for a rule that God Himself decided on. To me, this is more like if the same solider who threw himself on the grenade is also the person who tossed the grenade into the bunker in the first place. 

Because, surely, God in his omnipotence could have just cancelled out original sin by merely wishing for it to disappear, instead of going through the suffering of Jesus, right?

So I'm curious, Christians who read the bible and hold that God is good; how do you interpret the bible in regards to these or other stories?

But in the secular society, the liberal universalist may get the same criticism as the conservative baptist because they are referencing the same book, but i would argue that these two people are following two different religions.

Now I know these are different sects of the same religion so of course they are going to have different philosophies, but lets look at only the conservative baptists. Even in the same church and the same philosophy, everyone is going to have a slightly different interpretation, and it could be something as simple as one person feeling it is slightly more important to go to church every sunday than another.

But if everyone has slight different nuances and their own subjective interpretations of each religion, is it the same religion. Now you could argue against this and say that everyone has a different interpretation of a song or painting, but its the same song or painting. But religion is different, because religions are made essentially of rules and doctrines, and subjectively, we all alter those rules and doctrines, or at least interpret the weight of them diffrently. By this way of thinking, you are changing the nature of a set of rules, if you change your interpretation of the mona lisa painting and say its a dude, you are not recreating a new painting with your interpretation.

Now if we base a religion on its holy texts, we see that they are a collection of ideas, not one fixed thing. By picking and choosing certain parts of a holy text, you are removing those ideas from the context as a whole, creating something different.

This is not like having a subjective interpretation of a harry potter book. people will get different reactions and symbolism from the story, but the reader will still take in the narrative as a whole and not disregard a certain part because its not to their liking. If people interpreted literature the way some people interpreted the bible, it would be like saying chapter 13 was only symbolic, but chapter 14 was actually part of the plot. If you want to pick and choose and say that at the end of the great gatsby, jay gatsby didnt actually die, you have every right to do that, but you are not talking about the same narrative, you more or less created a fan fiction, not a subjective interpretation.

I will aim to show that a good God, objective morality and being a decent human being are incompatible even with the free will defence. Before I launch into the argument, I think it would be good to go over some common definitions that I will be using.
******
-------


## Definitions

+ **Objective morality** - The stance that there are unchanging, absolute moral truths not dependent on human subjectivity in the Universe. Most theists claim these moral values come from God.
+ **A Good God** - An all good God, or a God that is the source of objective moral values. Often also referred to as all loving, but that's a bit creepy.
+ **Free will defence** - I am using the version posited by Plantinga [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Plantinga's_free_will_defense), which can be summarised as: *A world containing creatures who are significantly free is more valuable than a world containing no free creatures at all. If God can personally intervene to prevent evil, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do not do what is right freely.* Note that I have summarised the summary, but you can read the whole thing through the link.
+ **A decent human being** - A human being that seeks to prevent atrocities and improve the state of the world when possible.

*******
-------


## The Argument

#### Simplified argument (**TL;DR here**)

1. Objective moral values exist
2. God is morally all good
3. The actions of God are morally all good
4. God does not intervene to prevent suffering (by valuing free will more)
5. Not intervening to prevent suffering is the morally good decision

If anyone disagrees with 5, and the logic is valid, then which premise(s) fall(s)?

#### Colloquial argument

For those that believe in an all good God, his actions must set the benchmark for the epitome of moral goodness. For if they are not, there exists a God who's actions are better, and hence the former God is not all good. Most people do not challenge this, they instead embrace it, and they seek to determine God's will through various holy texts and commandments, assuming that this is the best way to find the word of God and therefore the manual on how to live a good life. I prefer another tactic: I ask ""What would Jesus do?"", or more aptly, ""What would God do?"". And if I were a theist, this would not just be a rhetorical question, for I would believe in the existence of some all good God, that is actively watching over the human race.

Now, when faced with the problem of evil, most theists (that I know) simply shrug it off with a *how-do-you-not-understand* expression and say ""Free will!"". But what does the free will defence actually tell us? It tells us explicitly that God values a world with people significantly free more than he values having a world not significantly free and preventing moral evil. This does not imply that a world without significantly free beings cannot have moral good or evil - attempting to kill someone but having the bullet miss them is still a morally wrong act, even if the intended consequence did not occur and the intended victim survived.

We now have something to work with: we know a value decision made by a perfect, all good being: the valuation of significant freedom over non-significant freedom and prevent moral atrocities. But how would this apply to a realistic scenario?


    
    
********

--------

## The Application

Put yourself in the shoes of an ordinary civilian, who, walking home through a park after a tiring and repetitious day at work comes across a man raping a woman. Now let us quickly realise one thing that is not essential to the argument, but is very interesting: *For the man to be significantly free has to be able to choose to rape the woman, and then has to be able to physically rape the woman. For the woman to be significantly free, she has to choose not to be raped, and then be able to have this choice fulfilled in reality.* In either scenario someone's free will is impinged. This by itself should break the free will defence, but I will continue.

The civilian observer now has a choice, he can continue on and let the rape happen, or try to stop the act. Most people here would without any hesitation say the later is more moral than the former. **But** if the civilian is a theist that believes in an all good God, then things change. The civilian only has to figure out what God would do in order to determine the most moral course of action (remember, if morals are a universal truth what is right and wrong will not change through any perspective, whether it be God or human, as that immediately violates the definition of objective and becomes subjective). Now, it is obvious the value decision God has made: He values the will of the rapist to rape over the combined will of the female not to be raped, and the suffering she is undergoing and will undergo in the future. So the civilian, but God's inaction, can immediately logically deduce that, in order to follow the best (most good) course of action, he should also value the will of the rapist to rape over everything else. And he walks home.

If he does **not** walk home, then he must be a hypocrite, as he can logically determine the value decision made by God but believes that his own morality is superior to that of God's.

## Expected Counter arguments

1. **What is right for God to do is different to what is right for people to do** - This counterargument violates the definition of objective morality, as what is right and wrong cannot be dependent simply on perspective, it must be independent. Further, the nature of the agent plays no part in the moral scenario, which, for the example above is simply one person raping another. Does it matter if the observer is male, female, white, black, short, tall, mortal or divine? No.
2. **If God intervened all the time right and wrong are meaningless** - I am not arguing for a God that intervenes whenever you might say a bad word in public, so I hope no one insinuates that I did (but it will happen anyway). And if you intervene and stop a rapist, does that make is actions morally invalid? No. Because he still chose to rape, and still attempted to rape.
3. **God is mysterious** - Playing the mystery card, offered as an excuse to continue holding untenable and illogical beliefs.
4. **What is right is what God wants, so your argument is wrong** - In which case, if God told you to torture a child to death, would you do it because it is the ""right"" thing to do. Also, your morality is now based off the whims of an deity, not off a rational foundation of the well being of conscious creatures, and I would assert that secular morality is therefore superior.
5. **God is testing us in those situations to see if we still make the right choice** - Which would explain why when there is no one to test, God starts intervening and stopping those atrocities?
6. **All suffering has a purpose, even if we can't see it** - Another appeal to mystery. An admission that we cannot rationalise nor resolve the conflict, but still want to keep believing anyway. Also does not impact the argument, in fact it reinforces it, providing more reason not to intervene when God doesn't.

**TL;DR is the simplified argument**

1337794738.0,40,self.DebateReligion,u1aox,To all: Does conceivability entail the logical possibility of Superman?,50,10,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/u1aox/to_all_does_conceivability_entail_the_logical/,"This post is inspired by a recent conversation I had with our resident Thomist, hammiesink. In it, hammie makes the [following assertion](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/tq251/to_theists_if_god_has_always_existed_could_the/c4osf47) in the context of conceivability and logical possibility:

&gt; *Prima facie,* ***Superman is logically possible.*** *The burden is on a skeptic to show otherwise. I seriously doubt that it can be done.*

A lot of theistic philosophy relies on the idea that conceivability entails logical possibility. That is to say, if it is conceivable, it is also logically possible, even if it is physically impossible in our world.

The example hammie used, Superman, is definitely physically impossible. He flies, he's inhumanly strong, he shoots frickin' laser beams from his eyes, etc... Yet we can all visualize him, we can all conceive of him, and the argument goes that since this is so, there are at least some [possible worlds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possible_world) in which he could exist.

In contrast, a circle that is simultaneously a square is inconceivable. We can't visualize it, no matter how we try to twist our brains to do so. In addition to being physically impossible, the square circle is logically impossible. There is no possible world in which a square could also be a circle without redefining them.

But is the physically impossible still logically possible, or is that a failure of resolution?

I argue that Superman is not logically possible, despite the fact that I can conceive of him at a macro scale. And to prove this, I reduce him to the micro scale, the scale at which he becomes something I *can't* actually conceive of. I reduce him to logically invalid math.

Let's assign some numbers to Superman's energy input and output. Superman gets his energy primarily from the Sun; he is rarely depicted as needing to eat much, or even breathe (useful for a dude who regularly flies in space without a spacesuit). For simplicity's sake, I'm not going to bother calculating the total amount of calories it would be possible for him to acquire with maximal surface area exposure to sunlight. Suffice it to say, even if Superman is a 100% efficient solar cell -- that is, every photon that his body absorbs is converted to a form of energy he can use -- he still has a massive energy deficit compared to his output. His powers include:

* Flight
* Super strength
* Super breath
* Super hearing
* Super vision (x-ray, heat beams, etc.)
* Super speed
* Etc.

Let's say Superman's energy input from the Sun is 3 units a day. And again, for simplicity's sake, let's call his output 12 units a day (really it could be any number). Unless we change the definition of Superman so as to give him an additional 9 units of energy coming from somewhere -- at which point, we're no longer talking about Superman as we've conceived of him -- we've reduced Superman to something we **can't** conceive of. Try visualizing 3 being greater than 9. You can't. It's a logical impossibility.

So merely by zooming in, getting into the details, we reveal that something superficially conceivable is actually logically impossible. Superman can't exist in any possible world **and still be Superman**. He is an incoherent concept that we can nevertheless visualize.

Have I missed anything? Is there a way to make Superman logically possible while still being Superman?

I contend that all physical impossibilities that we can conceive of are similarly reducible to logical impossibilities. But if I'm right about Superman, then it doesn't even matter if I'm right about that. All I needed was one counter-example to determine that conceivability does not entail logical possibility.

Here I will attempt to show that the existence of such a being gives rise to a contradiction.


Let g be an entity that has the following properties:

*  there is some event X such that g is a cause of X

*  g necessarily exists

This g is our necessary creator being. Now, we introduce the following proposition:


Premise: if X is a cause of Y, then the probability that Y occurs increases once we know that X has occured. That is:

X is a cause of Y  =&gt;  P(Y|X) &gt; P(Y)

The reasoning behind this premise should be clear. If event Y were just as likely to occur whether or not X did, then the two events occur independently of one another; X can hardly be said to *cause* Y if it would continue to happen in the just same way without it. If Y were *less* likely to occur when we know that X has, then calling X a cause would be even more absurd, since it is actively impeding Y's existence, not facilitating it. This leaves the only possible relationship as the one given.

By applying this premise, and letting G be the statement ""g exists"", we can rephrase the definition of g as follows:

*  P(X|G) &gt; P(X)

*  P(G) = 1

However, from this we see that:

      P(X) 
    
    = P(X|G)*P(G) + P(X|¬G)*P(¬G)
    
    = P(X|G)*1 + P(X|¬G)*0
    
    = P(X|G)
    
    &gt; P(X)
    
But P(X) &gt; P(X) is a contradiction. Thus, the concept of a necessary being who created the universe is inconsistent.

This would seem to suggest that they think the Church is wrong.

I could understand this in any other Christian sect because they take personal approaches to truth and revelation.  Most Christians I've known have simply packed up and changed churches or denominations when they disagree with a stance their church has made.

I just don't understand how it's justifiable to consider yourself a Catholic if you explicitly refute its declarations.  Wouldn't it be more accurate and honest to just call yourself a Christian and find a different church?

Apologies if this has been addressed before, but I couldn't find anything in the archives.

First, I'd like to define a term. Per my flair, I'm an ""agnostic atheist."" That is to say, I do not believe in any gods (atheist), but neither do I believe I could prove conclusively that no gods exist (agnostic).

**A little history about myself**

Unlike a lot of the atheists you'll encounter, I wasn't raised in any of the big religions. In fact, I was raised with some unusual New Age mysticism -- magic crystals, channeling, chakras, homeopathy, spiritual aliens, reincarnation... nothing was too woo-woo for my parents. So my perspective on Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Shinto, Buddhism, and all the other religions is that of an outsider, and has been since long before I realized I didn't believe any of the malarkey I was raised with.

Now, that stuff was quirky, weird, and dangerous in some ways. For example, homeopathy isn't medicine, it's a glorified -- and expensive -- placebo.

But all in all, it was fairly innocuous. Normal sexual behaviors and desires weren't demonized, no one told me God was looking over my shoulder to make sure I behaved in a particular arbitrary way, and there was no such thing as Hell.

In fact, to their credit, my parents never really settled on a specific thing they believed happened after death. While they've never gone the next step and questioned whether anything at all happens after you die, they haven't pretended to know.

So I was left with a vague feeling that ""something"" happened after death, and that there's a sort of cosmic consciousness that some people call God. I was pretty happy with that.

**How I became less happy with that**

I've gone over this a number of times in my head and in words, and each time I recognize additional contributing factors.

A primary factor is my gut instinct to reject unfounded claims. I've always been a bit of a skeptic in other matters, especially those of a supernatural nature. I didn't know the word, but by the time I was about 10 years old, I was more of a deist than a believer in the religion of my parents. I didn't think anything magical ever really happened in the real world, and the various stories were just that: Stories. I envisioned God and an afterlife as only existing outside of space and time. So even at a young age, I doubted.

And I thought most of the stuff coming from organized religions was bunk. Frankly, I was (and still am) horrified that anyone could possibly believe in Hell, or worship a deity that would create it. Later, I heard the ideas that Hell is actually just the absence of God, or that it's where nonbelievers and sinners somehow choose to go, but since I never was a Christian, I always thought these notions were bullshit cop-outs. Even my young mind knew it didn't make any sense, and figured it was just a scare tactic to ensure more followers.

As an adult, I had a few experiences that solidified my skepticism. For instance, I had the opportunity to spend some time with some Scientologists. Obviously, Scientology did not hold up to skeptical scrutiny, and I found myself mentally picking apart every ridiculous claim they made. It was so obviously a money scam, it wasn't even funny.

And then there was 9/11. For a while, I was something of a ""truther,"" because on the surface, their claims seemed to make sense, and considering the craven behavior Dick Cheney has always shown, I felt the (wholly unexamined) evidence of his involvement was pretty strong. Then I examined the evidence, and it blew apart like wet tissue paper in a strong wind.

At this point, I finally started applying my skepticism to my own already nebulous deism, and much to my shock, I found it just as lacking in evidence as any outlandish conspiracy theory, alternative medicine hoax, or the religions I'd been witness to from the outside.

**What put me over the top**

Most people find the birth of their first child to be a ""spiritual"" event. I certainly did. It's hard to express the combination of joy, exhaustion, exhilaration, and other intense emotions that accompany it. If you're a parent, you know. If not, you won't understand it until you become a parent.

There were some unexpected side effects, though. As the first year rolled by, I found myself less and less able to abide news stories about sick, abused, starved, hurting, or dead children. The idea of their pain and deaths horrified me far beyond what it would have prior to my daughter's birth. For maybe a full year, I assiduously avoided such news stories, because each one was like a sucker-punch to the gut.

But inevitably, I was forced by my own mind to confront it. Why did the pains and deaths of other people horrify me so much? After all, I still had a very slight amount of religious belief, right? I didn't think those deaths were actually the end of those people, did I?

Well, actually, yes. I did think that. And coming to that realization sucked, let me tell you. Try to imagine being raised in a feel-good religion where everything works out fine, you get to be reincarnated or advance to a ""higher plane of existence,"" and there's no Hell. Realizing I'd lost that really hurt. My beliefs, however tenuous, had all of the afterlife Happy Funland promises of religion without all the jerking-off-means-you-go-to-Hell bullshit. So what was making those news stories painful was the realization that those kids never got a fair shot, then were irrevocably snuffed out.

As an empathetic human being, that kind of flipped my shit out for a while.

**But I got over it**

So here we are today. I'm a better person than I was before. I give more to charities. I volunteer. I give to the homeless. I do all this because what matters isn't saving the soul I don't believe exists. What matters is reducing misery **now**.

I can't make those kids come back to life. Their deaths are unnecessary, tragic, and wasteful, and if I could, I would. I would bring them back to life, I would make them well fed, loved, and cared for. I would, but I can't.

Here's what I can do. I can recognize that our time is limited. Living for an afterlife isn't living at all, it's just existing until something better comes along, which it won't. Once I realized this, I realized that no time is more important than right now, no matter when ""right now"" happens to be. If I'm not doing what I can to ease the burdens and miseries of those less fortunate than myself, putting my energies into goals that I've set for myself, or otherwise working to be a source of happiness in the world, I'm squandering the incredible luck I have to be alive.

**So here we are**

I'm a science fan, and as such, I research scientific topics assiduously. This has further cemented my conclusion that there's no evidence for anything supernatural. This includes:

* **Dualism** - The mind is a collection of neurological actions and reactions, nothing more. That doesn't belittle it; on the contrary, knowing what the mind is does not at all detract from the fact that it's a beautiful, wonderful thing. But it does mean the mind stops when we die, in much the same way that a song disappears once you stop singing it.
* **Souls** - There is no evidence of a soul, spirit, ghost, or other supernatural component of our essences. And that's OK. Being my body is OK.
* **Intelligent design** - The evidence in favor of evolution by natural selection is compelling.
* **God** - There is no evidence of gods. Books that claim to be the word of gods aren't evidence, any more than Harry Potter books are evidence of a boy wizard's existence. Arguments that try to prove God exists by logical deduction are fundamentally flawed, one and all, and generally boil down to special pleading or other fallacies. One can no more argue God into existence outside of the universe (if such a concept even makes sense) than one can argue a chair into existence inside of the universe. The very best arguments result in an uninvolved deistic creator that may or may not be sentient, and whose existence bears not at all upon our own.

And there you have it. The evolution of an atheist.

&gt;*Abstract: People often reason egocentrically about others' beliefs, using their own beliefs as an inductive guide. Correlational, experimental, and neuroimaging evidence suggests that people may be even more egocentric when reasoning about a religious agent's beliefs (e.g., God). In both nationally representative and more local samples, people's own beliefs on important social and ethical issues were consistently correlated more strongly with estimates of God's beliefs than with estimates of other people's beliefs (Studies 1–4). Manipulating people's beliefs similarly influenced estimates of God's beliefs but did not as consistently influence estimates of other people's beliefs (Studies 5 and 6). A final neuroimaging study demonstrated a clear convergence in neural activity when reasoning about one's own beliefs and God's beliefs, but clear divergences when reasoning about another person's beliefs (Study 7). In particular, reasoning about God's beliefs activated areas associated with self-referential thinking more so than did reasoning about another person's beliefs. Believers commonly use inferences about God's beliefs as a moral compass, but that compass appears especially dependent on one's own existing beliefs.*

It seems that every time there's a thread asking to defend the value of faith, most theists here (contrary to what I hear theists outside of this sub say) say it is not blind belief, but rather evidence/reason-based.

Okay, so let's say God wants us to believe based on evidence and not blind faith... Why didn't he provide enough to convince everyone?

Before you say, ""he already has,"" obviously he hasn't, since there are so many non-believers in your particular sect of your particular religion. 

So, it is either:

*  *Literally impossible* to convince any current non-believers, or 

* There could be evidence to convince current non-believers, but God has not provided it. 

If the former, why are we blamed for not believing, if it is impossible for us to believe? If the latter, why hasn't God provided the level of evidence he knew we'd need?

Regarding the level of evidence needed and given, consider this:

God would know, at the beginning of creation, exactly how many people would end up believing based on the level of evidence he chose to provide us. That is, being omniscient, he knew that the level of evidence he provided,  *X*, would convince exactly 10,655,456,553 people before the end times. There would be absolute certainty of this exact number - not a single person more or less. If he provided level of evidence *X*-n, it would only end up convincing 9,324,654,786, not a single person more or less. Similarly, if he provided level of evidence *X*+n, it would end up convincing 11,425,634,998, not a single person more or less. So why not just provide *X*+whatever ""n"" required to convince everyone? 

Some say, ""It would take away our free will if he convinced everyone,"" but then you'd be arguing that the numbers of people above had no free will, since God knew with certainty that level he provided would convince them. Why knowingly convince those people, but not the rest?

1365691816.0,36,self.DebateReligion,1c4y0s,To atheists: There is no contradiction between God’s omniscience and free will (WARNING: Long Argument),70,34,261,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1c4y0s/to_atheists_there_is_no_contradiction_between/,"I made a post on this topic a few days that generated some good discussion, so I've decided to expand my arguments in response to criticisms and post it here.

##Clarifications
First off, I want to clarify exactly what I attempt to demonstrate with this argument. My aim is not to show that we have free will, but rather that ***God’s omniscience (and other classical attributes for that matter) does not entail that we lack free will***. It is not a criticism of my arguments that if determinism is true they fail, as it will then be the determinism that is in contradiction with free will and not God’s existence or attributes. Unless, that is, you can argue that God’s attributes entail determinism, which is the thesis I shall try to demonstrate is false. Similarly, it is not a criticism of my argument if the concept of free will is incoherent.

Secondly, it will help to define my key terms. By ‘free will’ I refer to the incompatibilist definition that an agent has free will if and only if they could have acted otherwise than they actually acted. This is the standard definition in this context and omniscience poses no problems for compatibilism anyway. My definition of omniscience may be more controversial and is as follows:
&gt;Omniscience is the property of knowing all things that it is not logically contradictory to know.

Some of you may object to this added caveat, but it seems reasonable to not define omniscience so that it leads to logical absurdity. In any case this restriction of omniscience to the logically possible seems in keeping with the standard restriction on omnipotence so it seems reasonable to be consistent in this manner.

##Groundwork
We will need to begin with some metaphysical groundwork on the nature of time, all of which is discussed in detail in the [SEP article on Time](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time/#PreEteGroUniThe). There are three main views on the nature of time. The first is called Presentism, which states that the only objects in existence are those that exist in the present. I exist, the Eiffel Tower exists but Gandhi and any future Moon colony do not exist. The second view is called the Growing Block theory, which is like Presentism but allows for the existence of past objects. Both Presentism and Growing Block are in agreement about the non-existence of any future objects, events etc. 

The third main view on the other hand argues for the reality of the future and is called Eternalism. Eternalism takes its cue from physics and argues that time is just another dimension, akin to space. A key consequence of this view is that all moments in time are already there and could be said in some sense to happen at once. If you were able to look at the time line from a timeless perspective, it would be like looking at every frame of a movie at once.

My thesis is that whichever of these three views you accept, they each pose serious problems for the inference from omniscience to foreknowledge to predestination. (as this is quite long the first sections of each argument also function as tl:dr)

##Presentism/Growing Block
The basic problem here is that as under these views there are no future objects or events. Therefore both future me and my future choices do not exist. Therefore there can be no facts pertaining to how I will choose and hence it is not logically possible for God to know my future actions. Thus omniscience under this framework does not entail foreknowledge and so there is no contradiction with free will. 

To properly articulate this argument (in response to objections raised by /u/MaybeNotANumber) we will consider a simple model. Suppose we have a true random number generator that will output some integer at future time T. Call the present time t (t&lt;T). Consider the claims “The output at time T is even” and “The output at time T is odd”. **At time t**, neither of these statements are true. Why?

To answer this we employ [Russell's Theory of Descriptions](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descriptions/#RusTheDes) which analyses the former statement as making three claims:

1. There exists an output at time T
2. There is at most one output at time T
3. Whatever is an output at time T is even (for the latter statement this just changes from ‘even’ to ‘odd’)

Now the output at time T is a state of the machine at time T, thus (1) is false to claim there exists such a state as there are no future objects. Thus both of these claims evaluate as false. Furthermore by the definition of a true random number generator it is impossible to infer the future states of the machine from its present and past states. From this it follows by definition that knowledge of either of these statements is impossible at time t, as by definition if p is false then it can’t be known that p. 

We may further supplement this point by appeal to the [correspondence theory of truth](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth/#CorThe) which states that “p is true if and only if p corresponds to some actual state of affairs”. Thus a claim about some future event can only be true if it corresponds to a future state of affairs. But as there are no future states of affairs (as there are no future objects) then no such claim can be true. Now what holds for the random number generator also holds for any free agent, as the actions of a free agent can’t be inferred from any past states of affairs.

MaybeNotANumber tries to avoid this critique by arguing that the output at time T exists as a concept rather than as an actual object. He thus considers the claims as statements of the form “If time = T then the output is …”. This would seem to run into the difficulty of us having two equally valid concepts of the output, one even one odd, and no fact as to which will be actual. Furthermore a concept is a mere product of a mind, whilst the claims being considered are clearly referring to actual, mind-independent events. We must distinguish between truths of such things and truths of concepts. For example “Pegasus has wings” may be true of the *concept of Pegasus*, but is not true of the thing Pegasus as there is no such thing. Thus this objection seems not to succeed.  

Thus, knowledge of the future actions of free agents is impossible under this framework. 

##Eternalism
In the groundwork we described how the Eternalist (‘Block’) universe looks from a timeless perspective as every event happening at once. This is the view that God is supposed to have, being himself timeless. So God knows everything that I do, have done or will do because he can see every moment at once. However this doesn't mean that my actions aren't free, because the *reason* that God sees them as what they are **is because that was how I chose to act**. If I had chosen to do Y instead of X then God would have timelessly known that I did Y, but I chose to do X and so he timelessly knows that I did X. My choosing is causally prior to God knowing what I chose*. A key premise of this is of course that God is timeless. If you think he isn't (or that the concept is meaningless) that is the avenue you should take in refuting classical theism, not omniscience/free-will.

/u/Deggit presents an ingenious response to this argument based on that other attribute of God as the creator of the universe. Consider the two versions of me mentioned above. Call the one that chose X X-me and the one that chose Y Y-me. These entities are totally distinguishable beings under Eternalism, possessing distinct 4-D forms, at least if you have a timeless perspective as God does. To quote Deggit
&gt;The whole point is that God has timeless knowledge from the moment of creation that you are X-You. When you get to the choice-moment you **will** pick X. You will feel as if you are picking X for entirely reasonable reasons. The choice will feel free, not arbitrary.

&gt;The lack of freedom enters the equation with God being the one who deliberately and knowledgeably approved of X-You existing. If God didn't want X-You to exist, he could have *just as easily* created a universe where you are Y-You and ""freely"" pick Y for reasonable reasons.

Thus not only does it seem that I have no free-will if there is an omniscient creator, we also arrive at a problem of evil on steroids with every evil event in the history of the universe, by man or nature, the direct result of God’s choices at creation.
 
However there is perhaps a loophole to avoid to this conclusion. This requires a couple of axioms that seem plausible, but may not be sufficient under closer examination, that are as follows:

1. X-me and Y-me are both numerically one and the same individual (me) with different 4-D profiles
2. Pre-creation a free individual has an indeterminate 4-D profile (note: I could do with an explanation by a theologian as to what exactly happens when God creates a being to come to an informed opinion as to the truth of this axiom)

Given these two axioms we can then consider Gods creation process as God chooses to create the singular individual ‘me’ (as well as every other thing in the existence) which has an indeterminate 4-D profile, and then the entire history of the universe unfolds (from God’s point of view all simultaneously) and I freely chose all my actions and then God timelessly knows all of my choices*. 

I think on balance I favour the view that pre-creation there is a universe with determined initial conditions(/set of initial conditions) and fixed physical laws, but an indeterminate 4-D profile. Thus God chooses the initial state and laws of the universe, but doesn't choose the 4-D form that the universe takes. Hence my actions still genuinely result from my free choices and this choosing is still casually prior to God’s knowledge of my choices.

I've also just polished off *Orthodoxy* by G.K. Chesterton and I actually think he makes many good points, but is more style than substance when confronting atheism.

This all came to mind because I just finished reading the worst book I have ever read.  Ravi Zacharias' *The End of Reason*, which is largely an attempted rebuttal of new atheism.  I'd heard many of Ravi's sermons and enjoyed them, but going past his theology and into more the philosophy, every page was a train wreck.  Previously the worst philosophy train wreck I'd ever seen was the Lewis Wolpert v. WLC debate where wolpert does very poorly.  But it really pales in comparison to this.  Here is the first part of the prologue:

&gt;A university student arrives home and informs his parents that after reading a popular atheists' book he has renounced his family's faith. His mother in particular is shattered by the news.  His father struggles to engage his son in dialogue but to no avail.  The deepening grief causes them to distance themselves from their son. When the game of silence does not work, the mother is plunged further into depression and despair.  The grandparents get involved watching in anguish beliefs that were held deeply in the family for generations crumble.  Before long his family that was once close and peaceful are now broken hostile.  Abusive words are shared between the son and the mother with increasing frequency and intensity.  And the siblings blame their brother's new strident atheism for the rift in the family.  After one night of arguing with her son and after pleading unsuccessfully, the mother takes an overdose of prescription medication and ends her life,  unable to accept what she interprets to be the destruction of her family

.

&gt;Although this particular scenario is imaginary, I suspect that in some measure such scenes like this have occurred since Sam Harris' publication of *Letter to a Christian Nation*

What.the.fuck

I'm pretty sure the theists here can see what awful sophistry is going on here and if you don't, well you're one of the reasons I'm anti-theistic.  This isn't even dignified enough to be the argument from example fallacy, it's the argument from imaginary example, which is to mention nothing of emotional blackmail and appeal to consequences.

He goes on to:

- Complain about how Sam Harris thinks muslims are too violent, but then says that he would be suprised that if Sam Harris spoke to a mulsim group that Sam would walk away ""unscathed"" after what he says

- Say that atheists would riot if atheism wasn't allowed to be taught in colleges

- Say that the logical outcome of atheism is drugs and suicide

So here is where the debate comes in.  Ravi is popular.  His videos have around 3 million views total, I can hear him on the radio when I drive home.  I've heard time and time again how the ""New Atheists"" are too extreme or unsophisticated, but nothing I've heard is nearly as stupid that which I've just read today.

At the end of the class the teacher asked me to please read the bible I would learn a lot, at first i didn't think much of it but after a while I decided it would only be far if I actually really looked into the religion. Ive read a decent amount so far (just past the first testament) and I cant really say it has changed my views but I don't understand how Christians can constantly call the Lucifer the cause of all evil, here is what I think. I saw Satan as some kind of an unsung hero in the bible, he expanded Adam and Eves mind by telling eve to eat the fruit. It reminded me of the Greek mythology of Prometheus stealing fire and gifting it to humanity to help them advance their technology. But Satan never really had a say in the bible I could believe that it has been removed 100s of years ago by nutty priests trying to block out the evil in the world. Satan never really caused trouble on earth like pastors and all those kind of guys would like you to believe, also all pictures you see of a Lucifer are of him looking like some sort of horrible demon when it fact he was created as the most beautiful angel again another thing I think the church is producing to make him look ""evil"". I wont really go into kills vs kills but god has killed an insane amount of people (in the old testament I haven't really started the new yet) while Satan killed less than a handful. I simply don't understand it completely confuses me how I have never seen this been bought up before its almost as if it is something that the church has tried to suppress as it sort of breaks their beliefs. But honestly it is the number one thing that is keeping me from the religion because honestly I so far I see Satan as the good guy in the bible only doing whats best for humanity and standing against a tyrant that no human possibly could. I asked my religion teacher this in class but he just told me that it was a stupid thing to ask ""Satan is the most evil force on earth"" is what he told me and then continued on how evolution was impossible.

So, I'm going to try to start an real debate here about a topic that was one of the major points that, while fairly simple even in my youth, turned me away from religion, and I am yet to hear a sound argument against it. I'll give my side and why I take the side, and welcome anyone to refute it; I'll be as unbiased as humanly possible and fairly consider the points of all sides who have anything to say. Here goes:


If God truly cared whether or not we go to Hell or Heaven, He would prove to us His existence and let us choose to follow Him or not. There is no need for the inherent ambiguity of whether or not God exists, or which god of which religion is ""most correct"". People say that God wants us to have faith, to test out faith, or whatever, but why would an omniscient being need or want to do that? He knows exactly what will happen, so why bother needlessly distancing Himself from His creation? Why leave us, mere humans, to interpret such vague and shaky claims of such universally monumental magnitude, and expect anything other than what has historically resulted from it: violence, bloodshed, holy wars, and other atrocities all committed by people who sleep well at night feeling they are in the moral and spiritual right, that they are on the right hand of God? If a God exists and allows all this to happen, while at any point He could easily descend into some corporeal form as he has done before, present himself before the world, and undeniably state his presence and intent for the world, then he must be a rather apathetic god indeed.
 As a child, I prayed literally every night for about two years for God to send me a sign that he was not only real, but was how the Christian Bible described him, as opposed to other religions, or if not then what religion was most accurate in describing Him. I gave God my requirements, the bare minimum for me to mentally be able to believe at all, yet even those requirements remained (and still remain) unfulfilled. To me God's complete absence, his act of completely ignoring my simple requirements that were made not out of pride or angst but out of simple necessity, was proof to me that there was no God, or if there was that he was completely impersonal, devoid of personality or empathy (not that that necessarily would detract from a  deity).

This of course remains a vigorous topic of discussion, but I recently ran across an [interesting extension of the dilemma](http://philosotroll.com/2013/02/02/unmediated-presuppositional-silliness-biting-the-silver-bullet.aspx) that gets, I think, to the heart of many theistic arguments.  It was brought up in the context of the increasingly popular presuppositional apologetics, but I think its applicability is more general.

There seems to be a view common among theists that abstract objects, however we might define them, necessitate theism.  Concrete objects, no problem, atheists can account for those.  But abstract objects can only be accounted for if we allow for a god, so the thought appears to go.  We humans do not instantiate (i.e. give properties to) abstract objects (or at least *some* abstract objects), we simply observe them, but they must be instantiated by *something*, else they would not have properties.  And the ""something"" that instantiates these abstract objects, theists call god.

However, there is a problem lurking at the heart of this claim.  And it flows from the Euthyphro dilemma, because objective moral values are occasionally claimed to be such abstract objects.  If *any* set of abstract objects are claimed to be non-arbitrary, then the form of the dilemma kicks in.

* P1: There is a set of abstract objects such that all beings stand in either an observer relation (OR) or an instantiating relation. (IR)
* P2: If some being stands in IR to the abstract objects, then those objects are arbitrary.
* P3: Those abstract objects are not arbitrary.
* C1: Therefore, no being stands in IR.
* C2: Therefore, God does not stand in IR.

Common ""targets"" include, of course, morality, but also such things as logic and mathematics.  If it is claimed, as presuppositionalists tend to do, that the utility of logic depends on the existence of god, then they run into a problem if they also claim that logic is not arbitrary.",,False,,t5_2snuc,False,,,True,t3_17td03,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/17td03/to_all_extending_the_euthyphro_dilemma/,

I wanted to clarify what is and what is not actually the nature of it.

The fallacy occurs when a universal claim is made, but when faced with a counterexample, an ad hoc modifier is added to discount the  counterexample.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**3 Examples:**

**A)** A Christian need only be somebody who believes in the divinity of Christ (Evidence: WBC protest). Those aren't true Christians as True Christians would not do that.

**B)** A Christian is somebody who believes in the divinity of Christ.  No Christian would protest a soldier's funeral. (Evidence: a WBC incident).  They're not truly Christians, no True Christian would do that

**C)** A Christian is somebody who follows the teachings of Jesus Christ, including not pointing out a spec in the eye of another if you have a log in your own.  (Evidence: WBC protest again)  They're not actually Christians because they don't follow the teachings of Jesus.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A)** is the clearest example of the fallacy.  There's a distinct group which becomes modified in order to disassociate with some undesirables.

**B)** Is not actually the fallacy as the modifier comes before the evidence.  It's like if I say ""A good dog is both loyal and kind"" and then you find a mean junkyard dog and say I'm playing the ""no true good dog"" fallacy as this is a good dog which is loyal but not kind.  It doesn't meet the criteria I first deemed necessary for a good dog for it to be considered a legitimate counterexample.  While it is awfully convenient for a Christian to say that true Christians are not those which protest funerals, it's not the No True Scotsman fallacy provided the definition is prior to the example. 

**C)** Is also not the fallacy, but rather just a convenient definition.  If I say ""I define atheist humanists as those who lack belief in God and are good people.  See if you can name one atheist humanist who is a bad person"" I'm being dishonestly self-serving in how I define the group. (hint: It's because if you find somebody that labels themselves an atheist or a humanist and is bad, then I can say they merely incorrectly label themselves)

So it seems to me that the use of convenient definitions is actually the culprit in many of the occasions, but we also run into issues of personal interpretations for what constitutes the core of a religious movement or a religious label.",,False,,t5_2snuc,1350864462.0,,,True,t3_11va1a,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/11va1a/visiting_the_no_true_scotsman_fallacy/,

Why do so many people think that ""gnostic atheism"" is not a position that can be maintained and that ""agnostic atheism"" is somehow a higher state of being?


My confusion has always been this (I will try to describe it as best as possible): 

If you tell me that there is an invisible pink unicorn that follows you around and offer no evidence or further reason to believe you I will say with 99.9% certainty (0.1% margin for error) that it does not exist. No one I think would disagree with my assessment; No evidence, no ability to test the claim, and big picture insignificance... Dismiss and move on. Do I need to label myself ""agnostic"" for 0.1%? Do I need the label agnostic for ANY level of disbelief in unicorns?

So I ask, why do we somehow think the idea of a God/Gods cannot be so easily dismissed and that we need this label to qualify our disbelief in god/gods? 

When people present groundless claims are we expected to maintain and label our agnosticism to all of them? Should we remain agnostic to Russell's Tea Pot? Sure, we know it was a tongue in cheek analogy BUT you still cannot absolutely disprove it's existence. Why do we hold god/gods to some standard that we do not hold other baseless claims?

- **Because the ideas are old?** No religion still active today is older than 3,000 years and all religions that pre-date them are now considered ""fun stories"".
- **Because the stories had to come from somewhere?** Imagination is nifty thing that humans possess.
- **Because similar idea are seen in multiple distinct cultures?** Stories of wizards are found in many different distinct cultures... Does that mean there were once wizards on which all the stories are based?
- **~~**Because it is more intellectually honest to admit we don't know?** Is it? At some point we need to admit to ourselves that it doesn't matter and there is absolutely no evidence so to maintain the position of ""I don't know"" is pointless - declare certainty and move on. (Also back to dismissing other groundless claims which we do regularly and back to why are god/gods special)~~** *Thinking back, this isn't applicable to argument for the importance of the word, leaving it here for the sake of honesty.*
- **Because we will never know what triggered the universe?** So be agnostic to deism - that actually makes a little more sense... Agnosticism towards theism on the other hand is mental masturbation - Direct claims are made about theistic gods (answer prayers, sent down children, etc) none of those claims are substantiated so the base claim fails - Certainty might not be 100% but the original premise is groundless so it doesn't matter. 

Further food for thought:

We dismiss Scientology easily because we know who (L. Ron Hubbard) made it up and when (lots of people alive today actually remember)... Just because we don't know exactly who made up Christianity for example doesn't somehow protect it from being labelled fiction. We do know when it was created and it was no where near the beginning of life or even homosapien man for that matter, yet it lays claims to creation and includes an origin story... It appeared out of nowhere just like Scientology so we should be allowed to treat its claims the same - it's age does not protect it because on the grand scale of time 2000 years is nothing.

On that line of reasoning: did Jehovah have multiple personalities back in the day? Were the Egyptians just worshipping the same being as multiple deities? Were their stories completely different because God was speaking Greek to them and they didn't understand it? Was it not until the people in Biblical times came along they could actually communicate with Jehovah and record the correct stories and single personality (omitting the thousands of years prior because Jehovah decided he didn't like the Egyptians who worshipped him as like 20 people)? 

Just because these older ideas didn't spring up from nowhere during our life times doesn't mean that they didn't just spring up in the exact same was as Mormonism, Scientology, Heavens Gateism (yes I made that one up), etc.

**TL;DR:** Isn't it more honest to say one is an agnostic in regards to deism than to say they are agnostic to theism as we dismiss claims from recent religions (Scientology et all) quite easily and nothing except age really separates them from older claims like those of Christianity. Maintaining agnosticism to all baseless claims is pointless, why are god/gods special?

**Edit**: I should note we can use arguments that we use against theism against agnostic atheism as well:  
&gt; No one would tell you that it's intellectuality superior to be agnostic about the existence of Zeus, when you understand why you do not call yourself agnostic about Zeus you will understand why I call do not call myself an agnostic atheist.

**EDIT 2:** Maybe I should clarify my overall position... If you label yourself an atheist, why does it matter that you're ""agnostic"" - Yes in the pure definition of the word (""being without absolute certainty"") all atheists are agnostics, but, why do we need the label? I do not believe in god/gods with as close to certainty as possible, I can never be 100% but I do not feel we need to label that uncertainty as we would not label it for Xenu. This is not a question of ""does agnosticism exist"" because really it's just a definition, the question is more ""is it important to call ones self an agnostic to god/gods when we do not use the label in other areas of uncertainty.""

- 1) In 2 Kings 3:27, Yahweh is defeated by another god, Chemosh.
- 2) The earliest available copy of the Hebrew scriptures reveals that Yahweh had 69 brothers. Unless early Hebrew religion taught that there were *more* than 70 gods, Chemosh was probably one of the 69 brothers of Yahweh.
- 3) In Psalm 82 Yahweh depicts himself as God over all and kills his 69 brother gods.

**TL;DR**

- 1) In 2 Kings 3:27 Yahweh not only admits the existence of the Moabite god, Chemosh. Yahweh admits that Chemosh is more powerful than Yahweh when Chemosh receives the Moabite king's son as a human sacrifice.

2 Kings 3:27
27 Then he (Mesha, king of the Moabites who worshiped Chemosh) took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him as a sacrifice on the city wall. The fury against Israel was great; they withdrew and returned to their own land.

Maybe that's why Yahweh decided to sacrifice his firstborn son? So he could be more powerful?

Do you think it is inconceivable that a follower of Yahweh could acknowledge the existence of another god?

The biblical hero, Jephthah, gave Chemosh equal billing with Yahweh.

23 “Now since the Lord, the God of Israel, has driven the Amorites out before his people Israel, what right have you to take it over? 24Will you not take what your god Chemosh gives you? Likewise, whatever the Lord our God has given us, we will possess. (Judges 11)

- 2) The Hebrew text underlying the Septuagint reading of Deuteronomy 32:8-9 (below) from the most ancient available manuscript evidence (The Dead Sea Scrolls) reveals that Yahweh did indeed have 69 brothers.

""When the Most High (Elyon) assigned the nations their heritage, when he parceled out the descendants of Adam, He set up the boundaries of the peoples after the number of the sons of God;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While the LORD’S own portion was Jacob, His hereditary share was Israel.""
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Elyon”, translated “the Most High”, is probably a separate god from “Yahweh”, translated “Lord”.

The polytheistic nature of this passage became clear with the discovery in 1929 of Ugarit (related to Hebrew) texts in modern-day Syria at Ras Shamra.  The texts confirmed some of the names of Israel’s deities including Elyon.

In fact, **Yahweh appears to be only one of Elyon’s 70 sons**.  Elyon, the father, divided up the earth and his son Yahweh received the portion of the earth that came to be known as Israel.

http://triangulations.wordpress.com/2010/05/09/deuteronomy-328-9/

Literary and conceptual parallels discovered in the literature of Ugarit, however, have provided a more coherent explanation for the number seventy in Deuteronomy 32:8 and have furnished support for textual scholars who argue against the ""sons of Israel"" reading. Ugaritic mythology plainly states that the head of its pantheon, El (who, like the God of the Bible, is also referred to as El Elyon, the ""Most High"") fathered seventy sons, thereby specifying the number of the ""sons of El"" (Ugaritic, bn il). An unmistakable linguistic parallel with the Hebrew text underlying the Septuagint reading was thus discovered, one that prompted many scholars to accept the Septuagintal reading on logical and philological grounds--God (El Elyon in Deut. 32:8) divided the earth according to the number of heavenly beings who existed from before the time of creation. (Job 38:7 states that the heavenly host was present at creation.)

[DEUTERONOMY 32:8 AND THE SONS OF GOD](http://faculty.gordon.edu/hu/bi/Ted_Hildebrandt/OTeSources/05-Deuteronomy/Text/Articles/Heiser-Deut32-BS.htm)

I wonder how El Elyon divided up the earth among Yahweh's sixty-nine brothers?

We know that Yahweh's brother, Chemosh, got the region of the Moabites.

- 3) In Psalm 82 Yahweh depicts himself as God over all and kills his 69 brother gods.

God presides in the great assembly;
    he renders judgment among the “gods”:

2 “How long will you defend the unjust
    and show partiality to the wicked?
3 Defend the weak and the fatherless;
    uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed.
4 Rescue the weak and the needy;
    deliver them from the hand of the wicked.

5 “The ‘gods’ know nothing, they understand nothing.
    They walk about in darkness;
    all the foundations of the earth are shaken.

6 “I said, ‘You are “gods”;
    you are all sons of the Most High.’
7 But you will die like mere mortals;
    you will fall like every other ruler.”

8 Rise up, O God, judge the earth,
    for all the nations are your inheritance.
(Psalm 82)

""The final editors of the Hebrew canon were fervent monotheists, but a remnant of the polytheistic basis of the pre-Mosaic religion can still be detected. Albrecht Alt has shown that divine titles such as 'El Bet' el (Gen. 31:13; 35:7); 'El 'Olam (Gen. 21:33); and 'El Ro'i (Gen. 16:13); 'El 'Elyon (Gen. 14:18); and 'El Saddai (Gen. 17:1); all later taken to be one God (Yahweh) after Moses, were all originally separate gods worshipped by the early Hebrews.3 The Catholic scholar Bruce Vawter concurs with Alt. According to Vawter, none of the available English translations does justice to the original Hebrew of Genesis 31:13, which quite simply reads ""I am the god Bethel"" ('El Bet'el), who was a member of the Canaanite pantheon along with the rest of the above.4 The original meaning is therefore quite different from the traditional understanding: this god at Bethel is not the universal Lord who appeared at Bethel but just one god among many – a local deity of a specific place.""

Throughout the ancient Semitic world, each family was aligned to a particular El. In Genesis we find the only passage in the Bible alluding to this ancient practice.

The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us."" So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac, (Genesis 31:53, RSV)

Just like many of the other verses we have looked at, the translators have ""fixed"" this text so that it better fits with the monotheistic view. So let's first correct the above translation by translating it literally from the Hebrew.

The Elohim of Abraham and the Elohim of Nahhor, they will judge between us, the Elohim of their father, and Jacob swore with the fear of his father Isaac.

Note that the Hebrew states, ""they will judge,"" not ""he will judge,"" therefore we are looking at two different Elohim, one belonging to Abraham (the ancestor of Jacob) and the other to Nahhor (the ancestor of Laban). Because we are looking at two different Elohim, the Elohim in the phrase ""the Elohim of their father"" must be used in the plural sense.

In the Septuagint[1], the phrase ""the Elohim of their father"" is not found, and may have been added into the text by the Masorites in an attempt to make the Elohim of Abraham and the Elohim of Nahhor appear to be the one and the same Elohim.

Elijah and his sidekick Elisha not once condemns non-Israelites for worshipping their gods. Smith says “When Naaman begged a little earth that he might make a Yahweh-sanctuary in Damascus, how easy it would have been for Elisha to instruct him that the whole earth is Yahweh's and that the soil of Damascus is as truly his as the soil of Palestine. But the opportunity passed without improvement. Neither Elijah nor his biographer thought that the woman of Zarephath ought to give up the service of her Baal on the ground that there was no God but Yahweh. These facts are inexplicable except on the theory that neither Elisha nor Elijah nor the men who wrote their lives denied the existence of the heathen gods. Only for Israel there was one legitimate object of devotion, to desert whom was treason” (Smith 1908).

We know this because, for the first 1500 years of Christian history, just about all of the people who were supposedly “in Christ” also failed to condemn slavery. 

But let’s say Jesus was just too much of a generalist to come right out and condemn any particular cruel practice. Maybe it’s up to each one of us to figure out for ourselves exactly what Jesus meant. 

But there is a problem with that theory. 

Jesus also said the Holy Spirit was going to come and guide his followers into “all truth”. 

So one would think that the apostles would have received from the Holy Spirit the revelation that this ""golden rule"" thing meant that slavery should not be practiced. After all, the Holy Spirit revealed to Peter that pork was cool. And the Holy Spirit revealed to Paul that circumcision was no longer necessary. Surely the Holy Spirit could have seen his way to also drop a revelation about slavery being bad? If he wanted to.

Instead the fact is that Peter and Paul were more concerned with changing people’s attitudes and behaviors in relation to pork and foreskins than they were with changing people’s attitudes and behaviors in relation to slavery. 

Obviously pork and foreskins are much higher priorities than human suffering but how can anyone justify the fact that it took the Holy Spirit Guided Body of Christ some 1500 years to even start to wonder if slavery might be wrong and only about 15 minutes to approve pork and deemphasize circumcision? 

Only one church father, Gregory of Nyssa, wrote critically of slavery. But Gregory was the lone voice crying in the wilderness and the Body of Christ is a collective. The guidance of the Holy Ghost is expressed by the Body of Christ which collectively supported slavery for 1,500 years. And no other Church father or even one Pope could arrive at the conclusion or even speculate that *maybe* slavery was wrong until over 1500 years after the Holy Ghost started guiding the Body of Christ (the Church). But, by God, slaves and slaveowners alike could eat bacon.

And surely some Christian over the centuries should have felt led by the Holy Spirit to *actively* challenge the institution of slavery politically, out of love for his fellow neighbor. Yet it did not occur to even one Christian (each of whom Paul refers to as a ""letter from Christ"" (2 Cor 3:3) to do this until almost *1700 years* after Pentecost.

You'll often hear about wonderful human experiences like looking up at the night sky, sitting and playing with your newborn, feeling that warm breeze, there had to have been a creator right? How could any of that be an accident? Other times you have more formalized forms of it like teleology, which posits that there are things which have purpose and act towards an end but outside of human agency which suggests another intelligent actuating party.  

The issue is, you assign this necessity to the Universe but offer no explanation as to why this necessity doesn't apply to God himself. You have the Universe, which by all accounts is significantly complex by our limited faculties, and this complexity and order moves some to think that there had to have been a creator. However, this creator is almost always defined as not only being more complex and more ordered than the universe but **infinitely more complex**. 

And I honestly do not think the usual theistic objections regarding infinite regression or God's timelessness apply here. That's usually what comes up when ""who made God?"" is asked. Those are irrelevant objections. The point is, if you think that something had to have been designed because of complexity, there needs to be some criteria you're excluding something else by, otherwise the Universe can be just as exempt. How I see it:

1) If something complex or purposeful exists in any measure, it had to have a designer

2) God is infinitely complex and purposeful

3) God had to have had a designer???

See what I'm getting at? Its not the one asking ""who made God?"" that is running into the problem of infinite regress, its YOU who is running into the problem of infinite regress by positing that things that are complex must have a designer. 

So personally, when I ask that, I'm not putting things in a timeline or talking about causation or creation or actuation or anything like that, I'm simply talking properties. Infinity doesn't really solve anything, in my mind.

The 'Free Will Defense' (hereafter, FWD) is an argument which is often heralded as a defeater to the logical problem of evil (PoE). Given a god who is at once omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect, the presence of evil in the world seems to contradict the possibility that such a being could exist. Al Plantinga (and Peter van Inwagen, to name but two of the prominent theistic philosophers) claims that if there is an intrinsic good reaped from presence of free creatures in the world, then it may turn out that the presence of evil is compatible with this sort of god. I shall here briefly outline the FWD, and offer an argument for why it is flawed.

First, some housekeeping. Let's unpack just what we mean by 'omnipotent,' 'omniscient,' 'morally perfect,' and 'free will' (or 'free creatures'):

* *Omnipotence* is, for the purposes of this article, the ability to do anything which is logically possible. There will be no discussion of rocks so large one cannot lift them, or square circles (though it can be argued that a circle with infinite radius is a square, or that a square with infinite side length or diagonal is a circle), or any other such nonsense. If *A* is logically possible, then an omnipotent being can do *A*, or make *A* obtain.

* *Omniscience* is, for our purposes here, fairly limited. I define it as the instantaneous knowledge of all and only true propositions, where 'knowledge' is the classical formula of 'justified, true belief' with some undefined Gettier qualifier.

* *Morally perfect* means that whatever moral system obtains, a morally perfect being is aware of this system and abides by or defines it.

* *'Free will'* is the ability to do otherwise, given a complete mental (including physical, as appropriate) state. *'Free creatures'* are those moral agents which possess this trait.

I shall also assume *Compatibilism*, if not an outright denial of *Determinism*; I do not wish to get bogged down in details over the metaphysical possibility of 'free will' (which is dubious), and at any rate I am effectively granting Plantinga's first premise.

Plantinga's FWD: an overview
---

---

1. (Assumption) There is an intrinsic moral good realized from having free creatures in the world.
2. (Assumption) The moral good realized from having free creatures in the world [necessarily in all cases] outweighs any harm done from evil committed by these creatures.
3. (Definition) A morally perfect being would prefer a world in which the net moral good was necessarily positive (or maximized).
4. (Definition) An omnipotent being could create free creatures in the world.
5. (Definition) An omniscient being would know (3) and (4), and would also know that a) some free creatures would commit evil acts, and b) given (2), moral goodness would yet be a net positive.
6. (Granted premise) Interfering with the free choices of free creatures would significantly diminish the moral good realized from having such creatures.
7. (Definition) God is defined as an omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect being.
8. (Conditional proof) Therefore, if (1) and (2), and if god exists, god would create free creatures with minimal interference in their free choices, such that the moral good from having free creatures outweighs the harm done from evil acts by them committed.
9. (Follows from (8)) Therefore, the existence of god is compatible with the presence of evil. QED.

---

A problem of evidence, which undermines Plantinga's FWD
---

---

Insofar as this is not an exposition of the 'evidential' PoE, there is yet evidence which can be admitted to call into question the soundness of Plantinga's argument:

1. (Definition of soundness) If the FWD is sound, then its premises are true and its conclusion follows from them.
2. (From FWD premises) Therefore, if it is sound, the amount of intrinsic moral good realized from the existence of free creatures must necessarily in all cases outweigh the harm done from evil acts committed by these creatures.
3. (Evidence) But the intrinsic moral good realized from the existence of free creatures may in some cases be outweighed by the harm done from evil acts committed by these creatures.
4. (Definition) Therefore it is not the case that the intrinsic moral good realized from the existence of free creatures necessarily in all cases outweighs the harm done from evil acts committed by these creatures.
5. (*Modus Tollens*) Therefore, the FWD is unsound.

So what of this evidence in (3)? There is much here to be said, but clearly, first, this counter-argument is valid. Its premises are all either definitions or drawn from the FWD's own premises, with the lone exception of (3) -- which is why it is the sticking point.

---

An arithmetic primer
---

---

The FWD relies heavily on its second premise: ""The moral good realized from having free creatures in the world [necessarily in all cases] outweighs any harm done from evil committed by these creatures."" The bracketed portion signifies the implicit modality and quantification of the claim, which is likely controversial. I'll deal with that controversy later. For our purposes in this primer, I merely note that *in order for FWD (3) to be applicable in a given world, it must be the case that in that world the moral good outweighs the moral evil*. That is, FWD (3) has significant bearing on the logical space available to FWD (2).

Consider a pair of worlds, W^1 and W^2 . In each world, there is exactly one free creature, who is able to make exactly one morally significant free choice, and then the world is [by god] annihilated. Keeping the FWD in mind (as its premises, with exception of (2), are granted here), consider the net moral good realized in each world given the following arbitrarily assigned values:

World|MG(MFC)|MG(MSC)
|:-|:-|:
W^1 | 10 | 11
W^2 | 10 | 9

*(with MG(MFC) = moral good realized from the existence of a creature with free will, and MG(MSC) = moral good realized from a morally significant free choice)*

Note that W^1 is clearly a better world than W^2 . Now recall our definition of 'free will': *the ability to do otherwise*. This definition bears a modal claim that it is *possible* to do otherwise, which can of course be recast as the modal claim that is is *not necessary to do as-wise* (forgive 'as-wise'). Let us now consider a third world, with some FWD-specific modifications:

World|n(MFC)|n(MSC)/n(MFC)|MG/MFC|net MG
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:
W^3 |2|2|10|20 + *x*

Note in this world that we have increased both the number of free creatures and the number of morally significant free choices. Note also that we have a variable *x*, denoting the value of the moral good realized from the free choices made by the creatures in the world. As this value is linked indexically  both to the creature in question and to the choice in question, it would be inappropriate to specify a figure without some explanation, which I shall do through a few scenarios (more are easily generated but unnecessary):

1. MFC(1) commits MSC(1) = MG(10) and MSC(2) = MG(10); MFC(2) commits MSC(1) = MG(10) and MSC(2) = MG(-10).

2. MFC(1) commits MSC(1) = MG(10) and MSC(2) = MG(-10); MFC(2) commits MSC(1) = MG(-10) and  MSC(2) = MG(-10).

3. MFC(1) commits MSC(1) = MG(-10) and MSC(2) = MG(-10); MFC(2) commits MSC(1) = MG(-10) and MSC(2) = MG(-10).

The outcomes of these scenarios, in terms of net moral goodness, are as follows:

Scenario|net moral goodness
|:-|:
1|40
2|0
3|-20

Now, given the definition of 'free will,' clearly each of these scenarios is possible, yet clearly a net positive moral goodness is not a foregone conclusion: it is possibly the case that the evil committed by free creatures can outweigh the moral good realized from their very existence. Of course, I've arbitrarily assigned numbers here, and limited the number of free choices significantly -- surely every day each of us faces thousands of morally significant choices. Driving oneself to work, for instance, provides the opportunity for as many morally significant choices as there are moments in which one might choose to collide with another vehicle or a pedestrian.

Hence, arithmetic.

In order for FWD (2) to obtain, the value assigned to the moral good realized from each individual free creature must be so high that it can outweigh the *possibility* that all of the choices we make are evil -- yet this means our free choices must themselves be significantly limited, which is anathema to FWD(6). Likewise, FWD(3) faces difficulty with the arithmetic, because whenever a finite value is provided for the existence of a free creature, the fact of 'free will' threatens the balance desired by a morally perfect being.

---

Objections and conclusion
---

---

The conclusion is plain enough to see: I take it that FWD(2) is untenable, and indeed refuted by the evidence available. Plantinga's argument is unsound, and the [logical] PoE survives. Due to space constraints, I'll entertain only one objection here, and the rest in comments:

1\. *The inclusion of ""necessarily in all cases"" is neither a requirement nor really a part of Plantinga's FWD. Your argument pivots on that modal claim, and falls if it is removed.*

Not quite. While I clearly added the explicit modality, it is, as I noted, implicit in Plantinga's version. In order for his argument to retain *validity*, it must be the case that it is possible for the moral good from free creatures to outweigh the moral evil by them committed. But this is a Pyhrric victory. To require only that it is *possible* that moral good outweighs moral evil in a world is insufficient for any being properly called 'morally perfect.' Surely any such being would seek to minimize the chance of moral evil. Couple this with the other attributes of god, and it's easy to see that as soon as the third scenario above obtains (read: Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, etc.), an omnipotent (much less omniscient) being would seek to mitigate things and end the world.",,False,,t5_2snuc,False,,,True,t3_17i6ol,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/17i6ol/on_plantingas_free_will_defense_by_request/,

1353580802.0,32,self.DebateReligion,13m6m9,"To Christians who claim to have a personal relationship with God, why would God choose to reveal themselves to some people and not others?",38,6,160,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/13m6m9/to_christians_who_claim_to_have_a_personal/,"For clarification, I'm not talking about miracles. That's another very interesting discussion to have but not in this thread.

I've often heard of people having a personal relationship with God, and claiming that God came to them in a dream, opium fever, meditation, whatever. Some of them may even claim to see prayer as a 2 way communication, including everything from literally hearing the word of God to a simple feeling of reciprocation and that their words were heard. 

However, I grew up moderately religious until a certain age. I went to church, Sunday school, all that good stuff. Not once when I put my hands together and thought about God did I get even a hint of communication from them to me. It's not as if I wasn't trying; I had my own problems with life (and I won't bore you with them) that I sought guidance to get over at a young age (and I mean &lt;10), and I had heard constantly about how you could always ask God. So I did over and over again.

But I was never satisfied. People often describe a revelation of any kind as a ""click"" or ""light turned on"", but none of that ever happened to me; I just felt like I was talking to myself. And like I said, this isn't about me praying to get an A on a test and I didn't so I said ""fuck all this God stuff"", it was as simple as asking for mere guidance. 

I've seen similar stories to mine all over the place, so I'm not trying to make a case of this isolated incident (so save the proselytizing about helping me find the 'real' God), I'm just using it as an example. 

----

So to reiterate my question, why would a benevolent God who seems to reciprocate contact with so many people decide to ignore someone else? Haven't they held up their part of the bargain to reach out to God, and he is rejecting their inquiries to know him better?

To take it a step further; why would God be content with anyone lacking a belief in them when it would be easy to make nearly everyone in the world a believer? Before you pull out the ""free will"" argument, I'm not talking about purposefully tinkering with our heads, I mean something as simple as appearing to everyone on Earth at the same time as an apparition. 

I don't know about you, but if Jesus showed up in my bedroom right now in the flesh and could tell me things no one else would know; walk on water in my bathtub; and prove I wasn't dreaming/insane, I would convert. I may have questions, and it may take a while for me to come around, but I consider a 2000 year old super human Jew in my presence about a million times more convincing than the Bible. 

Considering that an estimated 3/4 of the world is not Christian and assuming that you guys have it right, that means a vast majority of humans walking around on the Earth will spend the rest of eternity having the flesh flayed from their skin, yet God is apparently perfectly fine with that. It seems to be a pretty severe punishment for not choosing the right religion, especially when the case for Christianity is anything but concrete and has no more innate credibility than Islam, for instance.

“But the new rebel is a skeptic, and will not entirely trust anything. He has no loyalty; therefore he can never be really a revolutionist. And the fact that he doubts everything really gets in his way when he wants to denounce anything. For all denunciation implies a moral doctrine of some kind; and the modern revolutionist doubts not only the institution he denounces, but the doctrine by which he denounces it. . . . As a politician, he will cry out that war is a waste of life, and then, as a philosopher, that all life is waste of time. A Russian pessimist will denounce a policeman for killing a peasant, and then prove by the highest philosophical principles that the peasant ought to have killed himself. . . . The man of this school goes first to a political meeting, where he complains that savages are treated as if they were beasts; then he takes his hat and umbrella and goes on to a scientific meeting, where he proves that they practically are beasts. In short, the modern revolutionist, being an infinite skeptic, is always engaged in undermining his own mines. In his book on politics he attacks men for trampling on morality; in his book on ethics he attacks morality for trampling on men. Therefore the modern man in revolt has become practically useless for all purposes of revolt.

* Here's the scene, he's staying in the Jewish Theological Seminary for a conference: [Edit: An academic confrence, not a religious one.  As far as I know RPF was not a religious man.]
&gt; And then one day - I guess it was a Saturday - I want to go up in the elevator, and there’s a guy standing near the elevator. The elevator comes, I go in, and he goes in with me. I say, “Which floor?” and my hand’s ready to push one of the buttons.

   &gt;“No, no!” he says, “I’m supposed to push the buttons for you.”

 &gt;  “What?

  &gt; “Yes! The boys here can’t push the buttons on Saturday, so I have to do it for them. You see, I’m not Jewish, so it’s all right for me to push the buttons. I stand near the elevator, and they tell me what floor, and I push the button for them.”

 &gt;  Well, this really bothered me, so I decided to trap the students in a logical discussion. I had been brought up in a Jewish home, so I knew the kind of nitpicking logic to use, and I thought, “Here’s fun!”

  &gt; My plan went like this: I’d start off by asking, “Is the Jewish viewpoint a viewpoint that any man can have? Because if it is not, then it’s certainly not something that is truly valuable for humanity … yak, yak, yak.” And then they would have to say, “Yes, the Jewish viewpoint is good for any man.”

   &gt;Then I would steer them around a little more by asking, “Is it ethical for a man to hire another man to do something which is unethical for him to do? Would you hire a man to rob for you, for instance?” And I keep working them into the channel, very slowly, and very carefully until I’ve got them - trapped!

   &gt;And do you know what happened? They’re rabbinical students, right? They were ten times better than I was! As soon as they saw I could put them in a hole, they went twist, turn, twist - I can’t remember how - and they were free!I thought I had come up with an original idea - phooey! It had been discussed in the Talmud for ages! So they cleaned me up just as easy as pie - they got right out.

Edit2: To quote /u/kicorro1, 
&gt;Well, first, you need to accept for the sake of argument that there is a god, that he did command the jews to keep the sabbath, and that part of the sabbath entails not operating electronics, e.g. an elevator.

The rest of the animal kingdom doesn't seem to care about rights much, and neither do we seem to place their rights on the same level as our own. Indeed, other animals *only* have rights because they are enforced by us, if we stopped they would have no recourse. 

The Declaration stated that these truths are ""self-evident"". However, they have certainly not been self-evident to all people at all times. I'm quite certain that many people now living *don't* hold them to be self-evident, North Korea being a pointed example. 

Our tradition of rights is *derived* from the belief the framers held of a Creator who grants them (whether the creator they all believed in was the Christian God or not is irrelevant to this particular point).

This is something I have a problem with; while it's certainly a good idea to learn what we can through careful study of evidence, it doesn't follow that a rejection of religious, faith-based ideas leaves us with nothing but unfeeling logic and bare facts.

To borrow from Bruce Lee in *Enter the Dragon*:

&gt;It is like a finger pointing a way to the moon. Don't concentrate on the finger or you will miss all that heavenly glory.

And yet, don't forget the finger, because without it you cannot find the moon.  Carl Sagan often talked about the necessary balance between skepticism and wonder.  I think that many atheists forget that; in their zeal to subject religion to (well-deserved) criticism and skeptical analysis, they forget that the emotional content of our subjective experience is important *to ourselves*.  We understand the molecular makeup of chocolate, and that's a good thing, but that doesn't stop us from enjoying chocolate.  We know why the sky is blue and the sunset is red, and that the two are products of the same process, but that doesn't detract from our apprehension of the beauty of the sunset.

I definitely think that atheists are right to mistrust the things that our minds do; as human beings, we are as susceptible to being fooled by our own inner experience as anyone, and we do well to refrain from making unjustified claims about the cosmos based solely on subjective experience.  But it is that experience that gives us the inspiration to ask the questions, and it remains incredibly valuable both to us and to the culture in which we find ourselves.  Many religious people believe in god because of personal experience; while they are wrong to do so, it behooves us to understand and appreciate the power and value of those experiences.",,False,,t5_2snuc,False,,,True,t3_zc5y6,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/zc5y6/to_atheists_on_the_value_of_subjective_experience/,

1371718542.0,38,self.DebateReligion,1gptxm,To All: Why objective morality is an useless concept,51,13,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1gptxm/to_all_why_objective_morality_is_an_useless/,"To start with, I want to clarify what I'm referring to.

As I understand it, objective morality comes in two sorts: Point of view independent morality, and universal morality.

The first is the kind of thing Sam Harris proposes. A morality that (ideally) when followed by different people still comes to the same conclusions. For instance if ""good"" means ""minimizes suffering"", and we have a way to measure it, then we have an objective way of determining what good is, by doing a comparison. This kind of morality can have a subjective origin for its axioms (the decision to care about money above all is quite arbitrary), but once those are agreed on, the same conclusions should follow regardless of who is examining a situation. 

Universal morality on the other hand, holds that the same rules apply to absolutely everybody. Choosing different axioms is not allowed. If God says that adultery is bad, then it is bad world-wide, even if some culture agrees among themselves they have no problem with it.

Here I will be talking about the second kind. I will be attempting to show that it's an useless and impossible in reality concept.


For a start, what good does it do to claim that your morality is objective? Imagine that you're cornered by an armed robber at night. He demands all your valuables. You claim ""God says stealing and murder are objectively wrong"". The robber retorts with ""I don't care, I still want your stuff"", sticks a knife in your guts, and runs away with your wallet.

My point here is that claiming to be objectively right does you absolutely no good if people don't agree with you. The ""objectively"" part of the claim is effectively meaningless. Either people agree with what you're doing, or they don't. Adding a claim of being objectively right doesn't win arguments.

The other problem is that objective morality doesn't have an objective beginning. Why should God's commands be followed? Because he's the creator of the universe? Because he's great? But deciding to care about greatness or creation is a personal decision. People aren't forced to obey the highest power.

Caring about God's wishes, and any punishments he might impose is also a personal decision. People are perfectly capable of deciding that a punishment is worth it.

Suppose my father gives me an ultimatum: ""You follow my rules, or I kick you out!"". Does this make his rules objective ones that I must obey? No. I can decide that it's more important to myself to live however I please, and accept getting kicked out. Same goes for any other punishment.

Same happens with God. I can make the personal decision that God's displeasure, going to hell, or anything of the sort is worth it to do whatever I think I should. If I make the decision that murdering a certain person is worth an eternity of torment, then to myself, it is, and God not liking it isn't going to do anything to stop me.

A further problem is that God isn't here to answer questions, so ultimately any such rules are filtered through my own flawed, subjective judgment. Ultimately it is I who decides what rules I will obey, and which I deem more important. The multitude of Christian denominations shows this perfectly: there's no feedback that allows us to determine who got it right, and as a result religion keeps splintering. Martin Luther created an entire major branch out of disagreement on what's important.

But even if God were to make the exact rules perfectly clear, we still have a problem. Anything we see or hear is interpreted by us personally. Even if the words ""Love your neighbor as yourself"" were clearly written in the sky, it's still our mind that interprets what ""Love"", ""neighbor"" and ""as yourself"" mean, and it's quite clear that different people have different views of the meaning of that sentence.

So, to follow this objective morality, I must necessarily:

* Subjectively choose a religion
* Subjectively choose a denomination
* Subjectively decide that I care about God
* Subjectively decide that I care about what God wants
* Subjectively determine the ordering of the rules, what is most important
* Subjectively determine what does the rule mean exactly. Is it ""You shall not kill"", or ""You shall not murder""? What does ""murder"" mean, exactly?
* Subjectively apply the rule. Ok, ""you shall not"", but what does one do about it? Do we kill those people? Imprison them? For how many years? Do we make exceptions for very young offenders?

So, obeying a simple rule already involves a mountain of subjectivity, which is never to go away. Sam Harris' morality in fact seems to have less subjectivity to it, as all that it requires is to agree that suffering is bad, and the less of it, the better. 

TL;DR: Claiming your morality to be objective does nothing for you in an argument, caring about God's wishes is a subjective decision we're free not to make, and the interpretation of any scripture is highly subjective as well, all of which contaminates this objective morality with more subjectivity than found in secular alternatives.

So where is the evidence that ""nearly all"" cases had no law enforcement involved, which is what the post prior to mine claimed was evidence of an actual top down cover up?

_____________

This theist clearly demonstrated skepticism and a demand for empirical evidence.  Personally I think it was because his beliefs were clearly being challenged with empirical evidence - but the question remains:

When a theist demands empiricism and remains skeptic in one (or many instances), why not apply this mindset to their own theism?

1367258271.0,34,self.DebateReligion,1dcnl8,To all: What are your baseline assumptions?,41,7,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1dcnl8/to_all_what_are_your_baseline_assumptions/,"I know, this is DebateReligion, not DebatePhilosophy, but since so many religious discussions devolve into philosophical ones, I thought it might be helpful for everyone here to see the basic, most core assumptions others are making. And I'll start.

---
1) I exist.
---
---
Kierkegaard famously argued against Descartes' *cogito ergo sum* by calling it a tautology, and insisted that the existence of the self is actually a presupposition required for any thought to occur at all.

I can't prove that I exist, even to myself. But failure to accept the reality of my existence leads inevitably to the absurd conclusion that it is impossible to know anything - even that conclusion. It is a useless position called ""radical skepticism"" that essentially stops all conversation. It can be used to object to nearly any philosophical position, but if you use it in a debate with me, I will immediately halt the conversation and dismiss you until you can come up with an argument better than ""all knowledge is suspect.""

---
2) My senses are at least somewhat accurate, and are strongly indicative of the existence of an externality.
---
---

So we've accepted our own existences. What's next? The universe. Does the universe exist? Or am I just a brain in a jar being fed false stimulus?

Once again, there is no way to prove the universe exists, and disprove the brain-in-a-jar hypothesis. But like radical skepticism, this position is a conversation-stopper, and fundamentally useless.

---
3) Models of reality with predictive capability have more value than those without.
---
---

Inductive reasoning in a nutshell. When I touch my nose, I will feel a certain kind of sensation, as opposed to something else happening, because I know from experience that will happen. Wait... OK, I just touched my nose, and I felt exactly what I expected to feel. I have successfully performed some predictive modeling. So it has proven useful once again.

Will it continue to do so? Well, I could tell you, except I'd need predictive modeling in order to be sure. I can't prove it with itself, that's circular reasoning. All I can tell you is that it has worked so far. So I have to presuppose it.

But if I don't presuppose it, I have no reason to believe touching my nose will result in that particular sensation over anything else happening. And if I only presuppose it for some things, what is my dividing line between that which predictive modeling works upon, and that which is exempt from it?

I think this is the weakest of the presuppositions I've listed, because it is at least theoretically possible that something will come along to confound it, which means I must accept it provisionally. There is a tiny asterisk at the end, leading to a footnote that reads, ""Subject to change should new reasons come to light that indicate predictive models are not more valuable after all.""

Of course, I don't really expect anything to come along and overthrow it. Based on past experience, of course. ;)

---

Now, I contend that everyone must make these three assumptions. Everyone accepts their own existences as a baseline. Everyone accepts the evidence of their senses. Everyone accepts that prediction of future behavior from past experience is effective. At least, in our day-to-day lives we function as if these are all accepted. The radically skeptical, solipsistic Last Thursdayists who reject all three in all circumstance are rare - probably because accepting them is also a survival trait.

These are the three basic operating principles that seem to work best, from my perspective. What about you? What are the baseline assumptions you make that you can't prove, but consider to be so fundamental that arguing against them is tantamount to arguing against the foundations of one's own arguments as well?",,False,,t5_2snuc,False,,,True,t3_1dcnl8,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1dcnl8/to_all_what_are_your_baseline_assumptions/,

These can be things that are morally wrong, such as the Old Testament's endorsements of slavery, genocide, killing rebellious children, stoning adulterers to death, etc. Or they can be factually wrong, such as pretty much all of Genesis.

The standard replies I get from Christians are:

* The old laws don't apply anymore. God made a new covenant when he brought Jesus into the world.
* These bits are only intended as metaphors.
* These bits are only intended as guidelines or illustrations.
* It is wrong to question the word of god.
* That it was right in the culture of the time.

**If your holy book says something that is obviously wrong - either factually or morally - then your holy book has said something that is wrong.**

For instance, if the book tells you something that you know is wrong, don't try and hide from that itching, nagging feeling that something doesn't add up. If it is wrong, it is wrong. There is no point trying to re-interpret what god might have meant, trying to re-word it or re-frame it in some other way so that it looks more palatable to you.

We realize that people don't deserved to be put to death for being gay, working on the sabbath, or disobeying their parents.

In a nutshell, the distinction is the difference between using a word or phrase -- ""Love is an emotion"" -- and mentioning a word or phrase -- ""Love is a word in the dictionary.""

A use-mention error occurs when you confuse a reference with its referent, or confuse the properties of the reference with the properties of the referent.

Consider a stone. If I say, ""that big stone over there is rolling down the hill, heading towards the river,"" I have used teleological language to describe the stone's motion. Its final cause is to end up in the river. But while my language is teleological, does that mean the stone's motion actually has a final cause? No. My *description* uses teleological shorthand to simplify what would otherwise take a long time and many words to say, but my doing so has in no way imparted properties to the stone itself that it didn't already possess. To say otherwise is to engage in a use-mention error.

When you engage in use-mention errors, it leads to all kinds of absurdity. To use my stone example, a stone becomes a five-letter word. Or you can find a stone in the dictionary, rather than the word ""stone."" Silly, huh.

It's (supposed) to be based on rational thought and discourse. Now, dealing with current laws and basic logic, I'm going to attempt to make an argument for the legal reason for abortion being illegal and/or punishable by law. This basic idea comes from Kreeft, but I want to rephrase it and make it less pretentious sounding.
 
So, we have four options when it comes to an unborn child: 

1.It is alive and we know it.

2.It is alive and we don't know it. 

3.It is not alive and we don't know it.

4.It is not alive and we know it.



In each of these cases, a different legal precedent would be set. 

In case one, it is clear cut murder - I would be knowingly killing an innocent person. In case two, it would be manslaughter. If there is a body shaped lump in the road, and it turns out to be a person, and I killed them I am legally responsible for their death. While I didn't know it was a person, I am still legally culpable.

In case three, I am guilty of criminal negligence. I fumigated a building without checking. Even though I had no evidence of a person, and even though there was no person, I am still guilty because I acted without care or responsibility. I can and should be tried for criminal negligence. In case four, abortion is completely fine. However, Kreeft points out that ""skepticism counts not for abortion but against it. Only if you are not a skeptic, only if you are a dogmatist, only if you are certain that there is no person in the fetus, no man in the coat, or no person in the building, may you abort, drive, or fumigate.""

Now, we may rule out certain situations -  namely, situation 1 and situation 4. We do not know when a 'person' becomes so. 

Therefore, at best, either the doctor or the mother - or indeed both - are at best guilty of criminal negligence and should be prosecuted as such.

This is an incontrovertible truth of logic and mathematics.  But if I pour one glass of water into another cup of water, do I have two glasses of water?

No, I do not.  I have one glass of water, possibly overflowing onto the table, and another empty glass. *This real-world situation does not model arithmetic at this level of abstraction*. Despite the surface similarity between adding integers and putting the contents of two glasses together, they are fundamentally different. 

The failure of real-world situations to correspond to a similar-sounding logical structure gets much subtler than pouring water.  Some of the world's smartest people spend a lifetime studying logic and its real-world analogues, building real-world models of logic structures to exacting specifications.  They even get continuous, empirical feedback on the accuracy of their  model, unlike philosophers. And they still [fail in disastrous ways](http://rdist.root.org/2009/05/28/timing-attack-in-google-keyczar-library/).  There's a lot of popular and academic writing on this problem under the name ""leaky abstractions."" 

So, when you come to a logical conclusion about reality, there's two independent ways you could be wrong: You could have made an invalid step in the logic, or you could be working with an inapplicable model.  Unfortunately, there is no way to *logically prove* that your model is applicable. Your final uncertainty must be the probability that you made a logical mistake, multiplied by the probability that your model deviates from reality in some important way--and this latter probability is almost always underestimated, *especially* here.

Some people modify this slightly and say that some evil does exist, because humans have free will, but 'natural' evil does not; all earthquakes and tornadoes (which is to say, all things directly in God's control) are part of God's great plan. In view of this, I would ask we restrict the discussion that follows *only* to 'natural' evil, since this is the 'harder' problem.

So let's pick an example at random of some natural evil that I think is absolutely unjustifiable by any morally competent being; allowing smallpox to exist if you know how to cure it. Let us assume God allowed smallpox to exist even though he could have removed it from the world in order to teach us a lesson - perhaps She knew it was the fastest way to teach us about vaccines? This does raise a very important question as to why She couldn't have just told Moses or Mohammed about vaccination when She was talking to them, but let's leave that aside and assume that was impossible for some reason. It is easy to be thankful for the invention of the vaccine - I myself am thankful every time I hear how many lives are saved every year by Western medical science - but it takes a theist to be thankful for the Polio beforehand.

Indeed, a theist should almost be *more* thankful for the Polio than the eventual vaccine; a 'naive' moral view would be that Polio is bad; if it were in my power to eliminate Polio, for example, I would have done it. But God - in Her infinite wisdom - saw that Polio was necessary. So giving thanks for good health, or your favourite sports team winning, or for getting a job you wanted is fine, but you should be REALLY grateful for beloved relatives getting cancer, earthquakes killing millions of otherwise blameless people and virulent, incurable diseases (because these are the things that humans would never strive to achieve - by which I mean they would never happen if humans were in charge of their own destiny in the sense theists mostly believe God is in charge of human destiny - but fortunately God knows they are necessary and so causes them to exist/happen)

It's things like:

- How do you justify God sending people to Hell if God is good?

- Why did God create the universe with so much empty space?

- Why doesn't God make himself obvious?

This isn't a bad thing because generally the more times a system of beliefs must respond with ""I don't know"" or come up with a flimsy response, the less likely it is to be true.

But it isn't that strong.  After all, not having a complete explanation of everything is sometimes germane to the field at hand.  A good example being Alien Astronaut Theorists who basically make a living off of trying to find ways that archaeologists can't explain some structure and then claiming a historical/terrestrial explanation will not suffice.

The ""method of pointy questions"" is by its nature very kind to atheism since atheists don't have much that they must defend.  The less beliefs you assert, the less pointy questions can be made about those beliefs.

What I would like to see more of though, is a stronger form of argument, namely inductive and deductive arguments.

1. If there is extra space in the universe, then God does not exist

2. There is extra space in the universe

3. Therefore God does not exist

You'll notice that this places the burden of evidence on the person making the argument whereas before they had just a question and no burden.  Yet if they can justify their premises as likely (or absolutely) true and have valid logic, then what is being said is much more substantial.

In the same way the Alien Astronaut Theoriest might have to make an argument like this:

1. If mathematics unknown to the Egyptians is reflected in the building of the Pyramids then aliens helped build the pyramids

2. Such mathematics were reflected in the building of the pyramids

3. Therefore aliens helped build the pyramids

Clearly when put into place of making an assertion, the alien astronaut idea starts looking a lot cheaper than it might have before.  Rather than pointing to something mysterious and how the other guys can't explain it, they have to defend what their actual assertions are.

The same might benefit our conversations here.  It's not that the atheists' case is on par with the Alien Astronaut Theorist, it's merely that I think we can challenge ourselves more than we do now.

&gt;It's true: Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris and Daniel Dennett and even sweet lovable PZ Myers. I am not making this up. These gentlemen, with their impressive and sustained frontal assault on all religion everywhere, have scared me.

And he notes where the real distinction is between himself and atheists: not his belief in god, but his pessimism.

&gt;What truly separates me from atheism is not my belief in God; that's a long way from the point of departure. It is instead my conviction that evil and weakness are not only problems to be solved, but are also reliable clues to the secret of the world. For me the emptiness of the glass is, in James' words, ""the best key to life's significance, and possibly the only opener of our eyes to the deepest levels of truth.""

I've heard it a few times in the past, in fact.  It's a persistent pessimism, a focus on things going from bad to worse, a surrender to how terrible things are because we can't make the world a better place on our own.  A friend of mine likes to say that I have a ""higher anthropology"" than he does, since I believe that most people are generally good people, and want others to be happy.  He, on the other hand, being a Christian theologian, holds to man's depravity, helplessness, and inability to solve problems without help from Jesus.

So, is it true that one of the hallmarks of the modern atheist movement is optimism?  I think so.  Is it the case that this separates atheists from theists in an important way?  In at least some cases, apparently.  Is such optimism *warranted?*  I think it is; violence is declining, prosperity is increasing, people are living longer, healthier lives, and we are oddly enough living in one of the most peaceful eras in history.

1345265608.0,35,self.DebateReligion,yezcp,To all: On philosophical equivocation,38,3,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/yezcp/to_all_on_philosophical_equivocation/,"Several recent posts on free will and determinism reminded me that I've been meaning to delve into the topic of the precision with which we define our words and terms.

One of the biggest problems with philosophy of religion seems to be a lack of rigor in the definitions used therein, at least to me. When I see the Kalam, for instance, it is patently obvious that William Lane Craig is using an overly-broad definition of ""begins to exist"" that intentionally avoids specifying the manner in which a thing begins existing. He has been called out on this, and has dug in his heels, claiming that it doesn't matter that his definition is broad enough to cover both the creation of new things out of old (clothing from wool, furniture from wood, etc.) and the creation of matter, space, and time (from...? Nothingness? Pure will? A previously existing universe?)

Craig stands by this broad definition, declaring it perfectly valid to equivocate this way by stating that the causes he is arguing for are efficient causes. The problem is that we have no way of knowing whether or not efficient causes can apply to both the creators of things within the universe and to the universe's theoretical creator. And we have ample reason to reject the idea, as efficient causes require time -- a feature of the universe.

His argument wouldn't work if he was more specific. If the Kalam's first premise was that ""everything that begins to exist *from pre-existing materials within a temporal framework* has an efficient cause,"" then it would be using a much better, much more rigorous definition of ""begins to exist."" But the second premise would no longer follow very well from the first, and the conclusion would be a non-sequitur. The only way to make it work would be to include an awful lot of wiggle room for rejecting the argument as a proof for God, such as putting it like this:

1. Everything that begins to exist from pre-existing materials within a temporal framework has an efficient cause.
2. The universe began to exist from either pre-existing materials within some sort of temporal framework, or it did not.
3. The universe either does or doesn't have an efficient cause.

Much more rigorous, but not very convincing as an argument for God, is it?

Now let's look at some other problematic words and phrases from recent posts;

**Free will**

The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy defines free will [as follows](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/):
&gt; “Free Will” is a philosophical term of art for a particular sort of capacity of rational agents to choose a course of action from among various alternatives.

Hoo-boy... The lack of specificity in a definition like that speaks volumes for the coherency of the idea. And the encyclopedia acknowledges that fact with what immediately follows the definition:

&gt; Which sort is the free will sort is what all the fuss is about. (And what a fuss it has been: philosophers have debated this question for over two millennia, and just about every major philosopher has had something to say about it.)

There are several main schools of thought regarding free will, how to more precisely define it, and how it works. The incompatibilists define it such that it is incompatible (hence the name) with determinism, and thereby declare that as we demonstrably have free will, determinism must be false. Compatibilists, as should be obvious, regard free will as real, but inextricable from causal reality, and thus compatible with determinism. Fatalists reject free will entirely, claiming that determinism proves it false.

It should be noted that while most theists would take an incompatibilist stance and most atheists a compatibilist or fatalist stance, there is some crossover. For instance, there are theist fatalists who reject free will because it is incompatible with the determinism implied by God's omniscience.

For our purposes here, let's focus on compatibilist and incompatibilist definitions. I'll call the first definition of free will *A* and the second *B*:

* **Free will A**: “Free will” means the capability to logically analyze choices using the brain's available knowledge, biases, and preferences, and determine which choice is optimal. It is a purely deterministic process.

* **Free will B**: ""Free will"" means the capability to determine which choice is optimal in a way that is not determined by the brain's knowledge, biases, and preferences. It is a non-deterministic process.

Obviously, if two people arguing over free will haven't figured out which of these definitions they're using, they'll never get anywhere. When a compatibilist says ""free will,"" it's almost certain he's using the *A* version (or something similar), which describes decision-making in the context of inescapably deterministic factors. When an incompatibilist says ""free will,"" she is declaring it to be antithetical to determinism. The incompatibilist's idea of free will pre-supposes non-deterministic reality, so obviously our ability to make choices rules determinism out, while the compatibilist's idea of free will rejects non-physical sources of decision-making, so of course it's compatible with determinism.

The thing is, we definitely do have the *A* version of free will. Our brains are demonstrably decision-making engines.

Do we also have a touch of the *B* version? Maybe, if the uncertainty principle has any bearing. But one thing we definitely do not have is the *B* version exclusively. And that becomes quite clear once your terms are clearly defined. Any failure to differentiate between these versions of free will is basically equivocation.

**Teleology**

This is a recent realization on my part: All the fuss about final causes comes to us because Aristotle lumped all goal-directed agents together. But some are not like the others.

According to Aristotle, a final cause can exist regardless of whether or not such causes involve conscious deliberation and foresight. To him, the cause of me reaching for my cup of coffee (to drink it) is the same kind of cause a stone rolling down a hill possesses (to reach the bottom).

From this arises all the argumentation about teleological language in science, how and why to avoid it, the apparent implications of inescapable teleology, and so on.

But was that a proper categorization on Aristotle’s part? Well, that depends on whether or not you think...

* “Goal-oriented” agents capable of planning and foresight; and
* Agents that behave as if goal-oriented, but are incapable of planning and foresight

...amount to the same thing, and are appropriately described as a single concept.

More and more, biologists and those involved in philosophy of science reject grouping the two together. The term “teleonomy” has been coined to describe agents of the latter type. These agents can be described without teleology, but *resemble* teleological processes enough that it is simpler in the English language to describe them with terms that, on the surface, are teleological.

Under Aristotle's original definition of teleology, being or behaving in a goal-oriented manner means having a final cause, regardless of the presence of intelligence setting that goal. But with the advent of teleonomy, teleology gains a narrower and more precise definition. There is only a final cause if the agent is capable of choosing a goal and perceiving how to achieve it. So there is still a final cause when I reach for my cup of coffee, but no longer when the stone rolls down the hill.

It can be -- and is -- argued that this is semantic quibbling, just coining a new term to avoid the implications of teleology. But like I said, as we've seen with recent posts concerning evolution, it is possible to describe it in non-teleological terms. So the implications of teleology can already be avoided in biological sciences. Dividing teleology into teleology/teleonomy just gives us is the ability to use simpler, goal-oriented language without implying an *actual* teleology.

-----

I contend that all of the examples I've described share a common trait: They maintain their theistic argumentative power by placing unlike things within a single definition, thus smuggling in an equivocation. For ""begins to exist,"" the equivocation is put forward blatantly, and defended as valid, by the Kalam's supporters. For ""free will,"" the equivocation is subtler, resting on the finer points of our decision-making capabilities. For teleology, it's not necessarily an equivocation on Aristotle's part so much as an overly-broad definition he didn't realize was overly broad. (I'll forgive him for that; until I read up on teleonomy, it hadn't occurred to me that foresight was an important factor, either).

So I've rambled enough. What say you all?

- no sign that God is interfering with the editing and mistranslating of his text which will be read by billions of people (I feel is the biggest one and basically the last nail in the coffin) 


- the fact that other religions exist

Wouldn't you say that if there existed a 'God inspired Holy book' that the things mentioned above would be non-existent in it. Wouldn't you say that if a God did create the universe, he wouldn't want to be identified with the Old testament God. 


Or are you static in your belief that the bible was inspired by God and the supernatural things within it actually happened. That nothing will convince you otherwise. The same way that a developing society might believe that rain is caused by crying angels in the sky. You try and convince them by teaching them that it is water molecules that evaporate and then fall when too heavy in the sky. The angelists respond by reconciling science and angelism by saying that the angels just go down to lakes, take sips, fly up and spit the rain out when high enough. The moral of that story is that these angelists are static in their belief and will never listen to evidence. There is always ways of reconciling beliefs with assumptions. 


Would there be no way of convincing yourself?

**Problem of evil**:  Evil exists in the form of unnecessary suffering.  Either God can't or won't stop it.  If God can't, then He's not all powerful.  If God won't, He's not all good.

**Argument from mystery**:  Evidence for God could be better.  Either He can't or won't furnish better evidence.  If He can't, He's not all powerful.  If He won't, then He's proportionately disinterested in that we should believe in Him.

**The statistical inefficacy of prayer**:   Prayer doesn't seem to have [any effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studies_on_intercessory_prayer) on health.  I'm unaware of any peer-reviewed/published-in-a-reputable-journal studies that show prayer having any affect on the physical world outside of that which is plausibly attributed to psychology.

Other arguments such Dan Barker's [FANG](http://ffrf.org/legacy/about/bybarker/fang.php) end up couched in philosophy and can be dodged through redefining God's traits or other (questionably reasonable) ploys that make the idea of God less falsifiable.

He creates this 93 Billion lightyear in diameter universe, the earth and all the people on earth. Then he only concerns himself with the Middle-East and then narrows it even more to the Israelites, deciding to have a personal relationship with them, helping them fight wars against those that don't believe in him, revealing his message to them, giving them laws, the best way to live life etc.He also sent all of his prophets exclusively to the Middle-East. Does that maybe tell you that 'Yahweh"" was maybe just made up by the Israelites/Canaanites.

",40,6,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/umi8p/to_fallacycallers_the_genetic_fallacy_fallacy/,"The genetic fallacy is defined on Wikipedia as “a fallacy of irrelevance where a conclusion is suggested based solely on something or someone's origin rather than its current meaning or context.” One example given is “America will never settle down; look at the rabble-rousers who founded it.”

This is already markedly different from the way the term is generally used here: Someone says they can explain why people hold a certain belief; that belief’s defender says “explaining its origin doesn’t mean it’s not true, that’s the genetic fallacy.” But if it’s a fallacy, it’s the kind that usually leads to correct reasoning, in the real world. 

Let me attempt to demonstrate.  Consider a child pulling a prank on his parents as they prepare to leave the house.  He turns on a lawn sprinkler pointing at the window, flashes a strobe light, and shakes a panel of sheet metal.  As the parents finish putting on raincoats, rubber boots, and grabbing umbrellas, he runs in, displays the light and sheet metal, and starts laughing, “ha! I gotcha!”  What the kid is saying is that he knows the origin of his parents’ belief that it’s raining. He has not logically proved that it is not raining outside, but for the parents to point that out triumphantly would just be retarded.

Once you have shown that someone’s *reasons* for a particular belief are not actually *evidence* for that belief, you have reduced that belief’s likelihood to whatever its prior probability was.  In the case of rain, that’s anywhere from sub-1% to 70%, depending on where you live.  In the case of a philosophical model, that’s probably something so low that you wouldn’t even consciously consider it without the incorrectly evaluated evidence.

How do Christians condone this? If you do, when do you think its right to excommunicate someone and for what reasons? Do you really think someone who comes out as gay should be excommunicated?

1332325699.0,31,self.DebateReligion,r6kh3,To Atheists: Does Empiricism require faith?,46,15,223,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/r6kh3/to_atheists_does_empiricism_require_faith/,"Very often, the main argument against a certain belief is that it requires faith and that there is either very little or no empirical proof for that religion or religious claim. The implication is that empirical claims are somehow more valid than other claims. As far as I can tell, empiricism requires faith, and quite a bit of it. If I am wrong, I would like for you to explain to me how you can believe these things without faith.

Here is what I would say are the basic assumed beliefs of empiricism:

1. There is an objective, immutable reality outside of my own existence. 
2. My senses, at least much of the time, are accurate and accurately represent that external reality. 
3. My mind is capable of accurately analyzing the data presented to it. 
4. My memory, at least much of the time, is capable of accurately recalling what it has previously perceived and analyzed, and it is not common for extra memories to be inserted. 
5. Time moves in a linear fashion so that I am able to apply cause and effect. 
6. My current context is correct, and I can safely throw out any which are contradictory (i.e. dreams) 

Every one of these must be assumed without any evidence that doesn't require itself to be true. Further, if any one of these are taken away or proved to be false, then the whole system fails. These things being the case, it seems to me that they can only be accepted by faith alone.

None of these things must be accepted as true, and are considered to be false to a solipsist, and perhaps by other belief systems. Some people, including some mystics and occutists deny some or all of these claims, and (assuming the empirical worldview is true) they still deny them while being able to live happy and arguably productive lives. Various religious or spiritual beliefs may exist which start from fewer assumptions and still arrive at similar conclusions.

If you believe that your empirical worldview is true, then you must accept that there are people in existence who you can know that, if they accepted these same claims as you do, for them they would be incorrect relative to yours. Examples include people who are dreaming and under the effects of hallucination, particularly those hallucinations caused by psychosis rather than just drugs.

This is not to suggest that people should be solipsists. I would imagine that very few if any people are solipsists. Most people do believe in something, even if that something is believed by faith. Perhaps, you may even argue that people default to this faith for some reason, and that may be discussed in a later thread. In this discussion, I would prefer to consider whether it is accepted by faith, rather than why you might suggest it is the right or best faith.

EDIT: it seems to me that a large number of comments make the argument that empiricism is justified because it is common to all people or that there is no other option. I can say with complete certainty that is not the case. I am a Christian. I did not arrive at any of these claims by assumption. However, I sit here typing on my laptop, which I do believe is real, and I write to people who I believe to be real. I do not believe in what I see in spite of my faith, but because of my faith in the Bible. If I ceased to believe in the Bible, I would cease to believe in reality of the world as we know it. That is because before I was saved, I was so deep in the occult and philosophy that I didn't even think that I was a real physical human. At that point, I did have trouble getting out of bed, and some days I did not. However, now, I accept this world, because it seems to be the only way for the Bible to make sense.

EDIT2: Well, it seems like the arguments here generally boil down to only a few separate arguments. Here's what they seem to be to me:

1. By dictionary definition, you can't have faith in empiricism because it is given the special exemption. Therefore, we don't have to justify why we make these assumptions.

2. Yes, these must be taken by assumption only, but there is no other choice. In other words, not solipsism therefore empiricsim.

3. Everybody believes it, therefore we should believe it regardless of whether we must make assumptions.

4. It proves itself, therefore it must be true. For instance, if it is true, then there are other people who exist and say that it is true, therefore it must be true.

5. Other popular beliefs prove those claims within their context, so it is safe to simply jump to those claims and throw out other beliefs that lead to them.

None of these seem to address the question, at least as far as I can tell. They seem to me to simply ignore the matter in some way or another. Almost all of them seem to rely on empiricism to make their case for empiricism. This is the reason that before I was saved, I could still not be an Atheist. I did not have enough faith in empiricism, and I couldn't justify to myself believing in something by circular reasoning. I tried hard, but I could not reconcile that worldview. I was hoping that such a forum as this could show me something I missed.

The short answer is that the idea of perfection is arbitrary and is a human concept that has no bearing on the world. One person's idea of perfection is not the same as another person's, and certainly the universe couldn't give a shit less what a philosopher thinks about perfection. 

Attributing real world properties (like existence or not existence) to a concept (like perfection) does not necessitate the truth of that concept. 

My favorite example:

    1. The perfect woman would have sex with only me (and ScarJo) whenever I wanted.
    2. The perfect woman would also be Kate Beckinsale.
    3. The perfect woman would also exist.
    4. Since I can conceive of no woman hotter or more perfect than Kate Beckinsale, 
          Kate Beckinsale will have sex with me (and ScarJo) whenever I want it. Giggity. 

    5. QED.

This 'proof' of course is absurd - because for NukeThePope, the perfect woman would not have sex with only me whenever I wanted, the perfect woman would have sex with only *him* whenever *he* wanted. 

These two different versions of perfect can't possibly both exist. Perfection is not a real thing, and therefor the definition of perfection cannot be used to prove something exists.

Reoccurring examples are the Thomas Aquinas argument regarding an unmoved mover which contradicts the second law of thermodynamics and the Kalam cosmological argument which takes cause for granted in a situation where cause is in fact very hard to insert into the physical understanding.

All credit to the original constructors of these arguments but they  based the arguments on very rudimentary thinking about physics. ie. the Thomist argument tries to explain energy transfer without any knowledge of fundamental forms and mechanisms of energy and energy storage.

1.
We can of course debate the metaphysical implications anyway but:
Is it wrong to say that the first thing to do, with classical arguments based on how our reality works, is to review whether their picture of physics is yet valid? Or otherwise acknowledge that the physical framework of the argument is outdated today but the debate only concerns the resulting hypothetical  philosophical framework of the outdated physics?

If not, please elaborate.

2.
Is there any interest in trying to revalidify or create new such arguments by embracing physics.

Why? Remember that the original arguments are built on assumptions of how our reality works. The trend to assign them to purely philosophical arguments is destructive for both theists and atheists: It makes the arguments irrelevant to reality as to compared to their originally intended impact and the honesty of using them becomes highly questionable.

Agree/disagree? Why?

3.
Is there any argument for God based on non physical assumptions out there? Devoid of the flaws above?

Don't be afraid to use this argument, but keep in mind that the border moving back to fulfill thee above mentioned arguments is not really an realistic option.

[Recent events in Bangladesh](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/world/asia/two-days-of-riots-in-bangladesh-turn-deadly.html?_r=0) are just the latest example of a violent clash that at the very least seems to involve the some form of the Muslim faith, and they have already sparked [some intense discussion in this subreddit today](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1dsqdm/its_not_a_small_minority_of_muslim_extremists/).

A common question that is raised is how much the actions of select groups of Muslims reflects the overall views of the religion and its adherents as a whole. Considering both sides are attempting to extrapolate to [the world's second largest religion with almost 1.6 billion believers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam), this can obviously be problematic. Therefore, I thought it might be useful to integrate some new data into our understanding of Muslims as a group.

* [**THE PEW FORUM ON RELIGION &amp; PUBLIC LIFE: The World’s Muslims: Religion, Politics and Society**](http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/Muslim/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf)

Linked above is the very recently published data from [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewresearch.org/), which did an in-depth survey on a wide variety of topics pertaining to Islam, consisting of face-to-face interviews with over 38,000 Muslims in countries in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. This data is also combined and compared to an earlier data-set from a few years prior of Muslims in the United States, although this is a relatively small portion of the total report. The report itself is quite large; at about 140 pages I have only had a chance to skim it thus far. However, there is obviously a great deal to be gleaned from its pages, and the data can better inform our various positions and views of just how popular many views are within the Islamic World. So let's dive in, shall we?

* **Summary**

Based on what I've read so far, I believe i can *very roughly* summarize the overall tone of the results in a few sentences. It seems that, overall, the large majority of Muslims are indeed what we would consider to be rather moderate individuals, at least where violence is concerned. Certainly such harsh generalities as ""most Muslims support killing non-Muslims"" can be thrown out the window before we even get on the highway. It is also apparent that views can range wildly from country to country on particular issues, and that overall Muslims are a rather heterogeneous group. *However* there are plenty of findings that trouble me as an atheist. While many of the more severe views are overall less common than an anti-theist like myself might expect, some views are even more popular than I would have guessed. Even more troubling, while some positions might hold a minority worldwide, certain countries and regions can end up largely in favor of some startling views. Finally, there is data presented that could reasonably support arguments that both condemn and absolve religion's role in such things, based on certain predictors.

For the sake of space, rather than go into significant detail, I shall reproduce some of the most interesting stats I have found in a number of areas below, along with a brief explanation.

* **[Sharia law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia_law)**

* % of Muslims who favor making sharia the official law of their respective country:

Top Three: Afghanistan (99%), Iraq (91%), and (tie) Malaysia &amp; Niger (86%)

Bottom Three: Azerbaijan (8%), Kazakhstan (10%), and (tie) Turkey &amp; Albania.

Median by region: South Asia (84%), Southeast Asia (77%), Middle East/North Africa (74%), Sub-Saharan Africa (64%), Southern/Eastern Europe (18%), and Central Asia (12%).

Some things to note; countries in which Muslims make up large or overwhelming portions of the population tend to have much higher support for enshrining sharia. Countries that also have laws and a government that favor Islam over other religions and the nonreligious are also much more likely to have high support for sharia. Both of these facts suggests a cultural/political component to this position. However, how often a believer prays daily (a common metric of how devout or religious one is) is a powerful indicator of how likely he/she will be to support sharia. This can add anywhere from +10% to +37%. Interestingly, support for this position very largely remains the same irrespective of age, gender, and even education. 

There are two important modifiers to this position; whether one believes sharia law should apply to everyone or just the Muslim population, and what parts of sharia should be enforced.

* % of those Muslims that support sharia who believe it should only apply to Muslims:

Top Three: Kazakhstan (77%), Thailand (75%), Russia (70%)

Bottom Three: Egypt (25%), Kyrgyzstan (36%), Afghanistan (37%)

Median by region: Southern/Eastern Europe (64%), South Asia (60%), Central Asia (59%), Southeast Asia (55%), and Middle East/North Africa (51%)

So while the majority of Muslims worldwide and in each region do not support applying sharia law to everyone, it is certainly not an overwhelming majority, especially in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. A notable exception is Egypt, where 55% of *all Muslims* (or 74% of those who support sharia law) think it should apply to everyone.

* **Suicide Bombing**

Muslims as a whole are overwhelmingly against suicide bombing. Support is the minority in every country, although a couple countries have a very large minority. It is not surprising that these exceptions are countries with Muslim populations that are both relatively devout and large, and that these countries are experiencing ongoing political turmoil.

* % of Muslims who believe attacks against civilians in defense of Islam can often/sometimes be justified

Top Three: Palestine (40%), Afghanistan (39%), Egypt (29%), and (due to this weeks relevance) Bangladesh (26%)

Bottom Three: Azerbaijan (1%), Kazakhstan (2%), and (tie) Tajikistan &amp; Bosnia-Herzegovina (3%)

* **Apostasy**

Muslims are pretty well-split when it comes to punishing leaving Islam with the sentence prescribed by the faith; death. Many countries in the Middle East/North Africa and South Asia are amazingly in support of this punishment, while those in Europe and Central Asia are very much against it (Southeast Asia is somewhere in the middle).

* % of those Muslims who support sharia who favor the death penalty for converts:

Top Three: Egypt (86%), Jordan (82%), Afghanistan (79%)

Bottom Three: Kazakhstan (4%), Albania (8%), Kosovo (11%)

* **Evolution &amp; Science**

Muslims are overall mostly of the belief that humans and other organisms have evolved over time (the survey does not clarify beyond that). 13 of 22 polled countries have a majority believing in theistic evolution versus the idea that we have always existed in present form. Notable exceptions include Iraq (only 27%) and Afghanistan (only 26%). Most Muslims also do not believe there is an inherent conflict between science and their religious belief, with surprising exceptions in Lebanon (53%) and Albania (57%).

* **Moral Issues**

While Muslims tend to be more moderate overall in terms of issues of violence, as a group they are overwhelmingly conservative on matters of perceived morality. For example, every single country surveyed has a majority of Muslims believing drinking alcohol is morally wrong, and in most of those countries overwhelmingly so. The highest exception is Chad with 23% saying it is morally acceptable (it should be noted than some countries have significant percentages claiming it is not a moral issue, up to 34% in Albania). Muslims also overwhelmingly believe that all of the following are morally wrong; suicide, abortion, extramarital sex, homsexuality, and prostitution. Most Muslims also consider divorce immoral, but they are far more divided on this issue. Same goes for polygamy.

* **Women**

Although most Muslims favor a woman's right to choose whether or not to wear a veil in public, there are a great many countries where those in favor are in the minority. This is especially prevalent in the Middle East and Africa (both North and Sub-Saharan). Interestingly, however, the large majority are of the belief that wives must always obey their husbands, with most countries reporting percentages in the 80s or 90s in favor. Interestingly, while women tend to be more in favor of liberal positions than men, the differential never surpasses +22%, and averages closer to only +11%.

There are plenty more interesting statistics in this report, and I urge everyone to at least skim through it for a few minutes. Some potential discussion and debate topics that I would suggest are relevant to the findings:

* Is violence in the Islamic world still a major issue of concern, given these numbers? Does the data support religious motivation for things like suicide bombing, apostasy killing, honor killing, etc., or are the political and cultural factors more important?

* Is the role of women in the Islamic world a reasonable one in the 21st century? Can they rightly be considered an oppressed demographic, or not? 

* Is the desire to enact sharia as law of the land a concern in many of these countries? Is it possible to do so in such a way that it only applies to Muslims? Are non-Muslims threatened in countries where significant percentages wish to apply sharia to everyone?

* How does one reconcile the belief that science and Islam are not in conflict with the wide acceptance of the Quran as the divinely inspired word of God? Is it concerning that more Muslims think no conflict exists than do accept evolution?",,False,,t5_2snuc,False,,,True,t3_1duio8,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1duio8/an_injection_of_data_into_the_discussion_of/,

A common counter-argument to this is that the text no longer applies for some reason. *In the Leviticus example above,* some Christian apologists reply that these Old Testament are no longer applicable, having been superseded by the New Testament. (Sacrifices and dietary restrictions, at least -- it's apparently still cool to hate on gays.)

Assumptions: 
--The New Testament is the critical body of text for contemporary Christian religious practice.
--Christians believe the Bible is the infallible ""Word of God"" (http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~fisher/gnt/chapters.html). This posits an originalist interpretation of the Bible.
--The New International Version is an acceptable translation of this holy word. (http://www.biblegateway.com). I understand some use the King James version, *e.g.* http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/)

So, why do Christians not universally follow the New Testament 1 Corinthians 11:1-34?

&gt;3 But I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. 
4 Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. 
**5 But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head—it is the same as having her head shaved.**
6 **For if a woman does not cover her head, she might as well have her hair cut off**; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, then she should cover her head.
7 A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. 
8 For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; 
9 neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. 
10 It is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority over her own head, because of the angels. 
11 Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. 
12 For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God.
13 Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? 
*14 Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, 15 but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering.* 
**16 If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice—nor do the churches of God.**

1343743129.0,33,self.DebateReligion,xg5vo,"To Christians, esp. Kalam advocates: the Malak Anti-Cosmological Argument.",41,8,187,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/xg5vo/to_christians_esp_kalam_advocates_the_malak/,"**Abstract**

As the title of this post indicates, this argument is directed towards Christians who accept the [Kalam cosmological argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kal%C4%81m_cosmological_argument) as a valid and sound argument for the existence of God.  My goal here is to demonstrate, by the use of a relatively mild [*reductio ad absurdum,*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum) that the type of inductive reasoning on which Kalam rests can just as easily be used to prove that God does not exist.  Since the rationale in question [proves too much,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proving_too_much) it must be discarded if we are to honestly maintain that we value and seek truth.

**The Argument**

* Everything that exists had a beginning.
* God did not have a beginning.
* Therefore, God does not exist.

**Validity**

The argument follows basic [modus tollens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_tollens) form, and is thus structurally valid.
 
**Soundness, Premise Two**

Premise two follows naturally for all definitions of God that render him the causal agent responsible for the universe.  *""Since God created time,""* the reasoning goes, *""God cannot exist within or be bound by it.""*  Given that premise two is a secondary conclusion that can be drawn from Kalam, and that the intended audience of this post already accepts Kalam, there should be little to no dispute over premise two.

**Interlude &amp; Crescendo**

Syllogistic logic is an extremely powerful tool.  If the argument is structurally valid and the premises are factually sound, you *cannot* escape the conclusion--it *necessarily* follows.  Thus far, we've satisfied the former criteria, and are only one step away from fulfilling the latter.  So, where could things go from here?  Possibly, you will accept the first premise, completing the argument and leading you to some form of strong atheism.  More probably, you will reject the first premise while maintaining that the analogous premise in Kalam is still sound, and in so doing betray an uncomfortable tension that raises certain unpleasant questions about your intellectual honesty.  Ideally, you will come to realize that the first premise *and* the analogous premise in Kalam both rely, essentially, on the application of our ""common sense"" intuitions about the world to the distinctly *un*common territory that is the metaphysical realm.

 **Soundness, Premise One**

Premise one is confirmed by universally consistent observations of existent things; in other words, inductive experience with the world around us points us strongly towards the truth of premise one.  Though I shan’t fallaciously demand that my opponent provide an example of an existent thing that did not have a beginning apart from God, I will point out that a complete lack of such defeaters to premise one would be highly suspect, and would likely necessitate a further conversation to explore the possibility that God is simply the beneficiary of [special pleading]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading).  Perhaps we can agree that premise one seems more likely than its negation; after all, it simply isn’t the case that we observe various permanent or eternal objects in the world around us.  In sum, I doubt that anyone can sincerely deny the truth of premise one.

**The Challenge**

Without a doubt, you have a whole glut of objections to the material here presented.  So, here’s your opportunity to voice them!  *Please furnish an objection to either the structural validity of the argument or the factual soundness of its premises that cannot be lodged against Kalam with equal force.*  Thanks for reading!

I consider it a mark of respect when a person tries to proselytize me. It means they consider me worthy to receive salvation, that I am capable of receiving their message.

If you believed you knew the truth of God and the path to salvation, it is your moral obligation to share it with others. Even if you are totally wrong. 

If I believed a bus would hit a stranger, even if I was raving mad, I should very much like to tell that stranger he would be hit by the bus. I must warn him, whether I am delusory or telling the truth.

So, when many of my Christian friends try to convert me, I begin by thanking them for considering the salvation of my soul. They were not indifferent. They did not hoard the (alleged) truth and keep it behind closed doors, but they proclaimed reality as they saw it to the world.

And when I confront a religious person and they will refuse to elaborate about their beliefs or attempt to convince me, I consider that an insult. It means they do not care to share the truth with me. That the truth is for them and I am not deserving of it.

In return, I would be happy to watch whatever video you consider to be the very best argument for theistic belief.

The whole playlist can be played from [here](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA0C3C1D163BE880A&amp;feature=plcp). If you watch it, let me know. And I'll update this post with my thoughts on whatever videos you send me... within reason. I have a day job, after all.

While I think the man's arguments are patently ridiculous and amount to little more than well-disguised equivocation -- easy enough to rip apart in written contexts -- he's such a talented speaker that it's pretty rare for him to get nailed in public speaking forums. He usually leaves his opponents too flustered to adequately deal with the barrage of almost-logical argumentation he produces. I would encourage any theists who think highly of him to watch him taken down a peg by people who are unruffled by his delivery.)

Using ancient Roman mythology and the Abrahamic religions as examples.  The people of ancient Rome truly took Jupiter's desires into consideration and believed that Apollo rode his chariot across the sky.


A Muslim, Jew, or Christian, would likely dismiss such beliefs as naive or ridiculous because we now know, thanks to modern science, that this just isn't the case.


Yet, as a YEC Christian where humans came from, and they will tell you that a deity made the first man out of dirt or dust and then a woman out of his rib.  Even though modern science has clearly shown this is not the case, the belief is still widely held on to in western culture (about 40% of people in the United States).


In fact, the beliefs held by the religious today can only seem to be ""proven"" my personal testimony, appeals to emotion, arguments from ignorance, or logically invalid arguments cryptically put together by apologists with the gall to call themselves philosophers. 
 

Is there anyone here that can show me that there is more of a difference between mythology and religion than just the number of people today that believe it's all true?  Are there any arguments that can be used in the case for religion that can't be used to argue that any of the ancient Greek, Roman, Egyptian, or Norse gods existed?

1. Any post making a positive claim for God's existence or describing any properties of God (omniscience, omnipresence, immortality, etc) must include in the post references to peer reviewed scientific journals that prove either the veracity or very least plausibility of the claim. Citing unscientific theistic pseudo-journals run by organizations like the Discovery Institute or Answers in Genesis is grounds for immediate and permanent banning. Failure to cite your sources will result in a temporary ban to last no more than four weeks for first time offenders. Second time offenders will be permabanned. 

2. If you cite the bible as a scientific source, you will be permabanned. 

3. Mentioning Thomas Aquinas or promoting any of his arguments is grounds for immediate banning for all time. 

4. If your argument has previously been refuted and no new evidence has been put forward to make the argument  something to reconsider, then you will be permabanned.   If can be shown that the offender was unaware of previous refutations, the offender will be placed under a probationary ban lasting not more than two weeks. 

5. Posts arguing for any supernatural phenomena without relevant citations from credible scientific journals will result in a first time offense probationary ban lasting no longer than two weeks. A second offense will result in a permaban. 

6. Posts supporting any form of Young Earth Creationism (without reference to God) must first be vetted in r/AskScience. If the argument passes in r/AskScience, then it may be proposed in r/DebateReligion with proper sources, including scholarly journals and a link to the r/AskScience post.  If not, you will be immediately banned for all time. 

7. Any post relying on past events to make a claim that doesn't rely on archaeological evidence must be supported with proper citations to non self-published scholarly history books. Self-published is in reference to the author, not necessarily the OP or commenter. Failure to cite sources will result in a week long ban for the first offense. Second offense will result in a permaban. 

8. Any claims made of the distant past concerning some facet of human civilization must include valid archaeological citations from reputable archaeological journals not connected to theistic organizations like DI or AIG. Citing a theistic pseudo journal will result in a permaban. Failure to cite a source will result in a one week probationary ban for first time offenders and a permaban for any second offense. 

9. If a Christian is found arguing in philosophical circles, he or she will have the tag MORON placed next to their name for a period of one month for each reported offense.  

10. Permabanned Christians will be included in a list along the sidebar titled, ""The Wall of Shame.""

11. Atheists love Muslims so none of this applies to them.

I wanted to give a more thorough account of why this attitude is incorrect.  

The first thing is that on some subjects it's directly contradicted by the text.  [Luke](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+1&amp;version=NIV) begins with Luke claiming to be writing a very accurate historical account.  [2 Timothy](http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-16.htm) claims the bible is useful for attempts at being righteous.

Moreover, users of this rebuttal don't make some important distinctions.

- What is intended by the authors

- What is expected by adherents of the religion

- What the bible would be expected to look like if there were a divine finger behind it

The first two aren't particularly relevant to the argument that the bible is inadequate.  If the authors intended to write anything less than that which we should expect of the God of classical monotheism, then this is proof against the divine inspiration of the books.  If adherents of a religion have expectations, they can easily be wrong.

**What should we expect from the bible?**

A number of things come to mind, a world map, a reasonable account of hygiene and germ theory, and maybe something like a discussion of the social contract.

I'd throw in whatever theistic arguments might be successful if theism is true (somehow the Kalam didn't make it in?).  I'd bring up how many chromosomes humans have because that would be radical confirmation of unknown knowledge that would help confirm the divine inspiration of the book.

It's nothing I wouldn't do and I don't even have perfect knowledge.  That's the kind of stuff that would be put in there if God wanted what was good for us, wanted us to believe true things, was interested in our belief in Him, and wanted to verify for us that the bible is true.  Regardless of the intent of the authorship and regardless of what adherent expect, this is what *should* be in the bible given our background understanding of what God or even just a decent person with a fair amount of knowledge would do.  It wouldn't have to be a complete library of biology, but just enough as would be necessary to confirm the bible or otherwise provide significant help to people.

Even if God couldn't bother to get any of my examples in there, we should still expect some kind of info unknownable to Iron Age Greeks, Romans and Jews, something more helpful, and something more confirming of theism/that the book is divinely inspired.

**What we actually get**

Apparently there wasn't enough room for this because we needed 4 books telling the same story about Christ, painful to read geneaologies,   [completely unnecessary detail about how the Ark of the covenant was built](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+37&amp;version=NLT), [some guy tripping out](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+1&amp;version=ESV), an account of creation that would confuse the shit out of people who are apparently reading it wrong, including our dutiful historian Luke who seems to think [Genesis was an actual history](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+3%3A23-38&amp;version=ESV).  Most of this stuff is useless, boring, and confusing stuff and I've only mentioned a few parts of it.  If you think the bible should be that, then I don't think you have a healthy expectation of what God would produce for His primary communication to us.

**And of course this is an entirely one way street** 

If there were things like the chromosome count, a world map, etc. in the bible, it would be put on parade and taught to us from our first day in school (a bit hyperbolic, but you get the idea).  No one would discount this information if it was in there because ""the bible is not a science textbook""

This is in fact attempted by some people who say Job adequately describes the water cycle, or more commonly amongst muslims who claim the Quran has a divine account of how embryology works, though this is much more dubious and therefore generally discounted by anyone without a prior theological commitment.

So yes, there are many things not found in the bible that we would expect if behind it all was the inspiration of a perfectly good being who wants us to have a decent amount of true beliefs, doesn't want us to suffer, and wants us to believe in this book.",,False,,t5_2snuc,1372527077.0,,,True,t3_1hbas7,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1hbas7/the_inadequacies_of_the_bible/,

These were among the first questions I asked when I started to doubt Christianity and look deeper into Atheism. My beliefs no longer hinge on these questions, but I was curious as to what responses people had. 

1) How can both suffering and an omnibenevolent omnipotent being exist?

2) If the Holy Spirit unifies, why does the Christian church contain three schismed traditions and 30,000 protestant denominations?

3) If the Holy Spirit guides the church, why has Christianity appeared more human than divine throughout history?

4) If God is omnipresent why is evidence for his existence nonapparent?

5) If God is love why are his followers so full of hate? It would seem that people worshiping, praying, studying a loving God would themselves be more loving. If religion doesn't change anything in the religious, what purpose does it serve?

6) How can I be certain that this all isn't just wishful thinking? I'm not an atheist because I want to be an atheist. I'm an atheist because it's the most likely conclusion. The promise of God seems more like wishful thinking than the truth. How can we ascertain what is real about God and what is simply confirmation bias?

1364254885.0,34,self.DebateReligion,1b09o8,Secular arguments against homosexuality,45,11,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1b09o8/secular_arguments_against_homosexuality/,"So I've often heard that there simply are no nonreligious arguments against homosexuality.  I may be reading such statements wrong, but I wanted to use this submission to prove two contentions and raise some difficult questions.  

The two contentions are these:

- Secular arguments against homosexuality can exist in principle.  That is, we can at least imagine such a thing.

- The people who argue against homosexuality do (if very infrequently) appeal to secular reasoning

Forgive me, but I think I've picked some very easy contentions for myself.

I've been reading Scott Rae's *Moral Choices* and Scott in fact does bring up some secular objection to homosexuality.  I'll paraphrase:

**HIV (utilitarianism)** - HIV has much higher rates of transmission amongst homosexuals.  I couldn't see any citations for this (it was on audio and he doesn't explicate on anything) so I did my own research.  According to the CDC, male to male homosexual activity transmits HIV at a rate more than [6 times that of heterosexual transmission](http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance/basic.htm#hivaidsexposure).  Given the minority population of homosexuals, that's quite a lot.  Though I could use stats on female homosexuality if anyone has them handy.  

But I still don't think this works as an argument, because multiplying numbers overplays the small portion of society afflicted by HIV.  Surely the greater public health loss would be faced by repression of homosexual desires.

But is there a point at which dangers that could be associated with homosexuality could outweigh the liberty of the homosexual?  We can go off the deep end here and hypothesize homosexuality entailing an 80% chance of getting HIV.  Does society have an obligation to keep people from harming themselves in this case?

**First Formulation of the Categorical Imperative (Deontology)** - """"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law without contradiction.""  Kant generally meant this in two ways, namely producing logical contradictions (you can't let everyone break promises, because a promise that can be broken at will is not a promise) and destruction of institutions (you can't commit suicide because that would destroy the race)

Here Rae argues that if homosexuality were taken to be universal, it would have destroyed the race ages ago.  Though he admits that with current reproductive technologies, it's not necessarily so today.

 I think this specific categorical imperative is at best a consideration in morality, not a hard and fast rule.  For instance, if we were all artists, then certainly society would fail, but that does not render it immoral to be an artist.  Exceptions to a rule are fine in many cases.

**""No civilization has ever survived the destruction of the traditional family."" (historical)** - You'll notice I went out of my way to quote this one directly.  For the life of me, I have no idea how the chair of ethics  at Talbot made this assertion in order to argue against homosexuality, but I thought it would be improper to exclude the argument.

Here is why I think it is absurd:

A) Homosexuality is not out to destroy traditional families

B) I don't know of any evidence suggesting this assertion apart from the communal rearing of children attempted in modern Israel. (which did fail)

C) This commits what I would call the ""Fallacy of inevitability"" you can always say that a society which in the past didn't allow the traditional family failed and you can say that any society which doesn't have traditional families will eventually fail, but this is the fate of any society.  The Arabic society provides a strong counterexample.

While I think I can amply defend my two contentions, I can't say that I find the arguments themselves to not be wildly outrageous.

To be honest, the whole section on homosexuality read a lot like *The Poisonous Mushroom*

&gt;“Yes, my child! Just as a single poisonous mushrooms can kill a whole family, so a solitary Jew can destroy a whole village, a whole city, even an entire Volk.”

I don't think that's at all an unfair comparison either.  Apart from the first argument (which seems to take an extreme on not allowing people to make their own risk decisions), the last arguments are of the same type, those which think that a benign minority will bring about the destruction of civilization.  I am not persuaded by these arguments. And while I normally am highly sympathetic to most theists, I don't just have a factual problem with the people who think these arguments are sound, I have a moral problem with the people that make these arguments.

This line of reasoning is not only false, but dangerous, and should be expunged from our society.  ",,False,,t5_2snuc,False,,,True,t3_1b09o8,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1b09o8/secular_arguments_against_homosexuality/,

This is what atheists appear to feel that religion is. 

This makes a couple of wrong assumptions though. First of all, it implies that the outrageous answer they are being told is out of nowhere. Its actually the answer to a question they ask. Everybody is curious about how they, the world, and the universe came to be. Every civilization has wondered, and virtually every child wonders. Is there such thing as a ""default position"" to a question that you are asking?

Next, it ignores how complex and unexpected some answers are for phenomena often attributed to deities. Lightning strikes are a series of discharges down and up between a cloud and the earth. At the equator, we are spinning at ~1000 mph. Light is a disturbance in the electromagnetic field; except its not, it has wavelike characteristics and particlelike characteristics. How can you possibly say that quantum physics is the ""default position"" and when people claim god said ""let there be light"" they are over-complicating things?

In my opinion, the default position is to be open minded. If people were somehow given access to modern education, but heard nothing about any religion or about atheism, I think very few of them would decide that they were atheist. None of them would independently discover a pre-existing religion, but many of them might develop whimsical theories about dieties. All of them would be openminded and curious though.

EDIT: Thanks for the replys guys. If atheism is defined to include not knowing, then yes it is the default position. I thought that atheism was to be confident that no gods exist. I suck at debating, but I still feel that this is not default. If atheism includes not knowing, are there words to specify what kind of atheist a person is? Agnostic atheist?

There is no possible evidence that one could adduce in support of this claim. Any evidence would flatly contradict one’s initial claim, because it would entail knowledge of the unknowable.

To claim that god is incomprehensible is to say that one’s concept of god is unintelligible, which is to confess that one does not know what one is talking about. The theist who is called upon to explain the content of his belief—and who then introduces the “unknowable” as a supposed characteristic of the concept itself—is saying, in effect: “I will explain the concept of god by pointing out that it cannot be explained.” ""

1) A God of mercy is not compatible with a God of justice.

At least, not the type of mercy Christians talk about. Justice is when everyone gets what they deserve. Mercy is when someone is spared judgement, even when they don’t deserve it. Mercy and justice are inherently incompatible. One must also consider the type of mercy Christians speak of: when someone calls on the name of the Lord, they are saved. If you do not believe in Jesus Christ as your lord and savior, you are not saved. That is not true mercy. It’s conditional mercy.

2) Christianity underestimates God as part of its very premise.

The reason why Jesus had to die was as an expression of God’s pain in forgiving us (this is a summary of something Keller said in The Reason For God, and does not do his original work justice). But pain is an expression of vulnerability, is it not? Pain is the message that something is hurt. If anything pains God, then that means that thing is damaging God. Claiming that God can be hurt is the height of foolishness. God, the Omniscient, Omnipotent Creator the Universe, the one who made all the Rules in the first place, has been hurt by the rejection of a puny ape? Christianity, in its attempt to make God seem relateable,  has minimized God’s most basic quality- All-Powerfulness.

3) You cannot have a relationship with someone that is infinitely greater than you.

A healthy relationship is one where both partners give and receive from each other, neither having dominance over the other. Even Christian couples, who claim to believe that the man is the head of the household, typically expect the husband to respect the wife’s wishes (or so I have observed thus far). We see that unhealthy, abusive relationships are those where one holds power over the other- when the relationship crosses the line from marriage to servitude. So what about a relationship where one member not only *believes* himself to be greater than the other, but truly, objectively *is* greater than the other? Not just greater, but infinitely greater? In this case, you do not have a relationship. You see, God knows everything about you, and demands your entire essence. He is omniscient, is he not? He knows everything, including you. He knows everything you are, everything you used to be, and even everything you will be. He knows more about you than you know about yourself. What do you know about God? You know some basic facts- he’s all-powerful, he’s all-good and merciful, yet wrathful, and he loves you, and wants you. Is this healthy? If all you know about your boyfriend is some vague idea that he’s nice and he loves you, but you know that he’s been stalking your Facebook and knows every little thing about you, is that a relationship? I posit that it isn’t. The knowledge is too one-sided, and unless you find out more about this person, you will not grow in your relationship. Sure, Christians claim that your relationship will grow as you pray and read your Bible, but this is not something I experienced as a Christian, and it is not something I have ever heard of a Christian really experiencing.

I would like to say that I am young, and I would be very, *very* surprised if I was the first one to come up with any of these points. I've seen people on this subreddit who are way smarter than me in the realm of philosophy and could easily debate circles around me. So Christians, tear my points apart.

In a free market place of ideas, what kinds of religions would you expect to out compete the others and emerge as dominant religions? 

The answer is simple. The ones that promised the greatest rewards for believing (ie eternal life/happiness) and the worst punishments for not believing (burn in hell forever, being socially ostracized). Additionally you'd expect the religions that focused heavily on converting ""nonbelievers""and growing its follower base to out compete other religions. In the market place of made up religions you'd expect those that make the greatest claims about their god to gain competitive advantage (like god is omnipotent, omniscient, etc.) and religions that offered easily understandable answers to life's hard questions too (god created earth, you go to heaven when you die, lying is bad because god said so.) Much like companies compete by discrediting each other, religions also gain competitive advantage by claiming that all other religions are false.

All the things you'd expect to find in a religion that would out compete others in a market place you find in today's dominant religions. What should be obvious, however, is that these religions are the products of a competing market place and not that of a divine being. The dominant Religions mistake came when  they sought to gain a short term advantage at the cost of a good long term strategy. This mistake came in the form of claiming to be morally and scientifically absolute (ie god creted the earth in 6 days, homosexuals should be stoned). As this way of thinking becomes more and more obviously wrong, religion has been unable to adapt.  Much like companies that cant adapt to a changing market place go out of business or animals that cant adapt go extinct, religions influence is increasingly decreasing. It continues to evolve however, Christianity for instance has been backtracking on its claims of being scientifically and morally accurate by basically dismissing the whole old testament. It does this not out of guidance by god but as a strategy to compete and stay relevant. But thats all religion ever has been.

In regards to coincidence, I know the human tendency is to overvalue coincidence and think some things are ridiculously coincidental (when it's only likely that eventually, some sort of funny occurrence will happen at some point [or points] in their lifetime). We tend to look for logic in a lot of independent events, simply because that's human nature. How do we know if something is God answering prayers or if it's simply coincidence? In the end, what if it's all coincidence and God is never working?

This then transitions to the prayer question.

Breaking it down, I've been reading a lot on free will, determinism, and libertarianism. I think I'm an incompatibilist (because free will and moral responsibility are congruent and because of this, do not seem to be compatible with determinism), but have become even more interested in libertarianism. This brings me to the conundrum of prayer.

Doesn't praying take away our free will? Asking God to do or prevent or bless or keep safe, doesn't that interfere with human choice? How can we pray for other people without somehow undermining their free will?

I believe in God, I believe in free will, and I think I believe in prayer, but I don't know how they all go together. Does Christianity require a compatibilist belief of the world?

http://willcady.com/2012/08/23/a-heartfelt-plea-from-the-dalai-lama/

I was wondering how our atheists and materialists feel about his view. Especially his statements on reductionism (which personally sum up a lot of my issues with some strains of atheism):

&gt;In the current paradigm of science, only knowledge derived through a strictly empirical method underpinned by observation, inference, and experimental verification can be considered valid.  This method involves the use of quantification and measurement, repeatability, and confirmation by others.  Many aspects of reality as well as some key elements of human existence, such as the ability to distinguish between good and evil, spirituality, artistic creativity – some of the things we most value about human beings – inevitably fall outside the scope of the method.  Scientific knowledge, I believe, is essential.  Only by such recognition can we genuinely appreciate the need to integrate science within the totality of human knowledge.  Otherwise our conception of the world, including our own existence, will be limited to the facts adduced by science, leading to a deeply reductionist, materialistic, even nihilistic worldview.

&gt;My difficulty is not with reductionism as such.  Indeed, many of our great advances have been made by applying the reductionist approach that characterizes so much scientific experimentation and analysis.

When you advance evidence towards non-Christians and they do not accept it, to you it is clearly not because the evidence is faulty or the conclusion false, but that the person in question clearly cannot reason well enough to be convinced by the argument.

Let's pretend this is the case: Christianity is true and there are many good arguments to prove this is the case. Those who do not believe in Christianity are those who cannot understand the arguments. God punishes those who he has not blessed with good reasoning, education, knowledge etc. 

That's why I don't like the reason-based, William-Lane-Craig-Style, apologists, because they change the bar of salvation/condemnation from faith to reason (or some unholy mix of the two). 

The problem with the assumption that Christianity is rational is that it unjustly condemns those too stupid to understand the evidence. And unfortunately the vast majority of the world is without sufficient education and erudition to be convinced by your arguments (because apparently upwards of 6 billion remain unconvinced).

However, if your holy books are simply metaphor, they are unfalsifiable.",38,6,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/tmx4a/the_most_popular_falsifiable_deities_have_already/,"Agnostic atheists (making up the majority) are of the stance that they don't believe there is a deity because there is no supporting evidence or reason to assume any exist.  Even considering this stance, I am willing to take a ""strong"" stance regarding the Abrahamic deity(/deities) and any others that are clearly defined by a religious text that I'm familiar with (primarily the Torah, Bible, Qur'an, and some of the Vedas).  This means that while my atheism represents a lack of belief in general, I am still willing to say that I hold a positive belief *those particular deities do not* exist.

I also acknowledge that this means I carry the burden of proof, as it should.

Keep in mind, however, that at any moment my opposition questions any *literal* nature of their texts, they are admitting that their text does not literally define their deity.  Simply put, if the passage in the bible is metaphor, then it doesn't define God.

We'll go with the holy text I'm most familiar with for most of my argument because, well, it's the one I'm most familiar with.  However, all of the religious texts I've read, to the extent that I've read them thus far, seem to also be subject to the same arguments.

If one is a Christian, it's safe to say that everything they are to believe in regards to their religion is contained in the bible.  Jews have additional texts and Muslims have the Hadith, but as far as I know neither of these redact what's written in the Torah and Qur'an respectively.

Here is my argument:

* According to Christians, the bible is said to be the word of God and is the only text that defines the only one true God.
* God is defined in the bible.  Some of this definition is by his visual appearance, but mostly by his interactions with the physical, natural universe.
* Anything in the bible that a follower considers *metaphor* does not qualify as a literal definition of God.
* All evidence related to the alleged actions of God, as told in the bible, have been incidentally falsified by scientific discovery and explanation.
* The Christian deity is *falsified*.


Elaborations:

&gt;According to Christians, the bible is said to be the word of God and is the only text that defines the only one true God.

Simply put, everything that the modern-day Christian believes in regards to their deity ought to be traced back to the bible as the source of their beliefs.  It's true that many may have their own personal views on God and morality, but it's safe to say that if it was found that the bible contradicts their personal view, they are to conform to the bible and correct their view.

The bible, being God's word, and with God being the very top of all hierarchies and authorities, every understood letter of the word should be obeyed.  This even goes for situations of the same moral severity as killing your own children.  If God demands it, you must do it.  Any exceptions (which, technically, there shouldn't be, even according to the bible) are addressed in my third point.

In my experience, allegorical Christians will tell you this is true at first, until/unless they are aware of the difference between something being literal and metaphor (including allegory).  

&gt;God is defined in the bible.  Some of this definition is by his visual appearance, but mostly by his interactions with the physical, natural universe.

The visual descriptions of God vary, and are probably not as reliable to use to actually define him.  His appearance seems to be largely important, at least next to his demands, personality, and actions.  God is said to look like everything from light, to similar to humans (we're made in his own image), to not even being able to look at his radiance at all regardless.

The visual descriptions, however are parse, and don't provide much of a foothold to begin to validate his existence.  What we can use, however, are his actions.

Story after story, especially in the Old Testament, God reshapes the earth, destroys cities.  He starts by creating the entire universe in a matter of days.  He ends up flooding the entire planet.  In the New testament, he even grants humanity the ability to move mountains with the power of prayer... unless it's all metaphor, which brings me to the next point in the argument.

&gt; Anything in the bible that a follower considers *metaphor* does not qualify as a literal definition of God.

I would guess that a majority of Christians in the world, especially here, will say that the stories of Gods actions in the bible are metaphor.  They didn't *really, actually* happen and that such stories are there to merely provide guidance or teach a lesson, or to give a cryptic answer to a believer struggling to find one.

If this is the case, then it renders the most likely means to actually  validate Gods existence into metaphor.  I can't prove that submarines work by calling them fish.  When trying to falsify or prove a claim, said claim must be first and foremost falsifi*able*.

If all you have to go on, regarding the existence of God, is metaphor, personal feelings, and/or faith in these feeling, then why would you even have these beliefs in the first place?  If your God is not literally defined in any text at all, then clearly it's only being defined by you... Or maybe family or friends.  Regardless, this renders the deity as unfalsifiable, and therefore giving no rational, logical, or scientific reason to assume it exists.


&gt;All evidence related to the alleged actions of God, as told in the bible, have been incidentally falsified by scientific discovery and explanation.

The two most prominent actions, which ought to yield the most physical evidence, are creation and the global flood.

Using simple math and counting the generations and life spans of characters going back to the first man and woman in the mythology, the earth would be anywhere from 6,000 to 10,000 years old.  The easiest way to falsify this is by looking up at a clear sky at night.  Our galaxy is 100,000 light years across, meaning that the farthest stars we see herein we are actually seeing as they were up to 100,000 years ago.  It's safe to say that the stars in galaxies that are millions or billions of light years away drive the point home and make any further argument redundant.

However, for the sake of redundancy, humanity is able to measure the age of just the earth by referring to the rate of atomic decay.  It shows that earth is *billions* of years old.  Biology and geology also not only shows how ancient our earth is, but even rely on the great age of the planet to find answers today.  The same evidences contradict any kind of global flood.

Even the claims of old-earth creationists are falsified by the evidence which shows that birds did not precede land animals and plants certainly did not precede the existence of our sun. 

There's never been any evidence of a body of water consisting entirely of blood either.

No mountain has ever been moved by use of prayer, which, according tot he bible, is said to be a simple matter provided the one praying as a small amount of faith (like that of a mustard seed).  At best, we've carved giant valleys and tunnels through a number of them with explosives. 

Such a prayer would have been extremely handy in building the Pennsylvania Turnpike, and it's safe to assume that would have been the decided method, saving millions in tax payer money and resources.

&gt; The Christian deity is *falsified*.

In conclusion, if the best way to find evidence for God is to look at the earth-changing actions he committed through time then God is falsified.  The Christian God (in this version of my argument) simply does not exist because not only is there a lack of evidence that he did any of the things the bible says he did, but the *only* evidence we have shows us that nothing, not even a deity, did the things it says he did.

What we don't know, we can say we don't know and that doesn't mean that there must be a deity responsible.  We do know enough, though, to easily say that if your holy text describes your deity as leaving evidence behind, and it's the only way to define your deity, and the existing evidence contradicts that deities actions, it does not exist.


**TL/DR**: Just read the 5 premises in bullet point above.

**EDIT**: Changed ""actions"" in the second premise to ""interactions with the physical, natural universe"" for clarity.

**UPDATE**:  It seems some may not be grasping the argument, and that may be my fault, so I'll try to explain another way.  It seems the most common argument I'm being met with are *other* things in the bible which I can't disprove.  ""You can't prove Jesus didn't ____"" and so on.  That's part of the point, actually.  Any part that I can't use to prove or disprove your deity, I'm not considering because it provides no useful way to test the claim.

It seems many, if not most atheists here have no experience with Thomas Aquinas' works. If they have, it's mostly with the Five Ways, usually taken from the Summa Theologica/Theologiae and not the Summa Contra Gentiles, which goes into the details of the arguments in a more involved way.  

These are two giant works, but you don't have to read all of it to realise that Aquinas is coming from a very particular philosophical context, one that's foreign to almost everyone nowadays. Including Christians. It's unfair for a Christian who knows little about it to pop up, post the arguments and then cry victory for theism, unless that Christian herself knows something of why the arguments are supposed to work. 

But if someone who does know something of Thomism posits the argument, then I think the onus is on the atheist's side to engage with it *seriously*. You've graduated from the level of 'bananas proves evolution is false' to the arguments of the medieval educated class, the philosophers. It's up for debate what precisely this serious engagement involves. Personally, if I was trying to prove Hegel wrong, I'd at least try to understand what he was trying to say. 

Back when I used to be involved in the creationism vs evolution debate, creationists were ridiculed for not knowing anything of science. I strongly feel that creationists should understand the arguments from scientists before dismissing them.

Arguments often tend to go basically that we cannot arrive at empiricism without an assumption that is unevidenced by itself and that such an assumption is either unjustified or else opens the door to other axiomatic assumptions, such as the existence of a god.

So, how do we step away from solipsism without throwing logic and evidence to the winds?

One attempt is the common sense view. I want to get things done, so I must make the assumption of empiricism or else why not jump out the window?

I'm not fond of this approach. I think once you enter the thoughtful, philosophical realm, you must throw away a common sense approach, because common sense easily amounts to majority rule. If you are going to debate philosophy, you ought to be able to defend your points on that level.

I think there are a number of excellent escapes from solipsism without abandoning logic. Empiricists, naturalists, pragmatists and others have written extensively on concepts of truth.

Here is one simple escape.

Sense data exists. Whether it is in actuality the parts of a dream, or electrical currents being beamed to a brain in a jar, I see the table in front of me, I feel the itch on my arm, I taste the tea in my mouth.

We can argue about what I and these sensations and I ""really"" are, but there is something there, whatever that something is.

Now for me, and every human I have (or seem to have ;P) come in contact with, these sensations build up to suggest a world.

From my perspective, science, philosophy, and all investigative thought are an attempt to understand that world.

You may say ""But what if that world isn't real? Then you're understanding nothing!"" Well, no, then I would be understanding something fictional, but not non-existent. I could also easily map out the world and physics of Super Mario Brothers. It wouldn't be non existent either, merely fictional. So this world I'm mapping, that I see as the real world, exists, just as the world of Super Mario Brothers exists, even if it is ultimately not ""real"".

In my experience, this is the world I live in, the world I breathe in, try to get laid in, and pay my bills in. Truths about this world are true for this world. If another world reveals itself of which my world is a subset, then I'll investigate that meta world, but I can't investigate it until I see some sign of it's existence. 

EDIT:

I'm a little disappointed that the responses in this thread are all so far responses to solipsism and not to my argument.

**EDIT 2:**

**TL;DR**

**1) Solipsism is a proposition that you can't know sensory data are true.  
2) Tautologically, sensory data are true of the world described by sensory data.  
3) I will investigate the world of these sensory data until some other world makes itself apparent.**

I feel like if there were one true version of truth that it would be clear enough to where people were at least in agreement with one another. Yet, I recently posted about the topic of slavery in the Bible and everyone had their own wildly different interpretations. Some were even making me think they didn't think the Bible was their Holy Book but they were obviously Christian. 

There are not a billion different interpretations of 2+2, the existence of plastic (does it or doesn't it exist), etc. There are however over a billion different versions of Muhammad and what Muhammad represents to the people of Islam. There is enough complexity found within every major religion's holy books that it is almost impossible for even two people to form a clear agreement on the totality of their preferred holy book. 

What's concerning is that clearly everything is very important, or enough of it is supposed to be, that having so much non-agreement makes it seem like there is no real truth. I'm just wondering how you reconcile with that? 

I assume the majority of theists are going to say it does not bother them. I'd like to hear mainly from those who at least are concerned by the amount of variation.

The brochure is in German, but I think the English version is called ""Was life created?""

I just finished it and I'm struck by its descriptions of all sorts of natural processes, such as water circulation, oxygen circulation, gravity, etc. All of these are attributed to God and used as proof that God created the world to be perfect for life.

What I'm wondering now is: If you can accept the scientific explanations of how rain, thunderstorms, the earth's orbit, rainbows, our oxygen supply, etc. work and praise God for inventing these clever processes, what's keeping you from doing the same with the Theory of Evolution? Doesn't it prove God's goodness, that he came up with a process that allows the life he created to adapt and change with their environment?

In one section of the brochure, young earth creationism is debunked on a largely scriptural basis. The short version is that science and scripture are not in opposition when it comes to the age of the earth and the universe. It seems to me that the same reasoning applies to Evolution, since it is never specified how God created all living things. So, why not accept it and use it as another example of God's ingenuity?

It seems to me that evidentialist atheists use the anthropic principle along with the multiverse to get out of the fine-tuning argument. It also seems that they have no problem using Lawrence Krauss's solution to the ""something from nothing"" problem.

But when it comes to the idea of a grand designer, this is suddenly absurd. There is just as little evidence for any one of these, but one of them is seen as inferior. Why?

Many would argue that the other two take more ""faith"" than believing in God. This is a subjective argument for putting God ahead of the other two, but the ""equality of absurdity"" still stands.

I'd like to address some potential problems with a designer that the other two do not seem to have:

**Problem of complexity** - A quantum reality would have to be just as complex as a designer that gave rise to the same thing - this *philosophical nothing* has to account for all of the particles, formations, and patterns which are the foundation for all the laws of physics just as much as a designer does. Occam's razor will not help you here.

**Who created [insert existential precedent here]?** I'm aware of the ""Who created God?"" argument. [I will offer you John Lennox's solution.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFD6U8XYhRI) Please note that the other two fare no better in this regard. (""Which reality gave rise to the quantum nothing?"" And if you want to argue that philosophically, lack of existence is not better than existence, then this can be said for a designer as well.)

**God of the Gaps** - All three constructs are extrapolations. I could just as easily say ""multiverse of the gaps."" The gaps that you choose to fill with a multiverse or quantum reality, someone else could fill with a designer.

This question is probably the linchpin of my agnosticism. I want you to firebomb it out of existence. The purpose of this post is to challenge my own beliefs more than it is to make a point.

The text below is not a claim or an argument:

Personally (and I understand that this ""argument from incredulity"" is a complete appeal to emotion; I'm just stating my personal feelings), I have a really hard time buying the fact that a quantum reality that contains all the necessary axioms to create the vastness we call the laws of modern physics, including the intricate laws of relativity etc. *just existed*. I also run into the problem of ""When did it and what made it *'decide'* to give rise to the universe? What was the causal factor?"" I see a designer as a more satisfying, albeit evidentially lacking explanation.

EDIT: I hate how I can't keep up with responses. I really don't have that much time on my hands. Sorry if I can't meet some of your thought-provoking responses in turn. I'd like to clear up a misconception though. I am not talking about a God in the sense of any religion's God. I am referring to a designer. Sorry about that.

My entire life, someone asks me a question and I have ANY information about the topic at hand, I can pop off a bullshit answer that sounds believable. Anything. The only time I ever get spotted is if there's someone in earshot that actually knows the answer, which happens, but if you do it right is not only rare, but almost impossible. More on that in a moment.

Now, let's take religion. Do you have ANY idea how much fucking material there is to read? The bible, the Koran, Aquinas, Hume, Nietzche, and on and on. Now, let's pose an analogy. Comic books have a HUGE amount of ground to cover. Basic DC comics, Golden Age, Silver Age, Pre-crisis, new 52, etc. I've been reading comics my entire life, and have still barely scratched the surface. I've done everything I can to read literally everything about John Constantine, one character, and I'm still not what I'd call an expert.

Now, what purpose does this analogy serve? Someone asks me the question ""How does Superman control his speed while flying?"", I can have an answer for you that not only sounds believable, but is actually somewhat supported by references in comics, and examining the material. My buddy Jason is a huge DC fan, and has read FAR more than I have, and I think he'd have a hard time proving me wrong, unless he's seen the answer somewhere and it contradicts me.

Now, I'm not necessarily right, *I just can't be proven wrong*. That's apologetics. It's incredibly easy to say ""Well, I've got a PhD in theology, and when this verse says not to suffer a witch to live, it's specifically referencing *only* during this instance"" or ""Leviticus *only* means this group of people, and it's not longer necessary"" or ""it's clearly meant as allegorical"" Now I can't prove any of that wrong, because it's not falsifiable, and it's impossible to bring other verses up because ""I'm not a literalist"", or ""christianity doesn't believe x, because of y"" or ""Well, that's the OLD testament"" which SHOCKINGLY sounds similar to ""Well, that was pre crisis..."" or ""That was just a what if!"" or ""That got retconned!"" right? 

Now this is all really fun. I love reasoning behind comic books, and describing why ""Batman isn't actually just a normal guy but why he's actually become metahuman"" and so on, to me is one of the best ways to kill an evening and a six pack with some buddies. Fun stuff. But, and I can't stress this enough, my interpretation of Batman is purely that. It doesn't influence my moral values or how I think we should legislate.

All I can find in the NT are vague references about how Christians aren't bound by Jewish law. But it's clearly not an all or nothing proposition; after all, the old law prohibits murder but Jesus didn't tacitly approve of that just because it was part of an outdated law. Clearly, you need to examine these things on a case by case basis.

The disciples who would know the teachings of Jesus apparently better than anyone else clearly had no problem condemning homosexuality. I think it's actually presumptuous to say you know what Jesus meant better than the men who followed him for a number of years, but that's just me.

At the very best, this shows a 'messenger from God' who wasn't very clear and allows transliterations of his work to completely reverse his true meaning; at the worst it shows tacit approval of the hate expressed against homosexuals.

## Basic Argument

P1: Everything that begins to exist has a cause

P2: The universe has a beginning of its existence

C1: The universe has a cause of its existence.

***
## The Various Problems
***

**Causality**


 Let me start by making one important statement: *There is no such thing as the Law of Causality*. Causality is **nothing** more than the probabilistic results of quantum mechanics. And at the base of QM are non-deterministic events, which happen with a [given probability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics), and these probabilities compound to such a great extent that macroscopic interactions may as well be thought of as entirely deterministic.

With this in mind, it is easy to find quantum events that are not deterministic; that have no cause. There is the creation of [virtual](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=are-virtual-particles-rea) [particles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_particle), [radioactive decay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism#Other_matters_of_quantum_determinism), and [other events](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/#QuaMec). 

Strictly speaking, through QM, determinism does not hold. The common response to this is that even in QM, energy is conserved (seeing Schoedinger's equation if you want proof), and therefore objects cannot appear without cause or prior state if they violate conservation of energy. The only problem with this is that we live in an [observably](http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html) [flat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_Universe#Flat_universe) [universe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqb1lSdqRZY) - which has a net energy content of zero.

With this in mind, it appears that hard determinism can only be realistically applied to macroscopic objects, which would make me challenge P1 and make it explicitly state the relevance is conditional upon macroscopic objects or interactions.

As I was stating above, hard determinism can only be applied to macroscopic objects. But, to the best of our knowledge, the universe, around the moment of genesis, was *not* a macroscopic object, but an object clearly in the domain of Quantum Mechanics. [Ref](http://www.space.com/52-the-expanding-universe-from-the-big-bang-to-today.html). With that in mind, I would question whether or not P2 follows off the modified P1.

......................................................

**Equivocation**

This is the most common rebuttal, as it is the strongest. We know the universe is finite, and that it is only 13.75 (plus or minus 0.11) billion years old... but does this mean it has a beginning in the sense that the word is being used?

If something exists for all time, does it have a beginning? And has the Universe existed for all time? Well, the answer to the second one is definitely yes. There is no point, in time or space, in which the universe did not exist. So did the universe ""begin""? Did it go from a state of not existing, to a state of existing? No. Because there is *no* state in which the universe has not existed.

This is what irks me when people say ""So the universe came from nothing, by nothing?"" No. That ""nothing"" has never existed. And the universe cannot come from something, as asking what is before the universe is nonsensical. What is before time? What is north of the north pole?

This post will begin to exist when I hit ""submit"", because it transitioned from not existing, to existing. The universe cannot undergo such a transition because it has always existed.

The common response to this is (the realisation that temporal causality cannot apply the universe) is to assert atemporal causality... something which has never been observed. And for atemporal causality, this implies that there is a state without the universe *causally* prior to the universe (commonly called God), but not temporally prior. If atemporal causality is correct, it would mean that these two states would have to exist at the same time (as time cannot elapse between them after all). Thus atemporal causality posits that at one point in time the universe both existed and did not exist... which is a contradiction.

**Composition**

For those that ignored my comments on determinism and believe that there is in fact some scientific law of causality, applying this to to the universe as a whole is unjustified, and a fallacy of composition. For example, we inductively apply causality to macroscopic interactions because that is consistent for us. But applying this notion to the universe as a whole (which includes macroscopic interactions, quantum interactions, and the dimensions of space and time) makes it a fallacy of composition.

********
## Conclusion
*********

1. At the bottom level, the universe is not deterministic, so arguments from causality are inapplicable to the early, quantum universe.
2. It has been shown that causality (as we know it - being temporal causality) cannot apply to the universe
3. Not only is atemporal causality completely unsubstantiated, it leads to a contradiction, and there is no reason to invent another form of causality simply to preserve the argument instead of admitting that one of the premises is wrong.
4. Even if everything in the universe was fully determined, we could not apply these laws to the universe itself, as that is a fallacy of composition.

I've heard the various defenses/explanations for creation, talking snakes and rib-women, so I won't go there. I'm more concerned with the following:

1) In the story of Adam and Eve, God commanded Adam to not eat from the ""tree of the knowledge of good and evil"". Why is it that God would want his creations to be ignorant of what is good and what is evil? Is this viewed as God not wanting his creations to judge each other? But if we could not evaluate our fellow persons' actions, a person could do any number of things and not be given proper criticism/punishment or praise/reward. Is this God's way of attempting to ensure only he can do the punishing/rewarding?

Furthermore, if God is omniscient and omnibenevolent, why would he have the tree there in the first place?

This train of thought has vast consequences for the omniscience and omnibenevolence of God. An omniscient God would have known not to make the tree available, and would have kept his creations blissfully ignorant. An omnibenevolent God would not have set his own creations up for failure so that he could punish them. How is this justified in a way that you end up with an omniscient *and* omnibenevolent God?

2) ""From Adam to Noah"" This part's pretty self explanatory, I think. The people in this portion of the story are living for 900+ years before dying. We know this is impossible, or at least it has not been observed in recorded history. Only recently have average life spans gotten close to 80, and before modern medicine it was down around 35-45. So how is this explained? Because they were God's first creations, they lived longer? After Adam, the life spans do not decrease as the lineage increases its distance from him (from Adam to Noah). So when and why did the life span drop so suddenly? 

Especially considering that according to creation, the Earth is roughly 6,000 years old. Between Adam and the birth of Noah, 1056 years passed. So roughly 1/6 of the Earth's history had passed and there was no significant drop in life span. They all lived to be at least 350 (lowest - 365, most - 969). People rarely live to be 100, even today. So again, what accounts for their (Adam and his immediate descendants) incredibly long lives, and for the enormous drop in average life span from them to us?

My neighbor's a Christian, so I asked him about these issues. What I got in return was, ""Those lacking faith cannot understand the workings of God."" What I heard was, ""Believe what is in the Bible or you will not *believe* what is in the Bible.""

If this is the case, God created an awful system for his creations. There is no understanding or clarification provided. Either you wholly accept the Bible as truth and God as your ruler/lord/creator etc., or you will not understand. How is someone who (as humans generally are) is incredibly curious supposed to believe in claims such as these? The second you look at it from a skeptical point of view, it falls apart and is reduced to, ""God made it that way"". Well, he made his creations inherently curious, so requiring belief before understanding is an incredibly ill-advised idea.

Second, to help ensure that only those who are taking this seriously are involved, I'd like to have a very strict moderation policy for the posts associated with the reading group. This sub has a very liberal moderation policy, but for these discussions, I'd like to avoid anything that takes away from understanding. To that end, I suggest you all report posts and the mods would delete inappropriate comments or behavior, *a la* [/r/askscience](/r/askscience).

Third, if there is someone in [/r/DebateReligion](/r/DebateReligion) that is recognized as any kind of expert or who feels they specialize in the subject matter or who is just really passionate about it to lead the discussions and to answer any questions that arise. So, for instance, hammiesink would be an excellent candidate to lead (among other things) books about Thomasism (assuming he is interested).

1320780430.0,32,self.DebateReligion,m54g6,To theists: How to overcome the problem of evil (and three arguments that will never work on atheists),35,3,231,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/m54g6/to_theists_how_to_overcome_the_problem_of_evil/,"I've been thinking about the problem of evil again, and it occurs to me that a lot of theists genuinely don't know why atheists find it compelling and convincing. So I thought I'd break down this atheist’s perspective here for all of you.

The purpose of this post isn’t to call out theists as ""wrong,"" although obviously I disagree with you. Instead, it is to help you understand why typical atheist reactions to religious apologetics on the matter range from frustration to derisive dismissal.

As a refresher, the problem of evil is that logically, an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent (hereafter referred to as 3-O) deity is incompatible with the presence of evil and suffering in the world. If he wants to prevent evil but cannot, he is not all-powerful. If he could, but doesn’t want to, then he is malevolent. If he wants to prevent it and has the power to do so, then evil and suffering should not exist. And if he neither wants to prevent it nor has the power to do so, then there is no reason to call him ""God.""

**Atheist perspective on the problem**

The reason atheists -- or at least, this particular atheist -- find the existence of evil such a compelling argument against the existence of a 3-O deity is that it renders each of those attributes incompatible with each other.

Let us assume, for the sake of discussion, that God exists. If God exists...

* **...and is omniscient and omnipotent, he cannot be omnibenevolent.**

In this scenario, God knows about all suffering and has the power to stop all suffering. As he demonstrably does not stop all suffering, it appears he lacks the desire to, and is therefore not omnibenevolent. Why he lacks the desire is academic; perhaps he has what he regards as valid reasons not to interfere, but from the human perspective, he can't be omnibenevolent, or the word ceases to have meaning.

* **...and is omniscient and omnibenevolent, he cannot be omnipotent.**

In this scenario, God knows about all suffering and has the desire to stop all suffering. As he demonstrably does not stop all suffering, it appears he lacks the power to, and is therefore not omnipotent.

* **...and is omnipotent and omnibenevolent, he cannot be omniscient.**

In this scenario, God has the power and desire to stop all suffering. As he demonstrably does not stop all suffering, it appears he lacks the knowledge it is happening, and is therefore not omniscient.

Logically, you may pick any two of the above traits for God (although really, omnipotence without omniscience is nonsensical, since he could just give himself that power). The third is always going to be logically inconsistent with the other two, unless you change the definition of one of the words. And as I will explain below, atheists typically reject that change.

**Theist responses that don’t hold water with us**

Terrible, terrible suffering exists in the world. When confronted with unbelievable horrors, like a Somali girl slowly, agonizingly, and uncomprehendingly starving to death, or a boy getting pressed into the Sierra Leone Revolutionary United Front after being forced by them to murder his own parents, atheists usually get one of three responses from theists, none of which we find compelling against the problem of evil in the least:

* **Apologetic 1: The theist says that this is human-caused misery (the ""free will"" apologetic).**

I'm not sure why theists think this is a good argument. Why would an omnibenevolent God care what caused the misery? The existence of children who suffer through no fault of their own is enough to destroy this argument. God has no reason not to intervene if there's a kid starving or dying of some horrid disease or injury unless he is not omnibenevolent by any human definition of the word.

On top of that, an omniscient God would know about any human-caused misery before he ever even created the universe. Not correcting for that before setting the universe in motion negates any sort of omnibenevolence he might have. And if for some reason (free will) he needs us to be allowed to hurt each other, he could always step in after the fact and negate the pain, as he’s supposed to be omnipotent. Any human being who had the power to stop all suffering and didn’t use it would be reviled as a monster complicit in the unnecessary, agonizing deaths of millions.

* **Apologetic 2: The theist says that evil is the absence of God.**

This one is interesting, because it runs counter to all three of the supposed traits of God. An omnibenevolent God would never be absent unless he wasn’t omnipotent and/or didn’t know about evil in his absence, thus lacking omniscience. A 3-O deity, by definition, has power over and is aware of everything, everywhere, all the time. There cannot be a place or person from which he is absent. He is, in fact, omnipresent.

* **Apologetic 3: The theist changes the definition of omnibenevolent to include some sort of greater -- but unknowable -- goal accomplished by human misery.**

This last one I’d like to unpack a little, as it’s probably the most common response I get. And as should be obvious by this point, the meanings of words are important.

Atheists do not, by and large, accept definitions of words altered to include some element humans can't understand. For instance, we reject definitions of ""good"" that include ""whatever God does, no matter how inscrutable and mysterious."" To us, if it's not good by a human definition, it's *not good*. It's *something else*, and should have its own word or words to describe it, with a comprehensible definition.

Frankly, we regard this kind of argument as nothing more than a tacit admission that we're right. It’s like changing the meaning of the word ""toaster"" to include automobiles, just so you can claim it's possible to drive a toaster. Whatever trait God is displaying, it isn't omnibenevolence by any human definition, and human definitions are the only ones that matter for human comprehension. So it’s *not omnibenevolence*, it’s *something else*.

To give them their due, some theists will admit that the problem of evil is deeply troubling to their faith. I wish I encountered this response more often, as it’s usually a good first step towards deconverting.

But that’s really a tangent from my main point that if theists wish to convince atheists and convert *us*, they need to use arguments other than the three above. The first is merely an attempt to assign blame for human misery, not an explanation for why God allows it. The second is just sophistry. And the third is linguistic sleight-of-hand.

Atheists have an easy, simple way to resolve the problem of evil: In all likelihood, gods do not exist. If you want to change our minds, you need to give us an answer that is just as simple and just as logical.

---

**TL;DR**: In order to counter the problem of evil with an atheist, you need to come up with an argument other than ""it's our fault"" (rendering God an evil bastard for allowing children to suffer because of the faults of others), ""evil is God's absence"" (rendering God an incompetent stooge), or ""we can't understand"" (rendering the words used to describe God, such as ""omnibenevolent,"" utterly meaningless). These arguments will generally fail with atheists.

---

**Edit**: As much as possible, I'm going to keep a running tally of arguments that fall into one of the three categories above, with links to the arguments. If any theists render an argument that doesn't fall into those categories, I'll link those, too.

So I was wondering what bad arguments you've encountered from your own side. (And hopefully this encourages *good* arguments!) I'll list a couple:

1. The argument that religion was responsible for the fall of Rome and then religion kept the whole world back. This is primarily used against Christians, so first of all it should be noted that the Visigoths did so because of other tribes pressuring them from the north and east. Secondly, this argument assumes that if Rome didn't fall technology and science would have continued in a straight line and we would be living in a golden age, or at least be better off. Determinism. Thirdly, this argument ignores that there were some progresses made in the medieval era, but looking for world-changing scientific breakthroughs is the wrong way to go about examining history. It would be like expecting the next Steve Jobs to come out of Kosovo. Things were chaotic and uncertain and most people focused just on survival. Finally, this argument assumes an inherently western ethnocentric view of history. As if Rome is all that there was and no other society made any scientific progress or *could* make progress. Like China with inventing gunpowder... Or the Arabian Islamic world and algebra. 

2. Another argument I've seen that annoys me goes along the lines of ""this deity has similarities to your deity, therefore yours is false."" As I see it, the majority of these comparisons are merely confirmation bias. While there are similarities, there are just as many (if not more) differences that tend to be ignored. Examples: Jesus and Horus having virgin births. Except Horus was born with the aid of a golden dildo. Muhammad and Joseph Smith, except Joseph Smith found and translated golden plates while Muhammad wrote what an angel told him. And even if there are similarities, how does that prove a religious belief to be wrong? Considering the history and scope of humanity and religion, aren't there bound to be similarities and overlaps somewhere? 

Like I said, I'm interested to see what you think are bad examples so that (hopefully) we can avoid them in these debates. And I may make another post asking for bad religious arguments from religious people when I have some more time (or someone else can.)

I would like to apologize for posting this. It didn't have a place here. I shouldn't be using this issue to grandstand an exit from the board. It was dramatic...and even more so, childish. Some of you pointed that fact out (particularly HuxleyOrwell and tripleatheist) and after some prayer and thinking I have come to agree that my actions were not very mature. My life has been stressful as of late and I am ashamed to admit that some of that stress came out in my frustration with the downvotes. Granted, I am frustrated about them and probably would have posted about them regardless of my mood - however there was no need to act this way.

One of the bolded rules on the right is to ""Be nice to one another"" and I don't feel that my post really did that. I acted childish and I apologize for that. I would like to stick around, if only to be forced to swallow my pride and be humble in this matter. I'd rather hold myself to a higher standard by promising that I'll log off before I let my emotions/circumstances/etc get the better of me.

And more to the point God made to me in my prayers - I'm just using what happened as an excuse to leave...which I have a bad habit of doing.

TL;DR - I'm kind of an ass. I'm sorry about that and I hope you'll forgive me.

Three days ago, tripleatheist made a post asking that Christian Lurkers start participating more in the discussions on this board. I took him up on that call and began posting. Today, I logged on to see some responses to my posts in a thread ""From a Preacher's Kid"". They were in the negative.

It was one thing to disagree with what I posted and write a response. It is another thing to turn off the RSS codes and downvote my posts down to -2. This is a subreddit that prides itself as being ""free of downvotes"" to encourage participation.

This has only further cemented my belief that serious, thoughtful, intellectual discourse is impossible to practice online. That is why I did not participate in the past and will not be participating any longer.  It has been an interesting three days, but I don't see the point in contributing to a subreddit where participants don't follow the rules laid out.

For those unfamiliar with the dilemma it looks like this:

On divine command theory, either:

**A)** Things are good because God commands them so

**B)** God commands things which are good in their own right

**If A)**, then immediately we see that God could order us to do harmful things for no deeper reason than God's whim.  One thing not commonly thought of however is that indeed God could take two identical scenarios and deem them to have different moral statuses, and that would make them so.  So God could make a robbery on Wednesday absolutely evil and the same robbery on Thursday absolutely good.  This gets even more bizarre if God can ""wind the clock back"" and make time run in reverse because He could actually make the first occurrence good and the exact same occurrence evil on the second run through.

**If B)**, then there is a separate standard of good about which God doesn't have any say over and God ends up being completely superfluous in the whole system.

One more uncommon bit to note is that these options are not extensively mutually exclusive and some moral issue might fall into either category.  For instance, circumcision might be good because God commands it and God might command us to love our neighbors because that is good in and of itself.

So the retort which I hear almost invariably from apologists is that because God is necessarily good, He can no more will us to abuse puppies (thus making puppy abuse good) than a triangle can have 4 sides.

This manages only to push the question into a further layer of complexity when we ask what it is about God that makes Him good.  If God's necessary goodness is derived from His own approval of Himself, then certainly this is a vacuous statement.  In fact, His approval of Himself would have to be good as well.  So God's approval would have to be approved by Himself.  And guess what?  That approval of the approval needs to be approved.  In fact we develop an infinite regress and we never get a coherent foundation for morality.

If it ends up being the case that God is necessarily good for some other reason than that He unendingly approved of Himself, then we're using a standard separate of God and we're right back to B) where God at best coincides with an external moral code that He did not create nor is necessary to affirm.",,False,,t5_2snuc,1372603301.0,,,True,t3_1hd68q,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1hd68q/some_more_depth_in_the_euthyphro_dilemma/,

Ten months ago, I asked the philosophers of /r/DebateReligion what they believed about time. [Here is the original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/v1tl2/to_philosophers_which_theory_of_time_do_you_find/), for the benefit of all the people here now who hadn't yet discovered this subreddit.

In a nutshell, many of the arguments for theism rely on a concept of time that turns out to be scientifically falsifiable. Special relativity gives us the tool set to move questions about time out of the realm of philosophical navel-gazing (not that there's anything wrong with that) and into the realm of scientific experimentation. And as it happens, scientific experimentation indeed falsifies the kind of time many theistic arguments need.

We seem to live in a block universe. That is to say, a universe in which time is equivalent to a spacial dimension. We do not move through time so much as experience the passage of it purely subjectively. The past - *and the future* - exist tenselessly. An analogy would be a measuring stick. You can label one point the beginning, and the other the end, and then trace your finger along the tick marks between them, but where your finger is has no bearing on whether the tick marks exist.

At least, that is all true *if* special relativity is true *and* it disproves absolute simultaneity, two points it is very difficult to argue against.

Many theistic arguments, like the classic cosmological argument of Aquinas or the version of the Kalam proposed by William Lane Craig, rely on a different version of time. That version is a more intuitive - but apparently false - time as something we move through or that constantly changes, rather than each moment already existing, and ""change"" being the differences between moments.

1366295379.0,26,self.DebateReligion,1clv6q,To Christians: Blood sacrifice or damnation. The original false dichotomy.,39,13,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1clv6q/to_christians_blood_sacrifice_or_damnation_the/,"Some evangelical Christians believe that God demands a blood sacrifice to atone for sins. This presupposition is really the basis of their soteriology.

But what if it's not true? What if ancient Jews saw animal sacrifice as just one of several forms/expressions of worship and not as *the* non-negotiable basis of their forgiveness?

There are examples in the OT of God forgiving without blood sacrifice.

'If, however, he cannot afford two doves or two young pigeons, he is to bring as an offering for his sin a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering.' (Leviticus 5:11-13)

When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he relented and did not bring on them the destruction he had threatened.
(Jonah 3:10)

God was also known to accept incense and jewelry as atonement offerings.

So Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly. The plague had already started among the people, but Aaron offered the incense and made atonement for them. (Numbers 16:47)

So we have brought as an offering to the Lord the gold articles each of us acquired—armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings and necklaces—to make atonement for ourselves before the Lord. (Numbers 31:50)

We have all heard that animal sacrifices ceased several decades after the crucifixion of Jesus with the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. But, in fact, animal sacrifices ceased for the vast majority of Jews with the destruction of the First Temple in 587 BCE. 

By the time the Second Temple was built, 80% of the world's Jews lived outside of the Promised Land and these Jews, the vast majority of Jews, did not rely upon animal sacrifices as a facet of their religion even after the construction of the Second Temple. 

So, in reality, for the vast majority of Jews, animal sacrifices ceased in 587 BCE. 

Thus, by the time Jesus came along, the notion that God *required* any sort of blood sacrifice for the remission of sins would have been foreign to the vast majority of Jews. No wonder the vast majority of Jews rejected the idea that Jesus died for their sins. The vast majority of Jews did not believe that *anything* needed to die for their sins.

And, you've got to wonder: if blood sacrifice is/was such a big deal to the Jews why is it that they have not been sacrificing goats and doves in their backyards or at the local synagogue for the last 2,000 years? Scratch that. The last 2*587* years?

Perhaps it's because the Old Testament says there were available to the Jews other means of obtaining forgiveness.

It seems to me the majority of answers boiled down to something like this:

* Religion as an explanatory framework for physical phenomenon has been superseded by science.

Obviously this is a very narrow definition of religion that leaves out many of the aspects that draw people to religion in the first place. One of the most important of these is that religion provides a definition or model of a good life.

I'm curious whether atheism can provide any such definition, and whether it is even possible. So, for Atheists: 

1) Is it possible to say that one way of living is better than another? 

2) If so, what is your rubric?

3) In what way is this model superior to one provided by religion?

People who use Pascal's Wager overwhelmingly follow some Abrahamic religion. But if I were to go along with the wager, why would I make them happy?

For this post I'm going to make the unjustified assumption that the Wager has no downside from choosing wrong -- you don't end up worse by displeasing the one god that does exist. You either guess right and win, or miss and lose identically no matter what you go with.

The wager as I understand it starts from a position of ignorance. I don't know if there is a god or not, and which god might it be. However I still bet for one to hedge my bets. 

The choices are near infinite. There are many religions, with many variations of them, with subdivisions in those, many of them now dead. The wager offers no help for narrowing the choice down. If I knew who the true god is, I wouldn't be making a wager, after all. So I might as well pick up something at random. No matter what I do, it's overwhelmingly likely that I'm going to choose the wrong one.

Given all this, why would I wager for a difficult position? It seems most logical to instead choose the easiest for me option: picking a god most in line with my sensibilities. That will take the least effort on my part, as I might not even have to change my behavior. And the better aligned the god is with my current interest, the more honestly I can hold on to its doctrine. I think this maximizes my chances.

This way, if I lose the wager (which is about 99.999...% likely) I will not have had invested much into it while living, and will have lived pretty much the way I like to do it anyway. This is about as good of an optimization for the scenario that I think is possible.



Now the question: Which gods are the best for this? The ideal candidates are gods that are pleasant, in line with modern sensibilities, and impose the least amount of rules and requirements on their worshipers.

Since we're in a position of ignorance here, absolutely any sort of deity will do, including those from now dead religions, and those described in games and fantasy novels. After all, who's to say that the true god couldn't have chosen a game programmer to spread its word?

At one point when discussing Paul, he brought up a very interesting verse:

[Romans 5:20](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205&amp;version=NIV)(link includes the rest of chapter)

&gt; The law was brought in so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more,

The law here is referring to OT law.  Unless Dr. Martin and I have something wrong here, it seems that God made laws in order to have people be more at fault.  This seems to raise some big issues here:

- Is such an action just?

- Does this mean we should promote sin as a form of increasing grace?

- Is the law not fixed?  If the rules on morality can be phased in and out like this, then it seems that ""goodness"" doesn't flow directly from God's necessary nature. 

This is important in the Euthyphro Dilemma in which either:

- Things are good because God says they are good (in which case morality is arbitrary or at least a product of God's whimsy)

- God says things are good because they are good (in which case we have a separate standard of morality that we are appealing to)

This is normally contended with the assertion that morality is a necessary component of God and as such a distinction can't be made between the two.  Normally I contest that even if God can't command something like child abuse because it's not in His nature, then the good at best coincides with God rather than originating from it, but with this verse in mind it would seem that God can arbitrarily install new laws.  This is troubling for theism because it makes the case that God could just come along and mandate something like child abuse as being a morally good thing.",,False,,t5_2snuc,False,,,True,t3_16dg8e,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/16dg8e/romans_520/,

Is there any justification for this assertion?  I have a hard time seeing how even the existence of God can overcome Hume's is-ought problem.

So I guess my position is: **even if God exists, objective moral values and duties do not exist**.  The only objection I can think of is that God is omniscient and omnipotent, and as such would always do the ""right"" thing.  But the problem is that what is ""right"" still depends on someone's values, in this case God's.  Why should God value what he does?  I guess this leads to the Euthyphro Dilemma, which some people try to resolve by saying that God values the good because he *is* good.  But then the dilemma is just moved up a step to the nature of God: what about God makes him ""good""?  ""Good"" for whom?

1354462763.0,31,self.DebateReligion,145ig2,To Christians: How do we know the Pauline Epistles are genuine?,35,4,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/145ig2/to_christians_how_do_we_know_the_pauline_epistles/,"The Pauline Epistles in the New Testament are thought to be some of the earliest evidence of Christian thought, the oldest documents we have about the worship of Jesus Christ.  However, how do we know that this is the case?  There are some interesting insights to be had in Patricia Rosenmeyer's *Ancient Epistolary Fictions*.  This book isn't actually about Paul's letters, but rather about the practice of letter-writing in the ancient Greek literary tradition.  Now, the questions raised here don't mean that the Pauline letters *aren't* genuine.  But they do force us to reevaluate how we determine that they *are*.

Letters were a popular composition both within novels and as collections of fictional or didactic correspondence.  They were a popular form of entertainment and instruction, both under the real name of their authors and under pseudonyms.  So the first thing that drops out of this is that ""Well, they were *letters*, not novels or anything like that"" doesn't actually help us determine that they are genuine.

There's also an interesting discussion of how writers were trained to compose letters. Chapter 8 discusses the genre at the time of the Roman imperial period of pseudonymous letters and letter collections written in the name of fictional, mythical or well-known historical persons such as Plato, Themistocles, or Euripides.

&gt;. . . the letters will give the impression of having been really written by that person by imitating the dialect and reflecting historical setting, but this same attention to detail will create opportunities for inadvertent anachronisms . . . The most obvious shared trait of all the pseudonymous collections is their supposed historicity.

Does not Philippians speak of a truly enlightened person as adopting a ""view from above"", a concept elsewhere not noted till the time of Marcus Aurelius well into the second century; and do not commentators struggle to demonstrate that Paul's gnostic phraseology is really ""proto"" gnostic since everyone knows gnosticism is a second century development?

&gt;By the Roman imperial period, the imaginative composition of letters to and from famous men had become a standard component of the rhetoric syllabus, . . .

So whoever wrote the NT letters, in their own name or another's, would quite likely have had training in writing pseudonymous letters.  Authors took to maintain consistency of characterization, historical plausibility, the use of well known names, places and precise dates, all to make the final product “ring true”.  They were trained to add minor personal details, such as requests for a cloak or mentions of the author's health, to increase the appearance of authenticity.

For example, look at the collection of Chion of Heraclea.  The letters begin *in media res*, with a situation already occurring that the ""real"" audience of the letters would clearly know all about, but which the *actual* audience (the author's contemporaries, and us) find very intriguing, requiring us to fill in the details.  How many times have we heard ""Well, Paul didn't *need* to talk about Jesus' life, because everybody he was writing to already knew about it""?  The last letter in this collection, one in which the narrative author writes that he is plotting an assassination, ends abruptly – leaving the reader hanging with suspense. This is nothing less than rhetorical intent.

Then there’s the collection itself and how it’s put together. Rosenmeyer argues that Chion’s letter collection is: 

&gt;deliberately arranged in chronological *dis*order. The arrangement may reflect an attempt at historical verisimilitude: the disorder is meant to suggest the absence of editorial intervention, and thereader is encouraged to accept the collection as a random assortment from the hand of the author himself. We are asked to believe not that the author wrote out of chronological sequence, but that the letters, retrieved from their respective addresses, were bound together as they came in, without regard for date or subject matter. In other words, this is like a jumble of ‘real’ letters in Pharlaris’ attic, not a sophisticated literary anthology.

One is reminded of the vast amount of scholarly work that has been done to try to figure out the original order of the Pauline letters, because the collection is not apparently in chronological order.

Rosenmeyer concludes that the only way we can tell whether a letter is genuine or a pseudonymous literary construction is from external evidence.  Internal literary clues are no help, because the authors of pseudonymous letters at the time were trained to make their work have the appearance of historicity.  So, how do we know which, if any, of the Pauline Epistles were actually written by Paul of Tarsus?

Theists are by and large presuppositionalists, whether they admit it or not. That is, they assume their religions are true, alongside the other assumptions we all must make to be functional human beings. I get this -- again, subjective -- impression from a number of things about theism in general. First, a pair of objective facts:

* If you are religious, it is almost certainly the religion of your parents. Conversions from one theistic belief system to another are rare.
* Your religion can be predicted with fairly good accuracy from your geographic region.

Then, some purely subjective impressions:

* To me, theists who engage in religious apologetics seem to argue in a way that indicates they believed *first*, and looked for justification for their beliefs *second*.
* Theists avoid trying to answer questions like ""what does the weight of evidence indicate?"" and ""what do I have good reason to think is true?"" No one looks about and says, ""the evidence and rational reasoning lead me to conclude that *X*,"" where *X* is the theological content of a religion.
* Theists who express the position that atheism is ""depressing"" seem to me to be very afraid of death, and hold their beliefs not because they genuinely think they make the most sense, but because they find the idea of a world without God and an afterlife a terrifying prospect.

All of this leads me to suspect -- again, I must emphasize that this is a subjective impression and I don't claim it to be fact -- that most theists did not reach their beliefs through calm and rational analysis. They were raised to believe as they do, they are afraid to lose that belief, and it is one of the underlying assumptions they make on the same level as ""I exist"" and ""my senses are at least sometimes accurate.""

Those last two are assumptions we all must make to avoid solipsism. We make many other assumptions day to day, of course, but for the most part, those assumptions are at least partially informed by deductive reasoning and experience. If you treat assumption as a spectrum, with 0 being ""not at all an assumption"" to 100 being ""nothing but an assumption,"" almost everything we do or think during the day would fall somewhere between. Even such seemingly obvious conclusions as ""if I stand up, I will be upright and vertical"" have a component of assumption within them; we assume them to be true because of past experiences, inductive reasoning that is metaphysically indefensible, but absolutely indispensable.

How do I actually know that standing up will result in me being upright and vertical? Well, I have to assume my past experiences are at least somewhat valid predictors of future performance. All other hypothetical results have failed to happen. I haven't ended up lying down. I haven't ended up floating in the air. I haven't ended up turning into a gigantic purple monkey. Is it even possible to know, 100%, that going through the motions of standing up will always result in me... well... standing up? Nope. But I can treat it as close enough to 100% to make it reasonable to behave as if I know.

So let's take it as a given that we all reach conclusions that contain a component of assumption, all day, every day. I assume my cup of water will remain a cup of water. I assume the sun will continue to generate heat. And so on.

The difference between these sorts of assumptions and the ones that are *nothing but* assumptions is what I'd like to focus on, now. ""I exist"" is 100% assumption. It has no basis in any evidence that doesn't also make that assumption. I can't prove it without resorting to circular logic.

My contention is that theistic belief ultimately belongs in that category of assumption. It cannot be compared to the assumptive components of any conclusions we reach that are somewhere on the spectrum between 0 -- ""not at all an assumption"" -- and 100 -- ""nothing but an assumption"" -- because anything on the spectrum also contains at least a little bit of non-assumption. Its assumptive value is 100 -- just like ""I exist"" and ""my senses are at least sometimes accurate.""

-----
All this said, I freely admit this is a subjective impression I've developed of theism and theists in general. I know it's not going to apply to people who were atheists and then converted to a religion, and I know most theists who aren't already proudly presuppositional will probably reject it. To those, I would like to ask two questions:

1. What *are* your assumptions, if your religion isn't one of them? I want to know what the basic starting assumptions are that would *lead* to religion.
2. If you do not presuppose your religion to be true, what are the rational steps you took to get from ""what does the weight of evidence indicate?"" and ""what do I have good reason to think is true?"" to your specific religious beliefs, and did the answers to those questions happen to coincide with the beliefs you were raised with?",,False,,t5_2snuc,False,,,True,t3_y8d61,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/y8d61/to_theists_what_are_your_assumptions/,
1344957726.0,28,self.DebateReligion,y7f4i,To Christians (that believe in the trinity):  Why is the true nature of God completely absent in Jewish scripture.  ,32,4,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/y7f4i/to_christians_that_believe_in_the_trinity_why_is/,"Over in this thread

http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/y6uoc/to_christians_abraham_achieved_salvation_prior_to/

it was discussed how Abraham was saved long before Christ ever atoned for sin.  This salvation was afforded to him as a result of his faith in God.  It seemed to be the general consensus among Christians (in that thread) that because Jesus is God and because God is timeless the atonement extends both directions and faith in God is the same as faith in Christ. 

Alright, thats my premise if you want to debate the premise click over to the other thread.  My question:

If my premise is true why is the true nature of God competely absent Jewish scripture?  It would seem God had no desire to explain to Abraham, Moses, Joseph, etc... who he really was.  Why did God not explain in detail to the prophets of old the doctrine of salvation?  If salvation through faith in Christ was readily availible to the Jews and all nations (thats part of the premise, see link above) it would make sense to me that God explained this to them. 

Now if we look at the Christian sect Mormonism this is actually what they teach.  They teach that Adam was given the gospel of Jesus via some angelic visitations and that animal sacrafice was meant to be a symbol of Christ's sacrafice that was scheduled to happen at a future date.  According to Mormon doctrine Noah, Abraham, Moses (and others) all taught the atonement of Christ as it is explained in the four Gospels.  

Now the Mormon answer to my concern is to rewrite history (they add to the Old Testament a 'Book of Abraham' and they make 1000s of alterations to the Old Testament, corrections, new verses, new chapters).   Question for the rest of Christianity.  Why didn't God do what Mormon doctrine claims he did (ignoring other details of Mormon theology of course)?  Why wasn't the Gospel of Christ ubiquitous through out Jewish scripture?  Not only is it not common, its nonexistent.  The Jews have thousands of verses to help them understand God, his nature, and his relationship with man.  The most important part of God's nature is missing.  The Jews also have loads of verses to explain to them the role of the messiah and his importance in God's plan... again we have nothing about the Atonement of Christ or the doctrine of the Trinity.  

I would like to hear the Christian perspective on this.  Now if your issue is that God could not forgive sin until after the atonement please seen the link up top, there is another thread for you.  This thread is assuming that Abraham was made right with God when he demonstrated faith in Him. This allowed Abraham admitance into heaven before Christ ever came to earth and was not contigent on any ritual (like circumcision).

So my question to you is, what is the motivation for all those people throughout history who claimed to be messengers of a God? 

Were they all high functioning schizophrenics, who were somehow sane enough to hoodwink the masses while simultaneously misinterpreting that voices in their heads were the word of God?

Were they all con artists, who again somehow fooled the masses despite not genuinely believing what they were saying? And if so, what was in it for them, when many of the better known religious leaders were highly persecuted for their claims? 

I am a Bahai, and I believe Baha'u'llah was a Manifestation of God. I read His Writings and I don't find anything wrong in them. He was born into a privileged family, but turned his back on the life he was born into and taught His message and created a new religion. He was imprisoned, poisoned, tortured and exiled repeatedly for his claims. Why would he do that if he didn't believe what he was saying? And He lived relatively recently, there are many western historical accounts of His character, and nothing I have ever read of Him indicates any form of mental illness.

Also, his writings are far too coherent to be that of a schizophrenic. He made quite a few prophecies that came true very quickly, such as the unexpected fall of Napoleon III. 

So again I ask, why are there people like this, if there is no God? Why are there so many people who claim to be divine messengers, and why if everything they have ever said has been false have so many people ""fallen"" for it and believed it. People aren't stupid, and almost everyone likes to think they can judge reasonably well how honest a person is and whether something they said is truthful or a lie.

Quite often, when we humans are walking around the house, we'll see a cockroach or a mosquito and kill it (they are quite common where I live).  Most people never give this a second thought.  Sometimes people will even destroy entire ant colonies without thinking twice.  While a Jain might find something wrong here, most people wouldn't think this immoral.  I suspect we don't think it is immoral because of the large perceived gap between insects and humans.  We don't think they can suffer as much as a dog, and so we feel we owe them less consideration.

Now, if **(and this is a big if)** god were to exist, the distance between it and humans would be exponentially larger than the distance between humans and insects.  Why then do we, as atheists, feel god is somehow accountable to us?  If we are allowed to morally destroy entire cities of ants, shouldn't it be more than morally justifiable for god to destroy entire cities of humans?

If the argument is one of suffering, then what if god were able to destroy an entire city where no one suffered?  Would that be immoral?  This doesn't change my belief that there is little to no evidence for god's existence, but it is an interesting concept that I can't quite seem to answer.

And it's absolutely nerve-racking (I get kinda built up about these things)

**Background of the argument**:

1.  The physical constants exist in exact amounts and proportions so as to support the development of intelligent minds (the example I always use is that if you alter the expansion rate of the universe by 1X10^-40, the universe either overexpands or collapses in on itself before any long lasting stars form and hence no plausible form of life could develop)

2. This is either due to chance, natural necessity, or design

3.  It's not due to chance or natural necessity

4.  Therefore it's due to design

There end up being a lot of parameters used like the proton neutron mass ratios, weak/strong radioactive force, etc.

**End of background**

**My objection to the argument**

My rebuttal comes in the form of very very simple statistics.  You can't make a probability call with a sample size of one.  As such we have no idea what the probabilities of the constants should be.  A high probability renders precision a moot idea.  Moreover, there are a couple ways of looking at precision:

A) Look at all conceivable outcomes and if the item in question represents a small portion of conceivable outcomes, then it's precise.

B) Look at how much any given process errs in any direction from the average.  If the item in question arrives at or reasonably near the desired outcome despite a high margin of error and an external input altered the outcome, it was made more precise.  Examples might be precision in darts compared to precision in initial shots in golf.  One normally has a small grouping (darts generally aren't off by yards) and the other normally has a large grouping (it's not unexpected that the first golf shot should be off by yards).  With darts if you're within millimeters of the bullseye great, but the idea of precision is looser in initial golf shots.

Just by comparison of the two categories, we can see that B is the more meaningful and that A is almost meaningless.  Do the constants vary widely?  Do they vary only a little?  At all?  I haven't seen anything that says anything about that.  From what I've read by Stenger/Carrier, nobody brings up anything.

I've run into a couple Bayesian statisticians nudging at it, but I'm not sure how they're arriving at the prior probabilities necessary for application of Bayes Theorem.

To be honest I'm not sure how people are coming up with anything resembling a meaningful number for some categories.  For instance, one could look at the rate of entropy in the universe.  Sure we can imagine it being 40 gajillion times faster than it is, but so what?  There's nothing to say that's physically possible and how the hell do you get any kind of probability out of that?

**Other objections to the argument**

I also brought this up about [4 months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/prny8/what_do_you_think_about_my_objection_to_the_fine/).  I noted that people wanted to discuss some other objections to fine tuning, and I just wanted to hit on a couple rebuttals I find insufficient:

1) The vast majority of time and space has been inhospitable to intelligent life.  Well I don't consider this a good rebuttal because the argument is about any life at all, not about saturating the universe for all time with life.

2) Life could exist in other forms.  It's not inconceivable to not have carbon based life, but no working models have been proposed.  If one does and is more amenable to other tunings then this would be a good rebuttal, but only then.  Moreover, plenty of the parameters have to do with the existence of the whole of the universe or long lasting stars or instances where we would have much except hydrogen.  

3) The multiverse (or oscillatory universe) + anthropic principle (There are many universes, and we can't observe our nonexistence, so we observe ourselves in a universe in which we could exist) still seems like a plausible hypothesis but I could use more backing for it.  I've read up on the ""bruising"" found on cosmic microwave background radiation that might imply other universes but it seems we're still trying to figure out if this observation is in error.  I've heard speculation that the dark energy found in our universe could be gravity from other universes (which seems highly highly speculative) and I've also heard that string theory predicts 1x10^500 or so universes, but I've got no idea how that works.

As I've somewhat noted, what I find most disturbing is that I've seen a number of professionals use these rebuttals which I consider bad or unsubstantiated, but I haven't seen any professionals hint at my objection.

If these are really inspired rules, and not rules based on observation, then why would the inspirer not bother to mention such a simple and effective procedure?

EDIT: spelling

EDIT2:  Perhaps I'm beating around the bush too much.  I'm not asking why there is no mention so much as I am asking about the implications of such an omission.  The old testament is concerned with cleanliness to the point it could reasonably be called an obsession.  Doesn't this omission at least cast a shadow of incredulity on the concept that these works were divinely inspired?  Doesn't it at least hint at the fact that this was a collection of works based on human observation, and not divine insight?  The omission of modern medicine is one thing...it is complicated, and not easily understood by ancient nomads, or easily carried out without reliance on other advanced technologies.  But for so many passages to be devoted to cleanliness, only to have this one simple thing omitted, one thing which could be argued as a much better defense than anything else mentioned, seems glaring.

To say that these cleanliness laws were solely based on the concept of spiritual cleanliness seems naive.  While spiritual cleanliness clearly seems to be part of these practices, their concern seems to draw directly from physical cleanliness.

-An atheist saying what answer he thinks a theist would give, and why it's dumb

-A theist answering a question honestly, in which case the discussion moves to why they're a theist at all (not judging that, just saying it's a pattern)

-An agnostic (looking at you, redyellingman) chiding an atheist for the way they judge theists

Basically, are there questions we could ask or response styles we could try that wouldn't always stagnate to the same thing? For instance, maybe if we discussed some hypothetical situations and why we'd react the way we would, we could learn something about how similar/different our views are practically rather than philosophically (since sometimes it really does feel like a question of semantics and labelling). Any thoughts people?

If you want to know how people respond to the problem of evil, go look up what they said last time instead of having us go through the same old discussion.

Even worse, I believe, it conditions people to accept information from authority without justification or evidence. This throws off one's entire system of cognitive verification.

&gt;Nonbeliever: How can you Christians believe these ridiculous creation stories?! The science totally contradicts them, and they don't even agree with each other!

&gt;Christian: Your problem is that you are taking the texts literally. The stories of the bible don't need to be literally true to *contain* truth.

&gt;Nonbeliever: Cherry-picking rabble rabble literal rabble metaphorical rabble rabble Leviticus rabble...

Personally, I think this approach misses the point. My first problem is that, by taking this line of argument, he jumps directly into making accusations about how the believer should interpret his scriptures. Needless to say this does not often lead to a productive conversation.

But that's a problem with strategy, and not with content. What bothers me even more is that this approach leaves a huge assertion completely unchallenged: namely, that *we can know that certain things the bible says are true a priori*. Eschewing a literal interpretation doesn't help with this claim - it avoids making the bible obviously false, yes, but in doing so does not establish claims of truth. The fundamentalist who claims that every idea in the bible (historical, scientific, spiritual, etc.) is correct and the more ""liberal"" believer who only claims that the bible is authoritative in spiritual matters still face the problem of justifying *how* we know that the bible is right about these things.

Surely we can imagine writings on spiritual topics that are wrong (in fact we don't need to, because we have them in the form of holy texts from other religions), so merely restricting the subject matter doesn't guarantee us infallibility. So what does? Christians, can you explain to me how we know that the bible is right about what you think it's right about? For mundane topics (e.g. geography and history), we can of course compare biblical claims to what we know from other sources to figure out if it's right. But that's not what I'm talking about here. I'm talking about the *a priori* assumption of accuracy - that the bible has some kind of ""authority"" that guarantees us that certain claims are correct *without us having to check them first*.

This is another one of those statements (like ""Jesus was always right"") that, while rarely made explicit, seems to be held implicitly by a majority of Christians. For example, I have seen that the members of r/Christianity will freely give out bible quotations as advice, the subtext being ""this statement is from the bible, and therefore necessarily correct or helpful for your situation"". So I don't think I'm grossly misrepresenting the vast majority of Christians with this challenge.

But, as usual, I know that there will be Christians who don't agree, so if you feel that I am mischaracterizing your view of scripture, feel free to say so in the comments.

I'm not afraid to admit that religion isn't *all* bad, or it wouldn't be so widespread in the various cultures of the planet.  To me, it just shows that it was relevant to our species at one point in our evolution for *some* reason or another.

It's often explained that no wars or acts of terrorism have ever been committed in the name of atheism.  While this is largely true, does that mean that terrorists only commit terror because they are religious, or could it because of a number of other underlying issues?  Most people who claim to be religious I know *aren't* violent or insane, and most of them will denounce acts of terrorism committed by groups declaring their acts to be on behalf of their religion.

The only problem I've ever found with moderates are those that don't speak out against the fundamentalists -- and such moderates are rare.  Most I've met abhor terrorism and inhumanity just as much as the rest of us.

While I won't accept the ""no true Scotsman"" excuse when moderates use it, but I also don't judge the character and stability of said moderates or their entire religion  based on the acts of individuals either.

As a human, I'm, of course, still subject to be influenced by my emotions.  I will admittedly become more likely to generalize and judge a religion based on a news report about an attack somewhere -- until I think it through.

I know many atheists out there are libertarian or liberal when it comes to social views, and would say that on the subject of gun control, ""guns don't kill people, people do"".  The gun is merely a tool or instrument that, when wielded by someone irresponsible or dangerous enough, can become deadly.  I wonder why religion isn't seen the same way?

How many other atheists out there come to this same reasonable compromise?  

I like to think that those atheists who don't (Dawkinz!!!) are simply the part of the crowd we need to push us towards social and legal equality.  Anyone else agree?

**edit** Yes, no analogy is perfect.  I realize that a gun is a thing and religion is ideology.  That's why it's called an analogy and not an exactly-the-same-ology.

1375526012.0,26,self.DebateReligion,1jmd1u,[META] Saving this Sub,79,53,237,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1jmd1u/meta_saving_this_sub/,"This sub is a circlejerk. I say this as a person who is generally quite critical of both traditional theistic and anti-theistic arguments. There is an abundance of evidence to prove that it is a circlejerk, but I doubt anyone doubts this fact. If you do, I can provide an extremely detailed profile it in a few days.

There are a few critical problems, and I think the solutions are fairly clear, but we need to do something instead of continue declining with the occasional meta post protesting along the way.

**Problem 1: Questions in titles**

This is extremely prevalent and problematic. The specifics of this problem were astutely described [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/171i10/meta_to_all_if_you_want_to_debate_state_your/), but to summarize, most of these questions are passive-aggressive, subtextual digs at the opposing side. Presenting debates like this generally leads to a hostile tone in the discussion. Additionally, it will be much more confusing for people new to the sub who haven't learned our strange system of subtext. For example, I can give you links to about 15 /r/DebateReligion posts that ask the question ""Is there free will in heaven?"" to Christians. Now, for those of us familiar with the old song and dance, we know that the subtext is that a widely-accepted solution to the Logical Problem of Evil is the Free Will Defense, which relies on the possibility of Transworld Depravity, whereas many Christian conceptions of heaven would serve as a counter-example to Transworld Depravity being unavoidable. Can you see why it's really dumb to state this as a leading question, in effect forcing there to be several comments before the debate begins over the OP's actual subtextual assertion? It would be infinitely better to say: ""To Theists: The Christian conception of heaven seems to conflict with a key tenet of the Free Will Defense."" No one feels patronized or like the OP is trying to disguise a dig at religion. Instead, it's a clear assertion up for debate. I know people have suggested this before, but **Mods, you have the power to make this a rule.** How about no questions in titles except for truly neutral collection of opinions or other (rare) exceptions? I think it would improve the subreddit immensely.

**Problem 2: Engagement with philosophy**

A lot of atheist and anti-theistic people here have a strong distaste/distrust of any non-logical positivist philosophy. This is strange, since the overwhelming majority of contemporary philosophy is atheist. I don't want to link when it's going to cause brigading, but I'll just say that a subreddit full of academic philosophers has taken to mocking the philosophical views found at /r/DebateReligion. I think this is a problem for a subreddit that is, undeniably, debating the philosophy of religion. And while the worst offenders are a big problem, I think the vast majority of people here could benefit from a bit more reading. I think someone trained in philosophy in an academic capacity should assemble separate introductory and advanced surveys of the history of philosophy, with a slight emphasis on philosophy of religion, and these should be ""required reading."" Let's be honest here, people learn a lot from debating ideas themselves, but if you have no idea of even the foundations of academic philosophy, it is a lot more likely that you're going to wallow around in really fucking stupid ideas than independently intuit a previously undiscovered universal truth. The wallowing bit happens a lot here and, as with yesterdays ""onion"" post, the similarly poorly moderated /r/philosophy. I know there has been push back over any sort of official sub doctrine because we don't want to give more weight to certain ideas, but certain things are universally agreed to be true/false by the relevant authorities, and having weekly threads to debate them over and over again is really stupid, tiring, and circlejerky. But at any rate, I would love to have a sub where the discussion took a meaningful turn into Kant, Hegel, and Nietzsche rather than the perpetual hashing of debates. This segues into my last point.

**Problem 3: Repetition**

Recently, out of curiosity, I decided to try to see how many of the front page posts could be found discussed previously over the past 1.5 years in /r/DebateReligion. I knew we had a lot of repetition, but the results were absolutely staggering. I'm still compiling them, but I'm fairly sure 90% of posts on the sub can be distilled to the same 30 questions (I'm working on listing those questions). I don't even want to discuss the circlejerking in those posts, which is potentially viewed as a controversial accusation by some. But saying we get several posts a week about xyz topic is, empirically, not an exaggeration. Overall, we have a very weird and ultimately harmful lifecycle of posts. Most subs our size have a few big posts a day with ~200 upvotes and a lot of comments. We have about 10 (at least) posts per day. These usually receive about 5 and up to about 30 upvotes *but they all have 30 to 200 comments*. That's a *ton* of comments. I realize some of it is skewed because we are a debate subreddit, but that's still a really weird pattern, especially when half of those posts are boilerplate copies of something else posted this week. Honestly, discussions like these never go anywhere. You're trying to recreate a meaningful debate about a topic that has likely been discussed among professional theologians and philosophers for centuries in a few sentences. Not to say that people here don't have interesting/meaningful contributions when they have time to work on it, but splintering so much means that we never get past the surface in most debates. Several other subs I frequent use a model that I feel we could employ. They have content-specific recurring threads. What if we had a weekly ""Problem of Evil"" thread? It would be great! Everyone could discuss there, together, instead of one of 4 ""To Theists: why does god allow suffering"" threads with 7 upvotes and 45 comments. People could actually meaningfully discuss parts of an issue, assign themselves further reading (hell yes there are academic papers just about this), meet up again with previous debate opponents, develop their arguments, etc. That way, we can both move past surface level discussion on common topics and clear up the front page more. I think this would do wonders for the sub. You could have one for such topics as specific as ""Christian salvation doctrine,"" or general (this might be in more danger of jerking) ""conceptions of morality,"" etc. Posting about recurring topics outside these threads would not be allowed without special exception. It works really well for some other subs.

**Call to Action**

There have been many meta posts with many unclear proposals. But we've gotta institute changes, which is why I provided clear possible solutions to these problems. Let's just say that I think this sub is starting to draw outside attention from multiple other subs to how bad it is, most of which is beyond just the stuff I alluded to earlier. I realize a lot of people think that anything is up for debate, which is a noble goal to some extent, but especially to anyone who wants to engage with contemporary philosophy's views on religion, we've got to give up on the idea that all starting points are equally valid and instead actually learn and adhere to a basic level of philosophical literacy that we teach to newcomers. I could see this place being really great, with a bit of neutral introductory curriculum like other subs and then fresh discussion about new topics. 

We can do better. But we have to act soon.

**EDIT** Yo, this philosophy proposition seems to be causing a lot of controversy and is overpowering the general discussion. I'm not proposing we all have to read Plantinga or William Lain Craig (who isn't a philosopher) or John Calvin or something. I'm talking a comprehensive history of western philosophy or something from Plato to modern times. No one is trying to indoctrinate anyone.

* Newton - Nature is orderly and law abiding

1372346687.0,29,self.DebateReligion,1h6l9y,To all: Arguing about definitions versus arguing about concepts,44,15,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1h6l9y/to_all_arguing_about_definitions_versus_arguing/,"In [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1h5391/i_watched_a_family_guy_episode_where_stewie_and/), the difficulty in defining the word ""good"" came up again, and frankly, I'm rather sick of it. Going on and on about how to properly define a word completely ignores the real issue of what concept the word is used to represent.

""Good"" can be used to mean any of the following and more:

1. Delicious tasting - *""This burger is good.""*
2. Possessed of a friendly and kind demeanor - *""He treats everyone well. He's a good man.""*
3. A high standard of a subjective quality - *""She's got a really good singing voice.""*
4. Highly skilled - *""She's good at fencing.""*
5. Beneficial for a desired trait - *""Eat more vegetables, they're good for your body.""*


And so on, and so on... We use ""good"" and ""goodness"" in all kinds of different ways and different contexts. When I describe my mom as a good cook, it's shorthand for ""my mom makes healthy and delicious food."" When I describe Michael Jordan as a good basketball player, it's shorthand for ""Michael Jordan throws basketballs through basketball hoops with a high degree of precision."" No one equivocates between both uses of the word ""good"" to make the claim that my mom has Michael Jordan's talent for basketball (or that Michael Jordan is a skilled cook).

In that prior, heavily down-voted post, it became pretty obvious very quickly that what /u/Haxxmonkey had done is asked for a definition of the word. I don't think there's any merit left in a discussion about that, because it will inevitably devolve into an argument over whether or not the goodness applied to basketball talent is the same goodness theists derive from their gods.

It's not. The concepts are discreet.

From now on, I propose that we all immediately dispense with words like ""good,"" ""moral,"" and ""evil"" in any discussion wherein disputes about their definitions arise, since everyone defines them differently.

In the context of Haxxmonkey's post, consider what happens when we replace ""good"" with either of the following phrases:

* ""Beneficial to the health, happiness, well-being, and longevity of members of the human species.""
* ""In accordance with the will of God.""

If ""good"" is defined as the former, then scientific progress is demonstrably good. If it is defined as the latter, then there's no way to know whether it's good or not. But in either case, we've rejected all possibility of equivocation on the many meanings of the word, and gotten down to brass tacks, a discussion about concepts instead, for which words like ""good"" are always shorthand.

As an atheist, I am probably biased in that I perceive much of the argumentation over the definition of ""good"" as an attempt to equivocate between disparate concepts the word can refer to, but there are probably plenty of examples of atheists abusing this word (and others) too. So I'm not singling anyone out here. Rather, I'd like us all to take better care to ensure we don't smuggle two or more otherwise unconnected concepts into a single word or phrase.

**Edit**: As /u/TheFeshy points out [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1h6l9y/to_all_arguing_about_definitions_versus_arguing/careg4q), this is basically like the game of ""Taboo,"" which forces its players to convey a concept without the label usually associated with it.

Perhaps it's correct to do so, but it does seem a bit odd that our conclusions with theists should disagree every step of the way.

Here are the premises I accept from some of the most typical arguments:

*Kalam* - The universe began to exist

*Moral argument* - objective morals do exist

*Fine tuning* - The constants exist in a narrow range necessary for the development of intelligent life (and in some cases any complex structures) but only with the caveat that all else is equal in the universe, for instance the early expansion rate of the universe would not at all be necessary in a steady state universe.

Some others to consider (which I don't necessarily accept and perhaps don't deny): It's possible to conceive of God (Anslem's ontological argument), God possibly exists &amp; God if He did exist would be necessary (Plantinga's MOA),  people desire God to exist (Argument from desire), Jesus was not a lunatic or a liar (Lord Liar Lunatic), I could go on.

&gt; Most modern scholars dismiss Pope Joan as a Medieval legend.[5] The Oxford Dictionary of Popes [6] acknowledges that this legend was widely believed for centuries, even among Catholic circles, but declares that there is ""no contemporary evidence for a female Pope at any of the dates suggested for her reign,"" and goes on to say that ""the known facts of the respective periods make it impossible to fit [a female Pope] in"".

&gt; [...]

&gt; It is also notable that enemies of the Papacy in the 9th century make no mention of a female Pope. For example, Photius I of Constantinople, who became Patriarch in 858 and was deposed by Pope Nicholas I in 863, was an enemy of the Pope. He vehemently asserted his own authority as Patriarch over that of the Pope in Rome, and would have made the most of any scandal of that time regarding the Papacy; but he never mentions the story once in any of his voluminous writings. Indeed, at one point he mentions ""Leo and Benedict, successively great priests of the Roman Church"".[12]


So, resuming. Some reasons to reject Pope Joan are:

* There is no contemporary evidence of her existence
* The known facts of the period don't mesh with her existence
* The enemies of the Papacy said nothing about her

Which seems quite similar to how it goes for Jesus:

* Contemporary evidence for Jesus is absent. The only records are from people well after his death date, from people who couldn't have seen him in person because they weren't even born yet.
* It is known that there are many inaccuracies in the NT regarding subjects like the census, geography, and that there is a lack of third party confirmation of the huge events mentioned (triumphal entry into Jesuralem, darkness, eclipse, zombies, resurrection, etc)

1347057330.0,26,self.DebateReligion,zj20q,To All: Philosophy's Turf Defense,42,16,166,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/zj20q/to_all_philosophys_turf_defense/,"In [a recent post on Sandwalk](http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2012/09/john-wilkins-defends-philosophy-bit-of.html), Larry Moran made some very interesting points about the relationship that science has with philosophy and religion.  The whole thing is worth a read, but I'll quote a somewhat edited version here.

&gt;There was a time, not so long ago, when science and philosophy coexisted in (relative) peace and harmony. This began to change when science came under increasing attack from religion and from others who simply denied the knowledge that had been produced by the scientific way of thinking.

&gt;Now, you would think that philosophy would be a natural ally in this fight since the most important feature of philosophy is its ability to distinguish logical arguments from ones that are illogical. In other words, philosophy should be on the side of rationalism and not on the side of superstition.

&gt;It didn't work out that way. Unfortunately, many university philosophy departments were full of theists and those theistic philosophers did not sit still when their basic premises were being challenged. They began to see a connection between atheism and the scientific way of thinking and they decided that the best way to preserve their superstitious beliefs was to join the attack on scientists. That's why we've seen a ton of books from philosophers who try to refute *The God Delusion* by making a case against the scientific way of thinking. It's why we see so much criticism of scientism.

&gt;Instead of actually debating those issues, the philosophers are much more interested in trying to prove that scientists should keep their mouths shut because they haven't studied enough philosophy to have a serious opinion on the existence of god(s). 

&gt;It's all about defending turf. And it's astonishing that this comes from philosophers who should be smart enough to see why their logic is flawed.

&gt;If a scientist got involved in the question of god's existence then they were no longer thinking like a scientist—they were in the realm of metaphysics. And in order to engage in metaphysical debates you pretty much had to be a card-carrying philosopher. In other words, if you don't know the difference between Plato and Aristotle then you have no business debating the existence of god(s).

&gt;I think the philosophers were a little surprised at what happened next. Instead of just rolling over and admitting that philosophy could provide all the answers, scientists starting challenging the premises that philosophers had been taking for granted over the past several hundred years. They started to ask embarrassing questions like, ""What's the evidence that philosophy has produced knowledge?"" or ""What's the evidence that methodological naturalism is a limitation of science?""

&gt;Philosophers are rightly upset by this development. They all seem to have believed that their status and authority would rapidly squelch the upstart scientists who dared to intrude on their territory. They seem to have believed that all they had to do was start talking about Hume and Kant, and other long-dead philosophers, and that would quickly send the scientists scurrying back into their labs.

&gt;Now they don't know what to do. Some of them just start shouting even louder that they are the authorities and whatever they say is right. That's not going to work. Some of them try using their well-honed rhetorical tricks to defend their turf. That's not going to work either. Those tricks are mostly question begging.

Now, I'm certainly not claiming to be an expert scientist by any measure.  But I am an atheist, and I am scientifically literate, and I ask much the same questions that Moran points out here.  There's a tendency for many of the philosophers out there, both in the ranks of the ""big name"" philosophers and in our own discussions here, to give responses that are blatant turf defense.  The most common goes something like this: ""You're philosophically unsophisticated, so I don't need to take you seriously. Go read a bunch of stuff that I like, and come back when you don't disagree with me any more.""

That's not going to fly.  I have no objection to reading, to learning new things, to stepping outside my comfort zone, to exposure to ideas with which I disagree, or to changing my opinion.  What I *do* object to is a refusal to provide evidence that a particular work will be worth my time.  It's true that I haven't immersed myself in the works of various philosophers, and the expansions upon their work that other philosophers have made, and the subtle refutations that yet other philosophers have presented.  But I'm not an idiot.

Arguments from authority are worthless.  Many philosophers appeal to them, which surprises me, because they should know better.  Wordplay and jargon don't make for a good argument.  That I find much of philosophy to fall into this category doesn't mean I ""just don't understand"", it means that a clearer explanation is required.  If a plain-spoken amateur like myself makes a point, pretending that it's wrong *because* I'm a plain-spoken amateur is completely unconvincing.

I understand why the turf defense occurs.  Philosophers need to maintain that they're important and relevant.  That doesn't mean I'm willing to tolerate it.  Particularly in an open forum such as this, I expect that people can *demonstrate* why their ideas are relevant.

Before delving into this, I would like to say I am not supporting the sex trade, but rather the Amsterdam method of the sex market; legal, safe and without abuse (unless you pay extra). 

I bought a new pair of shoes for about £20. There are few things sadder than buying a new pair of formal shoes. You only ever get to flaunt them at the death of someone you know, or the death of someone one of your someones knows. Then it dawned on me; I enjoyed owning these shoes for roughly the same time as I would have enjoyed sex. 20 minutes, and that is with the effort it took to lace them. 

This led me to the conclusion that I don't think I have an issue with prostitution. Some people paint it as sleazy, morally lacking or desperate. It might be the last one but so is owning a cat. I pay for other services with the intent of pleasure, so why should sex be any different?

There's a tendency for the Sophisticated Theologians^TM among us to respond to modern atheist thought with [derision and laughter](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/uxhus/to_all_the_atheist_school_of_thought_or_yes_i/c4zjhiz).  Now, we all know that this does nothing to *address* the arguments being made, but it's a common reaction, so it deserves our attention.  There's a respect given to things that seem profound, and since much modern atheist work tends to *deflate* profundities and eschew them in favor of clearly and understandably presenting a point, it is treated as simplistic and elementary.  But Dennett, in the process of deflating these profundities, shows the problem.

Theologians, he notes, are the spinmeisters of religion.  The goal: What can be said to the laity that doesn't reveal the truth of the matter?  And the canon of good spin is as follows:

* It is not a bare-faced lie.
* You have to be able to say it with a straight face.
* It has to relieve skepticism without arousing curiosity.
* It should seem profound.

He later references what is I think one of the most blatant examples of this tendency, coming from Karen Armstrong's *A Case For God*.  In this book, a response to the writings of Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens, and Dennet himself, she states the following:

&gt;God is no being at all.

And this statement is hailed as deeply profound, as sophisticated theology.  I'm sure many people here can read that, even if they've never encountered it before, and see how that fits into modernist theology, and expresses many deep truths about the nature of man's relationship with the divine.  Now, compare it with this statement:

&gt; No being at all is god.

Well, that's ""crude atheism"".  It simply denies that any being can be considered god; there's nothing profound there, it doesn't tell us about the human condition, it's just...primitive atheism.  Which *of course* isn't sophisticated, right?  That's the kind of thing you expect from Richard Dawkins, and it can just be laughed off as ""missing the point.""

Some of you, though, might know about predicate logic.  Put the two through predicate calculus.  Go on, I'll wait.

Yep, they are *exactly the same*.  Their meanings are *precisely* identical.  They are logically equivalent statements.  But the former is sophisticated theology, and the latter is crude, boring atheism.

Armstrong goes on with things like ""God is Being itself"" and ""God is the God beyond God.""  The conclusion that can be drawn from this, the hailing of meaningless and vacuous statements like these as somehow being of value, is that theology simply isn't concerned with being meaningful.  The goal is to *appear* meaningful so as to justify being engaged in the subject, a task that I see being studiously practiced all the time here.  In the pursuit of this goal, admittedly, it's possible that certain items of real utility will emerge; modal logic may have been invented in an attempt to obscure the blatant falsehood of the god hypothesis, but it's proven to be actually useful on occasion.  But overall, I think that we've long since reached the point, and it may even have been the point all along, that theology is not saying anything meaningful; it is rather an exercise in saying whatever strings of words ensure that religion, and theology itself, are perpetuated.",,False,,t5_2snuc,False,,,True,t3_v46nu,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/v46nu/to_all_is_theology_meaningful/,

For instance there's the concept of ""nothing"" that comes from Lawrence Krauss which is dependent on observation. This is fundamentally different from the so called ""philosophical nothing"" which I have often seen defined as ""having no properties"". 

Is this philosophical nothing even a coherent concept? Isn't the property of having no properties a property? 

I have also heard it argued that from this property-less nothing, the universe could not have arose without cause. This seems rather baseless since by definition this nothing is not allowed to have properties, and the constraint that universes cannot arise without cause is again...a property. If god doesn't exist within this nothing, then this implies some kind of conceptual boundary inside of which there is nothing but outside of which there is god. Again, this seems to gives rise to properties.

This definition seems rife with contradiction to me. Most of the contradictions seem to be caused by the definition itself, and seem to be the result of this nothing being a purely mental construct with no bearing on reality.

But there are no degrees. Heaven is achieved by absolute piety, ample humility and undoubting belief. The humility may come into direct contrast with them striving for the prize brought about by the undoubting belief, but that is an argument for another thread. The point is that Heaven is hard to get into, and only by being *perfect* to their parameters do you have a, if you'll excuse the term, hope in Hell.

Hell, in juxtaposition, is rather easy to get into. It is an eternal (in some religions limited) torment. But said torment is brought about by both trivial and serious crimes. For example, if one is to steal paint, one would receive the same damnation as if one had murdered someone. 

This is entirely unfair. The whole idea of proportional retribution is demolished. So to this I ask theists, why stop at minor sins? Why not indulge in the murder of your enemies considering it seems just as wicked as theft? It would appear to me, and refute me if I am wrong, that your God illustrates an indifference to the level of sin.

To Atheists and those with different afterlives: Do you agree with the proposition? I know that Karma, for example, has the severity as part of its fundamentals. Reincarnation would be another example of proportional justice.

Many people think that morality is relative because people/societies have disagreed with each other over time.  Well, that's true of medicine as well.  Many people will disagree about which medicines work best and ideas about what medicines works have varied greatly from different times and places.  People have believed that you can purify blood with leeches, determine a person's behavior by the shape or their skull or cure infertility with ground up rhinoceros horn.  None of that changes that there are some actually effective medicines out there.

Some people try to point to moral dilemmas like the [trolley problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) or [samaritan's dilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritan%27s_dilemma) in order to say that the grey areas of ethics make the subjectivity of morality more apparent.  I would contend that the specifics of medicine are quite often not clear either and that there is room for debate in the use of many medicines.

Really the only thing that need be used as any kind of foundation for both these things is that we should promote the well-being of sentient animals (and perhaps societies by proxy).

I studied the scriptures my whole life. I was raised in a Christian home with a very religious mother who brought me to church every Sunday, Friday and Wednesday. 




I wanted to be a minister since I was young and everyone told me it was my calling but over the last 3 years I have lost my faith. It wasn't a tragic event that caused this but I hard look at the facts of the religion I was raised in. 



I have questioned everything I was raised to believe in and I don't understand the God I was raised to believe in at all. I wrestled with really hard questions as i got older like:
How can God command people to not kill others and then instruct them to kill an entire people **(Deuteronomy 20:17) ""kill the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—as the LORD your God has commanded you.""**



I could never answer the question in my mind why God would have us kill groups of people yet Jesus preached about loving thy neighbor. This is a contradiction in my mind and caused me question more.  I started noticing other things that I couldn't figure out like God saying,  **Ex 20:5 ""You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me.""**




Two things stuck out to me: 

1. How can God be jealous? I am a human and imperfect and I don't really get jealous. Jealousy seems like a selfish trait and selfishness is pride which God says he hates. 

2. Why would God punish the children for the sins of their fathers? Even in our sinful culture today we don't kill the children of murderers because we know that they are innocent. 

How can these traits and statements be a part of a loving, merciful God? I started to realize they can't be. Either God doesn't exist or people must have misheard or used the name of God to invoke all kinds of selfish deeds much like people to today. ""God told me to drown my children."" 


More and more major contradictions popped out like God not showing partiality yet clearly overlooking the sins of David and others. 


Little by little I lost my faith. 


Now I live with a fear, if I am wrong I might burn in hell and if I am right then I won't know till the end. 


How do you explain these verses and contradictions?

I was reading a post the other day about the fact the Bible does not mention Judas Iscariot being damned to Hell for the betrayal of Jesus. Logically it would be rather unjust for a God to condemn a man who's actions were not of his own free will but predestined by God to fulfil a greater plan, the sacrifice of his son. 

Assuming then that Judas was not in fact condemned to Hell, it implies that for Hell to exist at all the actions of which we are judged are only those of free will. Similarly does this not suggest that in order for Hell to exist that destiny, as a result of Gods manipulation or ""grand plan"" for you, must not? 

Furthermore, prayer would (hopefully) invoke the intervention by God to some degree and as a result change the future circumstances in which the person then makes future ""free will"" choices. So any intervention by God should essentially determine a persons ultimate future. Again at odds with the requirements for Hell to exist. Let me give an example:

A man is poor and humble, his family starving. He prays to god for money to feed his family. A week later he wins the lottery (or any other circumstance in which he gains wealth), he can now feed his family and live a lavish lifestyle. Through this the man becomes jaded and spoiled by wealth, as a result of his sins he should be cast into Hell. But it was God's intervention that put him on that road in which he sinned. Ultimately, following the Judas example, he should be spared Hell. 

The logical continuation of this is that prayers are never answered by God to preserve the course of ""free will"", seemingly making prayer pointless. I'd be interested in hearing a Christian opinion of this, preferably with more substance than ""says so in the Bible, so prayer does work!""

TL;DR: Prayer invokes the involvement of God, to go to Hell you must willingly do wrong through free will, which is ultimately influenced by the intervention of God.

In the first paragraph, it says:

&gt; In philosophy of mind, dualism is a set of views about the relationship between mind and matter, which begins with the claim that mental phenomena are, in some respects, non-physical.

I like this as a starting off point, because it describes only the feature common to all forms of dualism: the belief that the mind is not purely the result of physical and chemical processes.

Setting aside all the variants of dualism -- Aristotelian, substance, predicate, hammiesinkian (heh) -- all of them^1 have one thing in common:

They're all wrong.

* **Current science**

Throw together all the logical proofs you want. Philosophize to your heart's content. Wax poetic, if it suits you to do so. But dualism is wrong.

You see, science doesn't care about philosophy, ontological arguments, and all that jazz. While philosophers, both online and off, argue about it, the neurosciences are actually figuring it out. Again, I'll reference Wikipedia here, because the article about the [brain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain) is quite good as well. In the intro, we see this paragraph:

&gt; From a philosophical point of view, what makes the brain special in comparison to other organs is that it forms the physical structure that generates the mind. As Hippocrates put it: ""Men ought to know that from nothing else but the brain come joys, delights, laughter and sports, and sorrows, griefs, despondency, and lamentations."" The mechanisms by which brain activity instantiates consciousness and thought have been very challenging to understand: despite rapid scientific progress, much about how brains work remains a mystery. The operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail, but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions has been very difficult to decipher. The most promising approaches treat the brain as a **biological computer**, very different in mechanism from electronic computers, but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways.

That is a pretty accurate summary of current brain science. Yes, we know a lot about how it works now. Yes, there's still a lot we don't know. But we're figuring it out, and absolutely nothing we've discovered so far indicates that there are any non-material components of the mind. The brain isn't acting as some sort of aetheric radio receiver for signals from the soul, it's acting as a computer.

* **Objection!**

Now, the standard theistic response I've seen on this is: Who programmed the computer? A computer without software is useless.

Indeed it is! A computer without software would be a totally ineffective lump of matter, using up resources to load only the most basic, hard-coded autonomic functions. That's not at all like a fully-developed adult human being! It's basically just a financial drain if you leave it plugged in, generating emissions and noises without doing anything useful or helpful.

Gosh, where have I seen something like that before? Something that's a drain on my resources, generates emissions and noises, and doesn't really do very much? It's right on the tip of my tongue... I'm sure I could think of it, but my daughter just spat up on me, so I better go clean up.

* **Overruled**

Where dualists get tripped up is in imagining an **adult** brain in comparison to a computer, without going through the intermediate stages.

My daughter has learned how to crawl, how to pick up toys and wave them around, how to laugh in response to play, and how to say ""mama"" and ""dada"" (although she hasn't quite figured out how to **stop** saying either of them, so it tends to come out as ""mamamamamama"" or ""dadadadadada""). She started out like a computer with only the BIOS, but now she has a basic operating system and a few simple apps.

With computers, the process of becoming complex enough to do useful things is called ""software installation."" With babies, it's called ""life.""

So who installed my daughter's ""operating system"" and ""apps?"" Her mother and I, her older sister, her interactions with other people, and the rest of her life experiences up to this point. No non-material third party is necessary for the world's most extraordinary learning computer to, well, learn.

* **Objection! Again!**

But what about me? Who programmed me? And my parents? And their parents? Aren't I just moving the problem back a step?

Nope. Go back enough generations, and you'd be able to see small but steady improvements and refinements in the human brain as the species evolved. For millions of years, our ancestors have found intelligence to be a desirable trait, and have selected for it. Through the process of natural selection, this extraordinary learning computer of ours has become more extraordinary. *Homo sapiens* is a heck of a lot smarter than *homo erectus*, who in turn was smarter than *australopithecus africanus*. In minute ways that built up over time, each generation's brain built on the quality of the last generation's brain, until our contemporary situation in which IQ tests have had to become [harder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect) to keep a score of 100 the average.

Yep, we're still getting smarter. I'm an outlier, with a measured IQ of 165, but I wouldn't be at all surprised to see that become the new 100, assuming I live long enough.

* **Goodnight, sweet prince**

No poisoned blades were involved, but dualism is as dead as Hamlet. And by ""dead as Hamlet,"" I mean ""won't finish the damn death scene."" It keeps popping back up, just when you think -- to use a term filled with imagery I don't believe in -- it will finally give up the ghost.

It's only a matter of time before the majority of mysteries regarding brain function are solved, and putting dualism in that ever-shrinking gap of knowledge is as nonsensical as any God-of-the-gaps argument. It's time to put dualism to bed alongside other obsolete philosophies.

*The rest is silence.*

With the recent tragedy in Norway, I don't hear anyone saying ""well those people are just evil anyway. They have a long history of slaughtering people."" 

Blacks in Africa are still actively holding genocides in Africa, and have been doing so for decades. This is much more recent than any crusades or witch-burning. In fact in 1999 it was determined that 34% of gang members in the united states were black people. It's totally unacceptable to say ""Blacks are just violent, evil people. Look at their history! Look at what they are doing this very moment!""

Arabs were said to have enslaved up to 18 million people during the Arab slave trade.

Communists/secularists/Russians (take your pick) were responsible for the Holodomor genocide resulting in the deaths of some 7.5 million people. 

Mongols were obviously known for raping and pillaging about half the world at the time.

Germans were Nazis with a genocide of 6 million.

The Japanese killed 400,000 Koreans during the Japanese Occupation of Korea.

Enough of that, though. My point is that it's obvious that nothing inherent to *being* any race or creed or nationality above caused anyone to do those things they did. Not everyone in those groups engaged in that terrible behavior at the time, these people are obviously not doing these things now (with the exception of the gangs and genocides in Africa). In the same way, nothing about being a Christian condones violence or killing or even the taking of slaves *(the verses concerning being good slaves and good masters do not endorse or even condone slavery. they are meant to emphasize that we must do our best no matter the circumstances so that our lifestyle draws the eye of others so that we can be a good Christian influence. Just like the OT story of Joseph who was a lowly slave and ended up catching his master's eye and eventually became an influence over all of Egypt and the surrounding countries.)* burning anyone, shunning anyone, and even goes so far as to condemn hurting someone's feelings. Not all Christians took place in those things like the crusades at the time. Christians are obviously not doing these things now. The worst thing Christians seem to do now is to be ignorant or bigoted, which are BOTH against the bible's teachings. So why is it OK to generalize a religion (my main example is Christianity) by things done in the past by Christians, but it's not OK to generalize race, creed, sexual preference, nationality, political affiliation, etc? 

I know there will invariably be answers stating ""Because the bible, which is what ties all Christians together tells them to do bad things in the Old Testament. It says to stone gays, and to kill your kids and so on and so forth."" But this is not really true: the old testament does contain these things, but barring the ""some people"" who interpret it otherwise, the general consensus between protestants and the official stance of the Vatican is that the Old Testament laws do not apply to Christians. Given that information, why is it OK to judge Christians based on the crusades, witch burnings or any other bad thing in the past that Christians now could not possibly have taken part in and cannot possibly condone without going against the Christian Bible?

The reason i understand we get angry or jealous of people is we are either frustrated that we cannot accomplish something or we dont understand the persons motivations and past experiences and simply deem them evil.

for example you are angry that someone is a bully, but then when you realize that the bully has no friends and he or she is miserable, you may stop feeling angry and instead feel sorry for the person. If god knows everything about a person and exactly why they are doing what they are doing, he has no reason to be angry. also if everything is part of his plan and everything is going according to the way things should be, he has no reason to be frustrated because he is creating what he wants and how he wants it. to be angry or frustrated at something that is going on implies something is going wrong with his plan, and hence would negate his all knowingness and all powerfullness.

as for jealousy, if you are god who is capable of doing anything than you can make anything you want for yourself, including creating a race where every one follows you. the fact that he is jealous of other gods implies that these other gods have things that he does not have, if a god is capable of everything, it doesnt make sense.

also note if you argue in the sense of ""we'll, god is beyond us, we cant really know who he is and the reason he is angry and jealous is beyond our understanding"", remember the bible was written by fallible humans, so when they say god is angry or jealous, they are just making assumptions like i am. why is it that god is supposively unknowable yet people can claim they know about him describing these personality attributes.",,False,,t5_2snuc,False,,silver,True,t3_1id13v,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1id13v/to_abrahamic_theists_why_is_god_jealousangry/,
1373207798.0,24,self.DebateReligion,1hsx2z,What if Satan Simply didn't show up for battle of Armageddon? What theological implications would this have?,52,28,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1hsx2z/what_if_satan_simply_didnt_show_up_for_battle_of/,"Disclaimer: I lurk here quite often and came across this post from another forum ( by Kcrady) and found it somewhat interesting, I would like to see what people here think about its implications, if any. 

""Satan"" is a Hebrew word for ""Accuser""/""Adversary""--a judicial title equivalent to ""Prosecutor,"" or perhaps more precisely, Inquisitor.  In the OT, he is unequivocally portrayed as an officer of God's court.  Get a concordance and look up all the instances of ""Satan"" and see for yourself.  In the NT there are also clear examples of ""Satan"" serving in this role.  There are other verses where ""Satan"" does seem to be portrayed as an enemy of God.  However, since ""Satan"" is a title, not a name, there is no reason to assume that it must always refer to the same being.  Compare with the use of the title ""Pharaoh"" in the Bible.  We read of Solomon marrying a daughter of ""Pharaoh,"" but this ""Pharaoh"" is clearly not the same man Joseph served under, or the one Moses dealt with.

The Serpent (also the ""Prince of Tyre"" in Ezekiel 28) is arguably a separate being.  Now, perhaps he might rebel on the premise of false pride.  On the other hand, there are some things you need to consider:

1) He would have had direct knowledge of God's power, abilities, etc., more direct experience of him than you have.
2) The Bible is not an unbiased work.  It is written by spokesmen for God who are aiming to get people to worship and obey him.  Think, ""Pravda.""
3) The Serpent might have considered it possible that he could win.
4) He could have been right.

Consider: All of the New Testament writers clearly assumed that the Battle of Armageddon and God's final victory was imminent within their own time.  Some Christians today read those same passages and assume that they mean exactly what they say--the end is nigh.  See raptureready.com.  What they forget is, that these passages weren't written last month or last year.  They were written by and for people living centuries ago, and their first readers would have read them the exact same way Christians read them today.

There is a school of thought within Christianity called ""preterism"" that argues that the events of Revelation did indeed take place, and that they were fulfilled by the destruction of Judaea in 66-70 A.D.  They make an excellent case that these things had to happen at about that time (e.g. Jesus saying to his disciples, ""Truly I tell you, some now standing here will see the Son of Man coming in his glory"").  The problem is, the final victory of God did not happen.  Read Revelation 21.  Does that sound like our world today?  Not to mention that all the world-wrecking displays of God's wrath never took place, nor a recognizable Battle of Armageddon.  The ""futurists"" (Christians who believe the ""end times"" prophecies are yet to happen) argue this--again, quite persuasively.  Furthermore, the Bible contains no epistle or book saying, ""Now that Armageddon happened, this is what you are to do/how you should react""

And so, a paradox.

But what if the Serpent won the Battle of Armageddon--by not showing up?  Another poster on another thread (don't recall who) questioned God's strategic sense and wondered if he (God) was familiar with Sun Tzu, since he (God) is making the mistake of engaging in a protracted campaign.  But God made a much bigger mistake: he pre-conditioned his return on the premise that ""Satan"" (whichever one) would first incarnate himself as ""the Antichrist"" and set up a global theocratic dictatorship--a precursor to the global theocratic dictatorship Jesus will establish when he returns.

Since Satan is a being with free will he has an elegantly simple strategic response: refuse to play along, and leave God trapped in his own Word.",,False,,t5_2snuc,False,,userflair,True,t3_1hsx2z,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1hsx2z/what_if_satan_simply_didnt_show_up_for_battle_of/,

The two brothers hear his call and the Gospels do not neglect to mention that they leave their father behind in the boat (Mk 1:19-20, Mt 4:21-22). Further along Jesus encounters two men seeking discipleship. One, mentioned only in Luke, asks merely to say goodbye to his family first. Jesus answers him unequivocally, saying, “No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God” (Lk 9:62). The other, described in both Luke and Matthew, hears Jesus's calling, but wishes first to be permitted to tend to his deceased father's burial. ""And Jesus said to him,"" again, unambiguously, “Leave the dead to bury their own dead. But as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God."" (Lk 9:60). All of this comports with Jesus's straightforward command to ""call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven."" (Mt 23:9).

Clearly not one for hypocrisy, Jesus practiced what he preached. Described in varying detail three times in Luke 8, Matthew 12, and Mark 3, Jesus's miraculous healing draws a crowd so large that he fears that they may crush him (Mk 3:9). We find that ""when his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying, “He is out of his mind.” (Mk 3:21) Unable to reach him through the crowd, his mother and brothers call for him outside. ""And he was told, 'Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you.' But he answered them, 'My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.' (Lk 8:19). ""And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, 'Here are my mother and my brothers! For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.” (Mt 12:49). It seems Jesus knew first-hand that “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household.” (Mt 13:57)

How then is Jesus to be understood when he assures us that he has ""not come to bring peace, but a sword""? The same Jesus who commands his followers to love the stranger and the enemy also reveals that he has ""come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. And a person's enemies will be those of his own household."" (Mt 10:34-39). ""For from now on in one house there will be five divided, three against two and two against three.” (Lk 12:52).

Inevitably we arrive at Luke 14:26, for here we find Jesus's most forthright, and yet confounding pronouncement concerning a Christian's proper relation to family:

&gt;“If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.""

Confounding because, given the evidence already presented, it should be obvious that ""hate"" as it used here bears little to no relation to ""hate"" as it is commonly defined in English, where it connotes anger and hostility. As it happens, these are *not* the emotions evoked by Jesus himself in the presence of his mother and siblings, nor by James and John with their father Zebedee, nor does Jesus instruct the two men seeking discipleship to conduct themselves in such a way. What we observe in the examples provided is something nearer to apathetic dissociation. If we could replace ""hate"" here with something like ""dissociate"", we might be on to something.

Since the destruction of the Second Temple, Jewish sages have elaborated upon a concept referred to as ""sinat chinam"", or ""causeless hatred"", commonly [defined](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0008_0_08528.html) as a refusal to speak or otherwise associate with a fellow Jew. Causeless hatred has been traditionally blamed for the destruction of the temple in 70AD. Jesus was not particularly ambivalent towards the prospect of the temple's destruction. While one of his disciples was admiring the building's exterior, he said to him “Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.” (Mk 13:2). 

In any case, sinat chinam is the missing puzzle piece, the common bond between all that we've explored thus far. Understanding ""hate"" as ""dissociate"" brings clarity to Jesus's family values. In fact, I would argue that one cannot make sense of Jesus's teachings on these matters *at all* without employing the concept of causeless hatred. Simply put, Jesus is calling for his followers to dissociate from their own kin. But the real power of Jesus's ethical system comes from a simultaneous inversion of sinat chinam in *ahavat* chinam, or ""causeless *love*"" directed at the *anti*-kin, the out-groups, the strangers and the enemies.

Living under the sword of the Roman empire instilled certain political aspirations, apparent throughout the New Testament. While other Jews of that age found momentary messianic hope in the military leader Bar Kokhba, Jesus forged a new way, refusing to play by the rules of natural selection as they manifest in human politics (i.e., war). In fact, Jesus innovated an ethical system that was effectively an extreme inversion of natural selection, lifting up the sick, the poor, the weak. Jesus balanced the sinat chinam directed at kin with ahavat chinam directed at the stranger and the enemy. He clearly identified the family as a fundamental unit of society, and thus as a means of corrupting a power from the inside out. At the same time, redirecting compassion towards the fringes of society served as a means of empowering the powerless from the outside in. 

This strategy of flipping pagan morality upside down was directed towards the family, but ultimately and implicitly towards the logic of kin selection.  Jesus's values, though sublimated in this broader context, were constructed as an assault upon biology itself! The battle between flesh and spirit can be secularized as a contest between genes and memes, and we're caught in the middle. Jesus sided with the meme, utterly rejecting his biological nature through his very carefully orchestrated suicide. You'll admit, he's been a pretty successful *meme* propagator. 

Biological evolution has finally produced a species which is revolting against biological evolution. First by turning the other cheek, and finally by walking into the hands of his persecutors, what Jesus demonstrated is that biological weakness equals *post*biological strength. He is the Alpha and the Omega, the Most High *and* the Most Low. High enough to sit at the right hand of God. Low enough to be brutalized, mocked, and crucified.",,False,,t5_2snuc,1373483787.0,,,True,t3_1hh54b,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1hh54b/to_christians_what_is_the_deal_with_jesuss_family/,

Then I saw other people with ""absurdist"" in their flair, leading me to wiki the term, and lo and behold it's a [real philosophical perspective](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism).

&gt;In philosophy, ""the Absurd"" refers to the conflict between the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life and the human inability to find any. In this context absurd does not mean ""logically impossible"", but rather ""humanly impossible"". The universe and the human mind do not each separately cause the Absurd, but rather, the Absurd arises by the contradictory nature of the two existing simultaneously. Absurdism, therefore, is a philosophical school of thought stating that the efforts of humanity to find inherent meaning will ultimately fail (and hence are absurd) because the sheer amount of information as well as the vast realm of the unknown make certainty impossible. And yet, some absurdists state that one should embrace the absurd condition of humankind while conversely continuing to explore and search for meaning. As a philosophy, absurdism thus also explores the fundamental nature of the Absurd and how individuals, once becoming conscious of the Absurd, should respond to it.

Please note that these are purely naive questions.

But Roman leaders spent about ""less than 10 years"" out of the first 300 actually persecuting Christians, Candida Moss (author of *The Myth of Persecution* ) says. There are only six reliable cases of Christian martyrdom before A.D. 250 out of “hundreds of stories,” including Perpetua’s, she says.

Many scholars have greeted Moss’ contention that Roman persecution of Christians was exaggerated with a shrug. They say it was common knowledge in the academic world.

“There weren’t that many Christians who were persecuted,” says Gail O’Day, dean of the Wake Forest University School of Divinity in North Carolina. “When you actually read the Roman historical records, the Christians just weren’t that important to them. Most Christians just got along with empire.

Ordinary Romans might have thought Christians were odd but liked having them for neighbors, Rodney Stark (author of *The Triumph of Christianity*)  says.

“If people had really been against them, I don’t think they would have grown like they did,” Stark says.

Christianity became so popular that when Rome did unleash one of its sporadic waves of persecutions, the empire couldn’t stop the church’s momentum, Stark says.

“If you knocked off a bishop, there were 20 guys waiting to be bishop,” Stark says

Christian belonging, not blood, is what drew many people, another scholar says.""

[- Christ was persecuted but what about Christians?](http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/03/30/christ-was-persecuted-but-what-about-christians/)

So the persecution of Christians was intermittent. It happened occasionally over the course of three hundred years. And centuries after the fact, these intermittent martyrs were painted to have been exemplars of what every Christian experienced for hundreds of years. It's sort of like the myth of an American ""Wild West"" with a gunslinger around every corner. 

So not all Christians were martyred. Not all Christians were persecuted. Not even close. To say that ancient Christianity was dangerous and undesirable because some Christians were martyred or persecuted is like saying the United States is dangerous and undesirable because some citizens are the victims of crime every day. And the historical truth (the infrequency) of Christian martyrdom reveals the fallacious reasoning underlying the claim that, “Nobody dies for a lie.”

~~Sometimes~~ much more often than not, early Christians did not have to die for their beliefs. And aside from the very small group of people who allegedly saw the risen Christ for themselves, what early Christians believed is what someone (another mere mortal) told them.

It seems an all good being would eliminate suffering as far as it can, of course, it doesn't mean eliminate *all* suffering, there may be some justifiable suffering.  This is one of the things that may ""break"" the logical problem of evil, if you can show some suffering is necessary and is not incompatible with a God. 

I accept that sometimes, allowing evil might be necessary to prevent an even worse evil (say an evil dictator getting cancer). I also realise that if God intervened for literally every crime there is, functionally, it would break elements of free will (say you drop dead if you even attempted or think of robbing someone). One thing I have noticed that is incredibly hard to defeat is *gratuitous* or *massive* evil, things like the holocaust. 

Now, it cannot be God allowed the holocaust to prevent an even worse evil; i cannot make sense of that idea. Likewise, i do not know if i could buy it on a free-will basis. God prevented Pharaoh from slaughtering the Jewish people, whether that was interference on Pharaohs free will or just the outcome of his will does not really matter, he still stopped it. If he saved one or two million Jews back then where was he with part of the 6 million in Auschwitz? If he interfered once, why didn't he do it again?

## The Argument
*******

So everyone should know the argument already.

1. (P1) An all good God would prevent gratuitous evil

2. (P2) Gratuitous evil exists

3. (C1) An all good God does not exist.

This can be phrased another way.

1. (Pa) An all good God would, all factors considered, create the best possible world

2. (Pb) This is not the best possible world.

3. (Ca) An all good God does not exist.

*****
## Clarifications
*****

I commonly interchange gratuitous evil and unnecessary suffering - because let us be realistic - morality is about the well-being and suffering of sentient beings. We do not have moral obligations to a rock, after all. Any theist wishing to simply use God as the standard of good should realise that redefining the word this way gives you, from ""Good is good"", the empty tautology ""God is God"".

*****
## Evidential Support of Soundness
*****

P1: A being that would prevent grautious evil is morally better than a being that would not. As God is the morally greatest being, God must prevent gratuitous evil.

P2: Whether this is the rape of a young child before being shot, children starving to death in poverty afflicted nations, or being ravaged by diseases or natural disasters, we all can recognise that the world would be a better place if we could fix those issues. That is why we research cures for diseases, send money as foreign aid, and have laws against actions such as rape and homicide.

Anyone that has ever donated money for foreign aid or disaster relief, or even thought that if they had spare money to donate it would be worthwhile, implicitly recognises this fact. Anyone who, if they had the power, would stop a rape or a murder from occurring believes this too. Anyone that advocates using condoms to lower the transmission of STI's knows this. Essentially we all recognise this fact very obviously in day to day lives, it is only when trying to justify the continual absence of God that anyone tries to pretend gratuitous suffering does not exist.

Pa: Similar to P1, a being that makes a morally better world is greater than a being that does not.

Pb: See P2.

****
## Common Counter Arguments
****

**Evil requires free will**

* Only covers moral evil, not natural evil. Both are causes of suffering. It is an insufficient argument. Also, consider flight. Can humans fly? No. Has God impinged our free will by not letting us fly? No: because we do not have the capacity. If God removed from us the capacity to rape people, is our free will impinged? No. Thus, God could remove at the very least rape (and a host of other things) by simply removing the capacity to do so from us. Thus, there is a way to reduce suffering caused by current free will without impinging free will.

* God does not intervene in cases where free will is violated anyway. Is it a woman's will to be raped? No. Is it the rapists will to rape? Yes. If God intervenes, the rapist's will is impinged. If not, the woman's will is impinged. Hence God value's the free will of the rapist more than that of the woman. If an all good God does not impinge free will to prevent evil, then it values free will more than preventing evil. As this is a morally all good being, any theist that holds this view and desires to be as good as possible should hold to it. This means never intervening to stop evil if it requires impinging free will (so doing exactly what God does). Hence, they should not stop a murder, rape, theft, etc, because an all good being has decided not to (as God obviously has not stopped it). To do differently is to overtly do the opposite action of an all good being.

* Free will is generally only defined as the ability to be able to have free will in choice, not free will in choice and action (called by Alvin Plantinga 'significantly free'). In order for the free will defense to even be invoked you first need to modify the entire concept of free will to include the action or it makes no sense. I still say it makes no sense though.

**This life is only a test**

* A test for what? Are not most Gods omniscient? Any omnipotent, omniscient being should not need to run tests - there is nothing to find out. Hence, this test is without reason and therefore introduces unnecessary suffering. If one says that it is a test for us, not God, see the next post as to why that is absurd. Also, what sort of test is it for an infant to die in childbirth?

**Suffering improves us**

* I am sure the infants that die in childbirth, children that starve to death, those that drown in floods and die from diseases learnt a lot from their suffering.

**Nature contains suffering - it is an integral part of life**

* Does not solve the evidential problem of evil: why is there so much suffering? Also, using this responses means that nature necessarily requires suffering - or else God could have made nature different. Have fun supporting that claim if anyone wants to.

**Evil and Suffering are matters of perspective**

* ""In a world without greater evil, something like a papercut might be seen as the pinnacle of suffering and evil. People will obviously always call something evil, it is only perspective"". This fails to address the evidential problem of evil, it only addresses that the word would probably still exist. I hope we are all in agreement that on average rape is far worse than a papercut, and this the physical and emotional damage is not simply a matter of perspective.

**It is the devil, not God, that is the cause of suffering**

* I could simply quote Isaiah here where it explicitly says God is the source of our suffering, but that's no fun. If God is an omnipotent and omniscient being, then the devil inflicting and causing suffering is only possible through God's continual permission. It must be within God's powers to stop the devil if he chose to - and yet he does not. This is not like someone sneaking behind God's back - God is omniscient. Every act of suffering caused by the devil is known to God, and is within God's power to stop. And yet he does not. This is possibly the worst counter argument, and yet it is getting more popular these days for some reason.

**God cannot just fix these things, because we need faith**

* Because believing things on bad evidence is preferable to massively reducing the suffering in the world? Sounds like an egotistical, jealous and petty God that would prefer this over helping his creation live their lives in happiness. And this also directly contradicts the God of the Old and New Testament that went around performing miracles and generally announcing his presence.

**This *is* the best possible world**

* This response can be applied to any world. I could go outside and give out money to the homeless, or I could go outside and shoot people, and under this argument, no matter what my actions, this remains the best possible world. For this to be correct, any action I or anyone else can take must necessarily have the same moral weight. So under this counter, morality essentially has no meaning as all actions are morally equivalent.

**Cop over the shoulder**

* A world where God judges and intervenes with every single transgression is obviously not the best possible world, and many theist's attempt to go from non-intervention to constant intervention in a bid to make intervention seem not a viable option. However, even we lowly humans recognise that this is not the best possible world (to monitor and take action on every decision or action someone does), so let us give God a bit more credit than that, and assume can figure out something humans managed many decades ago.",,False,,t5_2snuc,1359365879.0,,,True,t3_17f2e8,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/17f2e8/to_all_the_comprehensive_evidential_problem_of/,

A) The exact instant of when humans would get souls seems very much arbitrary.  We just happened to end up with souls once homo heidelbergensis got a small jump in brain size.  It's likely that this small boost in brain size didn't overtake the species in a binary or instant way either.  There would have to be a period of ""gaining and losing"" souls within the population which seems absurd. 

B) Everything that we would consider ""activities of the soul"" seems to correlate directly with our evolved brain capacity.

**Argument**

---


I spent far too long yesterday defending, well, pedophilia. The most base summary of my position is : “One cannot and should not punish someone for what they think so long as it acts independent of action.” As far as I see it,  people’s thoughts are completely their own. People’s actions, however, have a genuine affect on the world. 

Groups of people like high functioning sociopaths, non-abusive pedophiles and internal racists do not warrant, merely by what is in their head, punishment.[ It seems tantamount to slapping me in irons for dreaming of smashing my boss’ face in with a keyboard every time he gives me extra work.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK0-76FChfk)

But theology often disagrees: 

&gt;You shall not covet your neighbour's house. You shall not covet your neighbour's wife, or his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbour.

~Exodus 20:17


The Ten Commandments, and I will stick with this example for clarity’s sake, have demands against the physical: one commandment forbids adultery, whereas this one forbids the desire to adulterate. Another commandment forbids stealing, whereas this forbids the desire to steal. This seems a tad Orwellian : this gruelling notion that an angel could bark at you through a tele-screen.

In the union of the sets of composers and frontiersmen, the question makes no sense; because that set is not [totally ordered](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order).

&gt; There is nothing in this world that is truly ""perfect"". Though it may be a rather large cliché, it is still the truth. It is the ordinary people who look up to ""perfection"" as an ideal and seek after it. But in truth, what is this idea of ""perfection"" truly worth? Nothing. Not a single thing. I detest ""perfection"". To be ""perfect"" is to be unable to improve any further. There would be no scope for ""creation"", not a single gap in one's knowledge or one's ability. Do you see now? To true scientists like you and I, ""Perfection"" is tantamount to ""despair"". We aspire to reach greater levels of brilliance than ever before, but never, NEVER, to reach perfection. That is the paradox through which we scientists must struggle. Indeed, it is our duty to find pleasure in that struggle. 

The video game part comes from the experience of finishing a video game, and having an option to play with the aptly named ""God mode"" enabled in a completed world. This is fun for all of 10 minutes. In the end, there's no challenge and nothing to do. Everything has been done, everything has been explored. Anything you can do is entirely inconsequential.


Now thinking on those two things made me realize something: Heaven, if it exists, is the ultimate expression of a lack of meaning in life. If, once you die, you reach a perfect place, what's the point in anything? A perfect place by definition can not be improved in any shape or manner. You can't make a single meaningful contribution, either. If there is art in heaven, it reached perfection, you can't contribute any worthy art. If there are any books, you can't do better. If there are buildings, they reached the pinnacle of beauty. No matter what you do, you can't make a single contribution, nor will you ever be able to, in the eternity at your disposal.

This comes from our human perception of the world, the Newtonian view that ""every action has a reaction"", or ""cause and effect"".  We see things as having been caused by something else, stepping backwards along the chain as far as we'd like to go.  This is very functional for our daily lives, as we can ascertain immediate events through this backtrack of reasoning.

For example: let's say you have a dog as a pet, and you find one day that it is deceased.  What caused this event?  If you found it on the road, you might reason the dog was hit by a car.  Why was it hit by the car?  Perhaps you neglected to close the door on your way in, allowing the dog to escape.  Why did you neglect to close the door?  Perhaps you were daydreaming about the lovely redhead that you observed at the grocery store.  And so on and so forth until we cannot go any further.

This is the reasoning that is given in this argument: everything is caused by something else, and God is the be-all-end-all cause of everything: every failed solar system, every new galaxy, every loving wife, every evil tyrant, every sexual escapade made in inebriated circumstances.  All of these things are ultimately caused by God, who created the universe, according to this argument.  This stretches what our minds are used to in a logical sense, because we cannot regress beyond our understanding.  Instead, we terminate with God, a celestial cork in the hole we don't understand.

This poses a few problems.

First, and the most obvious and tired, is given that everything has a cause, and that something can't come from nothing, did God not have a cause?  What about the cause of that?  And so on and so forth.  The answer regularly received is that God is timeless, eternal, is exempt from this rule, or was the cause of itself.  This brings us to the second problem: if such an assumption can be accepted by the arguer, why have this assumption to begin with?  How come God is immune to this rule?  Why could the universe itself not have this property, thereby making God irrelevant?

Third, if we somehow accept this line of reasoning, how does this in any way tell us the nature of such a being?  How do you know that this being is the one described by your religious leaders, or scriptures?  You still have all your work still ahead of you to make the claim that **your** God exists.  How did you (or others) get this information?  Certainly not science, otherwise everybody would know.

No one can say for certain that such a being does not exist, but neither can those claiming it does.

And I've seen an increasing number of Christians that do not believe it is a sin. But my question is, how did you come to the conclusion? 

In my personal experiences, it is largely to do with historical context and translations. 
In terms of historical context, homosexuality is shown in a number of places. But the places in which they are shown are historically because of other religions nearby that would use homosexual acts as religious practices and religious rites. This would therefor remove mixing of religions.
In terms of translations, even areas in which this is not the case we run into issue with translation. People too often forget the Bible was originally written in largely Greek and Hebrew, languages that sometimes have words difficult to translate. Words that nowadays are often translated as ""homosexual"" actually have context and wording much more similar to acts of prostitution, rape, or other sexual immorality in the like.
The Bible also teaches to love and to do everything out of love. Sins like murder, being unfaithful (sexual immorality), covetting, etc. are sins because they are not being done out of consideration of love for everyone involved. You can murder out of love for one person but it would not be out of true love for the person you are murdering. You could cheat on someone you are with out of love for the person you are cheating with, but not out of love for the one you're cheating on. My point being, sins are sins because they are out of selfish intent and not out of love for who is involved. However, Homosexuality can be purely out of love, love for the person you are with.
Another key argument is nowhere do we have anything stating that Jesus said a thing against homosexuality. As a Christian I think of myself as a follower of Christ and Christ alone. The truth is the Bible is simply a collection of letters, stories, histories, and poems that were not decided as canon by the church until long long long after Jesus and his disciples/apostles were gone. Do I believe the Bible is useful? Certainly. Do I believe it is the be-all end-all of my beliefs? No, that is the teachings of Jesus alone, the teachings of loving everyone.

TL;DR My reason is I believe historical context and issues with translation show there is no evidence agaisnt homosexual love.

I have trouble understanding how someone can attribute creation to a deity who has only been ""known"" for a few thousand years.

- Why is it that your deities who have existed since the beginning of time have only been known to man for at most a few thousand years? 

- Why did they allow the countless other religions before your own? 

- How do you explain that the oldest known (*and therefore closest to the ""creation"" which would have been the point of most active intervention by a deity one would think*) ""religions"" appear to be animistic with little to no parallel to your own religion?

- Should not the real creator if such a being exists have been worshipped consistently from creation?

There is [a youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9x_oa--KAc&amp;list=PLA0C3C1D163BE880A&amp;index=21&amp;feature=plpp_video) in which someone referring to himself by the name of ""Evid3nc3"" argues that mathematics is fundamentally empirical in nature, as opposed to *a priori* and purely rational. This argument is frequently reproduced here, so a closer examination of it is relevant.

The broader subject of the video is the narrator's personal conception of evidentialism, which is given in the form of a somewhat haphazard critique of Descartes' First Philosophy. I won't be addressing evidentialism *per se* here, but it is necessary that I draw attention to the narrator's conflation of evidence, *empirical* evidence, and visual or sensory evidence. The overall thrust of the narrator's evidentialist argument is to privilege empirical evidence as a necessary component of valid knowledge. Thus, I will only be referring to *empirical* evidence in this post, even though the narrator uses all of the aforementioned terms interchangeably.

**The problem**

If valid knowledge must be supported by empirical evidence, and mathematics is valid knowledge, then it must be the case that mathematics can be supported by empirical evidence, which would make mathematics empirical in nature. Yet mathematics is famously thought to be *a priori*, which is to say that it is prior to or independent of experience. If this is true, then mathematics would be a fatal counterexample to the narrator's argument for empirical evidentialism. 

**Evid3nc3's attempted solution**

Our narrator addresses this problem in the context of Descartes' Meditation III, 36:

&gt; ""Descartes makes the argument that some high-level rational beliefs are self-evident. For example, 'the proposition that 2 + 3 = 5 is,' Descartes argues, 'self-evident.' But I disagree. Rather, when pressed to do so, we *can* justify the belief that '2 + 3 = 5' using evidence [sic]."" ([6:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;list=PLA0C3C1D163BE880A&amp;v=g9x_oa--KAc#t=367s))

We are then given an example of evidential mathematical justification in the form of a scenario in which items are arranged into groups which are then compared. Let's call this **Argument #1 for empirical mathematics**. 

Our narrator seems content that this scenario provides an adequate empirical justification for the mathematical proposition in question, which in turn defeats Descartes' argument for self-evidence. But even if we grant that the counting scenario can function as adequate empirical justification, the narrator would only have shown that mathematical propositions *can* be justified empirically, not that they *are* or *must be* justified empirically by their nature. 

Descartes addresses this issue by distinguishing what he calls *imagination*, which is a kind of mental visualization similar to the narrator's counting scenario, and *understanding*, which is a purely rational activity. He writes that when he imagines a triangle, he doesn't merely understand its geometrical nature, but he actually envisions its three lines in his mind. ""But,"" he writes, ""if I want to think of a chiliagon, although I understand that it is a figure consisting of a thousand sides… I do not in the same way imagine the thousand sides or see them as if they were present before me… I notice quite clearly that imagination requires a peculiar effort of mind which is not required for understanding; this additional effort of mind clearly shows the difference between imagination and pure understanding."" (VI, 72-73)

So we may very well visualize (imagine) arithmetical procedures being performed on collections of items; we may even actually perform these procedures on actual collections and items. But the truth of the relevant mathematical propositions has no connection to these procedures since it can be established with complete independence from them. Thus, the counting scenario fails as an objection to the *a priori* nature of mathematics.

In fact, our manipulations of the items are only meaningful because of the mathematical framework which we impose on them; on their own, they do not lead to any purely mathematical concepts. Thus, we can see that the counting scenario also fails as a demonstration of the allegedly empirical nature of mathematics.

**Objection #1 to the self-evidence of mathematical propositions**

Our narrator continues:

&gt; ""Now I suspect one reason why Descartes was so inclined to declare that '2 + 3 = 5 is self evident' was unconsciously due to social pressure. There are certain beliefs that are so commonly held by individuals in our society that even questioning them evokes [sic] ridicule. In fact, my own awareness of these social pressures made me uncomfortable with the idea of breaking down '2 + 3 = 5' into an evidentially-based [sic] argument. These are beliefs that we are socially pressured to have through both positive and negative reinforcement, but the reality is they are not self-evident, and people who say they are may be unconsciously succumbing to social pressure."" ([6:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;list=PLA0C3C1D163BE880A&amp;v=g9x_oa--KAc#t=406s))

Let us applaud the bravery of our fearless narrator, who risks social disapprobation by nobly undertaking to rearrange various items. Yet he might have saved himself the trouble (and irrelevance) of speculating on Descartes' psychological motivations by simply reading his chosen text more thoroughly, for Descartes clearly explains why he believes that mathematical propositions are self-evident.

In reference to his famous initial proposition, the cogito (which our narrator accepts), Descartes writes that ""…there is simply a clear and distinct perception of what I am asserting; this would not be enough to make me certain of the truth of the matter *if it could ever turn out that something which I perceived with such clarity and distinctness was false.*"" (III 35, emphasis mine) And again: ""Let whoever can do so deceive me, he will never bring it about that… two and three added together are more or less than five, or anything of this kind in which I see a manifest contradiction."" (III, 36) 

So Descartes' criteria for propositional self-evidence are 1) that he can perceive the idea clearly and distinctly and 2) that the idea cannot be false without generating a contradiction. Our narrator's bizarre and unsupported notion that the self-evident nature of mathematical propositions is a function of societal consensus simply has no relevance to what Descartes is talking about. 

**Objection #2 to the self-evidence of mathematical propositions**

Our narrator advances a second objection to Descartes' argument for self-evidence:

&gt; ""Most of us have been trained in basic arithmetic starting at a young age, and our beliefs about basic arithmetic are reinforced by confirmatory evidence throughout our entire lives as we build and verify arithmetic [sic] beliefs. Due to the colossal mountain of evidence that we unconsciously use to support it, the evidential argument for '2 + 3 = 5' is so strong that it *seems* self-evident, but in reality, when we think that, we may be unconsciously making an evidential evaluation of that proposition."" ([7:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;list=PLA0C3C1D163BE880A&amp;v=g9x_oa--KAc#t=476s))

In other words, the self-evidence of mathematical propositions is an illusion brought about by the great quantity of our past empirical verifications, such as the counting scenario that was previously mentioned. 

But once again, this thesis isn't relevant to Descartes' conception of self-evidence, which our narrator never addresses. We've already seen that the counting scenario fails as an example of empirical mathematical verification anyway; it also fails to address what is really at issue with the nature of mathematic propositions, which is just that they are apodeictic because they *cannot be false* without generating a contradiction, which is why we can know with certainty that they are absolutely true. As was described above, this is just what Descartes means when he refers to mathematical propositions as being self-evident. But no amount of empirical evidence can ever provide this level of certainty. No matter how many times we combine collections of items and achieve the same result, we will never achieve the certainty that Descartes recognizes as a function of the apodeictic nature of mathematics.

**Argument #2 for empirical mathematics: tool usage**

&gt; ""The place of [non-rational] evidence in justifying abstract mathematical propositions becomes even more clear as the mathematics becomes more complicated. How do you verify your understanding of a basic principle of algebra? How do you verify that you understand integration by parts? How do you verify that the internal angles of the triangle add up to 180&amp;deg;? By working out the problem on paper, and possibly verifying your answers through a computer, calculator, or textbook, all of which constitute a form of visual evidence. ([8:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;list=PLA0C3C1D163BE880A&amp;v=g9x_oa--KAc#t=510s))

In this argument, our narrator conflates the empirical verification of mathematical propositions *in abstracto*, and the empirical verification of *our understanding* of those propositions. And once again, it isn't clear that we've even been provided with a valid example of empirical verification.

There's no denying that one may employ a variety of physical media or objects to assist in understanding a mathematical concept, but it doesn't follow that one's subsequent understanding of the concept must result in some way from the physical media and objects that were employed. If it did, then it seems that different physical media would have to produce different levels of understanding; perhaps calculations etched in steel would be more securely known than those penciled on a sheet of paper.

Furthermore, the helpfulness of sensory input as an aid to mathematical understanding does not indicate that the truth of mathematical propositions is dependent on any input from the senses. As Descartes points out, ""I can think up countless other shapes which there can be no suspicion of my ever having encountered through the senses, and yet I can demonstrate various properties of these shapes, just as I can with the triangle."" (V, 65) That such demonstration is possible is simply more evidence in favor of the *a priori* nature of mathematics.

**Conclusion**

Evid3nc3 doesn't seem to understand what Descartes means when he refers to mathematical propositions as being self-evident. As a consequence, his attempts to rebut Descartes fail because they are addressed at straw man conceptions of self-evidence.

John 20:17 and 27
&gt; Touch me not [Mary]; for I am not yet ascended to my Father ... Then he said to Thomas, ""Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.

As if the touch of a woman is somehow different than the touch of a man. Not as direct sexism as seen in other parts of the Bible but in light of Paul's writing it definitely sends the wrong message.

Paul treats women unequally

1 Corinthians 14:34-35
&gt; As in all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church

1 Corinthians 11:3-10
&gt; But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, **the head of a woman is her husband**, and the head of Christ is God.  Any man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head, but any woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled dishonors her head--it is the same as if her head were shaven. For if a woman will not veil herself, then she should cut off her hair; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her wear a veil. **For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. (For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.)** That is why a woman ought to have a veil on her head, because of the angels.

1 Timothy 2:12
&gt; Let a woman learn in silence with all submissiveness. I permit no woman to teach or to have authority over men; she is to keep silent.

Finally, God himself treats women unequally. Metaphor or not the story has women made from mans ribs as a cure for our loneliness. Furthermore while Adam and Eve both sin Eve gets it worse and all women after her share the curse. 

God made laws for the Israelite that treated women very differently then men, women were considered spoils of war.

In this one God commands them to just kill the men but to find the virgin women (if I remember human anatomy correctly that's a rather invasive check), kill the non-virgins and bring the virgins home as spoils of war. Straight up objectification and God has no objections to these orders, and he never had issues making himself clear in the OT. I'm not arguing that any of the OT ones are law now, I'm arguing that God found it moral at the time. 

Judges 21:10
&gt; ""This is what you are to do,"" they said. ""Completely destroy all the males and every woman who is not a virgin.""  Among the residents of Jabesh-gilead they found four hundred young virgins who had never slept with a man, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan.

Numbers 31:13
&gt;  Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the people went to meet them outside the camp.  But Moses was furious with all the military commanders who had returned from the battle.  ""Why have you let all the women live?"" he demanded.  ""These are the very ones who followed Balaam's advice and caused the people of Israel to rebel against the LORD at Mount Peor.  They are the ones who caused the plague to strike the LORD's people.  Now kill all the boys and all the women who have slept with a man.  **Only the young girls who are virgins may live; you may keep them for yourselves.**

The list goes on.

1339690284.0,27,self.DebateReligion,v1tl2,To philosophers: Which theory of time do you find most convincing? And which do you reject?,34,7,169,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/v1tl2/to_philosophers_which_theory_of_time_do_you_find/,"(Note: Don't worry, this gets to religion eventually.)

There are quite a few philosophical questions about time. How it functions; whether future events are deterministically set or not; whether the truth value of a proposition is tensed or tenseless. And so on. It's a big topic, one I've only just begun diving into.

From what I've seen so far, there are two main competing camps in philosophy of time. One camp asserts that positions in time are properly ordered according to their possession of temporal properties. The [Stanford philosophy website](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time/)'s example is ""being two days future, being one day future, being present, being one day past, etc."" Today, this is called an *A* series.

The other camp asserts that there are problems with an *A* series that result in contradictions (which I'll go into in detail below), and that positions in time are more appropriately ordered by two-place relations like ""two days earlier than, one day earlier than, simultaneous with, etc."" When ordered this way, they're called *B relations* or a *B* series.

One of the main differences between an *A* series and a *B* series is that the truth value of a proposition using *A* series properties can change. If I say ""yesterday was Wednesday, June 13th, 2012,"" this is only true so long as today is the following Thursday. As of the time I wrote this, the proposition is true. But tomorrow, it won't be. Propositions using *B* series relations, on the other hand, are always true, regardless of when they are uttered. ""The day preceding Thursday, June 14th, 2012 is Wednesday, June 13th, 2012"" has always and will always be true, no matter when it is uttered. It is tenseless.

John McTaggart, the philosopher who came up with this differentiation, argued that *B* relations don't constitute a proper time series, and that a series made up of *A* properties is essential to time. Since *B* relations are fixed, they don't describe genuine change, while *A* series positions change constantly.

And because of the contradictions that arise with *A* properties, he argued that time was therefore illusory.

Now obviously, that's a controversial claim, and there aren't a lot of proponents of it. However, there are even fewer proponents of what has come to be known as the ""A-Theory"" of time. John McTaggart was on to something.

---

**The A-Theory contradictions**

McTaggart's solution of calling time an illusion is only one of many, and not a terribly popular one. There are various time theories that disagree with McTaggart on whether *B* relations describe genuine change. Personally, I'm still reading up on time theories, and I have no idea whether I accept any of the theories under the ""B-Theory"" umbrella, or something else entirely. But it seems that most philosophers today agree with McTaggart that the A-Theory is fundamentally flawed.

First, there is a direct logical contradiction: Each time in the *A* series must possess all of the different *A* properties, since a time in the future will be the present and the past. But the *A* properties appear to be incompatible with each other; a moment in time can't simultaneously be the future and the past.

McTaggart predicted some objections on that. Quoting the Stanford website:

&gt; One response to this argument that McTaggart anticipates involves claiming that it's not true of any time, *t*, that *t* is both future and past. Rather, the objection goes, we must say that *t* was future at some moment of past time and will be past at some moment of future time. But this objection fails, according to McTaggart, because the additional times that are invoked in order to explain *t*'s possession of the incompatible A properties must themselves possess all of the same A properties (as must any further times invoked on account of these additional times, and so on *ad infinitum*). Thus, according to McTaggart, we never resolve the original contradiction inherent in the A series, but, instead, merely generate an infinite regress of more and more contradictions.

Now, anyone in this subreddit who has discussed the cosmological argument might begin seeing here why whether the A-Theory wins or loses is important. It's exactly this infinite regress that the Unmoved Mover is proposed as putting a stop to. The argument relies on this infinite regress being an actual problem for which the Unmoved Mover is the only solution.

No infinite regress that must be stopped? No A-Theory? Then no Unmoved Mover.

And then there's the empirical problem. In physics, the special theory of relativity comes into direct conflict with the A-Theory. Again, quoting the Stanford website:

&gt; According to [the special theory of relativity]... there is no such thing as absolute simultaneity. But if there is no such thing as absolute simultaneity, then there cannot be objective facts of the form ""*t* is present"" or ""*t* is 12 seconds past"". Thus, according to this line of argument, there cannot be objective facts about A properties, and so the passage of time cannot be an objective feature of the world.

So time is subjective, not objective.

If you accept special relativity -- and you should -- then this kills the cosmological arguments. **All** of them. They are in contradiction with empirically observable reality.

For most professional philosophers, these and other flaws in the A-Theory seem to be enough to dismiss it. According to the [philpapers survey](http://philpapers.org/surveys/results.pl), only 15.4% of professional philosophers accept it. By a very wide margin, philosophers reject it in favor of either a B-Theory variant or, more commonly, something else entirely.

And that makes sense. To argue for the A-Theory, you must either argue against special relativity, or argue that special relativity doesn't rule out absolute simultaneity. Neither proposition is terribly attractive for philosophers. There are exceptions, of course... Karl Popper famously likened Albert Einstein to Parmenides, and dismissed special relativity. Today, that seems kind of silly, and history shows Einstein was right.

There's only one group of philosophers who accept the A-Theory in any large numbers: 40.4% of [philosophers of religion](http://philpapers.org/surveys/results.pl?affil=Target+faculty&amp;areas0=22&amp;areas_max=1&amp;grain=coarse). Doesn't that seem odd? Why are so many religious philosophers in favor of a time theory that is rejected by most of their peers? Among the other philosophers, support for the A-Theory never breaks out of the 5-15% range, and among philosophers of the sciences, support for it is practically non-existent. It seems only philosophers of religion are willing to go on record opposing Einstein in large numbers.

So now I ask you, philosophers of /r/DebateReligion, which theory of time do you support? Or more to the point, reject? And if you're a supporter of the cosmological arguments, have you looked into philosophy of time at all? Does support for Thomism, for example, necessarily entail support for the A-Theory of time?

**Edit 2**: Several of the discussions below have forced me to research further, and I thank everyone for that. Regarding how cosmological arguments need the A-Theory:

* First, ones like the kalam explicitly rely on it. Without the universe having a temporal beginning, they fail.
* Second, arguments from contingency that need essentially ordered series implicitly rely on it.

1335810100.0,27,self.DebateReligion,t03c5,Countering Plantinga's Free Will Defense,30,3,225,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/t03c5/countering_plantingas_free_will_defense/,"Plantinga's argument is [resumed here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Plantinga's_free_will_defense#Plantinga.27s_argument)

For the sake of this argument, I will accept that omnipotence doesn't include the violation of logic (like making 4-sided triangles), and that God refrains from violating free will.

However, there are some things I think are problematic in this argument:


First, it requires accepting limits beyond my definition of omnipotence above. Not only God can't violate logic and free will, but Plantinga has him accept the limits imposed by something he calls [transworld depravity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Plantinga's_free_will_defense#Transworld_depravity), which apparently springs into being all on its own, and God is powerless to remove.

Second, Plantinga seems to assume God is powerless to create a world that works differently, or at least ignores that possibility. He can have Socrates have a bigger or smaller nose, but he never seems to consider a world with different mechanics. This seems to be a fairly unexplored area, and I have more on this on the bottom.

Third, Plantinga's claim is that God must allow evil to respect free will, not that evil is a good or necessary thing in itself and has to exist no matter what. 


Now, on to free will. Having free will only requires that one's attempt to act is not externally stopped from being initiated. The physical inability to do something or the circumstances not being right do not diminish free will. For instance:

* My inability to shoot fireballs from my hands or kill with thought doesn't diminish my free will.

* Neither is my free will diminished because I've never been placed in a situation where I can choose to shoot or not shoot somebody. In other words, it's not necessary for free will to have each human being be in  the right position to take each possible moral decision in their lifetime.

Now I propose that there exist solutions to the problem of evil, which could be created by an ominipotent and omnibenevolent god, which would allow for free will, and which would contain no evil, or much less of it. An explanation is needed why none of these solutions, or something in the same vein have been used. I present a list of alternative worlds that would solve the problem.

World W^b is populated exclusively by bacteria. They're harmless to each other. They have free will -- they can take any action they're capable of, meaning they can float in any direction they please. But none of the actions they can take results in evil. This world is such that there's no evolution, so this world will stay like this forever.  This is related to the point about fireballs above. The physical inability to perform an action doesn't in itself limit free will. So all is needed is to come up with a world and inhabitants such that none of the actions taken by a free agent can lead to evil.

But okay, that's boring. How about a slightly more interesting one?

World W^p consists of Gardens of Eden on parallel planes. Each inhabitant has a Garden to themselves. There's no way to reach any parallel plane. God grants them complete dominion over their Garden. The inhabitant is as capable as anybody living today. They can do evil, but are unable to actually perform it, because there's simply nobody to do evil to. This is the other example from above. Free will doesn't require the agent to be given an opportunity to make all the possible moral decisions. I'm not less free just because I never had a chance to decide whether to kill or not. So another solution to the problem is to come up with such an environment that a free agent never has an opportunity to make a moral decision.

The protest I got to this one is ""But worlds where morally significant actions can be taken are better!"". This misses the point. Plantinga's argument isn't that it's somehow better when worlds contain, or can contain evil. But that free will implies the ability to do evil, and that God must permit evil to exist in order to keep free will. It's a necessary compromise to make. Plantinga is saying ""Yes, this is not ideal, but with these constraints, God's hand is forced, and this is as good as it gets"". The entire reason why the PoE exist is because evil is undesirable, and we need to explain why it's there. Clearly, a world that couldn't contain evil would be better, if it could exist.

But even if I accept this constraint, I still can imagine worlds much better. I give you world W^m. It's like this one, with one extra law. Let's call it the Law of Mutually Agreed Tangibility. Somehow, the universe just works in such a way that free agents are intangible respect of each other, except when they're both aware of each other, and consent to each other's action.

For instance in W^m, Cain can't push Abel off a cliff from behind: Abel isn't aware, so Cain can't push him. Cain also can't stab Abel unless Abel is both aware that Cain intends to stab him, and consents to it.
W^m doesn't remove all evil. Cain can still lie, steal, verbally abuse Abel, and psychologically torture him until he consents to being killed. But it does remove a significant amount of evil. Killing and rape become much harder, war becomes much less practical. Force becomes much less effective -- it's hard to enslave people if they can just leave and you can't do anything to stop them. Escaping violence is trivial -- just don't consent to it.

Plantinga's argument as I see it relies on driving God into a corner: define omnipotence as being subject to weird external limitations like transworld depravities that God somehow can't get rid of, make the unwarranted assumption that the world must necessarily work like the current one, and then it's somewhat plausible that God might be stuck with this state of affairs. But I think that by looking at solutions he seems to ignore the argument gets considerably harder.

The Relativity of Wrong
By Isaac Asimov

&gt;I RECEIVED a letter the other day. It was handwritten in crabbed penmanship so that it was very difficult to read. Nevertheless, I tried to make it out just in case it might prove to be important. In the first sentence, the writer told me he was majoring in English literature, but felt he needed to teach me science. (I sighed a bit, for I knew very few English Lit majors who are equipped to teach me science, but I am very aware of the vast state of my ignorance and I am prepared to learn as much as I can from anyone, so I read on.)

&gt;It seemed that in one of my innumerable essays, I had expressed a certain gladness at living in a century in which we finally got the basis of the universe straight.

&gt;I didn't go into detail in the matter, but what I meant was that we now know the basic rules governing the universe, together with the gravitational interrelationships of its gross components, as shown in the theory of relativity worked out between 1905 and 1916. We also know the basic rules governing the subatomic particles and their interrelationships, since these are very neatly described by the quantum theory worked out between 1900 and 1930. What's more, we have found that the galaxies and clusters of galaxies are the basic units of the physical universe, as discovered between 1920 and 1930.

&gt;These are all twentieth-century discoveries, you see.

&gt;The young specialist in English Lit, having quoted me, went on to lecture me severely on the fact that in every century people have thought they understood the universe at last, and in every century they were proved to be wrong. It follows that the one thing we can say about our modern ""knowledge"" is that it is wrong. The young man then quoted with approval what Socrates had said on learning that the Delphic oracle had proclaimed him the wisest man in Greece. ""If I am the wisest man,"" said Socrates, ""it is because I alone know that I know nothing."" the implication was that I was very foolish because I was under the impression I knew a great deal.

&gt;My answer to him was, ""John, when people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together.""

&gt;The basic trouble, you see, is that people think that ""right"" and ""wrong"" are absolute; that everything that isn't perfectly and completely right is totally and equally wrong.

&gt;However, I don't think that's so. It seems to me that right and wrong are fuzzy concepts, and I will devote this essay to an explanation of why I think so.

&gt;When my friend the English literature expert tells me that in every century scientists think they have worked out the universe and are always wrong, what I want to know is how wrong are they? Are they always wrong to the same degree? Let's take an example.

&gt;In the early days of civilization, the general feeling was that the earth was flat. This was not because people were stupid, or because they were intent on believing silly things. They felt it was flat on the basis of sound evidence. It was not just a matter of ""That's how it looks,"" because the earth does not look flat. It looks chaotically bumpy, with hills, valleys, ravines, cliffs, and so on.

&gt;Of course there are plains where, over limited areas, the earth's surface does look fairly flat. One of those plains is in the Tigris-Euphrates area, where the first historical civilization (one with writing) developed, that of the Sumerians.

&gt;Perhaps it was the appearance of the plain that persuaded the clever Sumerians to accept the generalization that the earth was flat; that if you somehow evened out all the elevations and depressions, you would be left with flatness. Contributing to the notion may have been the fact that stretches of water (ponds and lakes) looked pretty flat on quiet days.

&gt;Another way of looking at it is to ask what is the ""curvature"" of the earth's surface Over a considerable length, how much does the surface deviate (on the average) from perfect flatness. The flat-earth theory would make it seem that the surface doesn't deviate from flatness at all, that its curvature is 0 to the mile.

&gt;Nowadays, of course, we are taught that the flat-earth theory is wrong; that it is all wrong, terribly wrong, absolutely. But it isn't. The curvature of the earth is nearly 0 per mile, so that although the flat-earth theory is wrong, it happens to be nearly right. That's why the theory lasted so long.

&gt;There were reasons, to be sure, to find the flat-earth theory unsatisfactory and, about 350 B.C., the Greek philosopher Aristotle summarized them. First, certain stars disappeared beyond the Southern Hemisphere as one traveled north, and beyond the Northern Hemisphere as one traveled south. Second, the earth's shadow on the moon during a lunar eclipse was always the arc of a circle. Third, here on the earth itself, ships disappeared beyond the horizon hull-first in whatever direction they were traveling.

&gt;All three observations could not be reasonably explained if the earth's surface were flat, but could be explained by assuming the earth to be a sphere.

&gt;What's more, Aristotle believed that all solid matter tended to move toward a common center, and if solid matter did this, it would end up as a sphere. A given volume of matter is, on the average, closer to a common center if it is a sphere than if it is any other shape whatever.

&gt;About a century after Aristotle, the Greek philosopher Eratosthenes noted that the sun cast a shadow of different lengths at different latitudes (all the shadows would be the same length if the earth's surface were flat). From the difference in shadow length, he calculated the size of the earthly sphere and it turned out to be 25,000 miles in circumference.

&gt;The curvature of such a sphere is about 0.000126 per mile, a quantity very close to 0 per mile, as you can see, and one not easily measured by the techniques at the disposal of the ancients. The tiny difference between 0 and 0.000126 accounts for the fact that it took so long to pass from the flat earth to the spherical earth.

&gt;Mind you, even a tiny difference, such as that between 0 and 0.000126, can be extremely important. That difference mounts up. The earth cannot be mapped over large areas with any accuracy at all if the difference isn't taken into account and if the earth isn't considered a sphere rather than a flat surface. Long ocean voyages can't be undertaken with any reasonable way of locating one's own position in the ocean unless the earth is considered spherical rather than flat.

&gt;Furthermore, the flat earth presupposes the possibility of an infinite earth, or of the existence of an ""end"" to the surface. The spherical earth, however, postulates an earth that is both endless and yet finite, and it is the latter postulate that is consistent with all later findings.

&gt;So, although the flat-earth theory is only slightly wrong and is a credit to its inventors, all things considered, it is wrong enough to be discarded in favor of the spherical-earth theory.

&gt;And yet is the earth a sphere?

&gt;No, it is not a sphere; not in the strict mathematical sense. A sphere has certain mathematical properties - for instance, all diameters (that is, all straight lines that pass from one point on its surface, through the center, to another point on its surface) have the same length.

&gt;That, however, is not true of the earth. Various diameters of the earth differ in length.

&gt;What gave people the notion the earth wasn't a true sphere? To begin with, the sun and the moon have outlines that are perfect circles within the limits of measurement in the early days of the telescope. This is consistent with the supposition that the sun and the moon are perfectly spherical in shape.

&gt;However, when Jupiter and Saturn were observed by the first telescopic observers, it became quickly apparent that the outlines of those planets were not circles, but distinct eclipses. That meant that Jupiter and Saturn were not true spheres.

&gt;Isaac Newton, toward the end of the seventeenth century, showed that a massive body would form a sphere under the pull of gravitational forces (exactly as Aristotle had argued), but only if it were not rotating. If it were rotating, a centrifugal effect would be set up that would lift the body's substance against gravity, and this effect would be greater the closer to the equator you progressed. The effect would also be greater the more rapidly a spherical object rotated, and Jupiter and Saturn rotated very rapidly indeed.

&gt;The earth rotated much more slowly than Jupiter or Saturn so the effect should be smaller, but it should still be there. Actual measurements of the curvature of the earth were carried out in the eighteenth century and Newton was proved correct.

&gt;The earth has an equatorial bulge, in other words. It is flattened at the poles. It is an ""oblate spheroid"" rather than a sphere. This means that the various diameters of the earth differ in length. The longest diameters are any of those that stretch from one point on the equator to an opposite point on the equator. This ""equatorial diameter"" is 12,755 kilometers (7,927 miles). The shortest diameter is from the North Pole to the South Pole and this ""polar diameter"" is 12,711 kilometers (7,900 miles).

&gt;The difference between the longest and shortest diameters is 44 kilometers (27 miles), and that means that the ""oblateness"" of the earth (its departure from true sphericity) is 44/12755, or 0.0034. This amounts to l/3 of 1 percent.

&gt;To put it another way, on a flat surface, curvature is 0 per mile everywhere. On the earth's spherical surface, curvature is 0.000126 per mile everywhere (or 8 inches per mile). On the earth's oblate spheroidal surface, the curvature varies from 7.973 inches to the mile to 8.027 inches to the mile.

&gt;The correction in going from spherical to oblate spheroidal is much smaller than going from flat to spherical. Therefore, although the notion of the earth as a sphere is wrong, strictly speaking, it is not as wrong as the notion of the earth as flat.

&gt;Even the oblate-spheroidal notion of the earth is wrong, strictly speaking. In 1958, when the satellite Vanguard I was put into orbit about the earth, it was able to measure the local gravitational pull of the earth--and therefore its shape--with unprecedented precision. It turned out that the equatorial bulge south of the equator was slightly bulgier than the bulge north of the equator, and that the South Pole sea level was slightly nearer the center of the earth than the North Pole sea level was.

&gt;There seemed no other way of describing this than by saying the earth was pear-shaped, and at once many people decided that the earth was nothing like a sphere but was shaped like a Bartlett pear dangling in space. Actually, the pear-like deviation from oblate-spheroid perfect was a matter of yards rather than miles, and the adjustment of curvature was in the millionths of an inch per mile.

&gt;In short, my English Lit friend, living in a mental world of absolute rights and wrongs, may be imagining that because all theories are wrong, the earth may be thought spherical now, but cubical next century, and a hollow icosahedron the next, and a doughnut shape the one after.

&gt;What actually happens is that once scientists get hold of a good concept they gradually refine and extend it with greater and greater subtlety as their instruments of measurement improve. Theories are not so much wrong as incomplete.

&gt;This can be pointed out in many cases other than just the shape of the earth. Even when a new theory seems to represent a revolution, it usually arises out of small refinements. If something more than a small refinement were needed, then the old theory would never have endured.

&gt;Copernicus switched from an earth-centered planetary system to a sun-centered one. In doing so, he switched from something that was obvious to something that was apparently ridiculous. However, it was a matter of finding better ways of calculating the motion of the planets in the sky, and eventually the geocentric theory was just left behind. It was precisely because the old theory gave results that were fairly good by the measurement standards of the time that kept it in being so long.

&gt;Again, it is because the geological formations of the earth change so slowly and the living things upon it evolve so slowly that it seemed reasonable at first to suppose that there was no change and that the earth and life always existed as they do today. If that were so, it would make no difference whether the earth and life were billions of years old or thousands. Thousands were easier to grasp.

&gt;But when careful observation showed that the earth and life were changing at a rate that was very tiny but not zero, then it became clear that the earth and life had to be very old. Modern geology came into being, and so did the notion of biological evolution.

&gt;If the rate of change were more rapid, geology and evolution would have reached their modern state in ancient times. It is only because the difference between the rate of change in a static universe and the rate of change in an evolutionary one is that between zero and very nearly zero that the creationists can continue propagating their folly.

&gt;Since the refinements in theory grow smaller and smaller, even quite ancient theories must have been sufficiently right to allow advances to be made; advances that were not wiped out by subsequent refinements.

&gt;The Greeks introduced the notion of latitude and longitude, for instance, and made reasonable maps of the Mediterranean basin even without taking sphericity into account, and we still use latitude and longitude today.

&gt;The Sumerians were probably the first to establish the principle that planetary movements in the sky exhibit regularity and can be predicted, and they proceeded to work out ways of doing so even though they assumed the earth to be the center of the universe. Their measurements have been enormously refined but the principle remains.

&gt;Naturally, the theories we now have might be considered wrong in the simplistic sense of my English Lit correspondent, but in a much truer and subtler sense, they need only be considered incomplete.

Especially since someone who is already ""inspired"" by the Jesus story is capable of committing further sins.

According to the ransom theory, Satan is being paid off, but this suggests God is dictated to by Satan. Why could God not forgive our sins without the collusion of Satan?

The Christus Victor view, I don't understand at all. Apparently the death of Jesus is somehow the means by which evil is defeated...

The satisfaction theory teaches that Christ was a substitute for mankind. But how does the transfer of accountability happen? And still the question remains, why does God want a sacrifice? It is as if God seeks revenge.

&gt;contends that omniscience and free will are incompatible, and that any conception of God that incorporates both properties is therefore inherently contradictory.



[Argument from inconsistent revelations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_inconsistent_revelations)

&gt;It asserts that it is unlikely that God exists because many theologians and faithful adherents have produced conflicting and mutually exclusive revelations. The argument states that since a person not privy to revelation must either accept it or reject it based solely upon the authority of its proponent, and there is no way for a mere mortal to resolve these conflicting claims by investigation, it is prudent to reserve one's judgment.



[Argument from nonbelief](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_nonbelief)

&gt;The premise of the argument is that if God existed (and wanted humanity to know it), he would have brought about a situation in which every reasonable person believed in him; however there are reasonable unbelievers, and therefore this weighs against God's existence.



[Argument from poor design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_poor_design)

&gt;It is based on the following chain of reasoning:

    An omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent creator God would create organisms that have optimal design.

    Organisms have features that are suboptimal.

    Therefore, God either did not create these organisms or is not omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent.

&gt;The argument is structured as a basic Modus tollens: if ""creation"" contains many defects, then design is not a plausible theory for the origin of our existence. It is most commonly used in a weaker way, however: not with the aim of disproving the existence of God, but rather as a reductio ad absurdum of the well-known argument from design, which runs as follows:

    Living things are too well-designed to have originated by chance.

    Therefore, life must have been created by an intelligent creator.

    This creator is God.



[Atheist's Wager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheist%27s_Wager)

&gt;You should live your life and try to make the world a better place for your being in it, whether or not you believe in god. If there is no god, you have lost nothing and will be remembered fondly by those you left behind. If there is a benevolent god, he will judge you on your merits and not just on whether or not you believed in him.



[Fate of the unlearned](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate_of_the_unlearned)

&gt;The question is whether those who never hear of requirements issued through divine revelations will be punished for failure to abide by those requirements.



[God of the gaps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps)

&gt;God of the gaps is a type of theological fallacy in which gaps in scientific knowledge are taken to be evidence or proof of God's existence. The term was invented by Christian theologians not to discredit theism but rather to discourage reliance on teleological arguments for God's existence.



[Incompatible-properties argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible-properties_argument)

&gt;The incompatible-properties argument is the idea that no description of God is consistent with reality. For example, if one takes the definition of God to be described fully from the Bible, then the claims of what properties God has described therein might be argued to lead to a contradiction.



[Omnipotence paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipotence_paradox)

&gt;The paradox states that if a being can perform any action, then it should be able to create a task it is unable to perform, and hence, it cannot perform all actions. Yet, on the other hand, if it cannot create a task it is unable to perform, then there exists something it cannot do.



[Problem of evil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil)

&gt;In the philosophy of religion, the problem of evil is the question of how to explain evil if there exists a deity that is omnibenevolent, omnipotent, and omniscient. Some philosophers have claimed that the existences of such a god and of evil are logically incompatible or unlikely.



[Problem of Hell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_Hell)

&gt;The ""Problem of Hell"" is a possible ethical problem related to religions in which portrayals of Hell are ostensibly cruel, and are thus inconsistent with the concepts of a just, moral and omnibenevolent God.



[Russell's teapot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot)

&gt;The philosophic burden of proof lies upon a person making scientifically unfalsifiable claims rather than shifting the burden of proof to others, specifically in the case of religion.



[Theological noncognitivism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theological_noncognitivism)

My question to you is, what makes this god (Yahweh) different and ‘true’ against any other god that’s commonly considered a fairy tale in today’s society?

Surely it will spark something in the comments.

In my minor musings on the topic of religion, and the existence of God I have come to a few conclusions.

1. Im not really that interested in people who are raised in their religion and never give it up. I feel that every argument they use to justify their beliefs requires them to already believe in their particular god.

2. Im not really that interested in why atheists dont believe. I think its pretty apparent why they dont, and since I count myself as one I have an adequate understanding of that.

3. Im supremely interested in people that change religions or adapt to one at some point in their life. Christians becoming Muslims, Muslims become Buddhists, Jews who become Muslim/Christian. All of them are interesting to me.

#3 isnt interesting because I feel they are using good arguments. I find them interesting because they were at some point in a pliable state and something changed their mind. Rather than leave their religion, they have changed religions.

In the case of a lifelong adherent to a particular religion. Especially those of you who are active here. I think most of you would admit that there isnt an argument that leads to the god you worship. If there is feel free to share. You likely went through a period of doubt at some point in your faith, and came out on the other side still maintaing your faith. To me this means that you find your particular god more useful then others, or you are attatched to it in some other way. 

Like theists, atheists dont really need a good reason to be atheists, in all honesty that **is the reason** we are atheists because we would need a reason not to be one. Many of us were formerly religious, and I would imagine most of us stopped being religious because we couldnt find a reason to continue that belief. It stopped being useful to us, and became detrimental to us in some aspect.

People that have swapped religions though... to go from one god idea that you find useful to another idea that you find useful. What causes that? You obviously went through a period of questioning much like life long adherents to a religion and former theists did, but you came out of it with another set of beliefs. You were convinced of a god you likely find more useful, or more true or just generally better.

So my question is what do you think caused that change in you? Where were you raised? Do you know how old you were when you stopped believing in your original god? Was there a particular argument that convinced you to adopt a new religion?

He thought he was telling the truth, but was mistaken, which would make him an insane person.  3. He was not telling the truth, and knew it, which would make him a despicable liar.

   8Then that lawless one will be revealed whom the Lord will slay with the breath of His mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming;9that is, the one whose coming is in accord with the activity of Satan, with all power and signs and false wonders,10and with all the deception of wickedness for those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved.11For this reason God will send upon them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false,12in order that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in wickedness.


**1 Kings 22:19-23**

   19Micaiah said, “Therefore, hear the word of the LORD. I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left.20“The LORD said, ‘Who will entice Ahab to go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’ And one said this while another said that.21“Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD and said, ‘I will entice him.’22“The LORD said to him, ‘How?’ And he said, ‘I will go out and be a deceiving spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ Then He said, ‘You are to entice him and also prevail. Go and do so.’23“Now therefore, behold, the LORD has put a deceiving spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; and the LORD has proclaimed disaster against you.”

**Romans 1: 18-32**

   18For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,19because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them.20For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.21For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened.22Professing to be wise, they became fools,23and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures.

   24 Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them.25For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.

   26 For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural,27and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.

   28 And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper,29being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; they are gossips,30slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,31without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful;32and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.

Experiences like ""I had breakfast two hours ago"" or ""God forgives me.""  Even granting that pbb's can be founded on a particular sort of experience, I don't believe these qualify.

If I'm looking at the Space Needle, it seems like a basic experience: I know instantly and undeniably that I'm looking at the Space Needle.  Yet, this surely cannot be a basic experience; anybody taken from a century ago and presented with the same image would *not* experience ""looking at the Space Needle."" 

""The Space Needle"" is, in fact, an interpretation I place on a sensory experience, because of the way my mind has woven together previous sensory experience.  So is ""breakfast."" So is ""God's forgiveness."" 

People blind from birth, when restored to physically perfect vision, usually have [severe problems interpreting visual stimuli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovery_from_blindness#Examples_and_case_studies); so even ""a tall, white tower, with a large disc on top"" would not be a properly basic experience when looking at the Space Needle.

Science can help us out, here.  It turns out that the [visual cortex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex#Primary_visual_cortex_.28V1.29) does not recognize a *picture*; rather, it has special-purpose clusters for recognizing different features of a scene; like lines, circles, color contrasts, etc.  (Interestingly, we do feature extraction and clustering for AI applications like Computer Vision, too).

I propose these primitive features as an upper limit for properly basic visual experiences.  

For a lower limit, we have the way images are stored in computers--as a stream of 1's and 0's, corresponding to pixel location and color (in raster graphics) or geometric primitives and their properties (in vector graphics, this latter case being closer to human vision). 

So, if a basic visual experience falls outside my bounds, why and how? And what are the corresponding bounds for a basic mental experience like ""God forgives me""?

If Mark is history, where are the reliable methods for uncovering it? If Mark knew real traditions, why would he bother to parallel some other story every time Jesus does something major? It's not like this is a sometime thing. Almost every story in Mark draws on the OT, and Mark often tells you where he got it from one way or another (and if he doesn't, that fussbudget Matthew certainly will). The few stories that are not OT in origin have a narrative function, and of course, are so totally bound up with the supernatural that they are certainly fiction -- sometimes both (as in the Gerasene Demoniac, for example, though that has OT echoes too).

http://www.iidb.org/vbb/showthread.php?s=d239f8ccf586656ab7cdeadddb5bb81...

Note: Turton's work also serves a secondary role: it serves to invalidate any argument that Gospel 'prophecies' are supportive of the Gospel's divine origin. It shows that such a claim is based on backwards logic: The Mark author isn't capturing a series of events that 'fulfills a prophecy, he's writing a story built upon Old Testament passages! Seeing as this provides us with a more parsimonious explanation for the purported prophecies of the Old Testament, the claim for Midrash follows the basic rules of valid historiography, whereas 'prophecy claims' violate them.

Well, about 65% of Markan pericopes are built off of the OT one way or another, sometimes by direct paralleling of events, sometimes by verse inspiration. The rest is either Chreia from the culture or hand of Mark, or obvious invention. Some things are difficult to classify, of course....

Mark is fiction. If there was really a community spurring Mark to write this, where are the traditions? There is nothing in Mark that does not go back to the OT, Paul, or something Hellenistic. Exegetes are fond of arguing that Matthew cannot be a disciple, else why would he have copied Mark? That is just as true of Mark: if he knew stories about the HJ, why did he bother to parallel the OT?

Vorkosigan

And seeing as the other gospels simply copy from Mark (the synoptic gospels), we can show that the NT is myth, not history.

The symbols and myths are understood in their immediate meaning. The material, taken from nature and history, is used in its proper sense. The character of the symbol to point beyond itself to something else is disregarded. Creation is taken as a magic act which happened once upon a time. The fall of Adam is localized on a special geographical point and attributed to a human individual. The virgin birth of the Messiah is understood in biological terms, resurrection and ascension as physical events, the second coming of Christ as a telluric, or cosmic, catastrophe. The presupposition of such literalism is that God is a being, acting in time and space, dwelling in a special place, affecting the course of events and being affected by them like any other being in the universe. Literalism deprives God of his ultimacy and, religiously speaking, of his majesty. It draws him down to the level of that which is not ultimate, the finite and conditional.

Though I was more or less aware of Christian theology and beliefs this is the first time I have encountered the actual physical manifestations of those beliefs, as such I have a couple of questions:

1) Regarding relics, I have seen relics which I can only assume are human bones and have been told that it is common. In Jewish culture cutting up dead bodies is considered profane, as are parts of corpses, how do Catholics view this? Does the thought of the graves of these holy men being disturbed not bother you? I was also told that in Mexico they actually keep the whole skulls (no sure if this is true), seems a bit morbid and disturbing to me.

2) Depictions of death and suffering: The churches are filled with it, even if you take out Jesus still tons of statues and pictures of saints being tortured and murdered (saint Sebastian and saint Paul come first to my mind). I also don't know if it was unique to Portugal but in almost every church there was a see through coffin with a statue Jesus lying inside complete with depictions of his wounds. Does it not bother you all these scenes of death and suffering in your places of worship? Do you not find this morbid? Jews don't lack morbid and violent stories and don't have a problem with paintings like Muslims but they mostly depict happy occurrences or nature motifs, why not have more ""happy"" art like Jesus teaching his disciples or John the baptist and less scenes of death? 

3) Well, this is actually silly but I was just interested, when you enter a sacred relic museum do you cross yourselves in front of every depiction of Christ or simply once at the beginning or before only the important ones.

I think most of us here would agree that government should stay out of enforcing religious beliefs. If you don't believe it's right to watch TV on Sunday, then don't watch TV on Sunday, but that should have no bearing on whether I can watch TV on Sunday.

But what if it was optional? A common theme in Christianity seems to be that sin is bad but temptation can be difficult to resist. So, *if* you believe that it's a sin to watch TV on Sunday, and *if* you want some help avoiding the temptation of Sunday TV, then you could opt in to make that action illegal *for you* so that the temptation is not as strong.

There are some major practical problems with the idea, but I'm more interested in whether the idea itself is sound if it could be implemented, so let's handwave these away. Somehow, the police know exactly who has opted into what enforcement, and they are magically able to enforce these laws without taking away resources from enforcement of stuff like murder and robbery and speed limits.

I mean a child has not committed any sin before birth so surely aborting the baby would mean a fast track to heaven. Why wouldn't people want that?

I've heard of original sin from Catholicism  but I've also heard about how people have to know of God and Christ and sin to be deemed a sinner. 

And surely if God gave us free will and we exercise it to abort a child, we the ones sinning but the child isn't so why would the child be stuck in purgatory or hell if God was good? This leads back to the Is God Evil debate.

&gt;Frankly, I think framing this question in terms of abortion just obfuscates the underlying question, which is whether or not innocent souls (unborn babies or infants) get into heaven.

This is an easy claim to make. A scientologist, a scientist, an aristotelian, an astrologist, a discordian, or a dervish can make that exact same claim. It costs nothing to make, and it can never be verified.  If someone tries to test the claim by studying, and finds it wanting, their study was obviously neither sufficient nor sincere.

Indeed, knowing this, few would even want to test the claim--it costs a lot of time and emotional energy to undertake a sincere and in-depth study of some philosophy or religion. If you have more than two or three such claims to evaluate, you might never finish--and since they're so easy to make, even a single person can present them faster than you can deal with them.

This is the opposite of what we want from truth claims: What we want is claims that are hard to make, but easy to verify. 

Scientology understands this, which is one of the reasons it's so popular. Scientology makes concrete claims about your emotional state, and uses an objective-looking measuring device to demonstrate the truth of its claims. Even though it's BS, the ratio of apparent claim difficulty to verification difficulty keeps many people from dismissing it outright.

Some more theatrical sects of Christianity recognize this as well.  ""I can handle poisonous snakes without danger, see?"" is a dangerous claim to make, but fairly easy to verify, unless you're being deceived outright that the snakes are actively venomous.

Complexity theory, a branch of mathematics, is the undisputed master of hard-to-make, easy-to-verify claims. ""[This is](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) the shortest path between these two graph nodes,"" or ""[this is](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem) the heaviest combination of those items that's under the weight limit,"" are canonical examples.

Bayesians understand that any belief they hold has a probability attached to it.  As such, we're often fans of betting--offering a monetary bet at a certain ratio, dependent on some future event, is a good way to increase the cost of your claim.  Even simply [writing down your confidence level](http://predictionbook.com/) helps, because of the social costs of being publically wrong.


So, when you're making claims about your philosophy/religion, and you don't want others to dismiss them immediately, try considering the ratio of claim difficulty to verification difficulty. If the ratio goes the wrong direction, you might want to change its form into something better.

However there is a problem:

Many (most?) of hammie's arguments depend on Final Causality. ([Teleology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology) is just a word meaning you believe final causality exists).

Now what is final causality? To put it simply it is the metaphysical assumption that everything has purpose. In other words, a particle doesn't fall down towards the earth because the rules of gravity demand it (modern science view), but rather because it's purpose and final cause is to fall (teleological view). People have eyes for the ""sake"" of seeing. Here is the short [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes#Final_cause) on it.

Final Causality is one way of explaining why we get specific effects in this universe. Example: When you strike a match against a certain chemical, it will oxidize. It will not turn into a duck, or do anything else. When you put two masses together, they attract each other.  

Now you will often see hammie use the match example as a supposed defense of why Final Causality is true. However this is wrong. Or more specifically, this defense proves too much (and thus nothing). Demonstrating specific effects in the Universe is not enough reason to believe final causality, specifically, is true. 

This is because clearly there are other possible explanations for why we get specific effects in this universe. Indeed the one I believe is true is that there are a system of basic rules which govern matter/energy. Natural Laws if you will. Under this system why does a match ignite when we strike it? Because the laws of the universe dictate that the chemical compound X oxidizes under Y conditions (energy levels, O2 levels etc).

So my proposal is this: If you wish to use teleology and Final Cause as base assumptions in your arguments (such as for the 5 ways) then you need to establish why we should think Final Causality is anything more than a rather unparsimonious way of describing the natural laws of the universe. 

Note: [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) is a good example of why the idea of complex systems arising from simple laws is plausible.

So, show me why I should consider final causality true, or if not, put at the start of each appropriate argument ""Note: This argument relies on your acceptance of teleology. If you do not accept teleology, this argument is defeated, or at least incoherent.""

Second Edit: It occurs to me that I forgot one point. I need to explain what *would* show teleology to be true. It is fairly simple, you need to demonstrate a phenomena that is only explainable via teleology. Something in our world that the Natural Law view point cannot account for. Intentionality is an example of an attempt at this (albeit one I have yet to be convinced by.)

Everyone should look over the types of philosophical arguments.

I've talked to a few people in the last few days who have defended apologetic philosophy by asserting that arguments need not be based on evidence (allowing for complex proofs of the supernatural and of god, which by their very nature defy evidentiary support).  I would counter that if an argument is not based on evidence, it must at least be rooted in something that more than one group of people believe. Ie, theist vs atheist argument cannot proceed until they find a starting premise that both of them can agree on, otherwise the argument is confined to one discipline and has no value to the other.

How about we take a moment to consider the value of arguments without some relation to reality or at least to agreement.  Do you think these arguments have merit? How do you defend such claims?

And as a challenge, I call on both atheists and theists to try and construct arguments for their philosophies which begin with premises we can all accept (either axiomatically or by concession), and then move on to higher level assumptions (imagine the opposite of the Socratic method).",,False,,t5_2snuc,False,,,True,t3_tw4dl,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/tw4dl/to_all_philosophy_and_logic/,

One of the biggest sins a Jew can ever commit is worshiping an idol. It's the second commandment given at Mt Sinai, the first being ""I am your God, you shall have no others before me.""

If our faith strays from the ONE and ONLY creator and provider of this world, we are desecrating Him and ourselves.  Monotheism is belief in ONE God.  The Holy Trinity says that 3 = 1, which is just nonsense.

The problem with Idolatry is that it takes away moral code.  You are essentially free to believe whatever you want.  ""It's okay that I &lt;insert action that goes against God's commandments&gt; because MY God forgives me.""

I know Hitler is a turn off in debate, but I ask this.  Hitler can kill 6 million Jews, 3 million Russians, plus another 3 million people of other differences.  When the Allies are invading Germany and the end is imminent for Hitler, he can sit in his bunker and say ""I'm sorry for killing all these people Jesus, please forgive me. BANG!"" and shoot himself in the head, end his life, and go to heaven.

Where's the morality in that?  Where's the logic?  What God would allow for such evil to triumph, then say ""well, you said sorry, so welcome to heaven.""

A secular perspective.,36,9,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1j74lh/why_take_religion_seriously_in_the_21st_century_a/,"I recently wrote an essay prompted by a debate I had with someone on r/philosophy.  This person was asking us to contrast science with religion and see if religion could possibly stack up favourably.  My essay is a slight re-working and expansion on my response to this challenge, where I attempted to defend religion as worth taking seriously in our modern age.  The full text of my essay can be found [here](http://chewingofthecud.blogspot.com.au/2013/07/why-take-religion-seriously-in-21st.html).

**TL;DR:**

There is a problem with contrasting science and religion in the first place, namely that religion is a far more vague term than science.  It is helpful to contrast a specific religious tradition with the more well-defined practice of experimental science.  But this is not the main problem, as something can be said in contrasting science and religion, though a whole lot more can be said in contrasting science and say, Indian Brahamanism.

There is another problem I see often in this debate, namely that the misuse of either science or religion is invoked as evidence against it.  But this is a shortsighted view.  You wouldn't have a problem with the hammer if it was used to kill someone, anymore than you should have a problem with science as yielding thermonuclear/biological weaponry or religion as yielding the violence of the crusades.  But even this is not the main problem.

The main problem when contrasting science and religion is evaluating one according to the terms of the other.  Almost every argument I have heard in favour of either science or religion has done this, and their arguments are almost always transparently circular.  The only way that science and religion can be sensibly contrasted is by evaluating the practical utility that both separately bring to the table.  Of course science is better equipped to address the mechanical workings of the world.  Of course religions are better equipped to address ethical and interpersonal considerations, though some religions better than others.

And in evaluating these two according to practicality, there is no clear victor for all time; they both have something important to say.  Certain ages have greater need of one than the other.  The late middle ages with their witch burnings and black death were in dire need of a more accurate account of the world and humanity in terms of the hard sciences.

The question then becomes ""what do we need in the 21st century?""

Certainly we face a lot of problems these days, perhaps more than ever.  Is the source of our problems a physical misunderstanding of the world, or not enough technology?  Or is the source of our problems an ethical one, or an inability to live with and respect our fellow man?

The analogy I keep thinking of, probably wrong, is a pilot in an airplane. The airplane is the body (including brain), and the pilot is the mind. This works for a lot of physical effects. For example, if you're tired or drunk, that's like the airplane's controls becoming sloppy and inconsistent. If you take caffeine, the controls get a boost.

All of this affects what the pilot can do with the airplane, but none of it affects how the pilot actually thinks. A pilot in a drunken airplane can still think as clearly as ever, he just has a harder time putting those thoughts into action.

The same is obviously not true of the mind. When we're tired or drunk or on caffeine, it affects our thoughts, often more than anything else. How we think is deeply affected. *What* we think is deeply affected. Even the sacred and ever-vague ""aboutness"" is deeply affected: try thinking about solving three-dimensional integrals while too drunk to stand.

I noticed something very interesting about how I've structured them in the past.

They form a prediction based on God's motives and abilities and compare them to the world we live in.

Namely, the Problem of Evil susposes God's motive, as an omnibenevolent being, is to prevent evil and His omnipotence provides the ability to do so.  Thus we should expect a minimal amount of evil.

The Argument from Mystery supposes God's motive is for people to have correct beliefs about Him and His omnipotence provides the ability to do so.  Therefore we should expect a minimal amount of incorrect beliefs.

One interesting thing is these can be versed in positive and negative forms.  The Problem of Evil can examine the evil that exists, or the lack of good.  The Argument from Mystery can examine the lack of persuasive reasons to think God exists, or examine the persuasive power of arguments against God's existence.

In order to make the premises as easy to defend as possible, I've come to what I think are pretty slimmed down versions of the arguments:

**The Problem of Evil**

1. Evil exists in the form of unrequired suffering (suffering not needed for a greater good and is avoidable)

2. Either God can't stop it, won't stop it, or does not exist

3. It's not because God can't stop it (it would require very little power) and it's not because God won't stop it (there is at least one instance where it would be better for God to intercede)

4. Therefore God does not exist

**The Argument from Mystery**:

1.  Evidence for God could be better

2. God either cannot furnish it, will not furnish it or does not exist

3. It's not because God cannot (it would require very little power to stop at least one bit of ~~unrequired suffering~~ lack of belief for someone), and it's not because God won't (God would be more successful in fostering correct beliefs by furnishing more robust evidence in at least some minimal way at at least one point)

4. Therefore God does not exist

I went to a prestigious Jesuit university, where I learned more about the critique of religion than anywhere else, and studied eastern religions in Asia for a bit.  But the more I've learned, the more I feel like my life would be better if I just completely ignored it.  No reading about it. No discussing it. No debating.

I was told to start from the back, so I did. What struck me again and again was the seeming obsession in the text with the day of judgement, and subsequently heaven and hell. I have five questions for everyone here.

The Quran has 114 chapters and I've read upto 70, starting from the back.

Nearly all of them follow the same structure, which I will mention

* Allah has created you from some small particle

* Be good, not evil

* (because) The day of judgement is fast approaching

* The good will enjoy heaven (Described often in vivid detail, and it looks like an island resort)

* The evil, unbelievers, and polytheists will go to hell (also described sometimes in vivid detail)

* So don't get proud, or you'll go to hell

That's about it, that is the same structure/content I've found in nearly all of the 44 chapters I've read.

I will grant that I have read no commentaries on the chapters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My questions

1) Is this the basic structural layout of the Quran? 

2) I have seen little to no philosophy of note so far. Does the Quran go into any philosophy?

3) All of these passages are simply commands with rewards for obedience and punishments for disobedience/polytheism. Does the Quran have any other teaching model?

4) Why the obsession with heaven and hell? There is not much of earthly life so far I've read, apart from a few basic things about kindness, but no chapter fails to mention that the reward/punishment scheme. Why is this?

5) Man has been given little to no importance. All descriptions of man constantly follow the fact that man is powerless before God. Why is this?

Those who think otherwise are confused due to not recognizing hidden assumptions.,57,31,242,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1aoicp/morality_is_subjective_those_who_think_otherwise/,"First of all, if something is objective its existence does not rely on a conscious mind. If all conscious life in the universe were to disappear everything that is left behind would be objective.

Something that is subjective is a thought, concept, idea, etc... Mathematics is subjective, which does NOT imply that 1+1 can equal whatever you want unless you completely disassociate it from objective reality (which is possible in mathematics, by the way... there is no reason it has to have any bearing on reality).

Morality/Ethics (for this discussion let's consider the two interchangeable because most people do, there is an important distinction but I don't want to discuss that here) are ideas about what is ""best"". Best according to what? That's the question you should have asked yourself after reading that sentence.

Most people who consider morality to be objective assume that the goal of any moral framework is to maximize human well being and minimize human suffering. If we take this stated goal and consider it to be axiomatic then they are almost right, morality is then pseudo-objective. It's psuedo-objective rather than truly objective because it is relative to a subjective goal.

This assumed goal is a minmax function (minimization of human suffering/maximization of human well being). **It is not the only possible goal of a moral framework**... in fact there are a near infinite number of such possible goals, anything you can think of can be the goal of any such moral system.

So, what is the best goal of a moral system? Again, the question you should be asking yourself is ""best according to what?"". The fact that you must ask this question is a clue that the answer is subjective. There is nothing objective to point to in order find out what the best goal of a moral framework is. One person might argue that the best goal is the advancement of human knowledge, another might argue that the best goal is the maximization of free time to pursue our own interests, another person might argue that the best goal is minimization of human suffering.... these goals are based on what the individual proponents consider to be important, what they value. Values are subjective, what I value might not be what you value and there is nothing objective to tell us who's values are better (again, better according to what?).

If we are to take as axiomatic that a moral framework should work to minimize human suffering and maximize human well being (or any other stated goal really) then morality becomes pseudo-objective relative to that axiom. That does not mean that morality is objective, it means that you have hidden in your argument the source of it's subjectivity by asserting an axiom that most people would not object to.

Thank you.

1363031922.0,25,self.DebateReligion,1a3lfr,To theists: Why the genetic problem is still a problem,30,5,154,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1a3lfr/to_theists_why_the_genetic_problem_is_still_a/,"Oftentimes on this subreddit, someone will point out that religious belief strongly correlates with geographic location and upbringing, which is inevitably countered with the accusation of committing a genetic fallacy — that a claim is false because of the source of that claim. In other words, the accuser is saying that just because, say, Hinduism is a mostly Asian religion, passed down through Asian families, doesn't make Hinduism wrong.

This is of course true — that doesn't make it wrong. But it ignores the real problem here. I'd like to present an argument I've often responded with but never received a satisfactory reply to, that raises the problems with the sources of religious belief, without committing a genetic fallacy.

1. A reliable method for discerning truth should tend toward the same answer regardless of the culture, location, upbringing, and background of the person applying the method. Moreover, different people from different backgrounds applying the same reliable method should, over time, converge on an answer.

2. Religious methods of discerning truth (tradition, authority, revelation, personal experience, interpretation of texts) give very different answers based on culture, location, upbringing and background. Also, religious methods have been applied for thousands of years and there is no signs of convergence.

3. Therefore, religious methods for discerning truth are not reliable.

The fact is that every year new cults, religions, sects and denominations are founded — religious thought only seems to diverge. [This map](http://dailyisrael-faith.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/prevailing-world-religions-map.html) shows how geography seems to matter hugely when it comes to religion.

Of course, unreliable methods do not make the conclusion false. They should just make us very skeptical.

My argument is valid, so you will have to challenge either of my premises.

Edit: Thank you for many excellent replies. A few primary confusions I would like to clear up. First, I am not arguing for the truth or falseness of any claim — just the reliability of religious methods. Some have objected to the use of ‘religious methods’ as a phrase, because there is no unified method. I have used religious methods as an umbrella term for revelation, analysis of scripture, prayer, visions, tongues/interpretation, authority, tradition, etc to streamline the argument and avoid repeating myself too many times.

The other commonest objection has been that science is also a cultural thing, since wealthy countries are most able to do science. Yes, it is easier to do science in a wealthy country, but if the scientific method were applied in two different countries, they will usually converge toward a common answer. My example was biology — applying the scientific method in developed nations has given us the theory of evolution, and genetics. However, even a less developed nation applying the scientific method would come to the conclusion that organisms can be classified into types in some kind of hierarchy (plant vs animal, mammal vs reptile, dog vs wolf). They wouldn't necessarily instantly come to the same conclusion as a developed nation, but their answers would tend toward agreement, and be compatible with, the developed nation, and presumably over time they would reach the theory of evolution too.

The best answers have, in my opinion, challenged premise 2. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1a3lfr/to_theists_why_the_genetic_problem_is_still_a/c8tu7ia) response asked whether my argument would fail if there were eventually only 1 religion. Perhaps it would, though common answers are not the *only* thing required to be a reliable method. [Another](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1a3lfr/to_theists_why_the_genetic_problem_is_still_a/c8tyc1g) suggested that convergence has already started to happen, which if it could be demonstrated, would go a long way to defeating my argument.",,False,,t5_2snuc,1363091184.0,,,True,t3_1a3lfr,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1a3lfr/to_theists_why_the_genetic_problem_is_still_a/,

1358235798.0,25,self.DebateReligion,16lw0c,[META] Conceding debates,32,7,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/16lw0c/meta_conceding_debates/,"This is a topic I've been wanting to write about for several months but have never had the opportunity, until now, to actually sit down and write.

Seldom do I see a debate on reddit that actually comes to any form of resolution. Most debates simply taper off with one or both parties loosing interest, agreeing to disagree, or degenerating into just calling one another trolls for not agreeing with the other. What I would like to propose is the we use take advantage of a little known feature of /r/debatereligion (i.e. the concede button).

This is what it looks like, if you've never seen it:

[](/concede)

You're probably thinking:

&gt; Ah, but conceding means admitting that I am wrong!? Why should I concede if I know I am right?

Below I will attempt to outline why conceding debates may be to yours and everyone's advantage sometimes.

A debate is a structured argument between two or more people. Debate embodies the ideals of reasoned argument, tolerance for divergent points of view and rigorous self-examination. Above all, debate is a way for people with opposing views to discuss controversial issues, such as religion and philosophy, without descending to insults, emotional appeals or personal bias. A key characteristic of debate is that it rarely ends in agreement, but rather allows for a robust analysis of the question at hand.

Because debate seldom ends in actual agreement, there may be the perception that we're simply wasting our time here in /r/debatereligion. For many, this can result in frustration and an even more extreme sense of opposition to divergent ideas culminating in actual hatred of an idea or philosophical position. Consequently, we dig our heels in, becoming ever more rigid in our cognitions and biases.

This is problematic for several reasons. Many of us like to describe ourselves as “truth-seekers”. We debate in order to discern falsehood or fallacy from truth and fact. We rightly interrogate the ideas put forth by our debating opponents that we might be able to gauge the rightfulness of their position and, upon self-reflection, the rightfulness of our own position. That's the ideal; but the reality of our debates doesn't necessarily follow that narrative. Perhaps, more often than we care to admit, we are so convinced of that we are right and our opponent is wrong that we cannot even consider that there might be at least some truth to their arguments. Thus, the pursuit for truth becomes an illusion as truth-seeking takes second-stage to self-righteousness.

Still others of us are more inclined toward competitive, even combatative debating. We're not at all concerned about the truthfulness of our opponents arguments and we may not even necessarily have a strong sense of what our own argument is; so long as it is the opposite of our opponents. The problem with this position is that to concede any point at all to our opponent might be regarded as weakness or ineptitude on our part. Thus, we are unrelenting in our attacking of our opponents arguments and often dismissive of their evidence. And while the competitive/combatative debating style is a perfectly valid approach to debating, it also retards us by hindering any actual shifting in ideas.

And I so propose the idea of being prepared to concede debates, not based on the truthfulness or righteousness of the issue; but based on argumentation itself. For example, as a theist I believe in the existence of God. As an atheist, you may argue against this belief and bring to the argument such evidence to support your position that there is “no God”. In spite of your evidence, I still believe in the existence of a God. But, believing that I cannot bring to the argument anywhere near the same amount of evidence or evidence to equal or superior validity and being unable to identify any logical fallacies in your argument, I will concede that you have mounted a better argument than I was able to mount. Thus I concede to you. My concession does not mean that I am now an atheist.

Similarly, your concession of a debate to a theist (e.g. on the matter of the existence of a God or gods) does not make you a theist by default. You would not be agreeing to the existence of a God or gods; but conceding that either your theist opponent had mounted a better argument or that your own argument was in some way lacking.

So why should we concede? Why not just do what we already do and just walk away from the debate or hound our opponents until they give up and walk away? The short answer is, to help us and yourself to become a better debater. Any conceding of a debate should ideally be accompanied by a brief description of why you are conceding. What was it about your opponents argument that you found difficult to counter? What was it about your own argument that you think was lacking? How could you have improved your argument? What could you have done to have avoided whatever fallacies you might have committed? Ultimately, the goal of conceding to your opponent is for you to become a better debater so that you can better argue your position in the future.

Now, one problem that I can immediately see with is that our debates in r/debatereligion are seldom 1:1 debates. Everyone chimes in with a comment or a mini-argument. In truth, most of these are simply spectator comments and not really debates; so they can either be ignored or an attempt to debate them might be made. But it is important not to become complacent about letting others do our debating for us. I might agree with something that Debater A says and disagree with Debater B. But I'll either begin a new debate (within the same thread) with Debater B rather than supporting the arguments of Debater A. In doing so, I become Debater C. And while Debater B might eventually come to concede to Debater A; my debate with Debater B represents a discrete debate and remains unresolved until either they or I can mount the better argument. Therefore, while Debater A and Debater C are arguing for the same thing against Debater B, each debate is ultimately independent of one another. 

If I don't want to debate Debater B, I might offer some input to Debater A, advising them of some source of evidence that they could use in support of the their argument or highlighting to them a fallacy in Debater B's argument that they could exploit. Admittedly, this could be seen as somewhat unfair to Debater B because it artificially augments Debater A's debate.

Perhaps one final reason why conceding based on argument style rather than “truth” might be worthwhile considering is that it might address what could be one of the greatest obstacles to many debates in this subreddit – animosity. While animosity either toward a particular debater, argument, or position should not be a major factor in determining the outcome of a debate, the reality seems to be that animosity is a significant factor in perpetuating or hindering the flow of many debates. Conceding with reflection, perhaps a meta-discussion of the debate itself, might help to overcome some of that animosity as we all strive to help one another in becoming better debaters.

I personally do not espouse the idea that Jesus Christ did not exist, however I commonly hear Christians tell those who do that, “There is just as much proof for the existence of Jesus Christ as there is for Julius Caesar.” My question, I suppose, is how many of you believe this? While I think a person matching a basic description for Jesus Christ probably did exist and went by the name Yeshua, I view statements like this Julius Caesar comparison as an affront to historical methodology. Julius Caesar conquered Gaul (military engagements produce extensive archaeological evidence), he played a pivotal role in the transformation of the republic into the Roman Empire, as dictator he commissioned extensive public works, and he personally took hegemony over the Mediterranean’s strongest power. Now, I am not trying to aggrandize Caesar’s achievements and gloss over those of Christ (should he have been divine). I am simply saying that Caesar was the type of man whose actions produced more of the kinds of evidence that we can examine today; his ego ensured that there were numerous and favorable contemporary accounts of his actions, and his military exploits and public projects produced extensive physical evidence. Frankly, the very notion that someone who was supposed to have been a religious leader, living in a border province, having few possessions, and travelling with a small number of followers would produce as much evidence is silly. Additionally, it is important that we be careful when using the words ‘historical,’ and ‘proof,’ together in close proximity.


Utilizing the following criteria...

* Human sources may be relics such as a fingerprint; or narratives such as a statement or a letter. Relics are more credible sources than narratives.
* Any given source may be forged or corrupted. Strong indications of the originality of the source increase its reliability.
* The closer a source is to the event which it purports to describe, the more one can trust it to give an accurate historical description of what actually happened.
* A primary source is more reliable than a secondary source which is more reliable than a tertiary source, and so on.
* If a number of independent sources contain the same message, the credibility of the message is strongly increased.
* The tendency of a source is its motivation for providing some kind of bias. Tendencies should be minimized or supplemented with opposite motivations.
* If it can be demonstrated that the witness or source has no direct interest in creating bias then the credibility of the message is increased.

...I think it is important that we recognize that whether or not Christ was divine or not, there is in fact more evidence for people like Julius Caesar.



Christians should be just as cautioned about making such claims as others should when espousing the Jesus myth theory. I think most importantly that appealing to such unfounded statements is the real problem, regardless of one’s position.

It seems to me that there is a spectrum of understanding this debate and that on one level we have the face value understanding of it, then a moderate level, and finally an intensely deep level.  A face level might be the sound bites often seen in /r/atheism ""quote with picture"" submissions, a moderate level would be something around understanding Aquinas' first way, and the deeper level being somewhere around understanding how alethic modality applies to the argument from contingency.

I think I'm pretty well through the first two levels and have been trying to delve into the third, but this stuff is brutally complex and reads like backwards korean VCR instructions.

After trying to dig through it a bit, I think I've come to a very important conclusion.  That is, I (and perhaps most people) believe in things based off of roughly 3 things:

1) Physical evidence

2) The suggestion of authorities or most peers

3) gut instinct/preconception

When it comes to God, there's no physical evidence that stands up to minor scrutiny (the argument from the physical constants tries to get off the ground then fails for lack of knowledge in statistics), the popular suggestion is that we should believe that God exists, but the authoritative suggestion disagrees (most high level philosophers/scientists don't believe in God), and my gut tells me that God either doesn't exist, or there's something completely fucked going on that I have no idea about (for instance, an appropriate rebuttal to the problem of evil might be that no one else exists and hence my own suffering is the only input to the problem of evil, and I previously consented to suffering in some pre-birth state and hence it's not evil)

But even with no physical evidence, that doesn't mean a proposition is not justified, appeals to authority and popularity are of course fallacious without understanding the reasons behind these attitudes, and my gut instinct sucks on regular occasion.

Mormon's have 4 books of scripture (The Bible, The Book of Mormon, The Doctrine &amp; Covenants and The Pearl of Great price) that make up their canon. 

Polygamy was revealed by Joseph Smith and is found in [Doctrine &amp; Covenants 132](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng).   Polygamy was openly practiced by [Joseph Smith](http://www.mormoninfographics.com/2012/09/the-many-wives-of-joseph-smith.html), [Brigham Young](http://www.mormoninfographics.com/2012/09/the-wives-of-brigham-young.html) and many other leaders and members of the Mormon church.  

In 1890 Mormon prophet Wilford Woodruff stopped the practice of polyagmy with [Official Decleration # 1](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/od/1?lang=eng) (its found near the end of the doctrine and covernants).   However section 132 was left unchanged.   Now the way I understood Woodrufff's decleration was in this line 

&gt;And I now publicly declare that my advice to the Latter-day Saints is to refrain from contracting any marriage forbidden by the law of the land.

Polygamy was illegal so Mormons were to stop practicing it but polygamy was still an important docrtine of the Mormon church.   Could a Mormon help me understand this?   What would happen if polygamy were legalized today?  What about countries where it is not illegal?  

I have found one instance where it is still being practiced today in theory, let me try to explain.   Some background, Mormons believe in two types of marriage.  There is the civil union that is recognized by the state and there is the temple sealing that is recognized by God.  Marriage by the state is until death but marraige by God is forever.  Now why this is relevant.

Hypothetical A:  Husband and wife#1 get married by the state and married by God in the Mormon temple.   They are married for eternity.  Wife#1 dies.  Husband decides to remarry.  Husband and wife#2 get married by the state and married by God.  Husband is now married to both #1 and #2 for eternity.  Everyone dies goes to heaven husband has two wives.

Hypothetical B: Husband#1 and wife get married and sealed in the temple.  Husband#1 dies.  Wife decides to remarry.  She gets married by the state to husband#2 but now she must make a decision.  The mormon church will not allow women to be sealed to more then one man.  She can either marry husband#2 by the state only and return to husband#1 when she dies.  Or she can cancel her sealing with husband#1 and seal herself to husband#2.

So in theory it would seem polygamy is still practiced.  Am i understanding this right?  Why then is polygamy not practiced in countries where it is legal?  If the law changes in america will official decleration become null and void?  I am confused. 

*I don't mean to bring up the topic of polyandry is this thread, if you want to discuss that start a new thread.  Also when I say Mormon I am speficially refering the the LDS sect headquartered in SLC, UT.

It isn’t the often patronising tone that irks me, but the fact that they are never proving *their* gods. Logical arguments too oft are stolen from deists: let me use the Ontological Argument.


Although we’ve got a few from which to choose,  I think we should stick to Anselm’s:


1. Our understanding of God is a being which no greater can be conceived.

2. The idea of God exists in the mind.

3. A being which exists in both mind and in reality is greater than a being that exists only in the mind.

4. If God exists in the mind, we can conceive a greater being - that which exists in reality.

5. We cannot be imagining anything greater than God.

6. Therefore God exists.

Ignore for a second that there is “*an evident absurdity in pretending to demonstrate a matter of fact, or prove it by arguments a priori*” or that existence is not a predicate. Grant Anselm that it only can be applied to God and not Gaunilo’s Island. And even then he has not proved his God,  not even a god, just something superior to us.

Anselm, of course, wouldn’t dare consider this a ‘proof’ for anything other than his God: a Muslim, a Christian and a Jew walk into a bar and could all use this exact same argument to ‘prove’ their god to the bartender. Why? Because they are all asserting a deistic God at best. There is no link here to any form of dogma; any form of ‘religion’. 

So I plead, please, if you are a Christian, assert arguments for your God. Couldn’t you be a darling and tell me how Christ was clearly the son of God? Or as a Muslim you could describe to me how the miracles occurred? As a Jew, perhaps you can provide historical evidence for Moses’ military campaign?

I think [cogent](http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/rea.html) [defenses](http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/carrier-wanchick/jointstatement.html) of naturalism have been made in the past, but just came across a [highly interesting argument](http://secularoutpost.infidels.org/2012/06/evidential-argument-from-history-of.html) from Jeffery Lowder.  He posits that naturalistic explanations have been so successful that even most scientific theists concede that supernatural explanations are, in general, implausible, *even on the assumption that theism is true*; thus, the history of science is some evidence for naturalism and against theism.  I'm very curious what the thoughts are in this sub regarding the matter, so I'll present it here.  Note that this is an *evidential* argument; it is a matter of probability, not absolute logical necessity.
___

**Formal Statement of the Argument**

**B: The Relevant Background Information**

1. The universe is intelligible.

**E: The Evidence to be Explained**

1. So many natural phenomena can be explained naturalistically, i.e., without appeal to supernatural agency.
2. The history of science contains numerous examples of naturalistic explanations replacing supernatural ones and no examples of supernatural explanations replacing naturalistic ones. 

**Rival Explanatory Hypotheses**

T: classical theism

N: metaphysical naturalism: the hypothesis that the universe is a closed system, which means that nothing that is not part of the natural world affects it.

**The Argument Formulated**

1.  E is known to be true.
2.  Pr(E | B &amp; N) &gt;! Pr(E | B &amp; T).
3.  T is not much more probable intrinsically than N.
4. Therefore, other evidence held equal, T is probably false.

**Defense of (2)** 

N entails that any true explanations must be naturalistic ones.  Thus, on the assumption that N is true, we have an extremely strong reason to expect that successful scientific explanations will be naturalistic ones. In contrast, if T is true, then it could have been the case that that successful scientific explanations were supernatural explanations. For example, biology could have discovered that all animals are not the relatively modified descendants of a common ancestor; neuroscience could have discovered no correlations at all between human minds and brains, etc. If the history of science were like that, then that would have supported T over N.  But then the success of science in finding naturalistic explanations must be evidence for N over T. How strong is this evidence? I agree with Draper:  ""the more likely it is that there are true naturalistic explanations for natural phenomena (i.e., the stronger the presumption of naturalism), the more unlikely it is that there are supernatural beings.""",,False,,t5_2snuc,False,,,True,t3_vfonx,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/vfonx/to_all_the_evidential_argument_from_the_history/,

**What I mean by ""God"":**

In order to clarify and limit the scope of my arguments, I am defining as narrowly as possible the exact meaning of ""God"" that my arguments pertain to. God, for the sake of these arguments, has the following attributes:

* An entity that transcends all physical attributes.
* An entity that transcends all logic.
* An entity that is a Mind and has a Will.
* An entity that creates from material nothingness and sustains every other entity.

***
    EDIT: An objection has been raised that I cannot use logic to prove the existence
    of God if He transcends all logic. I will reply to this in a comment and link to it here.
***

It follows from the physical and logical transcendence of God that He is also single and indivisible. This I will argue after the arguments for the existence of God.

I have two arguments for the existence of God, which in summary are:

* *Argument A:* I exist, therefore, God exists.
* *Argument B:* The universe exists, therefore, God exists.

Argument A is the more powerful argument for me.



**Argument A: ~~I exist, therefore, God exists.~~** I have conceded this argument. Please follow the discussion [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/swtit/to_all_critique_my_theism/c4hp273).

* *""I"" means the mind and not the body*

In order to demonstrate this argument, I must first clarify the usage of the word *I*. Here, *I* refers to the non-physical self which experiences all experiences, which I will refer to as the mind. *I* does **not** mean the physical body, in which case this argument would become identical to Argument B.



* *The mind exists*

The existence of the mind is evidenced by subjective, personal experience. I believe in the mind because I experience [qualia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia). No matter how much I study the physical body I cannot find the seat of experience. Nor do I need to study my body in order to know that I exist and I experience. I know this *a priori*.



* *The existence of the mind is relevant to both you and me*

I believe the existence of the mind is a valid basis from which to build an argument, even though it is subjective, because I believe (reasonably so) that you all also have minds and are not, in fact, [zombies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie).



* *I am not self-caused*

In the same vein that I know that I exist, I also know that I did not create myself. If I did create myself, then I must have the innate ability to create minds. Yet I find myself lacking this innate ability. I only know that I exist, not how or why I am in existence.



* *I am not eternal*

I also know that I am not eternal, otherwise I must have experienced an infinite of qualias. Since I continue to have new experiences with new qualia, then I cannot be eternal.



* *Therefore, another entity created me*

Since I am not self-caused, nor am I eternal, this means that another entity created me. I shall call this entity the Creator.



* *The Creator is a Mind with a Will*

No arrangement or interaction of mindless entities can give rise to minds. The quality of myself having a mind must come from another entity having a quality of mind equal to or greater than the quality of mind possessed by myself. Similarly, the quality of me having a will must come from an entity possessing will. Therefore, the Creator is a Mind with a Will.



* *The Creator transcends all physical attributes*

No arrangement or interaction of physical entities can give rise to entities that transcend the physical. I transcend the physical, and the Creator created me, therefore, the Creator also transcends the physical.



* *The Creator transcends all logic*

The workings of the mind cannot be described by logic. For example, I cannot use logic to demonstrate that I am a mind, that I exist, that I have a will, etc. All these I know *a priori* and cannot use logic to demonstrate. Since the mind cannot be described by logic, and yet the Creator created my mind, the Creator transcends logic.



* *The Creator sustains me*

Just as the Creator created the mind, the continued existence of the mind is also contingent upon the Creator, who is then also a Sustainer. I do not know how to continue to cause myself to exist, since I did not cause myself in the first place. And since I needed to be caused to exist, I also need to be continually caused to exist, i.e., sustained in existence. Therefore, the Creator must continue to sustain me in every possible way, including from moment to moment in time.



* *Conclusion*

And so, there exists an entity that created me from material nothingness (i.e., the absence of material, since I am obviously an immaterial entity), that has a Will and a Mind, and transcends physicality and logic. This entity is God.





**Argument B: The universe exists, therefore, God exists.**



* *The universe means all physical things*

Let me first clarify what I mean by ""universe"". The universe here refers to all of physical existence. In some theories of cosmology, this would correspond to the ""multiverse"".



* *What is a physical entity?*

A physical entity can be matter, energy, momentum, forces, potentials, fields, space-time, vacuum, quantum states, strings, branes, dimensions, or anything else that physics describes and explores.



* *Why I am not arguing that the universe had a beginning, but instead that the universe was not self-caused*

I could have argued that the universe has a beginning, but this necessitates resorting to the Big Bang theory or other cosmological theories which have an origin of space-time. While I do believe the Big Bang theory to be the most accurate representation of the origin of the universe to date, I do not want to base my argument on it because it *could* change. Furthermore, our cosmological theories today focus on the evolution of the universe after the creation of space-time, and it can be argued that this does not constitute a true beginning of the universe (e.g., Stephen Hawking's argument that resorts to the use of imaginary time). Instead, I will argue that the universe was not self-caused. This is a much more powerful argument which transcends all theories of cosmology, including those which state the universe is infinite in spatial and/or past-temporal extent (even though I think this is impossible).



* *The universe is a closed system*

The universe and everything in it constitutes a closed system. This means that physical entities (e.g., planets) can form only from other physical entities (e.g., gravity and gas clouds). All experience and scientific probing points to this conclusion.



* *Physical entities are not self-caused*

[Noether's theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether's_theorem) gives us a profound insight into the nature of conservation and invariance of physical quantities. For example, the application of Noether's theorem to temporal shifts results in the conservation of energy and the application of Noether's theorem to spatial translations gives rise to the conservation of linear momentum. Generalizing this concept to all physical entities, we realize that all physical entities are subject to conservation laws. Since all physical entities are conserved, they must necessarily transform from one quantity to another, from one form to another, but never be created nor destroyed. Since physical entities cannot be created nor destroyed, they cannot create themselves nor destroy themselves. Therefore, they are not self-caused. In other words: atoms are not self-caused, galaxies are not self-caused, the four fundamental forces are not self-caused, energy is not self-caused, space-time is not self-caused, strings and branes are not self-caused.



* *The universe is not self-caused*

The universe is simply the physical entity consisting of all physical entities, and being a physical entity, it is not self-caused.



* *The universe has a Creator*

Since the universe is not self-caused, it has an external cause, which I will call the Creator.



* *The universe is not self-sustaining*

In order for any physical entity to be self-sustaining, it must have the ability to create (and its opposite: to destroy), since the idea of continued existence can be thought of as creation at every moment. Physical entities cannot create themselves or others, so they also cannot sustain their continued existence or that of others. Therefore, physical entities are not self-sustaining. Since the universe is a physical entity, it is also not self-sustaining. Note that space and time themselves are physical entities and part of the universe, hence even a universe that is infinite either space and time or in both is also not self-sustaining.



* *The Creator sustains the universe*

Since the universe is not self-sustaining, and yet it exists continuously, it must be sustained externally by the Creator.



*The Creator transcends all physical attributes*

Since the Creator creates and sustains everything physical, He must necessarily transcend all physical attributes.



* *The Creator transcends all logic*

There are two paths to argue that the Creator transcends all logic. One is that logic is incomplete, therefore cannot explain itself, and so needs an external framework created by the Creator. The second is that because logic is incomplete, it is impossible to make a logically consistent theory of all physical entities, and therefore physical entities and the universe at large transcend logic. Since the Creator created the universe, an entity that transcends logic, the Creator Himself must also transcend logic.



* *The Creator has a Will and is a Mind*

Since the Creator chose to create the universe, He has a Will, and since He has a Will, He is a Mind. (This is a bit of a weak argument for the Creator being a Mind, however).



* *Conclusion*

And so, there exists an entity which can create and sustains physical entities from the absence of physical entities, which transcends all physicality and logic, and which has a Will and is a Mind. This entity is called God.



**God is Single and Indivisible**

It follows from the fact that God is the ultimate Creator and Sustainer that He is also single and indivisible. When talking about entities that have the ability to Create and Sustain, including the universe itself, it is not acceptable to talk in the plural, as there is no rational method of distinguishing one entity with these attributes from another entity with these same attributes. We can only rationally talk about the existence or non-existence of such an entity. Therefore, if we accept that God exists, we must accept Him as singular. This rules out polytheistic belief systems. Using the same reasoning, we cannot rationally make divisions within this single entity, which means that He is indivisible (this rules out many-in-one systems like the Trinity).

But neither can we remain silent regarding the context of these times in which these events have come to light. There is a market in child pornography that seems in some way to be considered more and more normal by society.  
  
.  

&gt;  In the 1970s, paedophilia was theorized as something fully in conformity with man and even with children.  
  
[from the Vatican website](http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2010/december/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20101220_curia-auguri_en.html)  
  
Just saw this on TIL.  So the Catholic Church admits that their moral compass was completely wrong during this scandal.  They blame society for dragging the Church off course.  Isn't it the Church's job to bring correct morals to society, not blame us for its own failings?  And where did he get this idea that paedophilia was considered normal in the 1970's?  If this was the case, why did they have to move these priests around.  Clearly they knew they were doing something wrong, and this is a crazy cop-out.

1328334007.0,23,self.DebateReligion,pabzy,im just gonna be straight up and say it. i AmA christian that wants to debate religion with an atheist/agnositc. (but lets be civil),34,11,297,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/pabzy/im_just_gonna_be_straight_up_and_say_it_i_ama/,"my personal ideal on christianity, is not necesarily one of the main view of the church. i feel much of living a christian lifestyle has to do with faith virtue and knowlege. (add to your faith virtue, to virtue knowlege, to knowlege self control, to self control perseverence, to perseverence godliness, to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness love) and i explain it like this:


 The first three are fundamental. Faith, Virtue, and Knowlege

I always interpreted this as the basic foundation of living a christian life.

Before you do anything else one must have faith. If you dont belive in what your doing there is no point. Faith is blindly following, so one should be wary of where they are puting there faith. I would oberve the church, do they speak of richeousness (good) or condemnation (bad)? is there an atmosphere of love at the church? and most importantly does the serman match gods word, but remember we christians arent perfect so dont let our hypocricy reflect our god.  

the second is virtue. once one has faith, they should always to be sure to do what is right,a person can be virtuous without faith,  likewise having faith does not make one virtuous or moral. Many christians rely on the bible as a moral guideline only, when its a guidebook for living by gods covenant. Understand that every line in the bible has context when it comes to morality, but the world is not absolute so we must take into consideration the plight of the people in the world and respect there values and morals, when looking at our own. The least contested words in the bible are those of jesus, so when looking at virtue, read the red letters.

after that comes knowlege. if one doesn't try to seek out the real answers,  they will never grow. After jesus's parable of the mustard seed, many people left confused and upset that they only heard so little and that it was so vague. after the serman jesus's disciples went up to him and asked what he meant. this was them seeking out knowlege. while in church, listen to the serman and dont be afraid to speak to the pastor after. also after a serman, write down the bible quotes he/she uses, and look up there context. or ask him/her. the pastor is human, and he will have an opinion on any issue, but the bible is uncontestable for those that wish to live by gods covenent.  

 

self control is the next trial. one must know when to speak on accounts of faith virtue and knowlege, rather than simply know them. if someone does not have self control, there speech will be too wild. and although they may be religious, belive themselves to be pious, and have memorized the bible, they will be perseved as a pharasee, a hypocrite, and a poor example of the teachings of jesus christ. but if one controls there speech, and is not hastey to judge others for there opinions, they will not be seen this way but as humble and patient, rather than prideful and arrogant.

 after that comes perseverence, now why would one need perseverence unless things were about to become very difficult?

if you got that far, gods probobly going to test you to see if you are truely following his word. which means get ready, its going to get rough. although in this time you will feel alone, god will be with you. pray to him and try to learn what he is trying to teach you. if you are truely listening you will find gods answer. dont confuse this with falling away from god, although this is when most people would. if one has a strong foundation in there religious conviction they will pass there tribulation.

if they pass gods test, they will experience godliness. this does not mean they are god like, or superior in anyway, but rather god has smiled in there life, and have become blessed. but that blessing comes with a responsibity to shine god in a positive light. and god smiles when his christians are faithful, vitruous, wise, understanding and patient. (which are the qualities of godliness)

brotherly kindness comes after this. these are the peacemakers. For those that have the rare oportunity to experience godliness (which is not the same as grace, which can only come from god), they share brotherly kindness with the world. this would be the people that forgive there enemies, and turn the other cheek. they are peacemakers, who are the most blessed by god. but they are few and far between. if one truely is a peacemaker, they can truely change the world. (ghandi was so christian he was hindu -bill maher) (if all christians beliveled what they say they do, they would of already changed the world by now -mahatma ghandi). finally at the end of this, is love, when one truely has all these things that preceed love, they have the ability to change the world, for the better. (i wonder what my paster thinks of this)
