The Jeep was silver and the driver was white, male, 30's, 6'0""ish. He may be looking to fix it as it has front end damage. The car is local to the area by all indications and seems to visit around the train station in Port Jeff each day

More description: I was in a silver Dodge Neon Sxt. He hit me fairly straight on but more damage would be done to the right side of the car since the impact was scewed that way. He was travelling south on the road and hit me in front of the Comsewogue Library around 1:28 pm Monday. I will post images of my car.

My cousin was diagnosed with a rare form of liver cancer when he was 15 months old, he has now been in remission for over 5 years. For the past 7 or so years my uncle has been organizing a team of riders to participate in the Pan Mass Challenge ( www.pmc.org ). This will be the first time in 4 years that I will not be participating in the race because I recently had hip surgery, so I am hoping I can raise awareness in other ways.

The ""race"", which is really more of a ride, is a two-day 190 mile ride. Needless to say the riders have been training since spring and are extremely dedicated. The cost of entry is 3,600 per rider and we host an annual fundraising so that we can get as many people on the team as possible. Our team is named Matthews Ducks after my cousin, and we ride in his honor.I would like to extend an open invitation to anybody who is interested to come on down this Saturday.

There will be a charge at the door of 45 dollars, which gets you open bar and buffet. There will also be raffle tickets being sold, you do not have to buy them but the prizes are by far the best this year than they have ever been. The prizes are all donated and in years past have included hotel stays, gift certificates, Ipads, and a mountain bike.

If you are not able to attend and would like to contribute to our cause you have a few options. You can donate to our team via www.pmc.org (if you want to do this please pm me and I will give you the details), you can also donate to the pmc as a whole at their website.

Please check out pmc.org, it is an amazing event that takes place in Massachusetts.

Thanks for your time

-------------------------------

**Tips For Dealing With The Aftermath** via [r/Sandy](http://www.reddit.com/r/sandy/comments/12by8f/tips_for_the_upcoming_weeks_months_from_a_gulf/)

* **Contact your work ASAP** to find out when you will be next scheduled. After Isaac I was back at work within 2 days.

* **Traffic signals**: If there is no power to a traffic light, it is a 4 way stop. Don't get ticketed or in a wreck!
Home owners: Tarp your house ASAP, don't let the insurance company say you were neglectful and try to deny your claim.

* **Documentation**: Take pictures of the damage immediately, write down what you lost and have pictures of anything you need to throw away immediately, like carpeting, misc. stuff that went under water. The more you can prove, the more you will get from your insurance.

* **Repairs**: Do not do any major repairs until after your claims adjuster has been there. Let them see the damage first hand.

* **Contractors**: Make sure any contractor you are going to use is licensced, bonded, and insured. Get local references and make sure to contact them. Be very careful of scammers, they will be out in force. Do not pay the entire lump sum up front. Double check any work that they do, it is your house, make sure it is done properly. If you are unsure about anything, do not be afraid to speak up.

* **Self contracting**: Unless you know what you are doing, don't do it. If you repair/remodel more then a certain percentage you will have to bring the entire house up to code. If you don't do this, when the insurance inspects it, they may require you to do it before they release any more money. Protect yourself by getting somebody that knows what they are doing.

* **Gutting your house**: Doing it yourself is a good way to save money. It's cheap to get a sledge hammer and bust out sheet rock if your house flooded. It's also a great way to relieve stress! Just be careful not to knock down load bearing walls! Also if you are thinking about re-doing your floor plan and get enough money from the insurance, now is the time to do it! After Katrina, I completely re-arranged every bedroom in the house. If you go this route, make sure that you have a dumpster though, you might get in trouble putting house debris like this in regular trash. If you do get a dumpster, watch it like a hawk, other people will try to use it to avoid paying for their own.

* **Electricity**: You might be out of power for a week or more. Please be patient.

* **Disaster food stamps**: Check your local media to see if there is a pre-""approval"" process that you can fill out to try to save a little time when they are released. Also if you do not meet the criteria, don't waste your time going out there.

* **Debris**: Again, check with your local media on the proper way to dispose of debris. Post Isaac we were told not to bag any of the tree limbs and to just throw them in a pile in our front yard. Do it properly to help speed up debris removal. Expect it to take a while though, it was a couple of weeks for us.

* **Fridges**: If you are without power for more then 24 hours, clean them out ASAP before they get too bad. If you let the food rot too long, it will leave a stench in the fridge that will be hard to get out. Don't let it sit a month! My Katrina claim was a lump sum for food, so I didn't bother to document it. Check your insurance papers to see if you need to document it.

* **Insurance paperwork**: Chances are good that you won't be doing anything tomorrow, read your insurance paperwork and know it well. It will make talking to the insurance company a lot easier because you know what is covered and what is not covered. It will also make it easier once you get the initial offer.

* **Difference in damage**: Flooding is water that came from the ground up, this is covered by flood insurance, and not home owners insurance. Hurricane damage is water that came from the roof down. This is covered by your home owners insurance. Both of them will try to push it off on the other. Don't let them. Have pictures showing flooding in the area to help push your flood claim. Also oddly enough during Katrina flood insurance and home owners insurance used two different pay scales. A foot of sheet rock for flood was a different pay out then a food of sheet rock for home owners. I don't know why, but it was. Expect inconsistencies like that.

Great information from [FLDJF713](http://www.reddit.com/user/FLDJF713)

* Below I've listed some tips and pleas I give that make all of 911-services easier for us to operate in.

* Cars in your driveway. If it's on the street, it could be hit by another car or a truck. If it's bad enough, one of the FD's WILL break into your car and put it in neutral and push it away. They are not responsible for your car.

* If you are asked to leave, LEAVE. If you do choose to stay in a mandatory evacuation, no one will come when you call 911. For the most part, only police will remain in service in evac areas. Power will also go out most likely.

* Plenty of shelters out there for you, take advantage of them.

* If you are driving wherever, please be very careful and drive extra slow. Everyone is on edge, and we don't want accidents. Plus, if we are responding to some kind of emergency, simply move to another lane and out of our way. Seems pretty like common sense.

* Generators go outside your house and as far away as possible.

* If power goes out, use flashlights, not candles. If you are in an EVAC area, and you choose to stay, your house will not be attended to by the FD if a fire starts. Better not take that chance.

* Got gas? Store it outside and in the open. Don't let fumes build up.

* Charge all of your gadgets. Don't let the kids play Angry Birds.

I was out at 3:00AM looking for anything, but all I found was a lot of long lines at stations that didn't even have gas, or weren't opened at all. Every single station that has/had/or might soon have gas has a line of cars hours long in front of it.

I'm better off than most with half a tank, but I really need some premium for my chainsaw, and will soon need some regular for my truck.

If anyone knows where to get some gas or wants to trade for some, PM me. I can come cut up your downed tree in the Jericho/Plainview/Bethpage/Hicksville area if you have enough gas to make it worth the trip.

Being that I'm a licensed general contractor and the phone is ringing off the hook I expect there will be a lot of work after this storm...the problem is getting gas for the truck to get to the jobs, and pick up materials. Can't do much without fuel.

Stay safe everyone.

(Maps and Donation Info),38,1,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/longisland/comments/12o19g/li_need_blankets_and_food_and_water_storm_is/,"Blankets, blankets, blankets. 

The needs are much broader but with another storm bearing down we need to collect and move as many blankets as possible. Municiples need generators; most inside the affected areas are already in play. Besides gas is still an issue, until its not. Batteries, Flashlights, Candles, Food, Water, Matches, Baby Supplies, Cleaning Supplies, Pumps etc are still in great demand. General Clothing is not needed at many locations.

That said, whoever you are wherever you are, move as many surplus blankets as possible before Wed storm. Share if you can. Donate if you can.

1351913334.0,35,self.longisland,12jsyl,IAMA Lineman for LiPA,47,12,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/longisland/comments/12jsyl/iama_lineman_for_lipa/,"Hello, I'm one of the linemen restoring power. I'm starting some laundry now so I figured I'd do a little PSA. I'm sure most of this is just repeated information, but someone might find it useful.

I'll start with an **overview of the system**

The powerplants generate 3 phases electric at 22000volts (22kv). It's just a way to get 3 times the power per rotation of the generator, the thing to remember is that they are not the same and there is a difference in potential so if they are directly hooked up to each other, there is a large explosion and usually some fire. Anyway, that's why you'll see 3 wires running together at the top of the poles (but not touching each other or the neutral.  That's bad).  So, it's generated at 22kv and is then stepped up to 128kv or 69kv for transmission to the substations. There it's stepped down to distribution primary voltage (7620v or 2400v). These are the wires you see on most main roads on the top of the pole. This is what you tap into to power the transformers on the poles which in turn drop it down to two 120v legs. A transformer will feed about 10-20 houses.  So you might not see us, we might be 10 miles away, but we are working on the wire that feeds your home.  There could be several problems on the line that eventually leads to your weatherhead, you'll only see us when we're finishing up the last 5% of the repairs and finally restoring power.

**How we systematically restore the power:**

I've seen a lot of funny ideas about how we apparently triage customers and hook people up based on the customers need. Yeah, hospitals, fire and police need power, but they all have generators. We'll send out a serviceman to see if they can do anything to get them back on, but that's not what's tying up crews. Your restoration is not being delayed because of hospitals and other more important customers. They often comeback on first because they are closer to the feed. They're big customers and they usually take three phase transformer banks. They are just in line with what gets turned on first. We'd have to go out of our way to keep them off when restoring power to a town. They're just situated better; better engineering to minimize their outages.

So, we basically start at a substation and follow a circuit out from the source. Three-phase primary takes priority because you can pick up the largest number of customers in the shortest amount of time. These main lines often run through towns and many businesses and residential buildings are fed by it. The power is usually out because a safety has tripped. There are big circuit breakers at the substation. If the wire falls down at the end of the line, everyone can lose power. The best solution is to just cut that piece down and dead-end the wire there and turn on 95% of the town. For the firs few days we didn't even look down any side street that was more than a mile long, we just pulled fuses at the main road to isolate those side streets (single phase lines) and kept moving on those main, three phase lines. That's why the number of outages drops so dramatically in the first few days, we simple cut off the problems that caused the circuit to lock out and turn everyone else back on.

Now, once we have most of the easy work done, we start making repairs. Again, we prioritize these based on how long it will take and how many customers it will get back on. If there is a single phase line feeding 100 houses and all we have to do is cut down a tree and put a couple sections of wire back up, that's a no-brainer. We do that right away. Like-wise, if we need to replace a pole and transformer and run 2 sections of secondary (120 volt wires for the house) and we'll only pick up 3 or 4 customers, that is going to be the very last one we do. That is a job that will take 5 or 6 hours. We could turn on 500 customers in that same time.

**Etiquette:**

Ok, you might see us working on your street. We have already ridden around and/or are riding around looking for problems on the wire and fixing it. We make absolutely certain it is safe to energize the lines on your street before we throw in a fuse or switch or tap. Most of the down wires now are de-energized (**Never assume that they are dead!** If your neighbor isn't too bright, they could be back-feeding the whole system with a generator. Transformers work backwards too, they'll turn 120v from a generator into 7620v on that down wire), the last thing we want to do is energize a primary wire hat some kid could touch. Unless you have a wire that is actively sparking or setting something on fire, don't tell us about it. Report it via the annoying automated phone service. If it's something that we can fix, we will, we will always look around before we energize the system. If you saw the problem, we saw it too and it will be addressed.

We are not a tree trim service. Never, ever ask us to cut a branch in your drive-way. This is about the most selfish thing you can do. You are asking us to delay restoring power to a few hundred people for an additional day so we can spend 45 minutes following you and setting up the trucks to cut down a medium-sized branch that you could have gotten with a ladder.

**Never**, ever enter our work-zone. Do not pass the cones. I've already had 2 people come just a couple of feet from having their skulls crushed by a falling tree trunk. There are broken trees balancing on wires. I wouldn't walk under that at all, let alone when 2 people are up in buckets cutting it with chainsaws. Just don't ever approach the trucks when we're working. We can't see everything and it is dangerous under the best conditions. We need to focus on keeping ourselves safe.

Don't ask for an estimate of when your power's coming back on. The answer every time in going to be, ""I don't know"". Until I'm right there at your house, I really don't know. If you live a mile down the road, we might not have been there yet, or it might be a different circuit and we're not going there at all, another crew is working on it.

Please just try to be nice. We've been on mandatory 16-hour shifts since Sunday and it's not going to stop for a while. We literally have 8 hours to go home, shower, sleep, and be back at work. We have linemen who have lost their homes and many who still don't have power or hot water themselves. We're fighting to get gas in those 8 hours too and I'm staying up tonight to do laundry so I can go another 7 days. Guys whose homes took damage are doing whatever repairs they can during their sleep time.  And a week into storm restoration is when we start getting threats and actual physical assaults and people blocking the road refusing to allow us to leave, etc.  So, we tend to get on edge after a bit.

That's about it. Hopefully this helped clear up some of the FAQs. If anyone has any questions, I'll try to answer them tomorrow at lunch.

Edit:  Formatting.

Edit 2:  **Breaks:**

I didn't mean to make oir work day sound so dire.  Inba regular 8 hour shift we get a 15 minute break and a 30 minute meal.  After 10 hours we get an additional meal.  Different crews do it differently, but a lot of us like to take the second meal at the very end so we actually work a 15.5 hour day.  A standard day for us is get in the yard at 6:30 (7:00 at most yards), find ojt what ciecuit you're working, head out and grab coffee/eggs on the way (that's the break).  We work for 5 or 6 hours and then take lunch.  We work until about 9, return to the yard, clean and stock the trucks and take our ""meal"" from 10-10:30.  I'm usually home by 10:40.  So, the day is busy and the work can be hard, but it's not too taxing or exhausting.  We just don't have time to do anything but work and sleep.",,False,self,t5_2qk64,1351997489.0,,,True,t3_12jsyl,http://www.reddit.com/r/longisland/comments/12jsyl/iama_lineman_for_lipa/,

Mind you, I am not a slow driver and usually do +10 to +15 of the limit anyway.  Luckily I was able to get away before the guy got out of his car at a light to cause problems.  It has kind of made me more aware of how people are driving, and it is bad.  I saw someone today pass a truck on a one lane no passing road, and people brighting other drivers for going too slow.  People also generally ignore any of those ""do not block driveway"" signs which causes problems by my job.  I even saw someone drive on the sidewalk just to make a right turn.  Oddly enough none of this occurred during rush hour.

Here's a list of Representatives here that voted YES to CISPA:


[Tim Bishop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Bishop), D- First District


[Steve Israel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Israel), D- Second District


[Peter King](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_T._King), R- Third District


[Carolyn McCarthy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolyn_McCarthy), D- Fourth District


[Bob Turner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Turner_(politician), R- Ninth District


[Ed Towns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Towns
), D- Tenth District


[Michael Grim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Grimm_(politician ), R- Thirteenth District

**update:** [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/swrf1/cispa_is_unconstitutional/) from r/technology shows how CISPA is unconstitutional.  I plan on posting this on our rep's Facebook pages and tweeting it to them using twitlonger.  Granted, the best thing to do is to **call** the reps and senators to show our outrage in this, but it could maybe at least cause some people to see the truth before you are most likely blocked.  Do it in a professional manner though.  Like GunToForehead stated, they voted yes out of ignorance and anything that might appear as antiterrorism on the outside gets voted on.  Granted, I'd bet Peter King is probably salivating at the mouth for this, as that fucker just can't wait to have his hands in everyone's personal business.  My rep, Tim Bishop, is at times, a scared corporate tool.

This Friday at 7:00pm at the Ethical Humanist Society on Old Country Road in Garden City we are hosting an event sponsored by ""There Is No Limit Foundation"". 

There Is No Limit Foundation non-profit organization fighting global poverty, gender inequalities and diseases. They work alongside poor women and children to equip them with the proper tools they need to change their lives, those of their families and communities. The show will raise money for the ""No Water = No Grain"" campaign which collects funds to build wells which deliver clean drinking water and promotes agriculture; providing food and establishing an economy.

We're really excited about the event itself and hope this reddit post can reach anyone with nothing to do on Friday night (or with a few extra dollars to put towards clean water!)

The lineup is four long island acts:
 
* [Hotel of the Laughing Tree](http://hotelofthelaughingtree.bandcamp.com/) [Brookvale Records]
* [The Oogey Boogeys](https://www.facebook.com/theoogeyboogeys)
* [Bears and Motorcycles](http://www.bearsandmotorcycles.com/) 
* [Breathing East](http://www.breathingeast.com/)

There will also be raffles and baked goodies!

-The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States

Neighbors, 

The revelation of the NSA's PRISM surveillance software is just the latest blow from the Federal Government in the continual attack on our civil liberties. 

We are supposed to be free from fear of illegal search and seizure without a warrant derived from probable cause. From DUI checkpoints, to Stop and Frisk, to forced removal of blood on Tennesee drivers, the 4th Amendment has been trampled time and time again. Well, the news about phone monitoring and PRISM is the anchor which broke the camel's back. 

Some of us are just plain old fed up and we are going to let our displeasures be known. Please join us as we try to educate, inform, engage, and exercise our right and obligation to peacefully protest an ever reaching government which is intent on maintining the status quo of control. 

Our first meeting is Weds night at 8 pm in Washington Sq Park, where we will be structuring, organizing, informing, dyving up tasks and more.  Please join us as we take our inalienable rights back.

Looking forward to meeting you.

I'd like to get everything squared away ASAP so there's no confusing as to when/where plus any details. 

**Where:** [Heckscher State Park](http://nysparks.com/parks/136/details.aspx) Field 1, East Islip, NY 11730.  Entrance fee for cars this time of year is $10 per car, though anyone who has the Empire Pass can get in for free. (It's a $65 seasonal pass to state parks.) I've never been there myself, so if anyone knows a good SPECIFIC place in Heckscher (AKA which field to specify for us Redditors), please leave a comment!

**When:** July 14th 1:00 PM. 

**Why:** Why Heckscher Park? It was discussed in a previous post a lot of people have interest in a park/BBQ setting, and it has an open container policy, which makes those who can drink happy as well. It is in a decently centralized area on LI, so those coming from both Nassau and Suffolk shouldn't have too much trouble getting there. If anyone would like to car pool, post your interest here.

**What:** I thought it would be a good idea to create a list of stuff people can bring to help lower the costs of the meet-up, that way we'll all be spending just a small portion of the actual total. I'll make a small list here of what I think would be a good starter, and if anyone has anything else they'd like to add, comment! If you see something on this list you want to contribute yourself, comment on this post so others can see it's been taken, it just makes it easier. 

If you see something in bold, we do not need it anymore.

If you saw the train wreck which was me trying to get the stuff to bring into bullet points, I apologize. &gt;.&gt; Formatting is not working with me right now. 

Please be aware! Even though there will be alcohol there, anyone going MUST respect the laws of the state and the park, which means: **anyone under 21 *cannot* drink.** It's not to diminish any of the fun of the meet-up, we just need to make sure no one gets in trouble. 

**TL;DR:** Stop being lazy and read it, you bums. It's meet up info! Important stuff here.

I am sorry for the wall of text though, I really just wanted to get everything in order. If you have any questions or concerns, please comment or PM me! I'll be online just about all day today and I check in every day otherwise, so I'll get back to everyone ASAP. I'm looking forward to getting together with everyone~ 

**IMPORTANT!** Date is set. Anyone who is going to come, PLEASE comment with what you want to bring, or edit your comment you already posted. Most of the things are under 5 bucks, so if everyone brings at least one thing it won't be expensive at all, so I'd really like everyone to at least try to bring something to the meet-up. Thanks! 

Also, as for what we'll be doing, does anyone have any frisbees or anything? There's a beach there too, so maybe we could all bring our bathing suits or something. There's a lot to do~

**Update: Who?** I did a headcount. So far we'll have ~30 people coming to the meet-up. Just... Wow. I'm super excited! Also, the only things we really NEED right now is the charcoal and the ice for the coolers. If need be, I can pick up some ice before the meet-up, but I'm clueless about the charcoal. 

**Update #2** It's tomorrow everyone! We're so close and everyone's been so cooperative. I mean... Look at the list, we've got everything we need, and just about everything on the list.

Since the storm, companies from outside of Long Island have been attempting to enter the market here, without regard to the actual wellbeing of the homeowner's pockets, or without regard to the permitting process in New York, which is pretty unique in comparison to other states. In short, they are price gouging and reckless, and people are desperate to begin the repair process, so they do not get second quotes for the jobs they need done on their homes.

I am frantically searching for jobs, and have not had any luck in this area, causing me to not be able to make money to better my situation. I have $263 in my bank account, and if anyone is willing to help me get on my feet, I will give you that money for a place to stay in NY.

I can't help but notice legally nothing is being done to contain this problem. I haven't heard of one instance where a heroin dealer has been arrested in my neighborhood, nor in any where I know residents. I can't help but crave the need to organize something in attempts to run this drug out of our Island. It seriously has gone far enough, and the police put little to no efforts in doing anything about it. But of course, when an officer catches a kid smoking weed they fully crack down on the weed dealers for a drug that isn't even killing anyone. I mean sure, people make their own decisions on whether or not to purchase and do the drug, in most cases the dealers don't force anyone to do it. I remember when Long Island was actually considered a good place of living, despite towns like Wyandanch. So at least for the sake of the future generations to come, and for the sake of anyone who is intending to start a family here action needs to be taken about this heroin epidemic, and since like I said the police seem to do little to nothing about it, I feel like we the residents should take matters into our own hands. 

I doubt anyone will take this seriously, or even care about the cause and the reason I have the current urge to rally people. But at least think about it and look at the nightmare it's letting loose before you consider inputting your opinion. If any of you do like the idea of rallying against Heroin, we'll work out how to do so when plausible ways of fulling this cause are laid out. If you don't intend on taking this seriously, please move along to the next post.

Now I'm back after ten years away. I've returned to my old family home in Massapequa to avoid taking out student loans as I get my masters degree in the city. Massapequa hasn't changed much, in fact the only major changes I've noticed is all the gas stations are gone, and they changed the mural on the high school next to the bagel store. The only thing that seems to have changed is me: I'm 28-years-old, and all my old friends are gone, moved off the island like I did.

I'm just wondering how you guys spend your free time and meet people. Or do you just go into the city for everything, because that's how I've been spending most of my leisure time since getting here.

Also overrated is All American Burger. To me it tasted like big White Castle Burgers. Never been a big fan. I guess it's comparable for the price.

Underrated is Thom Thom in Wantagh. The steak I had there was really good and the spicy shrimp was amazing. Bit of a limited menu and a higher price point but the food was amazing. Never even HEARD of it prior to eating there.

Legally speaking, I have been getting completely fucked for the past 2.5 years and it’s gotten so completely out of hand that I have no idea who to turn to.  I’m completely out of money and options, so why not type up my story and see if anyone on the internet has any suggestions?  So here it is, the whole story, right from the very beginning:

Oct 2011 – 
My birthday.  An old friend is in town and offers to buy me a beer for my 27th.  He had taken the train in, so I pick him up and we go to John Harvard’s.  I have three beers over the course of a little over two hours.  We decide it’s time to head back home.  

I get pulled over on Montauk Highway by a cop who claims I was “serving all over the road”.  He puts me through some field sobriety tests and then finally gives me a Breathalyzer.  

I blow a .04.  Less than half the legal limit.  Home free, right?

Wrong.  The officer then begins to accuse me of smoking marijuana (I hadn’t).  He suddenly starts saying that he can smell it, and for some odd reason demands to check my tongue.  He claims it’s green (seriously, google ‘green tongue’ and prepare to be dumbfounded).  He searches me and my friend and turns my car upside down looking for drugs or paraphernalia, but finds nothing.  But no big deal, he goes ahead and arrests me anyway.

At the police station, he gives me an ultimatum:  either submit to a blood test, or lose my license immediately, without a trial (yes, this is legal and par for the course apparently).  Thinking I have nothing to hide, as I had kept my drinking to a minimum and hadn’t done any other drugs, I let them take my blood.

I spend my birthday weekend in a jail cell and get arraigned on Monday morning.  I’m being charged with DUI.

Dec 2011 –
After many postponed court dates, the blood test results finally come back.  My BAL was a .03. 
The test also detected “Less than 1.0 mcg/L Tetrahydrocannabinol,” an extremely low dose of THC.  I smoke weed occasionally, the most recent occasion being about five days before this arrest.  It can take over a month for even just a few hits of marijuana to be completely filtered from your blood, and if there is any amount in there whatsoever, you are legally considered “under the influence”.

There’s also this little stipulation in the law that nobody seems to talk about:  apparently, having ANY blood-alcohol level combined with ANY amount of ANY other substance is considered a full-blown DUI, no different from driving around totally smashed with a .18.

Therefore, I was guilty of a DUI.

A long and costly legal battle ensued, but thankfully I ended up getting a pretty decent guy as a judge (he even remarked that the “less than 1 mcg/L THC was by far the lowest number he had ever seen on a toxicology report, and that he had no idea it could even go so low).  

September 2012 -
After many months of court dates and costly, court mandated counseling, I was sentenced to a DWAI, or Driving while Ability Impaired, a traffic violation that is considered MUCH less severe than a DUI conviction.  Phew!

So it seemed I had gotten lucky (finally).  I was sentenced to a $800 fine and a 90-day suspension of my license.

It was finally over... at least that’s what I thought.

I tutor for a living, so I needed to be driving almost constantly.  To that end, I needed to go to the DMV to purchase a conditional license that would allow me to travel back and forth to work during my suspension.  Fair enough.

While I was there, they offered me the chance to take a “DDP” class (Drinking Driver Program) that would meet once a week at Stony Brook University for 7 weeks, after which I could get my full license back.  It was 300 bucks, but it would effectively cut my suspension period in half, so I figured it would be worth it.

I could not have been more wrong.  Signing up for that class turned out to be quite possibly the worst decision I have ever made.  If you or anyone you know winds up in similar circumstances, DO NOT EVER SIGN UP FOR THIS PROGRAM!  What I’m about to tell you is going to sound like some kind of warped joke or gross exaggeration, but I swear it’s all true.

So I go to the class, back and forth every week to Stony Brook.   Turns out, the classroom is only half the package – the other half is getting a “treatment provider,” basically a counselor that you meet with outside of class for High School health class-type lectures on drugs and alcohol.  I don’t have any health insurance, so I am forced to cough up $200 per week for sessions with this guy.  They never told me about any of this up front at the DMV, so this class is starting to seem like more money than it’s worth, but whatever… it’s almost over.  Right?

Halloween 2012.  The last day of class.  The instructor personally meets with each student, one by one, and goes over a checklist with them to make sure they have done everything they need to in order to complete the program.  He meets with me, checks everything off, and tells me I’m done.  All I have to do is go home and wait for a “certificate of completion” to arrive in the mail, which I can then take to the DMV to get my license back early.

So that’s what I do.  I go home and wait… but it doesn’t come.  Weeks go by… eventually, the full 90-day period of my suspension had passed, so I go down to the DMV and get it back on those grounds.  So the class did absolutely nothing for me.  All that money I spent on it seemed wasted, but hey, I got my license back now, so whatever.  As long as it’s all finally over with, I’m not gonna complan.  All is fine for several months.

April 2013 –
Out of completely fucking nowhere, I get a letter in the mail telling me my license is suspended effective immediately because I “Failed to attend the Drinking Driver Program”.  So not only did taking this class not help me get my license back even a day early, but now it was actually working against me, being used as grounds to take my license away from me again.  I couldn’t believe what I was reading, but at the same time I was certain that it must have been due to some kind of simple clerical error, so I plan to go to the DMV as soon as possible to get it resolved.  In the meantime, I need to keep driving to work.  This is THE season for standardized tests and I have a lot of students who are depending on me for help.

I go to the DMV the next Monday.  I talk to several people and basically get the runaround.  They tell me that it’s all up to the DDP people, that if there was an error it was on their end, and that I need to take it up with them.  “But I ended up waiting the full 90-day suspension period,” I tell them.  “Doesn’t that make this whole class a moot point anyway?”  Nope!  Turns out, once you sign up for DDP, you NEED to complete DDP if you EVER want your license back… even if it takes the rest of your life.  Awesome.

Here’s where it starts getting really messed up.

If you look into contacting the DDP people, you’ll find that they only accept calls during very particular hours on very particular days of the week.  But no problem, my schedule is flexible, so I free myself up for all of those particular hours and call them as soon as I can.

An automated message greets me, fairly typical.  Basic information about the course, website address, some easy listening.  Please hold to speak with a representative.

The message repeats, exactly the same.  No numbers to press to reach different departments or anything.  Please hold to speak with a representative.

It repeats exactly four times, and then it HANGS UP ON YOU.   EVERY SINGLE TIME.  I brute force dialed this number during every minute of their “operating hours” for a full week, and this is the only thing that ever happened.  Seriously, try it yourself.  Look up the number and try to contact them.  I also tried pressing every number and symbol, but none of them did anything.  Their phone number is just a total fucking dead end.

The only other means of contact they provide is an email address.  I have sent them many emails, and have never received a response.  I have gone to their offices at Stony Brook, and have always found them locked.  I have seen other instructors teaching classes much like the ones I went to, but they just shrug their shoulders and refer me to the website.  No straight answers, no help whatsoever.  Nobody knows anything.

Meanwhile, while driving to my tutoring sessions, I get pulled over no less than THREE TIMES IN TWO DAYS on May 1st and 2nd.  Each cop walks up to my car with full knowledge of my suspended license (they ran the plates).  I try giving them the short version of the story I have typed out here so far, but I still end up with a mountain of tickets for driving with a suspended license.  They make me late for all my sessions and in one case actually pull me over directly in front of my students’ houses.  Fun times. 

 The third cop tells me that I can’t keep driving, even if my suspension is due to some clerical error, because next time I get pulled over they are going to impound my car.  It’s now becoming clear that this is not going to be resolved quickly or easily.  I’m going to need to go back to the DMV for another one of those conditional licenses so I can get back and forth to work without being harassed.  So I go back to the DMV, apply for a conditional license and… GUESS WHAT?!  PEOPLE WITH ‘DELINQUINT STATUSES’ WITH THE DDP PROGRAM ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR A CONDITIONAL LICENSE.  At this point it is looking very unlikely that I will ever be able to drive in New York State again.  So with nobody to drive me around, no access to a functional public transportation system, ridiculously overpriced taxis and clients that are way too far to walk or ride a bike to, I AM FORCED TO QUIT MY JOB.

And I still can’t get ANYBODY from the DDP organization to talk to me whatsoever.  Completely out of options, I just start riding my bike to the DMV and hanging out there all day, demanding at least some sort of direction on what the FUCK I am supposed to do to get myself out of this situation.  

Finally, I meet a very helpful woman who claims that she knows someone who works in the DDP office.  She says she can call that person first thing the next day and get an answer for me.  Finally!

Sure enough, the next day she gives me a call back and says that they told her I had “failed” the class because they “referred me to further treatment that I had never completed”.  First of all, this is completely in contradiction to the letter they sent me which claimed that they suspended me because I “did not attend the DDP class”, and secondly, NOBODY EVER TOLD ME THAT I WAS REFERRED FOR FURTHER TREATMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE!  Last this I heard from them was that I was DONE.  How the hell am I supposed to know about this extra treatment bullshit if they don’t inform me of it in any way whatsoever?   I share these points of contention with her in a more politely phrased manner, but she once again gives me the all-too-familiar response of “there’s nothing I can do about it.”

So here I am, three years after making the truly evil choice to drive with a .03 BAL after having smoked weed a week beforehand, with a completely ruined life to show for it.  They have taken away every dollar I had ever saved, and every dollar I have earned since.  They have taken away my ability to drive indefinitely and for no clear or consistent reason.  They have left me forcibly unemployed, penniless and without any idea whatsoever on how to resolve the situation.  The overall goal of the Drinking Driver Program is to turn addicts into functional members of society, but it seems to me that they do a much better job of doing the exact opposite.  With no job, no money, and absolutely no hope for the future, I don’t see any reason why I shouldn’t be polishing off shots of cheap tequila as I write this. 

If ANYBODY out there has ANY connections to any of these programs or has ANY idea what the fuck I can do about this situation, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF CHRIST let me know.  Because I am ready to lose my mind.  Thanks for reading my shitty story.







**5/10 Update  -**

Wow, thanks for all the supportive responses!  I'm not sure if there's a way to 'reply all' on reddit or if I just have to hope you all check back here.

The only update as of now is that I'm going to see my lawyer about all this on Wednesday.  As someone said before this has gone beyond DIY and seems to be out of my hands entirely.  I have been able to get rides to most of my tutoring appointments from friends and family, and everyone in general has been really helpful and understanding.  So, there is a lot to stay positive about.  I will keep you guys updated on the situation as events warrant.  Thanks for caring!

&gt; Can you explain what it is you were saying about outpatient bullshit?

They won't tell you when you sign up for DDP, but the actual classes are only ""half"" the requirements for passing it.  The other half is you finding and hiring a ""treatment provider"" that is licensed with OASAS (Office of Alcohol and Substance Abuse Services).  If you don't have health insurance, sessions with these treatment providers can be very expensive for what basically amounts to a high school health class.  Your goal here is to get them to sign off and fill out a DS-449 form and fax it to the DDP offices.  As far as what you need to get them to sign off or how many sessions you need to go to until they do, it's completely up to them.  Until they fax that in, you're not done with DDP and you can't get your license back.

Another tip for you: about halfway through the classes, they're going to make you take a short survey to determine if you should be ""referred for additional treatment."" Obviously, you don't want that.

I had just come back from finishing college, so when the survey asked how many different places I had lived in the past 5 years, I truthfully answered ""over 3"". WRONG ANSWER, DRUG ADDICT!

The second mistake was truthfully answering the question ""How many jobs have you had in the past five years?"" Well, I had two jobs at college and two jobs after I came home so BZZZT TOO MANY JOBS, YOU MUST BE A DRUG ADDICT! NO GRAY AREA THERE! BACK TO ADDICTION THERAPY, YOU FILTHY LOWLIFE!

This is a possible reason why they are now claiming that they ""referred me to additional treatment,"" even though the instructor took me aside right after said survey, allowed me to explain my situation and told me that he understood and wouldn't refer me and even though nobody ever informed me of any such referral.

Don't make my mistake, lie on the survey if you have to because it is fucking bullshit.

[Frisky Floyd](http://i.imgur.com/O2e9ZEm) was recently abandoned at a feral colony I help to feed. We--his primary caregiver and I--want to get him off the street asap. He's too friendly, which can be dangerous (due to people being sick bastards and his location being in a somewhat dicey area).

He is on the north shore in Nassau. Super sweet, cuddly, less than a year old, gets along great with other cats.

If you are registered with a local shelter to foster cats, pls IM me. Food and litter included for the foster parent.

Or, perhaps we can skip right to the adoption. That would be sweet. Remember how I mentioned that people are sick bastards? For that reason, I will check the background and home of anyone who wants to adopt. Also, to protect Frisky Floyd from being sold to a buncher, a $35 donation to one of three local shelters is required.

Whether or not it will really hit bad, that isn't why I'm here. Below I've listed some tips and pleas I give that make all of 911-services easier for us to operate in.

1. Cars in your driveway. If it's on the street, it could be hit by another car or a truck. If it's bad enough, one of the FD's WILL break into your car and put it in neutral and push it away. They are not responsible for your car.

2. If you are asked to leave, **LEAVE.** If you do choose to stay in a mandatory evacuation, no one will come when you call 911. For the most part, only police will remain in service in evac areas. Power will also go out most likely.

3. Plenty of shelters out there for you, take advantage of them.

4. If you are driving wherever, please be very careful and drive extra slow. Everyone is on edge, and we don't want accidents. Plus, if we are responding to some kind of emergency, simply move to another lane and out of our way. Seems pretty like common sense.

5. Generators go outside your house and as far away as possible. 

6. If power goes out, use flashlights, not candles. If you are in an EVAC area, and you choose to stay, your house will not be attended to by the FD if a fire starts. Better not take that chance.

7. Got gas? Store it outside and in the open. Don't let fumes build up.

8. Charge all of your gadgets. Don't let the kids play Angry Birds.

There's plenty more to know, but it is all pretty common sense. Just thought I'd share it. ",,False,self,t5_2qk64,False,,,True,t3_1293da,http://www.reddit.com/r/longisland/comments/1293da/some_tips_and_pleas_from_a_first_responder/,

The idea would be to get cheap warehouse space in Yaphank/Riverhead area, be open 8a – 5p daily or by reservation to begin. I would lease the equipment and charge a fee for membership to use the equipment. 


Some of the equipment I had in mind were:

* CNC Machine
* Laser Cutter
* Water jet
* Photo Printing and Sign Making Equipment
* Photo Copiers and Printers
* Bend/Press/Brake for light metal working
* Spot Welders
* Powder Coating Equipment
* Equipment for small electronic board manufacturing and prototyping
* Pick and Place Machine (really pushing it here)


Other things I am interested in combining into this place would include:

* Small private offices ($500/month with services)
* Lounge for Cigar Smoking (personal interest here)
* Gaming Lounge
* Colocation Hosting (simple hosting, with Optimum Lightpath)


This is an overview, but I would like to know if there was anybody like me out there that  might be interested in a place like this.

We've lived there for two and a half years now, and we're steadily trying to save up to buy a house.  When we moved in, the landlady was great, kept the place up, was really on it.

About a year ago, she passed away, and the house has passed to her son.  He has slowly let the whole place go downhill.  Several times over the winter he let the heating oil run out, where we woke up with no heat or hot water.  He had his power shut off for a day or two because of over a grand he owed to LIPA.  I hear shouting matches downstairs with his girlfriend, and have to wear earplugs at night sometimes to keep the noise out.

We're terrified he's going to lose the house.  We could move, but we only have so much saved up, which isn't enough to buy a house yet.  In fact, moving costs at this point would put us back at square one saving up for a down payment and closing costs.  I'm pretty sure we can rule out getting any of our deposit money back when we leave as well.  My husband and I are in such a good place financially, but we're so scared that it could ALL be taken away by one irresponsible person.

My question is: what's the best course of action here?  We've projected saving up enough money by about a year from now to be able to purchase, but we don't know if we have a year.

EDIT: I should add that we've met with CDC, and do not qualify for any grants toward purchasing a house.

All over the world, people are preparing themselves to make their voices heard and see their demands met as we move forward into this new, unexplored era where it means the difference between a future each person lives in fear of constant surveillance and a future where each person is able to express their creative and ideological perspective without fear.

City-folk, Long Islanders, Jersey-folk, Connecticuteers, and others, tomorrow is the day where we can come out and show our loved ones, neighbors, and friends just how important it is to be out there with us. Tomorrow is a day where we can send out the message that resonates deeply within all of us as human beings: we are all in this thing together, and the only way we'll make it out alive is if we stick together.

For those of you who might not be able to make the trip because of distance considerations, post your info here and we'll try and get some ride-shares going.

Depending on the source it's said that they will now be re-evaluating rates monthly instead of yearly which means they could potentially up the rates $10 each month.

Firstly, I am sorry to spam r/longisland with posts about the meetup. I just wanted to make sure that the people who didn't join the meetup groups (on Reddit gifts or meetup.com) were still reminded about the meetup tomorrow in Farmingdale.

I'm a Long Islander born and raised, and a Redditor for about a year. I'm from Kings Park, and I did live off of Long Island for about 4 years, and I know that a lot of people on Long Island (as compared to other places I've lived) say that there's nothing to do. I noticed in the past few days, the # of posts about this topic has seemed to be on the rise, presumably as people are getting out of school, and time is freeing up, more boredom is setting in. 

Now, as a 23 year old, I understand the financial restraints many of us are probably facing when it comes to not being able to find stuff to do. However, I myself work for a website catering to Long Island events, happenings, and businesses that is relaunching early next year - so I have had the privilege of finding out many of the things to do around here.

My question to everyone is: What is the issue with finding things to do on Long Island? Is it that you don't have a comprehensive resource or guide to turn to to look for things? Is it a money situation where you're only looking to spend minimally, so you're not looking to dine out? Is there something you would find particularly helpful in coming up with fun stuff to do locally? 

The reason I ask is because I am doing exactly this for work right now - putting together the best things to do, places to go, dining, and entertainment on Long Island. It seems to be a common theme for LIers that there is nothing to do, when really, compared to most of the country there is a hell of a lot more to do, and a lot of it is very available most of the time. 

I'm just trying to help you guys out, and I also want to make sure that when the new design of the site launches, it's everything Long Island is looking for. I think we've certainly achieved that, and I am very proud of what we are putting together right now. 

That being said, anyone looking for anything LI, let me know, and I will do my best to help. Thank you for your input - this is something that is important to me both as a resident, and in a professional sense.

Harrington, and I’m running for Suffolk County Legislator in the 14th District. I’m a progressive Democrat, and I was a member of a transit union for over thirty years. I became the shop steward for my union, and used that title to shield my fellow union members from oftentimes unfair and unjust management. I understand the needs of the working class, because I am working class. I will fight for the common man, because government derives its power from the governed.

I chose to run for this office because, in short, I’ve grown tired of politicians without policies. I’m exhausted from hearing stories about corruption, and the power of special interests. I’m fatigued from watching our children be locked out of success. I’m sick of watching the income inequality gap grow, as our working class works harder just to hold on to what they have.

When looking at those who are suffering in poverty, it is always easier to convince yourself that you are powerless to help, or that you need to take care of yourself first, or that they must have made terrible decisions in order to be in that situation. It’s no secret, however, that the easiest path isn’t necessarily the best one. I want to be your representative in the Suffolk County Legislature, and if you elect me, I can promise you that I will never take the easy way out.

We have a large site in mind and I figured we could all meet up, order a few pizzas, bring some hand or cordless jig saws and build one or two of these things in a few hours. I figure they are about 40 pieces or so and if everyone gets a piece we can finish in a few hours. 

Then we can donate it to a school, crush it in a giant car crusher or drop it from a crane. Whatever the majority vote wanted. 

Opinions?

Edit 1: if we want to make it easier we can also build the dino from 1"" foam and use hot wire to cut it. Then the pieces will cut like butter and much faster. Maybe we could build 2?

""RavenCon"" is a store mini-con run by the [Long Island Role Players](http://www.meetup.com/longislandroleplayers/) and hosted by [Ravenblood Games](http://www.ravenbloodgames.com/) in Plainview, NY, from March 22nd to March 24th. 

**Friday night from 6pm - 10pm**

*Ars Magica*, *Savage Worlds*, and *Ascension* are running.

**Saturday morning from 10am - 2pm**

We've got some open tables if you want to run a board game, or just want to come hang out and see who shows up for a pickup game.

*Fiasco* is also running, and is one of my personal favorites. I really encourage you to try it!

**Saturday afternoon from 3pm - 7pm**

*Metal, Magic &amp; Lore* is going to be run by the game's author, Vito Pandolfo. This is a GREAT opportunity to play an amazing game with the designer!

*Conspiracy X* and *Steve Jackson Games* like Munchkin and Revolution are also running.

**Saturday night from 8pm - midnight**

*All Flesh Must be Eaten* and *Hunter: The Vigil* need a few more victims... I mean players!

**Sunday afternoon from 12pm - 4pm**

*Game of Thrones: The Board Game*, *Savage Worlds: Slipstream* and *Pathfinder: Shadowfall* are running.

**Sunday evening from 4pm - 8pm**

Sunday evening is wide open for open gaming! Bring your favorite board game and let's try something new! 

If you're thinking of coming out, then you should join the [Long Island Role Players](http://www.meetup.com/longislandroleplayers/) meetup and RSVP for the events to make sure you have a seat at the tables! There will also be at least one open gaming table available during the weekend to play something from the store's library of demo games.

(moreover - can we spare turning this thread into a huge pro/anti gun debate?)


[Link](http://www.longislandfirearms.com/forum/m-1343662443/)

&gt;Ronkonkoma, NY- Long Island Firearms, New York's foremost on-line firearms enthusiast community, has helped file a petition against Nassau County to ensure your rights are not infringed. ""This is a step in the right direction"" says Steven Blair. He continues to say ""As the rise in Nassau County Pistol License applications continue, it's important that the County fulfills its obligation to ensure the process takes the proper time frame. Waiting over a year is unacceptable.""

&gt;The Police Commissioner of Nassau County is refusing to process pistol license applications of Nassau County residents within the six-month time frame mandated by Penal Law § 400.00 (4-a). The Police Commissioner's refusal constitutes a willful and purposeful violation of New York State law.

&gt;Thomas V. Dale, as the Police Commissioner of Nassau County, is the statutorily designated ""licensing officer"" within Nassau County, pursuant to Penal Law § 400.00.  As the said licensing officer, the Police Commissioner is vested with the statutory authority to issue or deny pistol licenses within Nassau County. 

&gt;In a letter sent to the Petitioners, the Police Commissioner stated that he is aware of the six month deadline cited by Penal Law § 400.00 (4-a), but he believes it is “…not a firm deadline,” and indicates he is not bound by such laws. In the same letter, the Police Commissioner sought to rationalize the delay, stating that “In recent years due to the downsizing of our Department the pistol unit has operated with fewer personnel. This situation has created a backlog of pistol applications which have not been determined within six months of their submission to the pistol unit.” The Police Commissioner also states that he does not believe that “…meet[ing] a six month administrative deadline would further the public safety interests of Nassau County.” 

&gt;Clearly, by his words and actions, the Police Commissioner is knowingly and willfully refusing to follow state law; and he has made clear that his decision to disregard the law is calculated, premeditated and deliberate.

&gt;In light of this situation, Long Island Firearms together with LI Second Amendment Preservation Association, Inc. had put together a questionnaire in which citizens who applied for a Nassau County Pistol License and were waiting over the six month period to come forward. Due to the overwhelming response, the group came together with Murtha and Murtha PLLC to take legal action.  Long Island Firearms and LI Second Amendment Preservation Association, Inc. solely financially supported this latest petition.

&gt;The petitions filed today are seeking an order from a Nassau County Supreme Court Judge requiring the Police Commissioner to perform his mandated duty, under existing law, to process the pistol license applications of Nassau County residents within the six-month timeframe required by New York State Penal Law § 400.00 (4-a).

&gt;**What is Section 400.00?**

&gt;*Section 400.00 (4-a) of the Penal Law establishes a six-month time frame for the issuance of pistol licenses. Added in 1980, the purpose of the addition of Subdivision 4-a of the New York State Penal Law was made quite clear. It was designed to provide for the expeditious processing of pistol licensing requests. It apparently had been the practice of some gun licensing authorities to prescribe only a few times during the year when applications for licenses would be accepted, and to delay for periods of more than a year the processing of such applications and the decisions thereon. Subdivision four-a was added to compel the immediate acceptance of license applications, and action thereon within six months (McKinney’s 400.00 [4-a] L.1980, cc. 233 and 234; State of New York Executive Chamber memorandum filed with Assembly Bill Number 11309, NYLS Governor’s Bill Jacket, 1980 Chapter 233.) “[Section 4-a] is a great help to the thousands of legal applicants in New York City who must wait eighteen months for an answer to their applications.” (Brief Summary of Provision of Bill A.11309, supra.)*

Some Nassau residents are facing delays of up to 14 months from their time of applying, even though penal code says 6 month max. It is about time they were called out on it.

First this, then on to the ""TARGET/HUNTING/SPORTSMAN"" restrictions they illegally place on carry licenses (especially in a post Woolard v. Sheridan world)

*note* - as you might know - NYS issues two types of licences as per section 400 of the penal code. Carry and Premise. Unless you are in NYC, you have a license to carry according to the law, however they stamp it with an ink pad and tell you that you can only do so when going to or from the range. There is no legal teeth to this, and at most your license can be suspended/revoked. These ""restrictions"" do nothing to deter crime, as the people licensed to have/carry handguns in NY undergo one of the most rigorous background checks and application process in the entirety of the US (4 non-family/non-law enforcement references, mental health screening, FBI background check, fingerprinting, the works), and they are not the ones adding to gun violence nor gun crime.


Anywho - thought some of you might like to know. Cheers!

WheatonWill and I have been discussing it the past few days, so I thought I'd make a post.

First of all, we'd need to reserve a spot soon, since apparently group spots are going pretty quickly/already limited. We're going to try to keep on the island and like last meet up, minimize costs, so a group spot is the best way to go here. Right now we're looking at **Smith's Point**, **Indian Island**, **Blydenburg**, and **Cedar Point**.

There's a few things we need to consider when picking a place. First, as stated before, price. Second, what is available. We were thinking of a **Friday-Sunday** trip, which should be good for most people. Third, the activities we'll be to do there. I personally would like to be near a nice beach, and go hiking for a bit. For those it concerns, alcohol is generally not allowed at these places, but if it's kept out in the open and you don't cause any havoc, the park rangers will generally be cool about it. 

With this discussion I'd like to see who is interested in going, the opinions people have on which place to camp, and what equipment/stuff everyone will be bringing/will want to bring.

Please keep in mind that the date we choose and what days will most likely be a result of the most popular/the majority of the people that can go, so some people may not be able to. I apologize in advance, but it's the fairest way to plan. 

Another note: We need to plan this quite soon, and we're looking to book this for 3-4 weeks from now. 

Also, we need to know who has green keys! This is VERY important as it could save us all a lot of money. 

So go ahead! Comment with what you lovely Long Islanders think.

I moved here from elsewhere a couple years ago.  One of the things I frequently get a craving for is a good Italian sub (or hero as some people call them here).  I am in the Port Jeff area and have utterly failed to find anything that really satisfies that craving.  Given the relative prevalence of Italians and delis on the island, I am a bit surprised, but maybe I am looking in the wrong places.  So I came here to tap the collective wisdom of Reddit.

However, you should know that I'm pretty picky about my Italian sandwiches (call me a snob if you will).  Here are the basics of what I am looking for when I say ""Italian sandwich"":

* mortadella (absolutely required)
* capicolla (absolutely required)
* salami (absolutely required)
* prosciutto (optional *in addition to* the above, **not** instead of)
* pepperoni (optional *in addition to* the above, **not** instead of)
* provolone
* lettuce
* tomato
* pickles
* onion (optional)
* salt, pepper (optional)
* oregano (optional)
* olive oil &amp; vinegar
* [hots](http://www.dutchvalleyfoods.com/images/products/detail/pic2/445435.jpg) preferably or banana peppers (optional)

There are a lot of differences in opinion when it comes to these things, but for me this is it.  To me, bologna is not an acceptable substitute for mortadella.  Ham is not a substitute for capicolla.  American ""cheese"" can't replace provolone.  Mayo can't replace oil &amp; vinegar.  These similar-but-not sandwiches are good, but they're not the thing that I get cravings for.  I'd ask for freshly baked bread (and the bread/meat/cheese portions to be oven-toasted), but I know that I'd be pushing it.

The other nit-picky thing is that it's gotta be substantially closer than the city where I already **know** there are great sandwiches.  If there's some place that's *pretty good* in Jericho or something, I'm just going to drive to Graham Meats &amp; Deli in Brooklyn (which I highly recommend by the way).

Anyway, if anyone has any recommendations, I'd be happy to check them out.  Tough work, but someone's gotta do it.

I couldn't think of a better place to put this. I've seen some pretty great things happen on reddit and I have hope that you guys will be able to help me to the best of your abilities. Feel free to suggest anything. I'll give you a little back story then dive into what i'm looking for.

In my house, we currently have 6 cats ranging from 4 years old to 17 years old. We've been able to take on the mess they've been making, but this year it started to be overwhelming. As they age there is more and more mess to clean up and me and my mom can't keep up with it. We have to put the eldest down soon. The rest of them are very unique cats, all have very strong personalities. 

We came to the conclusion that need to get rid of more than one cat and we don't have the heart to put them down for no reason, and I can't live with them going into an adoption center because there's no guarantee that they will find a home and I don't want them going from a home to a cage and end up dying in there. 

We have chosen our cat Noel to be the one who needs to be taken out. She is a very sweet cat. She came from a rough upbringing so is very skittish, almost to the point where you might not see her for a while. But when she warms up to you she is so lovable and kind.

The one downside to her is she has been continuously sick since the day we got her. She always has a clogged nose and is sneezing a lot and has a hard time breathing at times. You can imagine the amount of snot we find on windows! Her symptoms may worsen sporadically throughout the year, but luckily, she always comes back ""full"" health. We have never been able to take her to the vet due to money being too tight and I've never been happy about that.

I am looking for a home for her. Ideally I would like her to be somewhere where she can be looked at be a vet and treated to the best of their abilities. She deserves to live her life as sickness free as possible and we cant provide the treatment. If she is taken in, she will be very skittish, afraid and anxious. She won't come near you for some time but eventually she will open up on her terms.

Mine: Friday, July 13th (awesome) at John Harvard's in Lake Grove.

What say you, Long Isle Redditors? Let's meet some people and drink some beer and stuff!


**EDIT 1:** There seems to be a lot of interest in having a barbeque/picnic meet-up, most prefer it to be on a Saturday, with the 14th being quite popular. There are a lot more of you young ones wanting to come out, so I'm not sure how the alcohol thing would work for the legal crowd, even in a park where open container is allowed (Hecksher Park). Anyhow I'll let this get more attention for say four days, and we'll see where we are overall, sound good?

**EDIT 2:** Sorry I've been in Chicago for a conference so I've been a bit MIA. I think Hecksher Park is a great idea for Saturday the 14th.

I'm a new grad, fresh out of college so I don't mind moving to Long Island. I've checked around on craigslist but I feel a little out of my element (and surprised at all the broker fees). I'm looking apartments or even a room to rent near the N25 (stops at the hospital). I do plan on learning how to drive VERY soon so I'll have more options where to live down the line but for at least a few months I would need a place near the N25 bus.

Does anyone have any advice where to find apartment listings besides craigslist? Any advice for someone new to Long Island?

Figured maybe someone who's been in my situation might get a kick out of it:

Hey, just turned 30. Life is a bummer. Then reports came in the northern lights would be visible so I took it as a sign it was time to give our jolly green friend another go 'round but it turns out barely leaving your house for seven years leaves the old contact list a bit empty.

It's Brentwood, I thought. I should be able to throw up a handful of bills, scream ""quarter of dank please"" and have a pocketful of tasty nuggets before the money hits the ground. I asked a waiter who, frankly, looked like a child to my old man eyes if he knew where the good bud was. The polite young man assured me he did but at the promised hour the ashy bastard was nowhere to be found. Just like the aurora borealis.

Day 3 and I loiter at a gas station full of paraphernalia but no one comes inside. Everyone pays at the pump with credit cards. Yet another case of convenient technology ruining human social bonds. Doesn't mastercard know I'm trying get blazed? Will we never be free of their corporate tyranny?

Late night relocation to local bodega. It's across from an apartment complex and full of likely suspects. I mean, there's an always empty 24 hour pizza place next door. The whole strip mall is a front. Discretely and with great panache I strike up conversations. No small task for a pathological introvert who looks like a former linebacker turned mexican assassin. The bodega folks are amused and friendly but coy. Only when I've given up hope does a stock boy tell me he has what I need. We settle on a price and nearby location.

By the dumpsters I wait. Two men approach, their heads swiveling in every direction but mine. They're making me feel overdressed. I wasn't raised on Long Island and so am no stranger to back alley bad vibes. They get about nine feet away before I ask if they know the stock boy. This prompts one of the gentleman to reach into his pocket for a shiny sliver of I don't know what because I broke the fuck out. I never ignore my spider-sense.

Sober and defeated I sit. I'm a grown man, god dammit. All I wanted to do was incinerate a little plant matter while the sun bombards the atmosphere with radiation.

This is why I never leave the house.

tl;dr- 30 year old man without friends tries to find trees; almost gets stabbed at bodega.

The group is going to be made up of 7 people, Soprano, Mezzo-Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bari-Tenor, Bass, and VP.

I will be on VP, and I already have a few girls interested, however I need help finding male vocalists! So I still need to find a Tenor, Bari-Tenor and (true Bass). I need the Bass to be able to hit at least a C2, if not a bit lower.

A little bit about me, I'm 21 years old and live in Islip, NY. I've been singing for 5 years, and quickly fell in love with a capella. I do a lot of arranging and composing in my free time, and I'm currently a music education/performance major on Viola. I've directed an a capella group of my own before, but it fell apart after about 6-7 months because of lack of commitment from other members.

I plan on starting a YouTube channel as well as maybe getting some gigs around the island, primarily Suffolk and Nassau county. And if we stick together and are well received, try out for the sing off next season (trusting it comes back again).

Email me if you're interested and I'll get back to you asap! r.furrer91@gmail.com[1]

-Gas lines: For first-responders like police, EMS, and firefighters, show your ID at the lines. Yes, you do get to cut the lines. However we need the gas the most, so use it wisely. Only go to gas stations with police present. 

-No power? Well if you have a generator, read the next bullet. Otherwise, LIPA says most power will be restored by Wednesday, with the exception of some Suffolk towns like Huntington, Port Jeff, St. James, etc... If your town has power, make sure you check all lines leading to your house for damage. 

-Got a generator? Keep it outside and as far away from the house as can be. Store gas in the open as well, don't leave it in a shed. Fumes can build up.

-Need to travel? Don't unless it is of the upmost importance. Us first-responders need all of the room we can get, and traffic just impedes our travelling. See a car with flashing red/white/blue/green any of those colors, let them through!

-You were evacuated? Well check your town's website on news about evacuations. You may not be able to return to your home just yet. Sewage can be an issue.

-Food? Plenty of Red Cross places being set up that are giving out free food and supplies. Check your local firehouse for info, **MAKE SURE TO CALL THE NON-EMERGENCY LINE**

-Price gouging at the pump? If you encounter a gas station raising prices like crazy, you may call the police on a **NON-EMERGENCY** line. 

-Need to call 911? Well if your power is still out, make sure to have a cell phone charged. Relay as much info as possible to the operator, as E911 isn't active as of yet. E911 means that if you call from a hardline, you don't need to provide an address, they know where you are. Cell phones have only a limited functionality of this.

-LIRR? Well it's running better than before. However, some branches like Port Jeff and the Ronk don't have full service yet, meaning they don't stop at all of the stops. Check mta.info for that.

If it matters I'm 26, not rich by any means, but doing okay, and am going with my girlfriend who will likely be contributing $100. I plan on giving $600 total (from me and the g/f). Going overboard? Acceptable?

I made a throw-away for this question, only because my boyfriend is on reddit and I don't want to ruin the surprise. 

I'm thinking about adopting a cat for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day...but I have no idea how to go about it. While I love cats, I have never owned one, nor have I ever adopted an animal from a shelter/rescued an animal. What I'm looking for are suggestions as to where I could get a healthy kitten for not too much money. Do shelters offer animals that already have their shots, or is that something I'll likely have to take care of on my own? I only ask because money is tight for me, so I'm trying to go the cheapest route possible without sacrificing anything as far as the health of the cat goes. 

Would anyone suggest the North Shore Animal League or a different shelter? Also, does anyone on the island (preferably in Suffolk) happen to know anyone that is looking to get rid of some kittens? 

Thanks so much for your help, guys!

Where are the best places to find housing listings online, and are there any suggested areas where the rent is going to be more reasonable?

I'm a college student from the tri-state area who will be staying with family on Long Island for the summer. The first half will be spent in Wantagh, the second half in Melville. 

I'm happy to be getting out of my hometown for a bit, but as a young person who doesn't know anyone and is fairly unfamiliar with LI, I'm worried I may begin to feel isolated/painfully bored, so I was wondering if you had any recommendations for weekend/nighttime activities, or places where I might be likely to meet people my age.

I will be bringing my car, and I'm big on adventure and exploration, so I'm willing to drive pretty much anywhere and do pretty much anything as long as it's not insanely expensive. I guess I would say I'm an artsy type - I like museums, concerts, coffee shops, etc. I also enjoy the outdoors.

I'm better at the sciences, too. I generally score A's on my science tests. I scored a 97th percentile on the SSAT.

I don't understand fully why I wasn't accepted into the school, and I'm a little disappointed. I shouldn't have expected to have gotten in, but that's not my primary concern anymore. I need to enroll in a suitable high school.

I'm looking for a school with good teachers, and a good college guidance system, preferably a private school. I'm open to anything, however. I'd like to continue my music and math lessons, too. I hope I could have a school band to play in, and maybe a math club or any competitive mathematics course I could take up. My goal is to get into a good university/college.

My priorities (not necessarily in order)

*Good education system 

*Low taxes (if this even exists on LI, though i understand suffolk is alittle better than nassau, but with maybe larger schools)

*Walkable neighborhood

*Good value for money

* safe neighborhood


As far as I understand - most of the places on the north shore in nassau are out of reach due to housing prices (except a few neighborhoods.. like glen cove..), south shore eastern nassau county seems to have a decent amount of middle class housing stock with decent schools (ie: merrick, massapequa, seaford).  

not really sure about how suffolk plays out.

I've lived in Nassau for about 5 years so I have a pretty good idea of what I'm getting into, except I don't really have an inside scoop on the school districts (since I grew up in Cleveland).

Most of the districts seem to have pretty great primary schools, but things diverge pretty drastically once you get around to high schools, so ultimately that's what I'm trying to find out more about.

Question I'm looking for answers to:

-Did the school offer AP classes? How many?

-Did a lot of classmates go to college? Did any get into crazy-good schools?

-Were there a lot of extra-curricular activities?

-Were there opportunities to do a foreign exchange?

-If your best friend had kids and was looking to raise their kids in your town, would you be like NOPE?

Any feedback from the 20-somethings that grew up here would be a huge help to the 30-something derp dads who are looking for a lay of the land.

It will be my first time taking the road test and still need to pick a location to do so.
But would like to know some input in which location is the best, and why you think that.
I'm 25 and as I said this will be my first time taking the test.
And if I make the appointment now will get a date around last week of July, firsts weeks of August.

Thank you!!

PS.- Any tips are more than welcome!

**Update:**
Thanks to all your replies, I read them all.  And yes, I agree with the being able to pass anywhere if I am ready. That is true but sometimes the nervous factor comes in even if you are all ready; that's why I asked for the least stressful and not the easiest location :) Don't worry, I won't crash against your cars (hopefully!).

Anyways, as nite_hm suggested to check for cancellations, I decided to do this:  If there was a cancellation that would allow me to take the test at least 2/3 weeks before the average expected date (Anywhere between the 1st and 3 week of August), I would go for it no matter where it was. In case they were none, I would have gone for Riverhead.
But there was one... My road test is going to be on June 28th at Hauppage!!!  Now I need to get a car and someone with a license that could take me there. Probably will need to hire the ""road test service"" of a driving school =/

1.  **Heating oil**.  I guess, there isn't natural gas in Long Island?  I heard that you have to buy heating oil, and have it filled up several times a year?  Am I right?  Also, anyone know a good resource to determine how much that would be per month, or per year?

2.  **Taxes**.  Seriously.  WTF New York.  Right now, we have approx. 25% taken out of our income, and take home about 75%.  It looks like New York will end up taking a total of 35% (state, federal, and personal income tax).  Am I right?  Anyone care to share a pay stub?  

3.  **Electricity**. . .does anyone know if the rates are higher from Chicago to Long Island?  

4.  **Cigarettes**.  Can anyone give me a ballpark what they cost per pack out that way?  We've discussed quitting all together. . .but moving and all is putting a lot of stress on us, and thus, it might not be an option just yet. . .

5.  **Cable**.  What's the provider out there, and are there any companies that are better than others for just Internet.  We're cord-cutters, and while TV isn't so important, Internet is.  We currently have a 250GB cap on downloads.  Is there a comparable service out that way?

So has anyone here actually seen a LIPA truck out anywhere?



** Update as of 11:00 9/2 (Fri) -----------------------------------------**

Saw my first LIPA assessment team on my own block today taking note of a downed power line on a neighbors yard.

The number of customers still affected is down to 78,000 (85% restored). They just might hit their target of having 95% restored by today.


**Update as of 12:00 8/31 (WED)----------------------------------------**

The number of customers still affected is down to 190,000 (64% restored)



**Update as of 4:00 8/30 -----------------------------------------**

Official status has switched from ""assessing"" to ""restoration in progress"" for all areas.



**Update as of 12:00 8/30 (TUES)----------------------------------------**

The number of customers still affected is down to 271,000 (48% restored)


**Update as of 3:00 8/29 ----------------------------------------------**

The number of affected residents is reduced to 348,000 (33% restored)

Many out of state crews have been brought in from as far away as Texas.



**Update as of 12:00 8/29 (MON)---------------------------------------------------**

According to LIPA's press releases their priorities are:

1) substation and major transmission lines (much of which would not be visible to most people)

2) Critical care facilities (Hospitals, nursing homes etc.)

3) everything else

They are working ""uniformly"" over the island - not  prioritizing based on location so they're getting all towns up in bits and pieces rather than one town entirely at a time.

REPORT DOWNED POWERLINES HERE: 1800-490-0075

The unmarked trucks going around are indeed working for LIPA

Billing, collection calls and customer service has been suspended for the day - these people are reassigned to help with the recovery efforts.


originally 523,000 customers lost power

~125,000 have been restored

95% restoration is expected by FRIDAY

LIPA worked until 10pm last night, and started at 6am this morning.

1376077642.0,6,self.longisland,1k1nz6,Is there anywhere to do real engineering on Long Island?,9,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/longisland/comments/1k1nz6/is_there_anywhere_to_do_real_engineering_on_long/,"I'm writing this because I'm really starting to run out of patience.  It's been a year since I graduated and took my backup ""engineering"" position, and I feel like I've just absolutely wasted the past year of my life professionally.  I graduated from RPI in Mechanical Engineering, not because of a specific love of HVAC, but because my interests were so broad I couldn't pin down a specific area that I wanted to specifically go for.  I just like doing differential equations and Fourier transforms and research and making graphs and learning a little Matlab and C here and there.  Eventually I kind of settled down on control engineering, and took a Mechatronics class.  I really liked knowing EVERYTHING, from the mechanical physics to the way the circuit is designed, to writing code, and then this cool new control theory math with feedback loops and rise and settling time, etc...

However I really stayed broad with my studies because in the end, I wanted to have a career in my home area of Long Island, NY.  Both for financial (there's almost no way I could afford living on my own with the loans) and personal (I have a big family that I don't want to leave) reasons.  I thought I did everything I had to.  I had an internship which was in a field I didn't really care for, and a pretty cool co-op at a semiconductor manufacturing company that I lived away for.  Honestly, living those 6 months alone also made me want to start my career at home.  I had a wide variety of academic experiences, doing a bit of undergrad research, mixing my classes into electrical and chemical engineering grad classes (like Mechatronics and Combustion), and getting almost a 4.0 for my last 2 years on top of that.  However, the long slow job search for Long Island engineering careers is immensely depressing.  I feel like I haven't had to think in the year since I graduated, and I just miss that feeling of working at those engineering type problems.  My internship turned into my current job, which has barely any duties that I would consider engineering worthy.  It's just depressing.  It's so hard to go from constant advanced and AP classes to an engineering school, always surrounded by people who were smart and talked about how they would change the world, to a workplace where it's just a ""job"" and the most technical thing I do is when I boot up CAD to change the document information.  I also make 55k/year which is low for engineering, especially in this area.  Studying for the EIT exam this past May was the highlight of my year.  I had forgotten that I just fucking love doing physics and applying it to the real world.  

For the past year, at great expense to my free time, I've applied to hundreds of jobs in the area.  Not even a single response.  I've torn my hair out reading and rereading that resume perfecting every word.  I don't know why everyone's ignoring me.  I've obsessively stalked positions at Brookhaven National Lab, BAE Systems, Lockheed, Motorola, Honeywell, Telephonics and Canon.  There's a company called ATK that basically does rocket science by me.  It seems like this area should be able to sustain me (We built the Lunar Lander here!), and believe me I've done everything I can.  I apply to every engineering job.  I call to follow up with an engineering manager or HR person.  Actually at this point a few companies have outright told me to stop calling them, and only do things online.  I've made contacts.  I've volunteered at Brookhaven Lab.  No matter how many handshakes I make and emails I send, I always see the ever present ""Sorry, we're just not hiring for your experience level right now."" or ""Uh I don't know just apply online.""

My question is, what can I do?  Are there other companies around I'm missing out on?  I'll go into any field.  Research, software, fluids, mechanical design, just anything you actually need to think for.  There's definitely positions asking for maybe 3 years experience in something more specific, like RF engineering.  Should I get an RF certificate?  Then again, should I focus on software instead?  I don't want to dedicate time and money for a specific company's specific position that probably wont be there by the time I'm qualified.  I always had an airtight, waterproof resume, and I feel like the last year just ruined everything.

My ""game plan"" was always to demonstrate to companies that I can learn basically anything, have an LI engineering company take me in and mold me into the engineer for their company.  I didn't know I needed to basically have known I wanted to be, say, an optical engineer since middle school and have all these optical engineering qualifications and certifications and 5 years experience just for an entry level job.  At this point I'm willing to start branching out to New Jersey and upstate/moving towards the Boston area, and starting to use my free time to do less applying and try to build control engineering projects to maybe use as experience during applications and if nothing comes just give up and work some generic business/finance/union construction job that will at least get me a living wage for this area.  It just feels like I did everything right and I'm still getting the short end of everything.  I mean I obsessively check my automatic job agents and all these website's career sections every day, it created so much strain that it led to a breakup recently.  If a position is listed at 5 AM, I will have applied at 5:15.  I've done these company's applications so much I can do it with my eyes closed.  All I want to do is work somewhere important!

If moving out is the answer, then I want to do it right.  I want to be somewhere with the best of the best.  I applied for a position at CERN, but the U.S. isn't a member state.  If I have to move out for my career, then I'll work at something like the NASA JPL, or Tesla, or be a science researcher in Antarctica.  I just want to invent and create and do something new and important.",,False,self,t5_2qk64,False,,,True,t3_1k1nz6,http://www.reddit.com/r/longisland/comments/1k1nz6/is_there_anywhere_to_do_real_engineering_on_long/,

My sister has a very rough few years. A few years ago she almost died from two sub-arachnoid intracranial aneurysms. One had burst, one was on the verge. She had her skull cut into and clips put in. We were very honestly told that her chances were not good. Most likely severe brain damage or death. Her neurosurgeon nicknamed her his superstar because not only is she alive, but functioning very well. Because of the medical bills (uninsured) she lost her home. 

Her and her SO moved into a rental about two years ago where they had the main level and the landlord’s adult children had the basement level. A girlfriend of one of the sons’ was crazy and more than likely on drugs and after an argument with him, she set the house on fire. They all got out safe but lost a lot of possessions. 

So, they moved again, using what little they had to secure a nice home in a decent area with little else.  

Then this past Tuesday she was at home with her son (adult) just doing every day kind of things. When at approximately 11:45 a.m. there was an explosion. Her son pushed her to the ground and lay on top of her to shield her and in the process he was hit with glass and debris. The house next door was completely obliterated. An 18-month old boy was killed.  It is believed to be from two propane tanks in the backyard but no one has said anything definite yet. My sister’s home was blown off its foundation, every single window, mirror, dish shattered. The enclosed porch was leveled. The house has been condemned, it’s unlivable. Because she was renting, she doesn’t qualify for homeowner relief. And they now have nothing. The furniture is destroyed due to shredding and embedding of glass shards, dishes blown to bits, clothing left in the open (hampers, clothes lines) unusable, again because of glass, debris and insulation. Televisions and computer equipment just destroyed, cracked, blasted off of stands, just everything gone. 

 What I am asking for Reddit, is a little help for her.  I realize that by posting this I am giving up any sort of anonymity on this site but I am pretty much helpless in this. I am a working single mom who lives paycheck to paycheck with no sort of liquid (or solid) assets. The only thing I can do is bring her, her SO, son, daughter and dog into my apartment. But if any of you in the Long Island area can help out I would be beyond appreciative. Anything at all would help towels, food, old furniture, a gift card, any landlord in the Suffolk County area willing to put them up rent/security free for a month until her SO has saved enough to pay rent. He is a good, hard-working man who loves her and looks out for her but all available cash has gone to ‘stupid’ things like pizza, underwear, air mattresses, etc. Since I know you guys are super sleuths who can have a name, location and favorite color within an hour of any post with any sort of information, I am just going to save you the trouble and post a couple of links. http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/da-woman-sets-tree-on-fire-after-spat-1.2586470 (house fire article) http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/long_island&amp;id=8774189 (explosion, that is my nephew at 2:53, the one who shielded his mother from the glass, who has no insurance and was treated for cuts and tested for possible concussion) http://www.news12.com/articleDetail.jsp?articleId=330530&amp;position=1&amp;news_type=news (again, explosion, my sister and nephew are mentioned in the 5th paragraph). Just as a side note, I went over the day after to see for my own eyes, my family was there trying to get permission to go inside for some things, when a ‘pastor’ came soliciting for donations to the family of the baby that died. I, being poor, handed over a $10 figuring I can skip lunch this week and from behind me comes several hands of my family members with various bills, and one of them says, ‘I’m here, that baby’s not, least I can help his mom send him off nicely'.

I've been looking around the internet for a week or so for the above and have failed miserably, so I 'm hoping some LI redditor out there can drop a knowledge bomb on me.

Anyone out there know of a good spot for this? Pretty much just looking to have fun, do some cooking, relax, etc. Also, if anyone has an even BETTER idea please share :).
