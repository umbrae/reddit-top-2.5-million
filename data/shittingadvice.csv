Since then I have had some occurring off and on over the years.  Here is a few things I have found to counter the butt hurt. This is just from my personal experience, I hope some ones ass finds it useful.

* Shit or get off the pot. If you have IBS (like myself) after shitting remove yourself from the pot do a once over as to not drip fecal matter down your legs and just stand there, moving can help but again don't sit on the pot until you need to.

* Do not wipe more than 3 times.  If you need more cleaning get in the shower, if you are not at home you can do a few things.  1. Carry baby wipes.  2.  Wet a piece of toilet paper and dab like you are cleaning wine out of carpet. 3.  Do like Jim Carry in the movie ""Me myself and Irene"" and prop your ass up in a sink.


* Never force a turd. Do not push! Seriously wait for the deuce to come knocking and let it fall out.

* This last one may be completely bullshit and in my mind but it has seemed to help big time in the last 5 years or so.  If you take a shit and feel a pain in your inner rectum or start to feel some pressure like you may get a grape on your ass try to use your ass muscles to push it back up into the colon.  Inner hemorrhoids in my opinion are a lot less painful than a grape or marble hanging on your sphincter.

If you eat reasonably healthily, do not, I repeat *do not* just suddenly go on a fortnight long junk food binge.

It will fuck you up.

I went to the toilet expecting to take a normal dump, something that for me is like a 2 minute process. I was there for an hour and a half.

It started off normal enough but then quickly became apparent I was in trouble. It was so big, and so fucking solid that no amount of clenches was going to lighten the load for me.

When all was done, I was shaking and drenched in sweat. It hurt *so* much and felt like I had passed something *so* big, that I decided to stand up and take a look.

It was almost perfectly square and it filled the entire circumference of the toilet bowl. The texture looked like sun dried clay. Rock hard and full of cracks.

It took an hour and a half because there is no action you can possibly do, that will help you pass a brick through your arse hole. You just gotta let gravity do its thing.

This shit has cured me of my fear of child birth. It was that bad.

If someone stumbles across this because their feeling a bit blocked up. Imagine having to shit an actual brick. Then go eat an entire pack of all bran.

It was early afternoon on a winter day in January. I was driving to upstate New York to visit a school I was looking into going to. I had left earlier that morning, and stopped at McDonald's to get some breakfast and coffee before I left for my trip. I had a big breakfast platter and an egg mcmuffin with sausage on it, I woofed it all down and went on my way upstate. My stomach started to feel uncomfortable about 20 minutes later, I just figured that I ate too much food and was over full, so I unbuttoned my jeans and it seemed to ease the discomfort so I continued driving. About two hours into the trip I stopped and got gas, considered going to the bathroom but I just wanted to get to the school because it had started snowing lightly.

I pressed on, I was about 2 hours away from the school and my stomach suddenly felt like it flipped and growled loudly. It is the only time I had ever gripped my stomach in pain. It felt like someone had just punched me in the gut. I figured it was just gas pains so I shifted in the seat a little and loosened my seat belt, my stomach pain started to go away but it was still there. I was in the middle of upstate New York with a McDonald's food baby traveling through my guts. I knew it was just a matter of time until he reached the back door with a surprise.

My stomach kept growling and turning, the pain was coming back and getting worse, I knew I had to shit but I was in the middle of a major highway. I passed a sign that read ""Rest Area, 10 Miles"" Only ten more miles until I could empty my bowels. That was the longest 10 mile drive ever. I was sweating, profusely, so bad I opened the windows to get some cold air in the car. As I got closer to the rest area the pain only got worse, I had to fart so bad but I knew I couldn't risk it.

After 10 miles of pain I finally parked the car and hobbled into the rest area, I was literally holding my fist to my asshole, hoping, wishing that I wouldn't shit my pants in front of everyone at the rest area. I hobbled into the bathroom, went right for the handicapped stall and ripped my pants off and proceeded to let loose, the loudest, smelliest, most repulsive porcelain shattering dump I have ever taken in my life. It was the kind of shit, that when you finally let loose and it's all over you let out a little ""ohhh yeahh"" I got up from the toilet and it was like a murder scene, there was shit on the back of the toilet, on the sides of the toilet, even on the seat from where my asscrack met the bowl. I saw little bits of potato and fake egg from my McDonald's breakfast platter. I cleaned myself up using most of the toilet paper that was on the roll and left the stall. Then, to my horror, I saw at the sink three women just standing there staring at me, the worst, most disgusted looks on their face, I just nodded in shame and left the bathroom, as I was walking out a woman in a wheelchair opened the door and went in. I ran.

It was quiet. Too quiet. By the look of his clean shoes, the guy knew how to dress well. But at the same time, I figured that the man probably thought that high-end brands would make him more accepted among his peers. So there we were, in a standoff of silence. A prep VS a punk. A minute goes by, so I give it the usual ""Let it rip"" signal, something to say ""We're equal here."" But no, still silence. At this point I imagined him holding in an enormous amount of shit, yet feeling too awkward letting go. Sooner or later, I just started making plop sounds with a constant spray of my piss. Just imagine firefighters putting out a plane in flames, while they're still unloading the luggage. I took a deep breath, and exhaled. The guy on the other side made no sound. I knew he was waiting for me to leave. Just like a stranger in a desert town, I felt rejected. I packed my bags (wiped my ass), and left.

Tirana without bringing your own toilet paper.  Outside of Tirana, one
is likely to encounter what I call a ""turkish toilet"" (
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9-_Fa1cWdPU/TFl7aUVsprI/AAAAAAAAAmg/Q1zRhGrMvUs/s1600/Turkish.jpg)

What's more, there is usually no toilet paper.  Sometimes the toilets
don't even flush, and there is merely just a garden hose lying around
nearby.

I set out across the country early yesterday morning towards Pogradec,
which was the summer vacation locale for the communists back in the
day and is a popular vacation spot now.  It is on lake Ohrid, near the
border with Macedonia.  There you can eat the wonderful Korun fish
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohrid_trout).  Anyway, somewhere between
Elbasan and Lin, I had to make a pit-stop.  Uh-Oh  Although seemingly
a nice place that I stopped in, there was a turkish toilet and no
toilet paper.

Now, I had been doing research on this for the past year or two,
wondering exactly how this toilet works.  When stuck in such a
situation, I have squatted as if on a toilet, leading to lots of
straining and wiping.   I had been reading that this is, in fact, the
best way to relieve your BBQ, and that our modern toilets in fact
promote constipation.  Still, I never had the guts to really try it.

Well, this time I had to.  The full squat is said not to really need
much wipe up and all i had was two tissues in my pocket.  So I went
all in.  It was the best bowl movement of my life.  Done in about a
half a second, with no pressure at all.  Sure enough, one tissue was
enough (I used the second to double check), and boy, am I now firmly
committed to the turkish toilet camp.

If I can do one thing for the US in my remaining years, it will be to
end chronic constipation by converting people over to the turkish toilet",,False,,t5_2rg3c,False,,,True,t3_yv0yk,http://www.reddit.com/r/shittingadvice/comments/yv0yk/best_shit_of_my_life_today_on_a_turkish_style/,

Okay so here's a little back story...ever since I can remember I haven't pooped. No word of a lie I went to the bathroom once every month...my record was six weeks without going to the bathroom. I had constant cramps...a tight feeling in my stomach that would last for days weeks months. Time spent in the hospital and the consumption of every laxative available...rx and over the counter. 
    When I was 20 I finally went to a gastroenterology specialist who diagnosed me with IBS. No relief infact the medication made me sick. Fast forward 9 years and my husband and I have a lightbulb moment...we start paying attention to what I eat and how it makes me feel. Turns out 29 years of hell and I'm lactose intolerant...it has been a month since I gave up dairy and I have never felt better. I poop everyday if not more than once a day. I am off four prescription meds and have not had a stomach ache. I feel amazing!

NSFW(pic)",34,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/shittingadvice/comments/1b3o3v/can_anybody_advise_i_think_i_have_an_anal_fissure/,"hi everyone, so i have been trying to ignore this problem for what must be close to 2 years now and i am finally on the verge of going to see a doctor for it(though i'd really rather not. i want to try to fix it on my own first.)

quick info:
-i have always had a really fast metabolism and it is not uncommon for me to take multiple poops every day(anywhere from 1-4+)

-i started eating a lot more a few years ago to bulk up while hitting the gym and this is where my problems started, taking more frequent and larger poops

-for a long time now i expect some sort of blood when i poop. it isn't dyeing the toilet water or anything. sometimes it will be on my stool but normally it is just from wiping, i have reached a point where i cannot even wipe without running the toilet paper under warm water first and there is usually still blood.

-my anus usually hurts after i'm done. never put anything inside of it so i know any damage i have has to be from pooping

-i get really annoying and intense itching sensations on(or in?) my anus. like right now. it sucks and i have no idea what to do about it. sometimes i will go sit down on the toilet just so i can rub it with some toilet paper, i will usually get a really alleviating feeling if i rub hard(probably similar to people who scratch off scabs and say it feels good?) which i know will always mean i am getting blood from somewhere on the toilet paper i'm rubbing with. this is why i draw the parallel to a scab, i feel like i am opening a wound or something and for some reason it feels good for a couple seconds until i stop applying pressure and check for blood.

if anybody has dealt with this before i have a shitty request for you. i am going to link to a picture of my bunghole, does it look damaged or anything? i have no idea what it should look like or if mine is fucked at all. EYEBLEACH is included with the photo, i added some cute animals in spots that are not of interest.

It's annoying.

(Said it in that post, I'll say it again: My english may have flaws, im Argentinian :] )

So. I was consulting a Proctologyst about the hard time I was having when shitting (Hurt like hell, and lots of blood when finishing the shitting act -- light red blood dropped till i wiped and stand up)

This doctor made me do some Blood tests, A Colonoscopy, and several fingerings into my ass looking for possible causes of this problem.

My blood tests were exceptionally good. Nothing could be causing trouble in my Blood flow.

The Colonoscopy: The preparation is terrible. 2lts of the worst laxant ever that makes you shit non-stop for like 5 hours to have your Colon clean for it to be scoped by a bunch of Ass-Ologysts. The Results were fine and hemorroids were discarted.

After that bunch of studies this Woman said to me ""You're clinically OK, I can't do anything for you"" and i was like WTF: you just made my ass a roman circus and you don't have a fix for this? i'll have to ask for advice to other Doc.

So, i went to another doc that simply fingered me and said ""THIS IS A FISSURE.""

He prescripted me to sit 3 times a day in warm water with **Boric Acid** for 10 minutes and a cream for possible inflammation.

3 days of treatment after that, **IM HEALED** and  fully enjoying the shitting practice.

My first important memory was in the 4th grade when I was too terrified to poop because I thought it would be too big. I held it in for over 2 weeks. The Girl Scouts leader told my mom I was super white, and would lean over and groan (fighting to keep it in.) My parents made me drink coffee, prune juice, eat pepperoncini, etc. It finally happened, with me screaming at the top of my lungs, and it was a fucking tiny ball. (I wonder if its genetic because my cousin had to go to the doctors to get it all cut up and stuff when he was a younging. He has issues too.)

Aside from the usual toilet clogging, in college I was in a suite. I was too terrified to poop thinking I'd clog it and everyone would know it was me. I was too afraid to use the school public bathrooms so I went weekly before I found a time I could poop one out real quickly without getting caught.

On vacations, I would wait until we went to a mall, or a fast food restaurant, or a portapotty that happened to be around. Yes, I've done all this in the name of not clogging a family/friends/hotel toilet.

I recently clogged my friend's friend's toilet. It was a colossal shit, and I was crying at the sight of it because I knew trouble were to be had. Since a lot of people were staying, I didn't claim it, though my friend knew it was me (he drives me to a 24-7 grocery store to poop when the urge strikes so I don't clog his toilet lol). I wonder if  they ended up having to get a professional plumber...

So I poop at work. I try not to poop at home but if I have to do it, I will. I clog a toilet every time at work. But they don't leave a plunger there, so I usually just lock the door from the inside and run before anyone sees me and can trace all these clogged toilets back to me. I am convinced someone is on the lookout and trying to catch The Serial Clogger. In fact, my office switched floors, and I wouldn't be surprised if the janitor put two and two together and narrowed down who is continuously leaving these unflushable shits.

My current issue? I am dieting, drinking tons of water, and my shits are still colossol but even further apart. What use to be 2x a week - and that's me being 'regular', now is 1x a week, if that. I drink detox tea, take probiotics, colon cleanse pill, etc. Why is it worse now that I'm trying to get healthy? I pooped more regularly and they flushed more often when I was eating tons of terrible food and sitting around the house all day never drinking water! I had gotten the detox tea to work for a week, and I dropped 6 pounds just pooping!

WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO TO POOP NORMAL SIZED SHITS ON A MUCH MORE NORMAL BASIS?

I asked my doctor, and now I'm asking you - is it possible that from all these huge shits that I kept stored inside all my life going back to 4th grade that I stretched my colon hugely and now in order for movement to happen a whole lot of crap needs to gather before anything happens, and by that time it is wwaayyyy to big to fit out my tiny ass hole? (which I'm sure is larger than your average girl, anal wasn't a problem with me.) Can I die from not being able to poop? I am convinced one day I'm going to die on the toilet trying to poop.

I've taken to eating a large salad as a complete meal (lunch or dinner) a few times a week -- typical contents are lettuce, carrots, onions, other salad vegetables, and a vinaigrette.

I'm finding that I almost always get painful diarrhea about an hour or two after the meal is done, which is disconcerting, and makes it awkward for me to have my favorite meal in public.  The output is most certainly bristol type 7, pale yellow or pale green and ... sometimes a little frothy? (think beer head, not a thick and undifferentiated layer, but here and there).

Does this sound like something I might want to seek treatment for? I've seen in a few places that salad alone can bring diarrhea for those with regular GIs, but I have other shitting problems even when I don't eat it, just not this severe, so I'm concerned about IBS or something like it.  Thanks in advance

I had as a youngling a big problem with shit. At the age of 10 I had an almost 2 weeks constipation, and since then i'm not regular with my shitting schedule.

 I'm used to take a shit twice a week or so.
However, Now i'm 19 and im willing to regulate my times and have a healty colon again. 

Since I discovered ""Poopin 2.0"" and all that squatting tactic, i could regularize my times: In the last 2 weeks i've almost achieved the ""Shit Everyday"" medal. 

BUT(t) im having this issue: Blood. Every time.
It's only at the tip of the turd. And after that, my anus keeps leeking blood until I wipe and get my pants on. Luckily my underwear stays invict. THANK GOD.

It's like I have hurted myself and every shit lets the wound open. And it just won't go. Eventually I could moderate it and take happy shits but from time to time, this problem appears on the table again.

I want to erase it from my life. WHAT SHOULD I DO?

1) I become constipated very easily. I can feel like I have to take a shit, but when I get on the toilet the urge to go is gone, only to return when I stand back up. I've tried prunes and prune juice, but neither really help. Prunes make my logs... sticker? And the juice just makes my shit liquid (which still feels like constipation because I can't let loose, it comes out in spurts). I drink a lot of (and only) water, and I have a fairly fiberfill diet. I find the main problem is a shitting schedule. If I go at the same time every day, I won't be constipated. I never have to strain, it's a matter of the urge simply disappearing. If I postpone a dump for any reason, I become constipated for the next few days. But when I do manage to go...

2) it takes me upwards of 30 minutes to wipe. I don't get it. I don't put much pressure, and wipe until brown stops coming up. The only thing is it never stops coming up. It's beginning to really infuriate me. I'll wipe and wipe and wipe and it never ends. Once it starts to fade, I do one last wipe and OH LOOK MORE SHIT. After too much wiping, my ass gets sore and its pretty common to cause bleeding through abrasion (from repetition, not pressure). I may be developing hemorrhoids. Am I doing something wrong?

I have tried EVERYTHING, and nothing has worked. I am now beginning to wonder if I have some strange, obscure issue/disease/ailment/etc. that causes chronic constipation. Or generally just wondering, WTF.

What I have tried:
- Enemas
- Mineral oil
- Magnesium Citrate drink
- Stomach x-ray (small amount of impaction, just given laxative)
- Fiber
- Extremely fiber rich diet (beans, fruits, veg, etc ONLY)
- Activia
- ""Probiotic"" drinks
- All IBS medications
- Lactose Intolerance meds (over the counter)
- Tested for allergies such as gluten and wheat
- I have had colonoscopies, apparently nothing abnormal shows
- Laxative, ""Miralaxa"" past 4 yrs and just this week I started taking ""Linzess""
- Other things that I am definitely forgetting because this has spanned across 7 years

Medical ailments I have:
- Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome
- Hiatal Hernia
- GERD
- Gastritis 
- Minor hypoglycemia
- Hashimoto's Disease (thyroid autoimmune disorder - levels are extremely low, so although constipation is related to this, I don't see how it could be the cause seeing as my levels are too low to be on medication)
- Overactive bladder problems

I have been taking Miralax every day for 4 years now. Although it helps, it does not completely. I still can only eat a certain amount; if I get too full I will become extremely bloated to the point of painful, distended stomach sometimes, and constipated even with laxative. I cannot for ONE DAY be off the Miralax or I am incapable of shitting. Something else I have noticed, is that when I do eat too much like that, my urine will become cloudy. 

I have been a vegetarian for a few years now, and I eat VERY healthy. Organic, lots of whole foods, mainly home cooking. And when I say vegetarian: No meat or fish, &amp;amp; eggs only if they are baked/cooked within something. Although I will still consume dairy, it is not much. 

With the Miralax, my poop is anywhere from type 4-6 on the bristol stool scale. 


PLEASE HELP! I am truly worried for my future. I have been to countless gastros. I just cannot imagine it is okay to be taking laxatives for such an extended period of time, and looking into my future, for decades to come. I also cannot imagine being so constipated for so long will not have future consequences. And really, it just fucking sucks!!!

Two months ago I tried quitting coffee completely.  Two weeks later, I started suffering from constipation, which is unusual because I eat healthily (mostly vegetables, fruits and whole grains), exercise, drink lots of water, etc.  Researching, I pinned it down to constipation as a symptom of caffeine withdrawl (caffeine stimulates the digestive system, so after the body becomes dependent, withdrawl causes constipation).  Reluctantly, I resumed drinking 1 cup of coffee per day just for this, and was immediately able to start going once per day (the usual, throughout my lifetime).  

But I'm still having trouble.  Even though I go once per day, my rectum fills up in a bad shape - instead of long and skinny like it used to be, my rectum seems to be expanding into a baseball - grapefruit shaped object that is difficult to pass.

Crumbles are a fact of life, even with the most assiduous wiping.  Particles can and do migrate from the colon to the anus and beyond, long after the last sheet of TP passes the crack, virgin-white.  Unless you are French or Filipino, you may be faced with itching and discomfort hours later.

One solution to this problem is to keep a pack of *flushable* baby wipes near the commode: Baby wipes do not irritate the sensitive tissue of the anus, they are pre-moistened, and they do not disintegrate ""on the job"".  Scour the anus thoroughly if you have a case of the crumbles, and often, relief is immediate or soon to arrive.  It's best to get flushable wipes, but if you cannot find them, you may have to pretend that you are in China (if you aren't!) and dispose of them in the trash.

Sometimes this treatment is insufficient to diminish anal discomfort:  If the anus has been sanded-down after several messy trips to the crapper, no amount of baby-wiping will relieve the displeasure of a raw anus.  When this is the case, it is useful to apply a dollop of vaseline into and around the butthole.  Use a clean scooping finger, and if you use a bit too much, just shove the extra into the colon, unless you like greasy underpants!

Okay so basically every morning I drop one to clear things out for the day. I do this right before my shower because frankly I feel disgusting if I don't shower after a shit. So I'll take my dump in the AM and throughout the day I have to run to the bathroom and wipe up again. The amount that needs wiping is rather random. Somedays it's just a slight brown tint (which I consider a good day, btw) and other days it's like I just took a fresh shit. 

Needless to say this leaves me feeling absolutely disgusting by the end of the day. Because of this I always do a wiping up right before bed in case any sexy times occur. My lady likes groping my ass cheeks, but because of the aforementioned problems I hate it! Otherwise it'd be a great thing that she's doing. I'm basically disgusted by my own anus.

I do have issues with hemmhroids every now and then, but I have this issue even when the hemmhroids aren't an issue. I also sometimes shit and then feel like I *could* shit more, but I can't. Pushing results in nothing. I'm assuming this problem and the earlier problem are linked.

I, like a lot of others around this subreddit have the issue of not being able to get completely clean after a movement. I can drop a nice log but then when it should pinch off, more starts to come out that doesn't seem like it's ready to come out. Like it should sit in there until tomorrow or maybe later in the day to form a little better. This leaves me with hangers that are mushy and thin and really hard to clean. Over the last say 2-3 months it's a daily thing. I haven't changed my diet, I exercise. After reviewing a lot of threads I am wondering if maybe I have something other than a dietary issue going on and wondering if it's time to do see the doctor. I tried some fiber tablets the past few days but all it has been doing is making the initial log firmer. (I still can't believe I am typing this out). I've also had some Activia yogurt for the past 4 or 5 days, eaten some bananas. None of it has seemed to alter this at all. Coffee is my nemesis. If I have a cup of coffee in the morning, I am in the bathroom about 30 minutes later. I stayed away from coffee for a week but I still had the movement as it is today, just later in the day. At night for the last 2-3 weeks I am having some really bad gas too. Looking for some advice. I am about ready to make an appt with the doctor if I can't make it improve. I just don't want to go through a bunch of tests or giving samples because it's frustrating enough. 

Edit: It's been 3 days since I posted this and I have great news to report back. I have had no wipers since Tuesday. I don't know what exactly changed it but here is what I have been doing. I take 2g of soluble fiber daily. 2 caplets in the morning and 2 in the evening. I have been eating Activia since last Thursday, one a day. I stopped having coffee as my first drink of the day. I committed myself to drink as much water as I could stomach which is about 2.5 liters a day. I get 64 oz and then sometimes a little more. I honestly think it was the water that did this. I started hydrating bigtime and the very next bowel movement was solid, no wiping. I ate a not great lunch yesterday too and had 3 beers last night, no ill effects. I think maybe my problem is solved. Thanks for everyone's suggestions.

Historically I've eaten badly (lots of sweets and little to no vegetables, I was a picky eater), and last year I got my first hemhorroids at 19.

Until a couple of days ago, my diet consisted of this: breakfast - granola + yogurt; lunch - usually pizza, pasta, or a sandwich (PB&amp;J or something like chicken parm); snack - apples (two small ones) and a carrot or two (used to include lots of chips and candy bars, still occasionally includes ice cream); dinner - pasta and/or chicken/fish/some other meat.

The main problem I have is that I have to wipe a lot.  If I don't flush at least once during the wiping process, the toilet paper I use will clog my toilet (which is already made for bigger shits than the average toilet).  Even now, I'm eating healthier and more fiber (I think), but it's still a process.

The past couple of days, I've been eating Fiber One bran cereal for breakfast, maybe whole wheat pasta with tomato sauce or thin whole wheat bread with peanut butter and jelly for lunch, and a salad with a chicken or fish and veggie dish for dinner (tonight I had a casserole with green beans, carrots, tomato, eggs,  and whole wheat bread).  For a snack, I eat bananas, green beans, grapes, yogurt, and/or raw kale.
(Admittedly, I did have some chicken mcnuggets last night while I was drunk, which was obviously a big mistake).

I've had to shit about three times today, and each time I still have to wipe a lot, but I've been rinsing my ass in the bathtub instead of wiping because it's so painfully raw that even shitting the smaller poops I've been having has stung like hell.  Even after rinsing out and using my body wash on my ass to help cleanse it, I have to wipe a couple of times with wet toilet paper to get rid of all the brown.

Am I eating the right things now?  How else can I improve my diet to make it so that I don't have to wipe as much?

It happens without any warning, no matter what I eat, and as soon as I get the urge I've got about two minutes to get to a toilet. In addition, I have very frequent nausea (though no vomiting) and near-constant stomach pains. It is genuinely ruining my life--since I never know when it's going to happen, I've stopped leaving my house unless I absolutely have to. Needless to say, this is putting major strain on my job, my mental health, and my relationships.

These are the things I've tried, without success, in no particular order:

* Cutting out all gluten
* Cutting out all dairy
* Cutting out all meat
* Cutting out all alcohol and spicy foods
* High- and low-fiber diets
* Stopping the medications I take daily to see if they were the cause (They weren't, and the results of stopping medication were mildly disastrous.)
* Taking the Heather's peppermint oil capsules (which just made everything hurt more on the way out)
* Going to a gastroenterologist and having a colonoscopy--everything came back normal and they chalked it up to IBS
* Having a full allergy panel run (twice)--I'm only allergic to grasses and one kind of tree
* Getting a full blood panel done multiple times--everything normal except high cholesterol 
* Taking daily calcium and acidophilus supplements
* Keeping a log of what I've eaten and when I've had symptoms--it ended up being completely random
* Stopping all pain killers
* Taking a daily acid reflux medication (which made the problem worse)

EDIT: I also drink plenty of water and it's the only thing I drink other than a very occasional cup of peppermint tea or Sprite.

At this point, my only defense is to take Kaopectate and/or Imodium and hope for the best (as even those medications don't always stop it). If anyone has any ideas for me, I'd really, REALLY appreciate it. The pain is getting to me a lot, and I've developed a pretty severe phobia/anxiety issue about it which is fast becoming complete agoraphobia.

------------

I've been meaning to ask this for the longest time.  (preemptive **tl;dr**: When I shit I instantly don't feel depressed/anxious)

I've had lifelong problems with constipation and chronic back pain, and recently found I had depression and anxiety as well.  Sometimes I feel extremely happy or at least alleviate my depressed/anxious state for some time after going to the bathroom.  After taking a shit, as soon as it leaves my body, I feel these feelings bubble up inside of me; even sometimes (though rare) I literally become ecstatic - I'll begin laughing non-stop for a few minutes or can't control my smiles, I instantly become extremely optimistic, focused, etc., it's very weird.

Is it possible that some of my depressed state could be attributed to ... of all things, shit? Over the past year I really began focusing on this; one thing I noticed was that when I'm extremely anxious and unable to do things like work on homework that I also haven't gone to the bathroom in a while and can feel the numb pain in my bowels.

As an example: often when I'm sitting doing my homework I'm so anxious that I can't get myself to start it or continue on.  I notice my anxiety actually becomes extremely bad at some points, and then I'll suddenly have the urge to take a shit, go and do that, and come back with much less anxiety (suddenly, homework isn't scary to me anymore, and I dive in more freely).  I'm not sure if the *act* of shitting is making it *better*, or if the fact that I needed to go so badly was *causing* it and simply by going it put me at a normal level of anxiety (which thing is the causer, which is the resultant).

The same goes with my back pain - when that's gone, suddenly doing things like homework don't bother me.  However, the same as above, I'm not sure which is the causer and which is the resultant: is my chronic back problems causing the constipation, or is my constipation causing my back pain?  And which, then, are actually alleviating my depression - getting rid of the shit, or the lessened back pain?

Given the subject matter (and how fucking stupid that sounds), I've never brought this up with a doctor and was hoping someone here could shed some light on the causes of this, if it's ""normal"" for those that have depression and changes in mood to experience this.

Similar but not directly related to this: I plan on making a chiropractor appointment, do you think that will help with making me shit?  Also, I had chiropractor appointments in the past and... well... found it extremely difficult to hold in my gas when they were pressing so hard on me, how can I prevent this?

Actually, I can narrow it down to a particular date because it was on a return flight from Hong Kong in Dec 2011!   Usually, it doesnt bother me, but once it a while it starts getting bloody...

I have never sought treatment for it, but I decided I would have a serious attempt at fixing it myself and if that fails, go to the doctor to get some of the nitro cream, or whatever it is they prescribe these days

First up, I took some pics with my new camera. Obviously, this is NSFW! And I'm a guy, if it makes a difference to you before you click.
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/TmN2bxw.jpg)

I found it was useful to take the pics, because I could finally see how bad it was, where it was, how many (I think I have some more pics of additional fissures further inside my ass chute, but cant find them - your loss).

Anyway, obviously the main culprit is to the northeast of my hole.

So, as far as treatment, I tried vaseline and lotions, to keep it 'moisturized'. That didn't work.  Next, I tried Baby powder, to try to dry it out. That didn't work either, but it felt good.  Tried both of these for upwards of a week each.

My next idea was ""New Skin Liquid Bandage"", which I tend to like for paper cuts, etc. I had some around, so I tried it out. STINGS LIKE HELL!

So, I went to Walgreens to have a look around, and I found a product called ['Skin Crack Care"" by Nexcare](http://www.nexcare.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/NANexcare/Nexcare/ProductCat/~/Skin-Crack-Care?N=4326+3294631800&amp;rt=rud). It's very similar to the New Skin product, except it seems to use a different solvent which doesn't sting, and it takes a bit longer to dry.  I started doing this about two weeks ago, and today the fissure is almost complete healed. I'm going to continue it for another week or so.  I can hear the cries for more pics already!

I should add that I am fortunate enough to have a caring partner who is willing to be coaxed to applying the treatment. Pretty important really, because of the contortions you have to hold while the damn stuff dries. And you don't want to get the product in the wrong places because it can really seal you up good when it dries.  edit: I should add that I reapply the product every day or two.

Other things I'm doing... washing with the shower hose every time I dump.
Also, I'm cutting out nuts and any other undigestible bits and pieces. I'm convinced this is part of the problems.

I went a few times but not as much as one would expect to go in 2 weeks.

I figured it was to do with the new foods we were eating.  (everyone who came on holiday got blocked up).

However, when we got back I had the same problem.  I was blocked up.    The blockage problem has *kinda* sorted itself but I would still like some advice please.

Even then, I often find that over half of my successful sessions result in my turdcutter's early termination, or sometimes the shit just breaks on its own. So at most, there's a piece left inside about the length of a AA battery that bothers me.

The most reliable way I've found to get it out is to half-squat on a sitting toilet, meaning I sit but put one foot on the seat and squeeze it out. Alternate feet and eventually it gives.

I'm thinking that it's this vicious cycle making a pocket of sorts for that remainder poo which acts as a seed for my next session, as often it is darker and lumpier. My poops often start out as a type I stool and gradate higher up the scale, ideally never far past type II.

*First:* It is my opinion that there are 3 things in life that you should *always* spend good money on - a mattress, your shoes, and toilet paper. Just think of the amount of time you spend with each, &amp; how each of those three items can either make or break your day... each and every day.

*Second:* [Squatting rocks.](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2010/08/dont_just_sit_there.html) I use an upside down laundry basket to prop my feet on in front of me, but after doing a little bit of research tonight, I may invest in a [footstool such as this one](http://www.squattypotty.com/Squatty-Ecco-p/sp-plastic.htm) that allows me to squat with my feet/legs more towards the side instead of straight out front.

**Anecdote time!**

So, one night I was out running errands and I *really* had to go. I stopped in at a fast food joint to go. Squatting wasn't possible, and I was in there for some time. Of course their toilet paper was absolutely awful as well - unfoldable, thin, and worse - very coarse. When I woke up the next morning, my ass itched sooooo much that I couldn't stand it - I already had [Tuck's Witch Hazel wipes](http://www.tucksbrand.com/medicated-pads) due to having had hemorrhoids once before, but they weren't helping! I drove to the store, bought some [store-brand Prep-H suppositories](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Hemorrhoidal-Suppositories-24-Ct-Equate-Reduces-Internal-Swelling-Soothes-And-Protects-Hemorrhoidal-Suppositories-24/10324606) and actual-brand [mini tubes of the Prep-H ointment](http://www.preparationh.com/products/totables).

The Tuck's still aren't doing much and the suppositories burn so I void those within ten minutes. I think the cream is kind of working - I've figured out my hemorrhoid(s) are external this way, by the way. (Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew!) Halfway through work today (standing - I'm a cashier) I almost wanted to cry because it itched so much and there just wasn't a damn thing I could do about it except flex random ass muscles which made it worse!! If I'm not feeling better by the end of the week I'm going to have to go back to the doc... -sigh-

Anyway, I know my diet isn't 100% healthy. I've been doing better, but have recently indulged in fast food more often than usual. Learning that more fiber is good for hemorrhoids, I checked out the [link in the sidebar](http://www.wehealny.org/healthinfo/dietaryfiber/fibercontentchart.html), but it's listed alphabetically, so [here's another list of high fiber foods](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/high-fiber-foods/NU00582) that may or may not be more pleasing to read, as it's organized by type of food and fiber content.

**TL;DR:** After tonight, I'm now better prepared to prevent hemorrhoids in the future, and hope that you are too: more water, more fiber, less straining, more squatting, &amp; definitely good TP!

I poop at most once every 2 days, but have been known to go up to 4 days without going. When I haven't gone in over a day, I'll feel like I have to go, but won't be able to get it out. Then, my stomach gets visibly bloated and I feel too sick/uncomfortable to eat anything until I go again, which can be 12-24+ hours.

Anyway, [since then](http://www.reddit.com/r/shittingadvice/comments/q4y5h/girl_with_colossal_shits/), I've still had terribly large shits that still clog the toilet and would still happen 2x a week, if that. I did as many suggestions as you all said, with not much relief.

On vacation, my newly zealous health nut cousin was talking about how she eats to shit. (This was after they drove me to a mall so I can poop and not clog their toilet lol. Mall toilet clogged.) She told me a couple of things to try, and I decided why the hell not. Go dairy and soy free. I have never attempted this. I didn't think greek yogurt or cheese or milk was bad - it had protein!

I was also getting fed up with my acne, and she claims dairy and soy free is the best way to avoid acne. In addition, my eletrologist has been all up on epsom salt. I had been doing it wrong before and quit - I left the salt crystals on my face and it got everywhere. (When I first bought the epsom salt though, it said you can use it as a laxative. You just have to drink it. I remember I did that once and I pooped not even 30 seconds after - but I wonder if that was my body getting scared thinking I poisoned myself because of how terrible it tasted. I felt weird after and didn't do it again.) But now I wonder if soaking my face with epsom salt water is getting it into my bloodstream or something and causing it to work as a laxative affect (as well as helping my acne! awesome!)  My aunt is a nurse assistant or something and doesn't think so, but I wonder.

On top of that, I ran out of antibiotics for my acne. I don't think this has anything to do with me pooping a lot this week because I've been off antibiotics before and my pooping is always the same.

I don't know if it's a fluke this week because I ate poorly the week before (vacation) but again, before dieting and working out I always ate poorly and it never changed anything.

If you read the other post I made under this name, I wonder if coconut is a lubricant for pooping or something because I started eating coconut yogurt to replace greek yogurt. And almond milk and nuts to replace protein bars. Hmm...

**I started dairy/soy free and epsom salting on Monday. It is now Sunday. I have pooped almost once a day - 6x in 7 days!** Most of them no wipe! Completely and absolutely unheard of for me, and never in my life! I hope it keeps up! 


Now the question is - what exactly is making me poo? Is it going dairy/soy free? Or is it the epsom salt face soak? Is it the combination of the two? I have no problem doing this for the rest of my life if that's what it takes to poo. And yes, some were still quite large, while others were probably normal people sized shits.

So there's my advice to you guys, if I'm not jumping the gun as its only been a week. Go dairy and soy free, and try the epsom face soak. (Mix it with water so that its a liquid and not a crunchy paste, use a cotton ball and moisten your face as if it is a toner. Rinse off after an hour or so. It may get uncomfortably dry for you guys but as a sweaty person, I love it.)

The whole fam is on vacation in Greece at the moment (we are here every summer) and she is suffering her usual summer bout of constipation. She is usually fairly regular at home. The rest of us are champion shitters who have no problem going even multiple times a day.

Let me describe our diet and activities and you can tell me what you think is wrong. Breakfast for her consists of some whole wheat bread with peanut butter (she LOVES pb and eats it every day) and a couple of cups of coffee. We walk to the beach and go swimming for about an hour so physical activity is not an issue.

Lunch varies but we eat a LOT of vegetables - stuffed tomatoes with rice, broad beans, we've had beef stuffed vine leaves, and there is ALWAYS a Greek salad to which my mom helps her self to a generous portion. There is a lot of olive oil in the food we eat. I don't think she drinks a ton of water but we do eat a lot of watermelon and generally stay hydrated. Dinner is pretty similar.

My mom is also a creature of habit and takes a lot of time on the toilet at home. I'm wondering if her poop block could be psychological? The change in environment, maybe? Is it possible to eat TOO much fibre? Should she be drinking way more water?

Need advice for my graduation speech!,14,3,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/shittingadvice/comments/ssig3/ibs_help_need_advice_for_my_graduation_speech/,"Long Post, please bear with me.  I'll try to be as least melodramatic as possible, but this month is going to be very stressful for me to say the least.  Starting with the most stressful event:  I have to give a speech at graduation, take multiple AP tests, give several final presentation, and take finals.  My ""illness"" affects me daily in the sense I have raised paranoia and uncomfortableness in social situations because I either am afraid I'm going to poop myself or smell.  When I'm sitting down, I always feel like I have to go to the bathroom if that makes any sense...  Anyways for some more ""medical"" information:

I've been a vegetarian for the past 4 years and have recently only developed this illness.  I was diagnosed with IBS from a GI 5 months ago.  I was told to try various diets/supplements including lactose-intollerence, additional fiber (Benefiber-powder&amp;Pysllium Husk-Capsules), Celiacs (only blood test), and now I'm trying a low FODMAP diet.  Unfortunately none of these really helped (still waiting on seeing how the fodmap goes).

My symptoms aren't necessarily diherea (Though sometimes it happens).  It's more that my stools aren't solid at all (but not wet), and I have to go frequently (I could provide because I'm not entirely sure how to describe it aha).  My daily routine consists of  waking up, going to the bathroom, then twice during school (despite not eating during the day), then coming home going to the bathroom, usually going twice more during the night.

Obviously with it being IBS, it increases with stresses which is rampant through my life right now.  Usually whenever I present in front of people, I have to go to the bathroom two-three times beforehand just to make sure (but being on stage, I can't do that).  I'm often figitty and consequently sweat more when I have to go.  I really need some advice (whether that be medical or psychological) to get me through this next month without completely embarrassing myself.

She ran some tests and then referred me to a GI specialist. Unfortunately, the earliest appointment is in the middle of December, so I'd love advice/ideas for the meantime. 

This July I was hospitalized for 3 days with a campylobacter infection.  I shat green/bloody water for like a week straight. My bowels have not returned to normal. I've always been a bit poopy-- prone to beer shits, period shits, that sort of thing-- but my diarrhea has been *terrible* ever since I was sick. After leaving the hospital, I've had diarrhea 4/7 days of the average week. I made an appointment with my doctor after I saw a streak of blood on the toilet paper in September. It got better for a little bit in October and I had 3 whole weeks of mostly-solid stool with only 1 or 2 liquid episodes. But now it's returned with a vengeance.  It's been a week since I've seen an even vaguely normal looking turd. All my poop is completely liquid, bright orangey-yellow, greasy, and foul smelling. In addition, I'm bloated, flatulent, exhausted, and have dull, aching pain in my right upper quadrant, just under the rib. I can barely eat. Immodium doesn't do a thing to stem the tide. It's hard to sleep. I've lost like 20 lbs since July and I wasn't overweight before. And my anus is sore.

My standard blood tests came back normal-- no anemia, no signs of infection. My stool tests came back normal (though they were taken during my brief October remission, so that might not be accurate), with no indication of parasites, viruses, bacteria, or even blood. I had a liver function panel as well this past week-- normal. I'm negative for Hep A, B, and C. The only weird thing in all my testing was from my ultrasound: my liver has a slight coarseness that was so mild the radiologist considered not even telling me about it. My pancreas, spleen, appendix, and gallbladder all looked fine. No lumps, bumps, spots, stones, enlargements, distensions, or obstructions.

I'm a 24 year old, normal-weight, female nonsmoker with a reasonably healthy/mostly vegetarian diet, and moderate alcohol consumption (&lt; 5 standard drinks/week). I have been rather inactive in the past few months, but that's been more the result of illness than anything else. I also have been diagnosed with GAD and major depression, but nothing more serious than that. 

What is going on with me? Doesn't most inflammatory bowel disease have an impact on liver function and blood test results? Wouldn't gallstones/pancreatitis have shown up on the ultrasound?

When I was younger, I would constantly hold it in so I wouldn't have to go to the bathroom. Because of this, it would hurt very much to go #2, so I would be afraid to and avoid it.

Even several years later, I still suffer the effects of my younger years. I don't have the urge to poop except maybe once or twice a week, my stools are always WAY larger than healthy and therefore are very hard to pass, especially because they tend to harden up. It is always painful, and very uncomfortable to carry around 5 or 6 days of waste in my bowels.

First of all, I'm curious of how to get myself back to normal. I know laxatives are supposed to be used occasionally, but I need a more long-term solution. I eat pretty well, lots of fiber and fruits and veggies, and I drink lots of water.

Should I try enemas? Any long-term medication for this stuff?

I don't have liquid diarrhea, just very very soft stools. Sometimes the water will have floaties indicative of liquid poo, but for the most part it looks like soft clay, and there is a LOT of it. Like, past the water line and then some a lot.


I eat plenty of fiber, drink plenty of water, eat a fuckton of vegetables, regularly incorporate legumes (lentils and black beans mostly) in my diet, don't really drink (alcohol) all that often, and have eliminated diarrhea-causing foods like prunes and apple juice. I also stopped eating spicy food in January, thinking my infatuation with Sriracha wasn't benefitting me. I've already talked it over with my doctor and none of her suggestions are helping.

Which hasn't gone according to plan. Initially during my senior year of HS I was absent and went home early because of all the cramps and pains I would get. I would go to the doctor and hospital, where they would give me laxatives and tell me to eat more fiber and fruits, but did not end up working. These are three events that happened within a few weeks of my last weeks of HS.

The first time I went my doctor for this problem she told me to take an enema. She told me to buy a double pack, so I can take one on ""tuesday"" and the other one on ""wednesday"" and that should clear up my problem. So I proceeded with her instructions and when I did it, both times they only thing that came out was the liquid and pebble-like pieces of poop about 10 of them each time I did it.

The second time I went I told her it didn't work so she told me buy a mineral oil laxative and that I should take it a couple times every day, and while this did work my stools were probably 2 inches in length, 1 inch in width, and 1 inch in height but only came out about twice a week

By the third time I was already fed up with my doctor so I ended up going to the hospital where they took an x-ray. The doctor told me I was very much constipated, and while I didn't see the x-ray, his facial expression gave me the impression that I didn't have a little constipation but rather I was almost filled to the brim. So he prescribed me some pills, that I ended up finding out were stool softeners, and told me to each more fruits. The pills worked in the same vein as the mineral oil did, I was able to poop, only small amounts and it was about twice a week as well.

Before and after these events are tried a lot of other things that didn't end up work, and throughout the whole time I was eating fruits and fiber because I was told they were natural laxatives.

After that I stopped going to the doctor, my problem didn't go away so i just ignored it until summer came. When summer rolled around I started to eat more fruits, fiber and all around more healthier and I started exercising more. I started pooping about 2 to 3 times a week, but they were still small stools and it still continues to this day except now it's about 1 to 2 times a week.


Well now it's the end of summer, I'm going to college and I'm still constipated. I wouldn't have a problem if I was just constipated, but every time I eat something throughout the day you can hear the gas travel through my intestines. Which has caused some rather embarrassing moments in class, which I'm getting very tired of. I'm able to play it off as ""I'm lactose intolerant and I probably ate some dairy"", but I'm not sure how long before the stop believing me.


Please help!! Is there any advice you can give me? Any laxative/medicine that will clean out my system entirely? Any input would be great because I'm tired of having this problem.

I was thinking of buying that medicine that doctors give patients when they're going to go through a colonoscopy or something similar, but I'm not sure. Is there something I can do that can flush out my entire system within a few days, preferably in three days?

I'm hoping anything you guys recommend can be done within three days because through out the week I have classes scattered throughout the days and I don't want to end up having an accident in school. I want to be able to do this on my days off which are from thursday evening through monday evening.

please please help:(

Still, I decided to read more about it.  After reading more, I got some and it has made a HUGE difference for me in the last two weeks.

I have IBSd.  I was taking HUGE doses of Imodium each day so that I could work and not soil myself.  This would cause very painful constipation that hurt to pass.  I had stool #6 but pushed myself to #1 because I felt that was easier to deal with.

Psyllium seed husks draw water.  For diarrhea, this adds substance to your poo so that you aren't just uncontrollably dumping water and fluffy bits of poo.  Since the poo is solid, you can hold it if you need to.  Severity and frequency of the diarrhea is greatly reduced.  On the flip side, since the poo you are now able to store has LOTS of water in it, it doesn't hurt to pass.

If you drop a capsule in water, it swells and makes kind of a gel.

It does not help with diarrhea due to eating greasy food - I suspect the little husks cannot absorb grease.  It does not help with diarrhea due to eating spicy food - I suspect that is a completely different mechanism of causing diarrhea.  I don't know, really, I'm not a doctor.

I am 23 M, from India and currently living in United States. I have irregular bowel movements at different times, may be due to the food. 

Recently i come to realize that i might be lactose intolerant. After drinking milk, or cereal i could not hold my poo and i have leg cramps  until i poo. This happen within 15-30 minutes of  having milk.

As a child, everyone thought i had poo problems and holding it but i never realized until recently that it can be due to the food habits that i have. Being from india, my mom used to give me milk 2-3 times a day, and we eat yogurt with rice as part of every day meal. Its strange how i had that much lactose.(this makes me wonder if i am lactose intolerant or i am just assuming it)

I used to think that i was having a healthy diet since i poo (2-3) times a day. Recently due to my food habits of not drinking milk, and eating only yogurt rice once in a while i poo once in a day. 

I eat rice two times a day in my meal usually, and bread once. I poo once a day recently. It doesn't come as easy as it used to come. This might depend on a lot of factors. 

Today, when i ate one pomegranate i went 3 times to poo. So my question is what is normal ? Pooing 3 times a day, or once and how this poo should be ? Should it be like liquid, solid ( i see food i ate in my poo) ?

The bulk of my problem is in the title... I don't think I've gone a day in the past couple years without popping at least 3 times.  Often it's diarrhea, which usually means I'll be pooping 3 or 4 times before lunch.  Other times, it's just generally loose and I can almost always identify food that I've recently eaten in the toilet (particularly fruits, vegetables and nuts).  Can't remember the last time I had a good, solid, brown poop that smelled like poo.  That's I guess the one upside is that my poops don't really smell all that bad/strong.

Another issue I have that is probably related is intense itching on my sphincter.  Of course scratching it makes it irritated and therefore worse. It generally only happens at night when I go to bed, but not always.  I have a theory that this might correlate to when I eat really spicy food, but I don't know for sure as I love spicy food and eat it often.

I realized that people get worried about the smell, that they are supposed to go once every day, that it's something people actively think about and get self-conscious about.

I don't know what to do about that either) I end up making everything feel much worse, and eventually sometimes I just can't wait any longer and have to deal with the sounds and the smells that result.

Need advice.,9,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/shittingadvice/comments/17s9qu/serious_ibs_caffeine_is_the_only_thing_that_helps/,"I've suffered from fairly serious IBS since early high school. I would describe my primary symptoms as feelings of incomplete evacuation, and constant feelings of cramps, pain, discomfort, or occasionally burning when my colon isn't completely clear. I also get diarrhea fairly frequently, depending on the kind of food I eat, though I also seem to have issues feeling ""clean"" even after I've been on the toilet for a while with diarrhea.

The only thing that seems to help me to any degree is caffeine. That is, if I am able to set out quite a lot of free time, I'll drink lots of caffeine before going to the bathroom or even take some with me, and I'll try to defecate as much as possible. The caffeine seems to cause a strong impetus to ""go"". My defecation is also broken up into different ""sessions"". That is, I might defecate a moderate amount, then 10-20 minutes later feel a bit more and defecate that out. Repeat ad nauseam for an hour or several hours. Drinking caffeine in between each ""session"" makes it much easier and speeds things up quite a bit. And if I do this long enough, I'll eventually feel like I've gotten most everything out.

Obviously if I know I won't have easy access to a toilet, I carefully avoid caffeine.

I've tried quite a few different prescription drugs, including constipation-inducing ones and laxatives. I've also tried consuming large amounts of fiber mixed in drinks, but that just seemed to create more fecal matter in the long run and overall made discomfort worse. I tried flax seed oil capsules, which just made me have diarrhea constantly without really making me go more frequently. Nothing seems to address the underlying issue, which is the pain and discomfort I feel when there's fecal matter in what I believe is the lower half of my large intestine.

Also, I received a colonoscopy but nothing very abnormal was found in my small or large intestine.

They were often singular, huge clumps of stool that looked kind of like the normal 'pellet' shapes all mashed together, usually just one at a time and often leaving me feeling 'incomplete'. It seemed strange to be taking such a small dump. 

Then in January I started to feel generally weird and have strange, unusual pains in my stomach on and off. It's never really consistent. I would often feel so incomplete that I ended up starting to take fiber and magnesium. Since then, I can go easier (and go 2-3 times a week) but it's weird.

What happens is there is an initial part where I get a sudden, hardcore urge to crap and that part seems to slide out easily (though it has an odd feeling and seems to slow midway through). The rest of it is either one of two things: Somewhat thinner stool (not pencil thin, but definitely a bit tighter and snaky) or it comes out in a peanut butter like consistency, and often very slowly. By the end I often have some stuck and have to wipe a lot. Sometimes I have itching down there as well, but it can't just be hemorrhoids because of the feelings in my stomach. The strange gurgling, the weird, slight, migrating pains, the feeling of trapped gas...It's nothing crippling, but it has annoyed me for the past year.

Does anyone have any insight onto what's going on? My doctor mentioned IBS as a possibility but I'm still not sure he fully understands the extent of my symptoms.

I started having problems shitting a few weeks ago. My problem is that when it's just about to come out, my anus tenses up and the poop gets sucked back in. I'm not sure if the poop is passing too slowly, or if it's a tension problem? I always have to keep pushing for it to come out. Usually this ends up with several failed attempts, with my anus tensing and the poop sucking back in a bunch of times, before I'm successful. Luckily I haven't had to use suppositories lately, but pooping has become incredibly stressful and annoying.

I've been increasing the fiber in my diet lately, with eating dried prunes, drinking prune juice, eating more fruit, and I've also been trying to drink more water, but none of that has helped with this. I've been more regular and the stool is softer now, which is an improvement for me, but with my seemingly sudden pooping problems now, it's just adding a lot more stress to my day.

There's no pain when I poop or wipe, so it's not hemorrhoids. But could there still be slight swelling of the anus that isn't painful?

I have my own experience and for the sake of clarity I'll tell this out of order:

- Likely going to the doctor tomorrow, I wanted to share my experience to see if anyone has anything to add and also looking for feedback on a shitting with a hemorrhoid technique listed below.

- Aged 27/Male, I had a colonoscopy because of the hemorrhoid and previous cancer issue.  The colonoscopy was clear of pollops, but he sent me home with very nice pictures during the procedure including one of the hemorrhoid right next to my butthole.  He said to increase the fiber in my diet.  If I see a new Dr. I'll take the pictures.

- I have a struggle with fiber because of eating a lot of protein.  I have metamucil, it seems to work ok.  The problem is even with fiber supplement, I would occasionally have a hard, but not over sized bowel movement that would be painful and I feel like it would set me back a lot.

- Especially after the hemorrhoid was an issue, I never force a movement, but those hard/larger movements would come through and cause significant pain.  I'm sure many are aware of the tear in flesh feeling.  I started using a 'pre-pinch' strategy that I am looking for feedback on.  For a while now I haven't risked a tear instead I just do an early pinch and let the movement come out in pinches.  Using cottonelle moist wipes, carrying a plastic bag with wipes in public as well.

- The colonoscopy was in late January of this year, after 2 months of putting off going to the doctor.  I had a major ""set back"" in May with unfortunate circumstances that led to a severe bowel movement that produced lots of blood and severe pain for the rest of the day.

- Here it is July and no major set back or major bowel movement but the blood is back in full force that is leaving a double-golf ball sized blot on the first pass of my moist wipe.",,False,,t5_2rg3c,False,,,True,t3_wsfm2,http://www.reddit.com/r/shittingadvice/comments/wsfm2/an_ongoing_battle_with_a_hemorrhoid/,

A brief explanation why I ask this question. I love to shit the hard end of the spectrum, type 1-3 because usually almost no wiping is needed at all. 

The soft end of the spectrum (5-7) needs much more wiping but it is still bearable. 

However, I have serious problems with **type4** which is defined as ""Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft"". When shitting a type4, my colon does not get empty. I simply cannot push all the stuff out. A big chunk is left at the end of the colon, often hanging out of the anus, and I have to wipe forever without a chance of reaching the *clean anus state*. Meanwhile I make pushing attempts again in the hope of eventually emptying my colon, which I cannot accomplish for some reason, hence I have to start the endless wiping over. 

In the past year I had all different types, fairly divided, with a frequency of 1 shit/day. Recently type2 and type3 is becoming more common, which I consider to be a good tendency: the less wiping, the better.  Also, the frequency is descending: sometimes it occurs that I have no shit in 2 or 3 days. Only problem is, type4 is still reappearing again and again: roughly every third shit is of type4.

What could possibly be the cause of having **type4** shit? I noticed for example that there is a strong correlation between going out, drinking alcohol (especially beer) and having type6 the next day.

Do you think such diet and/or life-hack exists that guarantees you always shit type2 or type3?

Optional: any tricks that help when dealing with type4?

I got a call, ""hey, what're you doing right now? We're going to check out this new buffet that just opened for so and so's bday."" anyway, after I went home I felt like I really needed to have a BM, but only gas came out. After a while the pressure in my stomach telling me I needed to poop intensified, but only gas came out. This happened for a while so I gave up and went to bed hoping I could sleep it off.

About an hour or so later, I woke up because the pain was too much for me to sleep, but still bearable. I tried to poop, but just gas. I felt a little bit better, but not by much. I tried to sleep it off, but I couldn't, I just tossed and turned. About an hour later the pain was staggering so I tried my luck in the restroom. Right when I was about to give up I felt everything rush out of me. I had the worst case of diarrhea I have ever experienced. It was just a brown puddle in my toilet and it smelled pretty bad. After wiping, I stood up and felt another rush about to come so I sat down. Obviously I was sweating quite a bit, so I drank water afterwards for fear of dehydration.

I went back to sleep, but I still had this slight pain in my stomach, I woke up hourly because I had more diarrhea. It was weird because it felt like I had a lot coming out of me, but there was more water than actual poop. Like, instead of an all brown puddle, I could point out where's my piss and poo. I think I actually shitted water.

This happened all Wednesday morning until around 5am where I felt a gag coming up. nothing serious but I forced out a cough, which made me throw up. After cleaning my mess I took a shower and I think I had more diarrhea.

Wednesday morning my mom gave me some anti-diarrhea medicine, after having another case of diarrhea (this time it was mostly water though). She told me to take one pill before and after school. I also couldn't really eat. I forced myself to eat dinner that night.

School was pretty tough because I just felt groggy. The only way I could explain it was that it was similar to when I had surgery and was prescribed some pain medication, plus having a constipated feeling. I don't know if it was from the medicine or from the lack of sleep.

Now I havent had a BM since yesterday morning, and I do feel a little bit better, I just have this discomfort in my stomach. It ranges from slightly tolerable to cramping all over, and when it gets to that point the only thing that comes out is gas.

Please help me shit and empty out whatever shit is in my bowels.

Thanks for your time :)

Also, the only thing I've been consuming today is a mix of cranberry juice and gatorade.

TL;DR Had food poisoning, constant diarrhea all night/morning and I threw up once. Took some anti-diarrhea medicine and now I havent pooped in over a day.

I somewhat frequently get a very itchy asshole. A majority of the time it's after I poop, but not always. And it's not always right after. Yesterday I pooped around 4 and felt it much later. It also tends to ... leak, I guess. Meaning I'll be sitting at work and I just kind of smell sweaty ass. Then I'll wipe and it there will be light brown liquid. Sometimes it's just itchy, but the leakiness is always accompanied by the itchiness. Showering after a poo will sometimes make it ever worse. This will happen for a few days and then I'll have a good few days where it's fine.

I probably don't poop normally. It can vary from twice a day for a stretch to every second or third day. Every second or third day was actually normal for me before all this started. I rarely feel constipated. And then I'd say every one or two weeks I'll get diarrhea requiring multiple trips to the bathroom. I've improved my diet vastly, added fiber supplements, etc. I feel it's helped somewhat. I'm also trying to exercise more but so far no results there.

That worked until I started having my periods at 11 and would hold poop in until the heavy flow stopped, because trying to take a dump while bleeding and cramping is no fun,  even though the hormones at that time of the month would (and still does) make poops softer and easier, and this habit disrupted my semi-regularity.

I apologize for any grammatical or spelling errors. This was typed in a flurry so please forgive me.

I've done plenty of googling but everything is ridiculously vague.

Starting about a month ago, I started having really irregular bowel movements. I used to have a 'good' BM either once a day or every other day; good healthy poops. Out of no where, I've started having 'soft' and 'loose' stools. Not quite diarrhea, (at what point is it even diarrhea?!) but soft with multiple pieces rather than one big one. I've also been accompanied with not necessarily rot gut, but a general unsteadiness and unease; I don't feel awful, but I don't feel good either.

They are accompanied with quite a bit of yellow-white mucus mixed in and sometimes a white fuzzy exterior if they're in pebble form. They're either loose/soft pieces or hard little pebbles.

These stools happen around 2 - 3 times a day and cause mild to moderate discomfort before and after passing.

I've also started getting weird side aches in both the front upper left side of my abdomen (just under my rib) and around the front right side (usually lower abdomen). Feels kind of like a side stitch that you get from running when you're out of shape. These aches are right after eating most of the time though I seldom encountered this pain sensation till about 4-5 weeks ago.

Is this diet related or maybe a bacteria/infection problem?

Also, I started feeling ill around the same time I found out my cat had tape worm but I'm pretty sure it's not tape worm. But after I found out, I felt physically ill for about a week after because the idea was upsetting. Is it possible that it's just an overreaction combined with anxiety that could cause this? It's been going on for about 4 - 5 weeks.

I can provide more details if needed, just ask.

Had to strain slightly to get it out as it was a bit larger than normal. However, when I wiped I noticed some bright red blood on the tissue. Not a lot, but not a tiny amount either. Upon seeing this I decided to investigate my shit closer. There was a bit of blood on the end of the shit. 
This has happened before randomly but never lasts more than a once or twice in a row and then it disappears. However, I have had back pain below my shoulder on my right side the past two days (not sure if it's related, or just a pulled muscle or something)

I'm a junior in college, i've been having problems with hemorrhoids for a few years. Last year, I had a thrombosed hemorrhoid which was one of the most painful things I have ever experienced. I also probably have some other problems- my self diagnosis was Levator ani syndrome, and probably Irritable Bowel Syndrome or something. 

Since the thrombosed roid last year (which a colon-rectal specialist tried to excise, but it came back and I just let it go away on its own), I have increased my fiber intake by a lot. I have either a Fiber one or fiber plus bar for breakfast (fiber plus tastes better but I thought I might be allergic to wheat so I switched back to fiber one). I usually eat some type of deli sandwich and chips for lunch, and take Konsyl afterwards. I eat relatively healthy for dinner, usually pasta, chicken, or fish, and I've been trying to go running 1-2 times a week and eat more fruits and veggies (though maybe not enough).

Just about every time I poop, which is either once a day or every other day, it's very painful initially and seems like its way too hard for how much fiber I'm having. The hemorrhoids are still there, and I just can't figure out what to do to get them to go away. I got all kinds of different creams and stuff to help with symptoms, but its not going to fix the underlying cause, whatever it is.
I also get stomach cramps way too often (like right now, for example). I just had a philly cheese steak and fries for dinner, probably my least healthy meal all month. The frequency makes me think I have some kind of food allergy, or something I can take steps to correct.

 I was going to try this diet to see if I can identify what is wrong: http://www.woodmed.com/DietElimRech.htm
(It will probably be a little bit hard seeing as I'm eating dorm food and don't have a kitchen, although I do have a car)

Anyways, does anyone have any advice for me? I'm just getting really frustrated, it sucks to be in pain most of the time when sitting down.

On top of that, I am still having random sharp pains in the middle-ish left part of my stomach, nausea, bloating and overall cramping. My family doctor wrote me a referral to get a CT scan. Of course, I'm assuming the worst: twisted intestines, tumor in my bowels causing blockage, etc.

So, I've had severe IBS that seems to have been getting worse over the past year. In fact, it has gotten so bad that I am currently unable to hold down a job or go to school. I have days where I am incapacitated by abdominal pain, frequent urgent shits, and something I have come to think of as ""constirrhea"", which is where you have urgent liquid shits that may take literally sometimes hours and do not really happen ""on demand"". You know you need to shit, but you can't, but when it happens it is a crisis, so sometimes its not even worth it to leave the toilet until the spasming stops. I don't know if anyone else has ever experienced this, but sometimes when I'm having a particularly difficult experience, I will have this terrible nausea come over me and will begin salivating at an alarmingly rapid rate (like I could fill a cup). If this goes on for a while, as in if I don't find a way to stop and go lay down, I will inevitably vomit.

 I have been seeing a gastroenterologist, and so far he has not given me anything helpful. He is convinced it is an issue of cholinergic response so he has given me a series of anticholinergics that either don't work or make things worse. One helped a little at first, but would trigger an attack any time I would go through ""withdrawal"" which was after about seven hours. The only thing that has ever helped is any time I have had occasion to take an opioid. I was in some pain and I took a single vicodin and my symptoms improved dramatically. My doc is unwilling to prescribe opioids for this, which to me is ridiculous if it is possible that a small dose of something as weak as codeine would make it possible for me to return to work and school, but in my state they are really cracking down on doctors for prescribing this stuff. 

Knowing that there are a lot of opioid receptors in the gut, and that the endogenous opioids our bodies produce play a role in regulating motility (this being why the chief side effect of opioids is constipation), I was recommended by a friend to try a drug called ""kratom"", a legal, non-opioid plant product from Thailand that bonds to opioid receptors in a similar way and has been used in eastern medicine as an anti-diarrheal (and stimulant). I notice this drug helps substantially on days when I'm having the worst of it, but I can't take it everyday because it is addictive and also produces pretty nasty constipation the next day.

There's a specific spot in my colon, like right under the right bottom rib, that feels cold if I sit a certain way (very straight and awkard), and gives me nausea if I slouch. It feels cold in that spot if I sit ""right"", and it gets warm if I sit a different way. I think this is because something is going numb. It feels exactly like when my legs go numb from sitting a certain way. They get warm as they go numb, and feel cold when they go back to normal. And also, my shits are much smaller now. It doesn't hurt or anything, but there is the nausea. Weirdly, it doesn't mess with my appetite. So I can feel nauseous and still be eating at the same time, which is really strange.

This kind of concerns me, so I'm likely going to make an appointment soon. It feels as if there's an object or like my colon is swollen in one spot. I was initially concerned about cancer, but I don't have any other symptoms and I'm otherwise pretty healthy, and young.

So, I've suffered from anxiety for awhile—the formal diagnosis is generalized anxiety disorder—and one of the most frustrating parts of it is dealing with panic attacks.  I'm not on any sort of meds at the moment, nor do I think that's something I'd consider at this point, so I pretty much just have to grin and bear it when I feel one coming.  I experience muscle spasms (not flailing, but my torso will shake), hyperventilation, heart palpitations...all of that is bad enough, but the absolute worst thing is the diarrhea.  I guess that the body switches over from the parasympathetic nervous system to the sympathetic nervous system, and dumps (ha!) whatever it doesn't need—in this case, the food it was working on digesting.  The other stuff, I can work to conceal, but once that bowel stuff kicks in, I need to get to a bathroom pretty quickly.

So far, I've always managed to make it to a restroom in time.  However, without being too specific, there's an event coming up in a few days where I anticipate not being able to access a restroom for about 8-10 hours.  It's also an event so nerve-wracking that it induces mini panic attacks if I even THINK about it too much.  Understandably, I'm really worried about what'll happen if my body decides to give my food an express pass to My Pants, U.S.A. in the middle of the event.  My only seemingly foolproof plan is to just forgo eating 24 hours prior to the event, which is honestly not that bad, especially considering the alternative.

Later that night, the pain escalated and whenever I attempted to go and take a shit, nothing would come out. I ended up just taking that pain like a man and went to bed. The next morning, at around 5AM, I woke up sweating with a huge amount of pressure just waiting to burst out of my asshole. I rushed to my bathroom and just gave it my 100%.

I've had issues in the bathroom for the last 2-3 years.  I cannot even remember how it started.  I chalked it up to something like hemorrhoids but it kept bugging me and wouldn't go away.  I was in and out of the doc's office for a year, family, specialist, neuro and no one had an answer.  I've had several MRI's, anoscope, treated for hemorrhoids. Treated for nerve issues, had gluten tests, blood tests and more.

My problem is that I feel like I have a lump in my butt, right at the opening of the anus, its generally nagging more than painful, it can hurt during BM, rarely any blood.  Typical hemorrhoid stuff, right?  I was told I had some internal roids but nothing that seemed like it should be causing some of my other symptoms.  Other symptoms include, lower back pain, pain in buttocks, tingling in feet, urinary retention, bowel retention?  When i am trying to go, peeing or pooping, it feels like my body is fighting not to let it out.  In the middle of peeing, most of the time, I lock up and stop mid stream, I have absolutely no control over this, its much easier if I have my pants off.

It flares, its worse some days, I just had a good three weeks with little to no issues, in and out of the bathroom in under a few minutes, clean wipes.  Then back to this for no reason.

It's weird because I can remember the *exact moment* it started. I was at work receiving instructions when I felt a fart coming on.

It was not a fart

I had sharted myself, and had to go home and change (luckily I was allowed to go). But then the next time I tried to go... well... I couldn't without pushing above the average amount.

This persisted til October when I went to my doctor for it, I told him I had used laxatives a couple times (didn't want to get dependent) but took the occasional fibre supplement (which helped a bit, but not much). He said since I'm young it almost certainly wasn't colon cancer, told me to take more supplements, and he sent me on my way.

I took them every once in a while until about March, when I decided to buckle down and take them every day because it was getting worse. But then one day when I was hanging out with a friend at their house, it started to get sore after going, I thought it was natural, I was often going to the toilet, pushing, and having nothing coming out, but wiping anyway, so I assumed it a rash possibly.

Then two days later, the pain was so intense I thought I was going to pass out, by the time I was finished I had only my boxers on, so (naturally) I made a doctor's appointment. He told me that I had probably tore my anus (never before did I think I would use ""butt hurt"" in a sentence without a trace of humour) and suggested I stay on the pills and take ""Restorolax"". I've taken it every other day since then (big fuckin' packages, says it lasts from 1-3 days) as well as my regular supplements, and this was 2 weeks ago. On friday I had pain again, and saturday as well, not as severe, but troubling to say the least.

I'm starting to get depressed, my doctor just suggests fiber pills, and I don't eat EXTREMELY unhealthily, I've been cutting back on fast food and been eating leafy greens and I've been stuck like this for almost a year, I'm contemplating going to the Doctor's and demanding a colonoscopy.

Okay, so for the past several months, I'd say starting in October 2012 to present day (April 9), I've been having these weird shits. They are kinda skinny, but generally represent 3 and 4 on the Bristol stool scale. However, when I am about done with said piece of shit, there is a sploot/mush of diarrhea-esque poop that signifies the end of me shitting. This represents the 6 on a Bristol stool scale. In other words, it starts as a log then ends as a muddy puddle. 

So far, the stool is a normal color, meaning no black/red/green/not-brown colors anywhere. I should mention that I have had these shits several times since they started in October. I have been dieting since around September and have lost 20 pounds. I'm confident that the weight loss was solely based on my dieting. I barely drink any alcohol. I say this because I've been told that alcohol consumption can play a role in your poo. Anyway, I've only recently (the last three days) started feeling crampy and bloated in the lower abdomen.

Sometimes after taking a shit I get a burning sensation and have a small bit of bright red blood on the toilet paper. This happens rarely now, and seems to stop completely when I don't drink coffee. Anyhow, while inspecting my asshole to see what was going on, I noticed I had a few little tears(fissures) and I even made one bleed by stretching my ass too much. So I guess that explains the bleeding, I hope. However, I noticed something else a little deeper in that looked like a little ""spike"" or ""point"" that was sort of white-ish at the tip. This instantly shot me into a panic and I couldn't sleep for the first two nights before I decided to go to a walk in clinic in my town to see a practitioner.

I explained my fissure symptoms and then told her about this abnormal looking spike I found. She didn't have much to say about it, but she examined  the outside of my anus and stuck a finger in my ass briefly(VERY briefly, not sure if she was thorough enough to be honest) and diagnosed me with anal fissure(s) after spotting one at the 2 o'clock position. She told me she didn't feel anything abnormal or that felt as if it didn't belong there and that I didn't have hemorrhoids and that I shouldn't worry too much unless I had a lot of bleeding or a change in bowel habits. I'm worried that she missed something because of not being thorough enough, she didn't pay much mind to about what I said I saw when inspecting myself.

My bowel habits are very normal as well. I'll use the bathroom the same time every morning(as soon as waking up) and then some days I'll go 1-2 more times, usually twice if I drink coffee. My only symptoms seem to be burning after a BM when the fissure(s) bleed and a bit of anal moisture through out the day that continues until I take a hot bath; but this could be explained by the presence of anal fissures.


EDIT: ***I looked again and this time rather than looking like a spike it looks more like a small pimple; it's right on the inside on the front portion(towards my balls) of my anus and I have to slightly pull it out to see it.

**First some backstory:**
I am caucasian, 23F. I eat fairly healthy, no soda or fast food. Ever since I can remember I've had problems in the poo department. I had a finicky tolerance to dairy and I'd go in cycles it seemed between constipation and diarrhea. During the diarrhea cycles I'd get an upset/icky stomach, then have to rush to the toilet and where I'd get hot flashes, cold sweats, and I'd just feel *horrible*.

The constipation was far less common, but wasn't much better. I wouldn't get ""sick"" feeling, but passing stool was painful to the point of me being in tears sometimes. I would also go multiple days without going. I can't really think of a time in my life I ever had normal BM's. It was always like that.

I talked a few times to my Dr about it, and she pondered IBS but wasn't certain. I tried Fiber therapy by taking *Citracel*, and also tried *Align*. Neither did a damn thing. I was given a prescription for sublingual *Hyosciamine* to help with the diarrhea, and was also told to get some OTC *Miralax* and some generic stool softener. I used them occasionally but of course, they only treated symtoms and nothing ever got better.

**Fast forward to today:**
I've been on a variety of medications for awhile which I believe have altered my BM's. I take daily:

* 200mg Seroquel XR
* 300mg Effexor
* 100mg Topamax
* a Multivitamin, Vitamin D, and Biotin

Since taking these medications I rarely if ever get diarrhea anymore and am now stuck on a constant constipation cycle. I have a BM about once a week, consistently ranking a one, sometimes a two, on the [Bristol Stool Scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Stool_Scale). It has become increasingly painful. I generally stuff a cloth or part of my shirt in my mouth to muffle my groans and screams. For the past few months I have been seeing blood, more and more it seems. Now when I wipe, the tissue is *soaked* with blood - no stool. The last few times there were clots. Similar to [this photo](http://i.imgur.com/fm9aJ.jpg).^(not mine, found online)

I am torn about going to the doctor since my parents' insurance has changed and just a simple checkup might cost me hundreds of dollars now (I live in the US). I was laid off a few months ago and have been really struggling just to pay bills, so there's no way I can afford it. My parents heard of my troubles and urge me to go in, but I'm wary.

Firstly, I have been with the same doctor forever and I'm wondering if I should get a second opinion, since I never got any answers in the past. Second, I have a lot of social anxiety, as well as body issues... and frankly the thought of something like a colonoscopy is mortifying. I don't want to do it if I don't have to...

I know this isn't a substitute for medical advice, but what do you guys think? 

Thanks

So at the moment I wake up and immediately go for a dump then shower. Problem is that this yields a 50% success rate, often the shit will be very reluctant to come out and when it does it's in little clumps that take ages to come out.

I've always had strange pooping habits- I was lactose intolerant as a child and was notorious for pooping once every three days as an infant.  Now as a college student, I shit literally all the time.  I suspect that I have IBS but I'll break it down for you.

In the morning, about 20 minutes after eating something I have a large 3/4 thats usually a no-wipe.  I know it's time to poop, there is little pushing, it just happens.  Then for the rest of the day, anywhere from 1 to 4 more times, I'll have small 1/2 poops.

Also on a daily basis, I am constantly farting and burping.  The burps are usually after eating meat because they REEK and I know exactly what I've eaten when I burp.  I have stomach pains on a near daily basis, but those don't bother me too much.

But the real reason I think I have IBS is because of what I call ""episodes"".  These are usually 40 minutes after a morning or evening meal and my colon decides whatever is in it needs to come out now and fast.  I usually start by getting really hot then I cramp underneath my belly button.  I need to bee-line for the bathroom then I'm usually in there for 10-20 minutes enjoying water-y poop.  I feel like I'm done, stand up for a second, then need to sit right back down.  I average about one a week and they suck.

From what I can tell, it's not diet related.  I've been keeping track of the previous two meals before an episode and it ranges from Chipotle to eggs to a baked potato and some vegetables.  In general I don't have a great diet but I eat okay- lots of fiber, veggies, and I drink a ton of water.  I do need to exercise more.

Are my pooping habits normal? Do you think I have IBS? I've spoken to my doctor about it and he said ""yeah, probably"" and prescribed an anti-spasmodic so that once I identify what foods trigger an episode I can take it, but I can't figure it out.",,False,,t5_2rg3c,False,,,True,t3_15xtbr,http://www.reddit.com/r/shittingadvice/comments/15xtbr/am_i_normal_do_i_have_ibs_18f/,

Apply a layer or two of TP to the surface of the water *before* pooping. This layer of TP will break the surface tension on the water when your log hits it, and cut down on unnecessary splash back.

Anyway, that's not changed anything, so 3 more days without the toilet (still taking laxative pills, some oil to help you go, and a clean, high fiber diet with lots of water), i gave myself another water enema. There wasn't a lot coming out, but what did come out was small pellets again, and some weird looking yellow stuff. It looks KINDA like the things people show who say they have candida, but i'm not sure now, as it's symptoms are diarrhoea, not constipation. I still feel like i need to go all the time, i'm still having gas all the time, and when i try to use the toilet, it's just passing gas and forcing, and nothing's happening. A few hours after the enema, i had crazy diarrhoea, squirting out like water, 4 or 5 times. I don't know if that was the water enema that stayed REALLY far up there or something, but it felt like i got it all out at the time. I'm really worried, i've never had this before

I'm wondering if faecal impaction can happen further up than the enema can reach? Or if i actually have candida? Or, worst of all, if i've actually got a cancer or something.

Not diarrhea (though I probably have that an above average amount of the time). I had thought for awhile that it was because I take ritalin. If I skip a day of ritalin I won't go and then all the backlog comes out the next day (still  loose even though theoretically it should have had more time to absorb). But over the holidays I took 2 weeks off of the drugs and after a few days got over the constipation and when things got back on schedule it was still loose movements. So I think ritalin is not to blame though it can at times be responsible for super urgent bathroom runs. Unless ritalin can alter the microbiome in my gut and cause effects long after it is out of my system? Is that possible?

I'm embarrassed to discuss with a doctor since I worry about seeming too worried. It's not the worst thing ever, but annoying to go through so much toilet paper and worrying about marks on my underwear. I don't know how much is anxiety/stress related and how much is diet. I cant do much about the anxiety and stress but I'm up for dietary changes. I could buy into the idea that something in my diet might be causing problems.

The problem is there are so many fad things gluten, paleo it kind of overwhelms me and right now I live on takeout so anything which involves real meal prep is a big step up for me.

 I kind of like things I've heard where people cut out all but a few things then gradually add foods back in to their diet to see what impacts it. The thing is I have a very demanding job which requires my brain to be working at full capacity all day. I have to always be on my toes because there is always some new complex problem to solve.  So I can't do some kind of cleanse which might negatively impact cognitive function. Anyone have advice on dietary changes which wont hurt cognitive function and are easy to implement for a person who does not like to cook?

I'm pretty sure I know what started it: I went on an opiate binge from last Wednesday until Sunday, though didn't really get high on Saturday (threw it up before it hit).  So I'm pretty sure that has a lot to do with it.  However, I've been sober for the past three days, and I've barely been pooping--usually about once a day, and a very small amount.  They've been mainly 1s on the Bristol Stool Scale.  I'm somewhat worried that I may have an impacted bowel.  I'm reluctant to go to the doctor, as it's been a week and I don't have a lot of time to go--grad student working three days a week.

I recently started taking Colace (last night), which hasn't really helped that much (though I understand it takes some time).  I've bought some psyllium husk, but have heard that it is best to not take it in conjunction with stool softener.

Other things of note: In the past few weeks, I have started a diet.  I've been eating 1500-1800 calories daily, egg substitute with cheese for breakfast, generally two large servings of vegetables a day--typically salad and roasted/steamed vegetables, some sort of grain and fish with lunch, potatoes and more fish and/or veggie burgers at night.  I have also been drinking a lot of whey protein (4 servings a day) to keep my protein intake adequate while I diet, as I lift weights every other day and run 4-5 miles alternately.  I drink roughly 12-16 cups of water a day, have maybe a half cup of coffee with breakfast, don't drink alcohol, and smoke cigarettes.  I have had constipation while using opiates previously, but never lasting this long.  I typically don't use for that many days in a row, however.

The cut is about 1-2 inches above my anus and it looks like it is almost an open wound. What's strange is that I work out fairly often and I've never had blood in my boxers or anything (I was thinking maybe with my blood pressure going up it would cause it to leak, but nope). The surgeon told me to give it a few more weeks and if it didn't heal up completely then I should get them to stitch it up or something.

So you know I am on the level I have sharted / practically shit myself a few times (Twice while wearing white pants. No bullshit) If you have a small shart you can typically handle this with just a bit of toilet paper and a bit of uncomfortable mud butt.  The one time I did actually shit myself I was lucky which brings me to my first point.

Find water immediately. When I had a full blown assplosion I was camping and near a body of water, I instantly high tailed it for the river and just waded in the water whilst shifting my legs back and forth and letting the river take my crappy shorts excessive beer shit down stream.


If you have access to a bathroom obviously get there asap, but once you are there there is a few things you want to take note of. Use your underwear or socks to wipe the mess up, hopefully you have access to a private bathroom and if you do get your ass in the sink or wet your underwear or socks and try to clean up that way.  

Do not try to flush the evidence it will probably end up clogging the toilet and not only bringing attention to yourself (As you will either be free balling at this point or wearing one sock)  But if there is a detective around they will figure it out.  The other option here is to hide the evidence in the upper deck of the toilet, just take the top off and dump shitty evidence and be done with it.  Chances are you will be long gone before some one finds them.  (If you write your name on your socks or underwear seriously stop, I still have no idea why people do that)

Depending on the circumstances you can toss shitty drawers and or socks out the window but I would not recommend it.


Lastly you are probably going to smell either way,  Anything you can find to mask this is good, if there is soap there and you use it to wash up try to find something else as well.  Lotion, shampoo fucking anything just rub it in anywhere you think may have been infected by poo.

Worst case scenario:  You have none of the above options, lie and take a fake phone call asap declare family emergency get the fuck out before the smell is so obviously coming from your shitty ass.

Struggling for 4 years now, And I want change!",4,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/shittingadvice/comments/1jm8jv/can_someone_give_me_some_insight_in_my_situation/,"First of all, English is not my native language so I'm sorry for any wrong sentences or spelling errors.

So for as long as I can remember(I'm 19) I've had issues taking a poop. I went to the doctor once or twice past year and she simply diagnosed it IBS.. since my grandma also has IBS and she said the symptons were clearly IBS.

About 3 years ago I had these very long and painful shits were my belly would cramp and squeeze together and I had very irregular shits.. I didn't go anywhere because I was afraid to shit my pants..why? because it had already happened when I was little and I never want to experience that ever again.

Since past year my symptoms changed.. I was eating [this](http://www.kws-shop.nl/files/2992/products/1035627/waldkorn_brood_1.jpg) type of bread because everyone said: EAT MORE FIBER. Well shit went down fast, I was eating it for a few months I think and I started having these massive air farts... like a plane that started it engines and a jet that broke the sound barrier. I had to go 6-7 times a day with these massive shit explosions with air and god knows what else. That was a sign it had to stop, I was sick of it and needed change in my life.

So I started following this diet. It was a diet where nearly nothing was allowed, no fiber, no milk, no cheese, no lactose in general, no nothing nearly. It was a diet of 2-3 full months. I completed it and in that time my shits were pretty good actually, it changed to shitting 1-2 times a day.

When the diet was done I started eating cheese again once in a while. Then I had the great idea to start eating pancakes, yogurt and drinking milk on the same day.. next day was a spraying fire hose in the toilet.. from that day I think I might be lactose intolerant. (I also had these air bubbles in my belly, and a lot of farting, this is a sign that your belly can't digest a type of food or something, I still have that sometimes to this day(Lactose?) ) 

My shits nowadays are kind of strange, and thats the reason why I come to you guys for help.. I poop 2-3 times a day... sometimes just once but those are exceptions.. now thats not really the problem because they say that's pretty healthy. But the shits themselves are pretty strange. I always have to go in the morning, when I wake up and then at work. On time of writing it's morning for me and I've just taken a poop, and it felt like it was good but when I checked the toilet what I had dropped there were these floating thin [skins](http://0.tqn.com/d/localfoods/1/0/O/2/-/-/Peach5.jpg) (I really don't know how to describe it.) You can compare them when you skinned a peach. That skin from a peach was floating in there in pieces. They looked brownish and just looked like undigested food skins. Also, my shit was falling apart, it looked like it was soft.. good shape when it came out of my anus but once in the water it went to a snake to a heap of brown liquid plaster.

I've come to the conclusion that it seems like my bowel can't digest anything.. spices are a bad idea, hard to digest fruits skins are a bad idea.. milk is a bad idea.. so to give you guys an example this is what I eat these days:

Morning: 2 x [French pistolets](http://bakerystars.nl/afbeeldingen/producten/BO_Pistolet_wit.jpg) with some cooked ham or easy to digest [sausage](http://www.tomassen.eu/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/p/a/palingworst.jpg)

Lunch: same as above, 2x pistolets. But sometimes with a salad from the supermarket, ricewaffles,.[nuts](http://www.olijfje.eu/Medias/Webshop1/638560_a.jpg)

Diner: My parents know of my situation so they cook very light, no spices, no sauces, no lactose (milk) added to the food etc. So mostly lets take a example from what I've eaten yesterday for diner.

- [string beans](https://eigentuin.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/20120802_snijbonen_02.jpg)
- [small baked potatoes in the pan](http://www.publicare.nl/kokkie_henkie_nieuwe_kooksite_2012/hollands/vis_kip_witlof_gerecht/gebakken_krieltjes.jpg)

and 2x [this as cooked in the pan](http://us.123rf.com/400wm/400/400/szakaly/szakaly1206/szakaly120600073/14001441-gebakken-hamburger-vlees-in-een-hete-koperen-pan.jpg)

Now mind you that this is all made with cooking butter without lactose or anything like that.


And the result was, what I just told you above, this morning. (maybe that shit wasn't the above diner but I don't know)

Now, what I did notice was that the longer my shit is inside me, the better my poop is.. I sometimes think my body is getting it out too fast.. because I had these days where I had vacation and was home all week.. and sometimes I didn't shit everyday but every other day.. and my shits were perfect. (I'm also a nervous being, and it always works on my bowel movement, seems like when Im completely chilled out I get better shits.)

The thing I worry the most about is, is the air bubbling / air in my belly, because that's clearly a sign that my food is not digested that good...I had air free days and shits came out better.


I hope this is some sufficient information and that someone can help me out.. because I want to live a life where I don't  have to think about taking a shit every hour.. or being too afraid to go out with friends because I think my belly will fuck it up.

Thanks in advance.. if you need to know anything else.. please ask me.

TLDR: I have soft / loose / undigested shits and poop about 2-3 times a day. I want to shit more solid shits where my food has been digested well and maybe lessen the times I have to poop a day.

So, as the title suggests, I believe the diarrhea I'm suffering from was caused by some popcorn I ate. I went ""full junk food"" on Saturday (not something I do very often), and I made a huge bowl of air-popped popcorn for myself. I ate it really fast. It had no toppings of any sort on it, by the way. I felt fine until I was awoken in the middle of the night by shitrumbles and I've been pissing out of my ass ever since. Is this a thing that happens after popcorn? I did have a beer while I was eating the popcorn (but, I always drink beer). I also had a decent amount of Cape Cod chips earlier in the day (another mistake?). I didn't have any other liquids while eating the popcorn, which I now realize is a no-no when you're eating a lot of fiber. Anyway, as of this morning, I hadn't experienced any diarrhea for about a day and a half, and I was at school and starving, so I had two muffins. Now I'm diarrhea-ing again. Did excessive fiber damage my intestines or something? My mom has/had ulcerative colitis, so I am worried about the implications of this episode and am planning to go to the doctor as soon as I can. For now, I'm gonna make a point to just follow the BRAT diet until I have a normal bowel movement.

According to my mom, it has always been like that, but it has become a lot worse since i entered puberty. Before half a year ago, i had occasional constipations, but pooping was normal otherwise. It changed to the worse when i started on a boarding school this summer. 
I do get that changing your diet can let to different pooping habits. What i don't get is that it got worse, because i eat a lot healthier(but also more) than i did before, and we have 4 hours of sport every week. 

What i will eat on a typical day:
- Oatmeal for breakfast
- Danish rye bread around 10:00 o'clock
- Whatever is served for lunch(typically fish or meat with vegetables and salad)
- A bun in the afternoon
- Danish rye bread for dinner
- Sometimes a piece of white bread in the evening 

Also, i eat Husk two times daily. It's something that helps soften your stool and helps your digestive system do something. I drink the necessarily amount of water.

Since i've started on the boarding school, i have had problems pooping, but i have only had and actual constipation 1 time, which is better. Sometimes now, i have type 5 and 6 poops instead. 
But what bugs me the most is that i can go for days with minimal pooping. I have to press as hard as if i'm constipated to even pass a small poop. The stool i pass is not even hard and dry - it's soft and long like type 4 on the bristol scale. It often come out in long pieces. Most of the time i can literally feel that i'm full of shit, and i still can't pass it. Then ony day when there is pressure enough, i pass an absurd amount of poop. So basically i kind of feel like i'm constipated with soft poop(and yes, i do know that it isn't considered constipation).

Also, i don't know if it has anything to do with it, but when i'm home in the weekends, i'm back to my old diet again.

Does anybody know what causes this, and what i can do to prevent it? Any advice?

For a while I could feel my lower left colon kinda clamping down, or maybe swelling. I was still shitting normally for a while, but then one day a little less came out than normal, and then the next day a lot less. And then the next day, nothing came out.

After a while I found out that soaking two tablespoons of linseed in water and drinking it after leaving it overnight, seeds and all, helps. The seeds pass right through me, which is gross but better than not shitting.

I don't experience any pain, bleeding, nausea, weight loss, nothing other than this. Before this all started I was going perfectly, once a day, big logs that were easy to pass. I was taking about 2 to 5 minutes in the bathroom. Now it takes 45 minutes just for a little bit.

Usually I can just feel the stool inside me before it comes out because of this, and since my left bowel seems to be swollen or clamping on it, not all of it comes out at once. So I have to go more than once a day.

My actual movements have stayed just as regular. Always around the same time, just that a lot less comes out and it feels incomplete afterward. Sometimes I can somewhat finish later that night, but I long for the old days when I could just go once and be done with it for the rest of the day.

I'm gonna go buy some probiotics today (acidophilus I think) but I have no idea why this would have happened. I wonder if I got some sort of infection or if part of my diet is causing this, but I haven't really changed it at all since this all started. My diet isn't too varied at all.

(Well not really a routine so much as i kind of went ano and possibly screwed up my internals) Anyway after some testing on my own, I found out it was mostly curry that caused me to be constipated for days and be swelling with gas which was never the case prior to the diet although i did constipate whenever i went to work out at the gym. I consulted a doctor where he casually told me to lay off curry. Which i did even though I loved curry. 

Not so long later, I realized that tomatoes would also give me the same symptoms so I started avoiding those. Just having some of those would cause me to have trouble shitting, especially raw ones. 

Now or in the recent months I discover I'm also having trouble with black peppers or peppercorns. I suspect it causes an inflammation in my intestines because I feel like I have something to pass but no matter how hard I try, (and I tried so hard my neck got stiff from the strain) and nothing comes out. Not for days and when it does, usually after I chug down some yogurt to help ease things out, I get the long thin sausage ones like the type 4s on the bristol scale. 

Is there a chance all 3 foodstuff are related? I've never had this problem in the past and it's really bad because almost every meal I have tends to have a little of such pepper. I've not consulted a doctor but i don't know what good it will do. 

I've been having this for so long it's really getting to me now. The swelling discomforts me to the point of feeling depressed. Are the foodstuff related somehow or is this the sign of something worse going on with me? I don't have much income so I'm trying to avoid seeing the doctor until I'm sure there's something wrong to go.

Something happened. I don't know what, but I have only had about 3 shits in the last week and a half, all little and worthless. Like fucking rabbit poop. Today was my third. It was a better consistency, but tiny. 

I want to have a good shit. I want to get this butt baby out. I know something is brewing up there and it will be rancid and demons may spawn, but it is killing me inside. I've tried so many things! I'm increased my spinach eating to every single day, I eat probably heaps of blueberries now, drink so much water I pee every 20 mins. I've started taking some detox thing, last night I drank copious amounts of rum so I could hopefully flush out with liquor shits today and all I got was a little crap and a hangover. I'm taking exlax for tomorrow (didn't want to chance it at work).

I could pass for pregnant right now. I'm so bloated and round and my jeans hurt.

I poop regularly, but not often. Usually, I go twice per week, maybe 3 times. I usually go on Tuesday/Wednesday (usually in the morning after coffee) and Sunday (after breakfast/brunch). Sometimes there is a small movement in between those times. So, I am really regular, but I don't go very often. This has been the case for a few years now.

That is a small concern. I would like to go more regularly, but I just don't right now. I did take psyllium husk capsules at one point for a few months, and they did help some, but I did not like the water retention. I always felt and looked bloated. So I stopped taking them.

My other concern is the consistency of my stool. Basically every time I go, it is the same, which I guess is good. But, here's what happens....I feel a movement coming and I go to the bathroom. One normal turd comes out, usually of good consistency and with a clean wipe. I then leave the bathroom and then 5-10 minutes later, I'm back on the toilet with fairly runny and/or pencil-like stool that is fairly painful/crampy to pass. I find myself rocking back and forth on the toilet (because that helps to pass the stool) and bent over with my elbows on my knees to get in good position. But this second time on the toilet is always runny/pencil-like and generally not that comfortable to pass. It's kind of like there is a normal ""plug"" of poop and once that is out of the way, out comes the works after 5 minutes (which is runny, etc...).

I have been like this for some time and like I said, I am regular (as far as how often this happens) and this is a pretty consistent occurrence.  Any speculations as to why this might be the case or what I can do about it? Might this be a diet issue (lactose?). I eat pretty well, good amounts of veggies and brown bread. Eat meat a few times per week, but eat lots of vegetarian meals as well. I drink at least 3-4 big glasses of water per day, usually more. I exercise regularly. I'm 5'9"" (1.75M) and weigh 177 lbs (80kg), so not really over weight to a significant degree. 

I'm really at a loss here. This has been my pooping situation for quite some time and I would really like to go a bit more regularly and have a more solid consistency to my movements. I'm not too nervous that it is a health issue because this is my normal shitting situation but I'd like it to be better (if possible).

So for about 4 or 5 months now, I haven't been pooping regularly.  Maybe once every two or three days?  And it's often not very substantial - a small 2 or 3 on the scale.  I don't fart often either, maybe 2 or 3 times a day if I had to guess.  The weird thing is, I burp SO much.  I don't know where it's coming from - they're really *really* deep, growly burps.  I feel them start in my stomach and work their way up, but the thing is they don't really escape my mouth, if that makes sense.  They just kind of force themselves up, and I'm less bloated.  But these burps don't come from anywhere! I get them from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep, and even more so immediately after eating anything.  I've been told to keep track - but it's literally after eating anything that they get worse.  It seems like burping has taken the place of farting, and I'm not even entirely sure that's possible.

The only things I can think of that have changed since September is I eliminated pop from my diet completely, and I moved in with my boyfriend.  At first I was nervous to poop in the apartment while he was there, but I got over it really quickly - maybe my body is still anxious about it?  I really don't know, but my lack of bowel movements and excess burping is starting to worry me.  I've gained a good amount of weight, but I'm not sure if that's directly caused by not pooping regularly.  I'm not even sure if the burping thing is related.

I'm tempted to go buy Metamucil or something because it seems like I need to force my body to be regular again. Even *coffee* isn't doing the trick anymore.

I've had at least one for a while now...possibly up to 5 years.

I saw the doctor back then who prescribed me nitroglycerine and told me to shove it up there twice a day - but it just made me throw up and pass out (no good for a forklift driver). I just left the problem assuming it would heal of its own accord, which it never did. Has recently got a lot worse.

There used to be loads of blood when I shat, but not much pain. Now I have to take a towel into the bathroom when the house is empty for something to bite onto and scream into.

It still hurts 3 hours later (its even uncomfortable to drive) so I've decided to make a doctor's appointment, but I need to know what I can do in the mean time. I'm apprehensive to use painkillers as I would assume they would make the fissures worse. What if I need to shit again before then? I don't think I can stand it once more.

1340764218.0,2,self.shittingadvice,vnxfo,What do I do now?,2,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/shittingadvice/comments/vnxfo/what_do_i_do_now/,"So I made [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/shittingadvice/comments/tkchi/constipation_question/) a while ago and tried to go to the doctor as suggested and he just said the same thing he's been saying. I guess I will summarize what's been happening:

Sometime in september, I believe, I went to the bathroom and it was really hard and painful, so I tried to make sure to get more fiber. Anyway, I think it was abnormally long before I had to go again, and I was kind of afraid to. I'm not sure if it was then or a few times after, but I wasn't able to go. It felt a bit different from what I normally thought of as constipation, which would be more like the first time I described, where it's too hard. Anyway, it felt in my abdomen just like I was going to the bathroom regularly, but nothing would come out (usually; sometimes later a small amount would come out and it would be a normal consistency, so I don't think it was too hard during these periods). Same thing kept happening every time I tried for the next 2 or 3 days, and then it just went away. I probably took some miralax, but I don't think it had time to do anything.

After that, I was able to go to the bathroom relatively normally (at the time, that was about once every 3-4 days), except it was in smaller pieces (lengthwise), which is generally true to today. Then, about 2-2.5 weeks later, I got constipated in the same way again. This kept happening pretty regularly (it would go away on its own in about 2 or 3 days and come back around 2 weeks later). In November, I went to the doctor, and he said to get fiber, water, and exercise. So I paid more attention to getting more fiber and water. Exercise was a bit harder, admittedly. The constipation kept up in the same pattern.

I either went back to the doctor or emailed him, and he said to try miralax. I was a little wary because he didn't seem to get what I was saying. Miralax says it's a stool softener and he kept saying I need fiber to keep it soft and whatnot, but it's been soft ever since that one time in september (true to today) and I told him it wasn't hard. Anyway, I started taking miralax every day around January, I believe. I took it every day for about 2 weeks, I think. I started recording when I could go to the bathroom, when I was constipated, if anything was out of the ordinary, and when I took miralax around this time in case it was useful for a doctor, or something, so I could always verify.

Anyway, it did end up making it too soft. It felt like it was on the verge of diarrhea every time I went to the bathroom. I think the doctor called it ""loose."" I started taking the miralax every other day and then I stopped taking it entirely. The doctor suggested another laxative and said I probably just need to always take one, which I was not too excited about. So I just sort of decided to ignore it for awhile, and wondered if constantly taking a laxative was any better than constipation. 

In February, I was constipated, just as I had been getting, except it went away while I was still sitting on the toilet, which had never happened before, and I eventually was able to go pretty normally. This happened again in February, and then there was this weird period where everything just moved really slowly, apparently (I don't really remember, to be honest, but that's what I wrote). Other than that, there was no constipation like before in February and some of March. Then I did get constipated like before and I waited to see if it would go away and it didn't. However, it did go away by the next day, the next time I tried, which had also never happened before.

I got constipated like before (2-3 days) one more time in March. Throughout April, it became completely irregular and dropped the 2 week or so pattern. Every time I was constipated it would go away while I was on the toilet until may, when I made that other post. That time, I was constipated for about 9 days, which hadn't happened any of the previous times, but was otherwise the same, I think. I had a bit of trouble getting an appointment, but I did end up going to the bathroom a couple days after that post. Since then, I haven't gotten constipated at all. Though a few times it has been too soft (haven't been taking any laxatives since January).

Also, I did get diarrhea about 2 weeks ago, which reminded me about getting an appointment to try and get a referral to a GI doctor. So I went and the doctor just said the same stuff as before (fiber, water, exercise, maybe a laxative, otherwise it gets too hard, but it's definitely not too hard), and said that a GI doctor is just going to tell me the same thing.

So, sorry that was so long. My question is, should I just see what happens, considering I haven't been constipated in about 1.5 months? Should I insist on a referral? Should I be worried about occasional excessive softness/that instance of diarrhea?",,False,,t5_2rg3c,1340764433.0,,,True,t3_vnxfo,http://www.reddit.com/r/shittingadvice/comments/vnxfo/what_do_i_do_now/,

I've had OCD for ~9 years, and non-normal Bowel Movements for as long as I can remember. I just didn't realise they were non-normal. About 2.5years ago I had a week of no-wipers (after as many years as I can remember of half a toilet roll per day..)
This triggered my OCD to realise that something was up and I wasn't as clean as normal people. This led to a sharp increase in how long it took me to clean up, as I now feel I have to get every last bit.

Fast-forward to today. I seem to fluctuate wildly between days where my BMs are mostly fine (which takes around 1hour...) to days where they are awful (somewhere between 2.5 and 6 hours). Doctors are mostly dismissing the problem as it's ""not dangerous"". Aside from the fact that it's ruining my life completely.

I'll use last night as an example of a bad day:

Felt awful all day at work, needing a shit. Couldn't go because I can't take that much time at work and keep my job. Got home, and felt awful when I went. When I wiped, my asshole wasn't TOO bad. Thought I'd got away with it. Turns out I was entirely wrong.

When I checked the sides of my asscheeks, they were incredibly messy, and took a HELL of a lot of wiping to even reduce how much I was finding on each tissue. I have no idea wtf is going on here. I've been needing to clean the sides fairly often for a couple of years (and maybe before that and I just didn't know?), to the extent that they're sore most of the time from pulling them around whilst wiping, and there's some lumps/uneven skin as a result.

I've tried cutting out gluten - which seemed to help for a while (this was when I had a week or two of being absolutely fine, but it hasn't persisted). I possibly don't get enough exercise? Not sure. I drink plenty per day (1pint of water with breakfast + a cup of tea. Couple of cups of tea during day + a pint of some sort of flavoured drink. More flavoured water when home etc, used to drink even more than this but didn't seem to help. Tried cutting out caffeine, didn't seem to help).

I don't eat much in the way of fruit/veg, but it IS more than I used to. Used to be 0 portions a day, now it's more like 3 of fruit and not much veg. I know I should fix this, but it never seems to make much difference. I don't eat much greasy food (I've cut out crisps[chips if you're US], I rarely have anything that's fried, I genuinely eat healthier food - just lack Veg).

I take Omeprazole every day as I have heartburn/indigestion problems if I don't, and I take psyllium husk once a day.

I am a 20 year old male, for my whole life I've only ever took a shit every 3-5 days. On occasion I'd go up to 7 days without really noticing.

For *at least* the past 2 years now, there has been blood on the tissue when I wipe, and occasionally light red (Not dark red dry blood) blood on the actual shit.

For the first year+ it didn't hurt, it was just kind of ""wtf not this again"", but when going to the toilet there was no pain. Over the past six months it has got progressively worse, and began to hurt when I take a shit.

I am fairly certain it is roids, because when I feel my asshole there is a large lump on the rim. When I stand this goes inside, if that disgusting detail is any help. My theory is that ever time I shit this roid is getting squashed by the shit like a zit, and bursts...causing the sharp pain. It is possible there are more than one roid but only one on the exterior. (I'll post a picture if you *really* want...)

I don't want to see a doctor, I've lived with this for 2 years and its not a great inconvenience, just a slight problem I'd like to solve. Yes I am aware of the dangers.

My plan is to get some advice from you guys, and see if I can solve this problem in the next 6 months. If the problem persists after six months I will have no choice but to see a doctor because lets face it, I'm already being an idiot. I should have seen a doctor two years ago.

**TLDR - I have had blood in shit for last 2 years. I need your advice to solve it in 6 months, or I'll then see a doctor if the problem persists**.

So any doctors/professionals would be a very big help, but I'm sure the 1,016 subscribers here can give me some advice on diet and stuff. At the moment I get very little fiber in my diet. (Yeah...Problem solved?) But I don't know where to start. I still live with family so I don't want to make it obvious that I'm changing my diet. This whole thing I'd rather keep secret.

Once a Sardarji (A Sikh gentleman, which in Indian jokes is the  equivalent of a Polish man) from the villages visited the big city on invitation by a rich friend to attend his son's wedding.

Sardarji was put up in a 5 star luxury hotel. Now Sardarji did not know how to use the commode as he had always shat in squatting position on top of a hole in his village.

So Sardarji avoided shitting for the day, but after a sumptous meal at the wedding, he had to go shit. He came back to the hotel room and just could not figure out how to shit. So desperate for a solution, he finally shat in all the pair of socks he had. Finally relieved, Sardarji now had a new problem - How to dispose off the shit.  So Sardarji tied the shit filled socks to the blades of the ceiling fan and let the fan go at full speed.  Realizing what he had done, he quickly took down the empty socks and stashed them in his suitcase.

He then called for room service and said to the attendant 'I will give you 50 bucks but please clean the room'.

And hopefully, after you get a good dose of me, you will quit sending me those stupid emails or pokes or whatever the heck you call them, so great will be your disgust at what I have to offer.

Here it is.

Around 18 months ago, I decided that it would be a good idea to go out walking every evening after work with my eldest son.  Figuring that it would be most helpful to my health, I set out to give my body some much needed exercise (and my son, also).  We started out great, each of us strapping on our iPods, clipping on our headphones and making our way down the street.  The first day, I decided that jogging was in order.  I made it about 2 blocks before my body decided that it had enough.  My folly was grand and I made it home only to find that upon entering the house my muscular system shut down completely.  However, we trudged on in the following days.  My companion and I walked briskly covering three quarters of a mile at first and as the weeks wore on, we move to one mile and then to a mile and a half each night.  With each passing evening, I became a slave to the habit of walking.  The drug was in me and I couldn't find the will power to give up even one night of blissful, endorphin filled exercise.  My boy and I loaded our iPods with fast, upbeat music as we marched on, happily, our bodies enjoying the chance to stretch and move.  It was the best time of our lives.

And, as quickly as it started, it ended.  For in the bliss came an event so horrible, so awful, so shameful that it ceased our means to happiness and shut down our walking cycle forever. As fall settled in, the days became shorter and the light scarce.  We tried to make our walk before dinner in order to make frugal use of the sun's last rays.  It was difficult and we often times found ourselves making the last leg of our walk in the dusk's final throes.  Then one night, it happened, dinner was ready too early and we had to wait and eat before we ventured out.  Roxy pleaded with me to skip the walk just this one night.  I couldn't.  I didn't dare.  So addicted was I to this practice that I waved off her desires and set my own to appease the beast inside me that needed so desperately to exercise.

Ben and I readied ourselves for our adventure. As I pulled on my shoes and plucked my iPod from its cradle, I felt a gurgling in my gut.  No matter, I said to myself, it's just the digestions of a premature dinner.  And off Ben and I went to do our business.  Dusk gave way to the night as we rounded our first street corner.  Again, I felt my stomach begin to gurgle, its ornery bellowing rising though my body like an angry volcano.  Again, I paid no mind in order to finish the task at hand.  We moved on until we had made half of our sojourn.  By this time I could feel the revolt deep within my bowels.  My insides were churning like a taffy pulling machine and I knew that I was in trouble.  A quick internal diagnostic began within me and my mind and body reached a natural covenant - as long as I kept moving, I would make it home.

Ben and I rounded onto the next street and moved toward the half way point.  Then, Ben spoke up, he motioned to me to remove my headphones and I did so. I have to pee, he said in a panicked voice; real bad.  Not wanting to break my body's internal contract I pleaded with him to hold on until we got home.  He agreed that he would try and we continued on.  As we made the turn onto the sidewalk, Ben again motioned me to listen to him.  The panic in his eyes was real and he begged me to let him pee somewhere.  Looking around, I spotted a dark, unlit area of tall wooden fence that would provide temporary cover for him.  I relented and motioned him to do his business over there.

I stopped; I broke my contract.

A rock dropped from my stomach into my lower intestines.  The gurgling grew louder and I felt the pain shoot up my backside.  I had stopped and broken the covenant my brain made with my butt.  I was in trouble and I had nowhere to go.  Ben came back from doing his business, his countenance rife with relief.  He must have seen the terror in my eyes because his countenance immediately changed to concern; he asked me if I was alright.  I was not.  I told him what was wrong.  He offered all kinds of kidly solutions, none of which would do any good.  My mind raced.  What was I to do.  I looked around for shelter, my head turning back and forth until I spotted safety.  Across the street, in a newly developed neighborhood was a row of trees about 50 feet in from the road.  I looked at Ben and said we are going over there - now.  I began to move to cross the road and the pain shot through my right leg.  The pressure was great and I knew that if I moved, I was done for.  I stopped, standing at attention, my legs squeezed together, doing their best to hold off the imminent invasion.  My whole body was clenched into one tight, rigid pole as I waited for the pressure to subside.  The occasional car drove past as I stood there, unable to move.

And then, just like that, the pressure bubbled and waned.  We're going across the street, I said to Ben.  And we trudged over.  I made it about 20 feet from the road and it hit me again, the pain and pressure surging through my body, my bowels gurgling in violent revolt.  I clenched again and waited for the pressure to subside.  Longer this time, but it did.  Wait here, I told my son as I made my way to the line of trees.  Finding the darkest part of night's shade, I loosened my belt, hidden from the glaring moon and exposing my own lunar body to the house behind the trees.

I pooped in the trees in a neighborhood, hidden from the light of the moon.  That is the one thing that no one knows about me, that is my shame.

I get home, drop the deuce, no pain, no red in the water, I go to wipe, and the toilet paper is COVERED in bright red blood, but it didn't hurt when I wiped.

I drop another deuce an hour later, no pain, and there's no blood at all, nothing in the stool. Nothing on the paper. 

I'm so confused. I have had some issues with hemorrhoids in the past and some minor bleeding and pain when wiping, but never this much blood with no pain. 

Did I somehow knock a blood clot loose further on up the line when I was working out earlier? And for the record, I didn't press myself that hard at the gym today. I also drink kale smoothies every day for breakfast and I use beets in them which is good for the colon.. And I've seen the [leftover red beet juice seep out after soaking in the water](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeturia) for a bit, but this was DEFINITELY not beet juice. It was blood.

YOU DO NOT NEED TO READ THE BACK STORY IF YOU DON'T EANT TO, SKIP DOENT O THE LAST 2 PARAGRAPHS.



   Ever since I was in first grade, I have no idea what the hell caused it, trauma or genetics, but I would ALWAYS have the urge to have a bowel movement at a certain time of the day, EVERY DAMN DAY. This isn't like 'oh hello there mr turd! I can hold you in until lunch you just wait' this is like someone is taking your guts and squeezing and twisting the poop out of them. The poop is just THERE and I need a toilet at that very moment, I have taken to shitting myself many times. That is just first grade..


Second grade rolls around and I call my special bowel movements ""the cramps"", my family sort of understood and left me alone in the bathroom as soon as I mentioned it, which was good for at home. At school, it was rather embarrassing to be asked to be excused my class, and then spend 30 minutes to almost an hour in the bathroom, literally shitting your guts out. Eventually, as time wore on, they became a part of my daily routine and my excuse for being in the bathroom so damn long was, ""sorry I'm not feeling good, give me a minute"" so onto my next story..

 In the middle of moving to a new house, still in 2nd grade. I am staying at my grandparents, with mom, sis, and bro. I'm in the bed, suddenly I jolt awake. There is a HOWLING pain in my abdomen, I recognize it as some type of hellified version of what I call ""the cramps"". I went into the bathroom as fast ad I could off the bed, I sat on the toilet for what felt like *hours* just shitting out thick diarrhea. This isn't like the watery hershy squirt shits, imagine a thick blizzard from Dairy Queen coming out your ass at a 100 fucking miles per hour, heated at a bazillions degrees from pushing so hard to get it out. Eventually, the first of many battles was won that night. I crawled back into the bed, on the end of it and curled into the fetal position. This series of ""cramp attacks"" happened 3 times more that night. Food poisoning? E. coli? No fucking idea, everyone waved it off as me being over reactive. Next story..

Nearing the middle of second grade, my ass got so goddamn chafed from wiping it of the acidic shit that had covered it time and time again. Eventually it hurt so damn much that i cried in front of my parents, begging for them to do something, anything to make the pain stop. I farted, they busted out laughing, and while I would have (under normal circumstances) laughed with them, breaking free of my sobs into hiccuping laughs, I didn't. I cried harder, it was one of those sulfur farts and it spread an inferno on my beyond -chafed ass. We never went to the doctor, but wipes and soothing cream helped that. Before this, the school, being the total bitches they were, told me I had to go to the fucking nurse to go to the restroom. This is one of those nurses that doesn't give a flying fuck about your feelings and is as blunt as can possibly be, acts nice at first, but if your me, she's a real BITCH. We had to give the wipes and cream to her so I could go to the bathroom in her damn office. Sometimes, when I took especially long she would knock on the door and ask if ""I was alright"" NO BITCH, IT'S NOT LIKE MY ASS IS SCREAMING FOR MERCY OR NOTHING. I told her I was fine. Every damn time I got done she asked me if I had a bowel movement or a urinary movement. It's like they were recording my every damn move, and needless to say, I was not very happy to be out of the school at first when I had to move, but I am now for reasons that go in a story for a another time.

  I had mild ""cramps"" every once in a while for a couple of years, 3rd grade nurses were pretty cool about it. I loved the principle, he was nice and super chill with all the kids. Hated the fucking school though because I was bullied relentlessly by the kids, and not any of the teachers gave a single damn. These were my hardening years, I saw that the world was a cruel place and I manned up. 4th grade was relatively good, most of my ""cramps"" happened at home, and for the most part they felt like what I would consider an actually normal dump for the few sweet times that it had lasted.  5th grade was chill , a couple of the bullying factors in, but not as nearly as relentless. I had a couple of good dumps at the school in which case the teacher was the most understanding, I said ""I don't feel good"" as usual. No biggie, of course classmates questioned why I was gone for so long. Many had already made the assumption so I told them how it was  how it was. It was some glorified version of ""every time I take a shit, it's like taking a vacation through hell"", can't remember my exact words. Next paragraph, new story.


 6th grade was good for the first year at middle school,  taking dumps returned to what I would be considered normal. It wasn't liquid fire spitting out of my ass anymore, that was for sure. If I did have to have my special ""cramps"" I smartly did them in the passing time between 3rd period and lunch. They didn't last long, and most of the time spent was making sure it was over. Sometimes it comes a little slower as the other little shits travel through my gut, and I get the same goddamn cramp feeling every time it hits a spot and I swear to god, I can literally FEEL the shit moving through my intestines. Take a marker and draw a line down your arm, that's the only way I can help you imagine what this feels like. Lunch is a rather long period, and no one usually misses me and there are plenty of middle school excuses , ""had to stay back. In the class for a bit"" and things similar. One morning, my peace of having little to no chance of cramps is FUCKING SHATTERED TO LITTLE TINY BITS. I sit on the toilet in the morning, releasing that morning piss as a familiar sensation takes over. I become nauseated, and to get rid of the cramps I involuntarily push VERY hard at some points. I'm in the bathroom at 6:30, time passes , I have to be at school by 7:55, and with realization I between the small breaks that are rewarded to me, I have to tell my parents that I can't go to school. I'm in the bathroom, in more pain than one could imagine. I feel like I'm going to throw up, my guts feel like their being torn out of me, and I had to ball my fists up and his the counter, and grunt in pain; something I've never done. I was in the bathroom WELL into noon before it stopped. NEVER had I taken a shit so damn long. The nauseas feeling went away along with the cramps and believe me when I say this, I felt like a new damn woman. I promptly slept the rest of the day. Pepto bismol saved me, if not for that, I'm SURE that it would have happened again that week.  This overwhelming feeling of wanting to throw up, and what was described above.. Has happened a couple more times. These were worse than ""cramp attacks"" or the cramps I had In first grade. It was HELL. Fast forward to the present, and my point.

This is happening again, massive cramps and pain beyond belief. My only gratitude towards this situation is that I'm at home, schools out. This is right now, as I'm typing this. I'm spewing lava out of my ass at full force every couple of seconds due to my gut being so damn twisty. It hurts so damn much. I'm a girl, and having a period pales In comparison to this, even laughable! I don't know what's wrong with me, as started before , some type of trauma, mental or physical, I don't know. Or some genetic thing? My dad takes unbelievably long shits, but all guys do that, right? Anyways. I want to find out what's wrong with me to get it fixed, it wasn't bad at first, but these ones that are making me want to scream in pain and pound my fists on the counter Its just too damn much. I. Can't. Take. It. Anymore. Has anyone else experienced pain similar to this, and did they get it diagnosed? If so, what did your doctor say and prescribe? Or maybe you have your own insights? Please, I want this to stop, or the pain be minimized. I need answers... Oh, and if this information helps, please use it!

My apologies for the giant fucking wall of text, and explicit language and details about the shit blowing my ass apart, and leaving it in shambles. I think my current shit had ended, I could be wrong, but the chafing is starting again. Here we go again. DAMNIT I spoke too soon.
Tell me if this might need an NSFW tag. Please, I'm not sure.

Also, please don't tell me to go the a fucking doctor. I'm well aware that I might have to go to a damn doctor and I don't need you telling me that, I want to know if there might be and underlying cause as to why this curse was placed upon me, or maybe even if some other poor soul has it. I don't want to go to the doctor, because it really hasn't come down to that yet.

Anyway, story. Both sides of my family have colon cancer (paternal grandmother and paternal grandfather). My mother has hemorrhoids and is constantly constipated. My father and brother have delicate constitutions; they have regular poops but a cup of cold water can have them running to diarrhea their guts out. My brother complains about diarrhea. I'd rather have diarrhea like him than be constipated and feel so boated and gross all the time... Anyway, my policy used to be ""well, it all has to come out after some point, right?"" and just do things the usual way, but then I read that one post about the guy who didn't poop in the month of August, and now I have this pathological fear of going more than three days without pooping.

As a child, I was lucky to have a poop every three days. I didn't even know that was weird. At thirteen, I was pooping every two weeks or something and straining, and I got a hemorrhoid that I still have. The hemorrhoid isn't painful and it doesn't bleed, but it's definitely one. It's more uncomfortable than anything else. Right now, I still have trouble pooping. This is my fourth day of constipation, which is okay for me. Sometimes I can go two weeks without pooping.

I take olive oil and probiotics in the morning with Optifiber. I come home and eat a big bowl of soupy vegetables, flaxseeds, and poached eggs and I drink anywhere from 12 to 16 cups of water a day. I usually skip breakfast, and dinner is usually a smaller cup of vegetables. Despite all that, I'm constipated. My parents aren't very helpful. My dad tells me to ""push harder"" and ""eat more vegetables"" and ""exercise more"" (I walk 1.5 miles on the weekdays and go to the gym on the elliptical for 40 - 60 minutes on Sundays). My mom wants to put me on a liquid diet or administer an enema (I think she uses one everyday or something). I took Miralax a few days ago, but no difference.

Right now, I feel like I need to poop, but for the past six hours, hourly trips to the bathroom result in nothing. If I suck in my stomach and poke my left side in the hollow of the hip, I can feel my poop, and it's really gross. (It just feels like a knot under the skin.)

So, advice? (I already squat on the toilet.)

EDIT: I pooped! Not very pretty (2-ish on the Bristol scale), not a lot for the last four days, but at least I don't have impacted stool and I can drink more fiber and water without worrying that I'm making things worse. I feel more cheerful than I have in the past half day.

Unable to digest food?",2,2,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/shittingadvice/comments/pczg4/ok_here_is_the_situation_constipated_vomited/,"Quoted from another post I made about this.... See TL/DR at bottom if you dont want to read it.

&gt;Can you get physically ill from being out in the cold?

&gt;Last night I spent a good six hours sitting in my car in the cold. It was cold enough to start snowing. By the last hour I was shivering uncontrollably. I finally got home, turned the heat up, turned on the mattress pad &amp; crawled under a quilt. Tried to go to sleep. I spent the next 5 hours waking up frequently, tossing &amp; turning &amp; having strange dreams. My body felt a little like it does when you have the flu. I couldnt stop moving my arms &amp; legs.

&gt;Since i am a forever aloner (and a bit of a recluse) ... I rarely get sick since I dont have much contact with people. I DID have one small order of culvers wisconsin cheese curds last night (about 12 hours ago) and that was it. When i got home I just didnt feel like eating anything at all even though I knew I should be hungry. So I ate a half a cookie just to settle my stomach. ABout 5 hours later I awoke just feeling slightly off. Again, I couldnt stop moving my arms &amp; legs. My stomach was nauseous .... and I eventually barfed. Then felt instantly better. I have no temperature. I consumed no alcohol last night.

Note: also... last night I was extremely stressed out (social anxiety) and suffering a bit of an episode while first trying to go to sleep after I got home.

**TL/DR: about 4 hours ago I had a normal meal and now I have the full &amp; nauseous feeling again. Think I may end up vomiting again like the day before. As of late I dont seem to get hunger pains and instead feel just very slightly nauseous which makes me not want to eat. I have also been having infrequent large bowel movements and regular sized ones that are quite hard to pass. I am also quite dehydrated which I think is the main problem of passing BMs. Gonna try an enema in the morning if things dont get better. Gonna also have to pick up some serious fiber supplement... I dread taking that thru the checkout.**
