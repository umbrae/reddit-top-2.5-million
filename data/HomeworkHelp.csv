We've deleted a few posts where the submitter was asking for stuff others have paid for, including books, access to paid databases, etc. -- basically, illegal stuff. While I don't much care what someone does on the web, I don't think we should allow that sort of stuff on this sub-.  Thoughts?

I've removed a couple of posts because they contained personal info -- student and teacher name, school name, that sort of thing. I mentioned that in the sidebar, but since few posters read the rules, please report posts with personal info.

This morning, I deleted a post that was an entire quiz from a history class. To me, it was an obvious ""do it for me"" post -- here's the quiz, what are the answers? -- so I deleted it.

1346123851.0,12,self.HomeworkHelp,yxxep,[Tutorial] How to tackle any physics problem,13,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/comments/yxxep/tutorial_how_to_tackle_any_physics_problem/,"Sometimes physics problems seem daunting. You're given just a ton of numbers that don't seem to connect to each other and you're looking for some oddball solution that you've heard of before, but have no idea how to get from what you're given to the final solution. But never fear! The best way to solve these physics problems is to calm down and think. Physics problems should not be ""known"" how to be solved, but to be worked like sculptor on a statue.

But how do I start? What should I do? Here's a guide on not the answer to physics problems, but a guideline for how you should approach physics.

First off, ask yourself a few questions. What am I given? Write down and assign symbols to represent the data you are given. Try to use conventional terms, such as v for velocity, or theta for an angle. Convert funky units into units you are familiar with or are consistant with the rest of the problem. Make sure you try to understand the units on each value given. Try to associate these values with the physical things you've seen in labs.

Then as yourself, what am I looking for? Examine the question and try to determine what kind of answer the questions asks for, and how do they want it expressed. Many people lose points on physics problems because they fail to deliver the answer, although correct, wit the right form, significant digits, or units. Understanding your goal is key.

The final step is to find ways to link from what you have to what you want to get. This is what solving physics problems is all about. Try different methods of finding the answer. Is there a formula you can simply use? How many unknowns do we have? Is this problem similar to any example problem that you've seen? Can we set up a system of equations? Write down equations that you think may be relevant to the problem and see what you can get from there. 

If you still can't get a solution, try random things out. Don't spend time dabbling and worrying about how to solve it, WORK it. Very few scientists ever got it correctly the first time, and neither should you. However, you should do your best to try things out until you've exhausted your ideas. If you still can't figure it out, skip the problem and come back to it later. You may solve a similar problem later or be reminded of another trick that you can use on later problems.

Finally, if you've finished your work, make sure you check your work. Most scientists do a ""order of magnitude"" check, which means basically a quick mental math of whether your answer is in a physical ball park. If a baseball is flying at 10^9 m/s, it is traveling faster than the speed of light. If a cow ends up weighing 45 grams, you made a mistake in your calculations. Also make sure that your units match up to the units the problem asked for. Never forget to stop and think about the problem you just solved.

Find the volume between the two parabaloids x = y^2 + z^2 and y = x^2 + z^2

Hint: x - y divides x^2 - y^2

I thought...

Set z = 0 to find the ""shadow"" in the xy plane: y = x^0.5 and y = x^2

They intersect at (0,0) and (1,1) because:

x^2 = x^0.5

x2 - x0.5 = 0

x^(0.5)(x^1.5 - 1) = 0

x^0.5 = 0 gives x = 0 and y = 0 and

x^1.5 - 1 = 0

x^1.5 = 1 gives x = 1 and y =1

∫∫∫ 1 dzdydx where 0≤x≤1, x2≤y≤x0.5

I get that, but then when I try and calculate the Coriolis acceleration by taking the cross product of the velocity of the bullet and the angular velocity of the Earth, I can see that the velocity vector of the bullet points due south, and I know that the angular velocity vector of the Earth points due north, because of the right hand rule.

So if I take the cross product of these two vectors I get 0, and I definitely don't get something pointing westward.

THIS IS A SPEECH FOR MY PUBLIC SPEAKING CLASSS. NOT A HISTORY CLASS. I know my scenarios are implausible. ",13,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/comments/18mf85/i_wrote_a_speech_on_4_scenarios_in_which_the/,"Today, I would like to discuss with you folks a twist on everybody’s favorite history lesson: The second world war, and the rise and fall of the third reich. Your average joe with a high school diploma can give you the long and short of what DID happen, but a popular exercise amongst history buffs is to speculate what COULD have happened: What if the Nazis had pulled it off? Now, this question alone isn’t enough to use, because it doesn’t specify HOW they won. Rather than wax idiotic about what I personally find to be the most likely route to axis success, I’m simply going to lay out four contrasting and imaginative scenarios that could have led to a German victory, and how the world would look today in the wake of that victory.

Scenario one: The Zimmerman Telegram, second edition.

The Zimmerman Telegram was a document sent from Germany to Mexico during WWI, promising them that if they made war with America they could reacquire their lost territory in New Mexico, Arizona and Texas. Long story short, Mexico declined. But what if they accepted a similar proposal during WWII? Japan would have been able to use Mexico as a launchpad to assist in the invasion. America is too busy defending their homeland to assist in Europe, and Europe falls to the Axis powers. Germany would be relatively unable to assist, as this war would do nothing to defortify the Eastern coast of America. Thus, America is pushed back to the East, all the way to the Mississippi. 

War is all about who you know, so even though Mexico would likely never surpass us in industrial or economic terms, America would be unable and unwilling to make attempts to retake its territory so long as Mexico remained in alliance with Germany. America, with its entire population crammed into half of its previous area, would quickly become plagued by overpopulation and lose its superpower status near the turn of the millennium. People would quickly get it in their heads to emigrate en masse, but put simply they’d have few places to flee.

Scenario two. 
Germany doesn’t make its fatal mistake of betraying Russia, and with their help is able to drag out the war and exhaust Allied resources.

 Britain would have been too busy defending their homefront to contribute in Africa, and the Nazi army would have up through the middle east, forcing Allied powers in Europe to be the ones fighting a two front war. Britain falls, and the Nazis win the war. What does this mean for Europe? 

Mainly it means prime trading partners for the US – A triangle between the Axis powers, the US and Russia. This is the only scenario of the four that I’m going to propose that could possibly put the U.S. in a better situation than the one they are currently in. Germany would still experience great economic decline when the demand ceased for their war-driven economy, and the Soviet Union would have all of the same problems and more. The U.S. stands to gain much in this scenario by simply hanging back and enjoying undeserved spoils of war. Mainly the U.S. would benefit from the war-obsesesed industry of Germany: The German weapon Sturmgehwer, the world’s first assault rifle – a term coined by Hitler, little known fact – and the much-coveted Russian gun, the PPSH. The ability to quickly change magazines when your enemy  could not be overestimated.

Eventually, as an arms race developed between Russia and Germany throughout the fifties, as a result of their economy now being reliant upon world-conquest-level arms production, Russia and Germany would see open war. This is even better news to America, as we would be selling munitions to both sides in what is likely (given the Russian terrain the Nazi blitzkrieg style of warfare) a very long and drawn out war.
Scenario three:

 What if Britain had joined the Axis instead of the allies, as Hitler had initially hoped?

France would have fallen without British there to help them against the multinational attack, and it would have been unsalvageable long before America joined the fight – meaning America probably never would have joined at all. This would have left nobody to defend Africa, but as the last scenario was unique, so too is this one: Today Africa – at least certain parts and peoples - would be much better off. The apartheid would be less severe, if Germany had any interest in their colonialism paying off for the homeland and so-called master race. Warlords wouldn’t make the rules, and the primitive, uncivilized tribes would have been assimilated or annihilated under fascist regime – This would mean today far less famine, and little to no AIDS epidemic. This is also the most sustainable model for Germany, as the amazing natural resources of their newly acquired continent coupled with their technological capabilities to harvest and transport those resources could offer Germany an economy that has real stability that isn’t seen in other options.

Fourth and final scenario: Hitler acquires nuclear weaponry before 
anybody else.

Towards the end of the war, the best tactical choices would have been either London or America. Destroying London would have been the finishing blow to the British forces, and a few well-placed nukes in major American cities would have given the isolationists much more support. The political turmoil might have outweighed the physical turmoil enough to cause Roosevelt or Hoover to withdraw involvement. 

However, it was the people to the East that Hitler viewed as subhumans most fit for extermination. Thus, I think it is most likely he would have attacked Russia, despite its disadvantageous geographical distribution of its populace – most likely in Stalingrad. This would have very likely inspired a hasty Russian surrender.
Seeing the massive destruction brought on by nuclear weaponry, America and the European allies would very likely follow suit and surrender as well. This is one of many axis success models that still doesn’t leave Germany with a bright future, however: Their economy would not hold out for very long.

That is my take on what the world would look like following various methods of the success of the National Socialist German Worker’s party. Though highly theoretical and speculative in nature, half the fun of history is pondering what may have been – and celebrating what never will be.

2. Happiness? I say joy because I am referring to when Amir wins the tournament. Baba is proud of Amir, and Amir is ecstatic because of this

3. Disgust. After Amir asks Baba if he ever thought about new servants, Baba is angrier than ever before. He feels a disgust in Amir, and Amir is a little upset because Baba cares so much for Hassan. 

4. Seperation. This is the period after Amir asked about new servants. Amir feels distant from Baba once more. The relationship they had going for a little while is now gone. 

5. Friendship/growing closer. This is after Amir and Baba move to America. They have grown closer after getting older

6. Proud? Baba is proud of Amir. He is graduating school and going off to college soon, and he got married.

Credit goes to [jamt9000](http://www.reddit.com/r/jamt9000/comments/beuzq/subscript_and_superscript/) for the css code.

If you forget the syntax, I have added it to the sidebar.

**Examples:**

NH*_4_`+`*

2H*_2_*O ⇌ H*_3_*O^+ + OH^(-)

*_1_`2`*D + *_1_`3`*T  → *_2_`4`*He + n*`0`*

**Here's the syntax:**

\*\_subscript\_\* makes *_subscript_*

\*\`superscript\`\* makes *`superscript`*

\*\_sub\_\`sup\`\* makes *_sub_`sup`*

\*\`sup\`\_sub\_\* makes *`sup`_sub_*

---

If you have trouble with spacing like *_2_`300`*H, add some blank spaces with \&amp;nbsp;

\*\_2\_\`300\`\*H -&gt;  *_2_`300`*H

\*\_2\_\`300\`\*\&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;H -&gt; *_2_`300`*&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;H

UPDATE: Now with [spoiler](#s) tags! I was skimming through the subreddit and saw someone ask for them several months ago.

I also added a numbering system for code blocks. It only works up to 250 lines, but you should probably use a mirror if you're looking to post long segments of code anyways.

Scott Fitzgerald's novel '[Babylon Revisited](http://gutenberg.net.au/fsf/BABYLON-REVISITED.html)', written in 1930. 

The analysis of the novel is the main part of my assignment, with a particular focus on how the issues of that particular time are dealt with in the story ([the Stock Market Crash of 1929](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929) and [the 10-year Great Depression](http://www.history.com/topics/great-depression) following it).

I was hoping we could get an interesting discussion going about the novel, which I find to be a very interesting read. 


How the novel reflects the time in which it was written and how it deals with the issues of its time should ideally be the main focus, but any opinions and views on the story are welcomed wholeheartedly. 

How do you interpret the novel?

My thesis is that Katniss represents a new age of female heroines in popular contemporary literature.

In return for such a huge and kindly favour I'd be more than happy to write something for you, such as a review, press release or anything else really.

If at all possible it'd be great if the image could be at least 300 dpi.

In advance, thank you kindly.

The copy that I've written follows.

*The Generics are a sensation. Rising from complete obscurity to pant-wettingly famous in a matter of weeks must have shaken their humble, working-class sensibilities to the core. From some obscure and unheard of village in the depressing north of England, The Generics can associate with the lower classes, as they grew up in those conditions. They have been compared to The Arctic Monkeys, The Kaiser Chiefs, The Wombats, The Rakes, The View and countless other successful bands that start with ‘The’. With an entirely different and not at all copied sound, The Generics are set to become the biggest band in the world. It is rumoured that they have been offered a headline slot at Glastonbury next year and they have been given a multi-record deal by industry giants EMI. Front man Johnny was even given a top-ten spot on the NME cool list this year; quite an honour by all accounts. I met the band during their ongoing and extensive UK tour.

Johnny Guitar is a rockstar, to put it simply. In a painfully cool leather jacket and jeans so tight they could be painted on, he is obviously made for his role. As guitarist and lead vocalist, he has a tremendous presence, seemingly drawing energy from nowhere and making the crowd hang on his every word. “Well, you know, like, it’s part of the job man,” he explains as he lights a cigarette and slouches further into the cheap plastic chair he is sitting on. “Sometimes you don’t want to do it but, like, the fans have paid to come and see us, you know?” Johnny really knows how to work an audience and claims to be propositioned for all sorts of unmentionable acts by around twenty women and occasionally a man before, during and after each of their shows.

Billy Bass is a cool, calm and collected character. Despite sharing his name with a novelty singing fish that was popular in the early noughties, he is pegged as the sensible member of the band. “I never really got into the whole rockstar lifestyle,” he says respectfully. “I like being on tour and everything but I miss my girlfriend too much.” With a preference for jazz music and classic novels he is often left out of the partying that goes on: “I don’t really mind it, I don’t have that much in common with the other guys and I’m not into the whole lifestyle.” Billy, as the chief songwriter, claims to draw influences from a variety of sources; “I really like The Blands, The Sames and Crappy Boring Indie Music for Dumb People.” A list of bands that, to me at least, all sound very similar, but I’m assured by Billy that they are all original and groundbreaking in their own way.

Pete Otherguitar is quiet, to say the least. He is the youngest member of the group and it seems to affect his confidence somewhat. “I don’t really have too much of an input in the musical side of things,” he says. “Johnny is much better at creating music than I am so he tends to write the parts for me, and I’ve never been much of a lyricist.” Apparently, this shy front seems to fade after several drinks and from talking to the other band members, I discovered some quite shocking stories. I won’t go into detail as I fear he may suffer legal repercussions if I do, but let’s just say one night he got up to some drunken shenanigans that included a zoo, sixteen chimpanzees and a bowl of custard.

David Drums is an interesting character. A man the size of two houses and arms the size of buses, he is a formidable man. His hobbies, apparently, include drumming, playing the drums, and doing other drum things. This is a guy that is completely dedicated to his art and it really shows through. After trying unsuccessfully to coax him into a conversation, I was informed by a passing roadie that he has taken a vow of silence, but nobody really seems to know why. Some might say this is pretentious and irritating, but not anyone that values their life. The guy is terrifying.*

Consider a pure uncertainty economy where there are three states s = 1, 2, 3.

The utility functions are:

U1 = 2/3 ln X(1,s) + 1/3 ln X(2,s)

U2 = 1/2 ln X(1,s) + 1/2 ln X(2,s)

Where U1 is the utility function of individual 1, and X(1,s) represents good X in period one, at state s. 

Endowments are as follows: 
e1 = ((1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1))
e2 = ((2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2))

Compute the competitive equilibrium under the assumption that there is a complete market in elementary securities.

I'm thinking that I can't just straight up solve for n, but using both of the conservation equations, somehow I need to get rid of V2f, and use what I know between the initial velocities and the final velocity of M1 to find a value for n.

What I believe it is:
(again, as I'm trying to figure out what to write here I'm stumped.)

it seem to be something you add to your DNS, to make it easier to find and distribute information. as BIND let's you search for a name, rather than an exact address. the server checks the name in it's protocol, gives the name to the resolve library, who checks which server the name belongs to, and gives you back the info that particular server categorized with that name.

is that even remotely right? I just started the course and I have not learned anything about how a network is built up, or what DNS in itself is

Given that the molecular mass of the cytochrome is 54 kDa, and that the molar absorption coefficient for its reduced form is 180,000 mol-1 l cm-1 at 550 nm, calculate the concentration in μg ml-1 of the cytochrome sample.

ΔH = (Q - PΔV) + PΔV = Q

ΔH = Q

I'm pretty sure that he is just saying that metacognition is a useful human ability that enables us to overcome flaws in our natural thinking process. Am I on the right track?

Here is my paper: 

My Paper

Jonah Lehrer presents a very interesting and unique take on metacognition in his paper, Thinking Meta. He argues that metacognition while frustrating, confusing, and bewildering at times is a very practical and important ability that is all too often underestimated. Lehrer attempts to strengthen his claim by providing the reader with pieces of  key information which include a study by Philip Tetlock and his study on experts analyzing their ability to make accurate predictions about future events, a series of experiments conducted by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky on people's reactions to the framing of gambling games, and our inability to avoid thinking about white bears when specifically told not to.
	
First Lehrer introduces the act of metacognition to the reader by giving them a simple command: “Don't think about white bears.” The reader inherently fails because in the process of concentrating on not thinking about white bears the brain analyzes the current thought process sees the word white bears and the image of white bears is suddenly at the forefront of the readers mind again. This never-ending loop of goals and mental review checkpoints is what Lehrer sees as an “essential feature of the human mind” for which the technical term is metacognition. Metacognition is basically the ability to be self-aware in that we humans think about how we are currently thinking. Lehrer goes on to argue that without metacognition humans would make a much greater number of mistakes and would be on the whole less intelligent without metacognition.
	
One of the key pieces of evidence that Lehrer uses in making this argument is a study by Philip Tetlock. Tetlock found that the experts who had the most success were the ones who “reflected on their own thought processes” allowing them to weed out mistakes and arrive at a more accurate and soundproof conclusion. Lehrer uses Tetlock's study to point out that what allows a person to truly excel in their field of work is their ability to analyze their own thoughts, or metacognition. 
	
He then points out that by essentially proofreading one's thoughts an individual can catch themselves from making mistakes that other's would normally fall prey to such as loss aversion, which was studied in depth by Kahneman and Tversky's in a series of experiments they conducted. Kahneman and Tversky discovered that people strongly preferred avoiding losses over gaining pleasure which lead people to make poorly informed and irrational decisions because of their emotional tendencies, this tendency was dubbed “loss aversion” by Kahnema and Tversky. Lehrer argues that without strong metacognition skills people often fall victim to simple mental obstacles such as loss aversion, but if people stop and take a moment to reflect upon their thoughts and how they arrived at them they could easily stop themselves from making poor choices.

Ok guys, I've just started studying again (seriously for the first time in my life) and after learning a bit about stoichimetry forumlas and getting them down, I started learning about molarity.

Molarity= moles solute / litre solution

However I came upon a question that gave me the Molarity, and the moles solute so I had to work out the how many litres of solution there was. I am not sure what to do from here.

I would like the answer to this, but also was wondering if there is an actual system that I can use to determine what i should do based upon formulas.

if I knew that Pi / Ti = Pf / Tf

And i was given the Pi, Pf &amp; Tf

I already know that the forumla I would use is Ti = Pi x Ti/ Tf, but if I hadn't read this is a book, is there a more intelligent way to work out how I could switch around the forumlas?

Even physic based equations like E= mc2, what would I do if I had the E, and the c2 but not the mass, how would i know what to do?

I wonder if I use the word critique appropriately. Please let me know. I would appreciate it. Thank you, I really do appreciate it.

**My Reflection:**
Henry James attempts to articulate the flaws of perceiving criticism as negative. He endeavours to do so because of people's over-indulging senses of entitlement. According to James, adequate criticism demands the critic to accept the work as is. To be justly observational, one must endeavour to truly attain the state of appreciation so that the impulse to critique is absent. Only when the critic truly learns to deduce finished products as a series of sessions of hard work, he can comment on ways to achieve improvement for future instances. Henry James also philosophizes to accept the critiqued material as one's own. By accepting it as so, one promotes further criticism on himself and on the work recently critiqued. Since blatant denigration is often accompanied by negative connotations and an offensive tone, such a philosophy gives humans an evolutionary promise to improve. Henry James' philosophy - if properly perused - would aid humanity into the next era of self improvement.",,False,self,t5_2r6f3,False,,,True,t3_1hj9l1,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/comments/1hj9l1/high_school_english_please_proof_read_my/,

I know the following bonds, have the following molar bond enthalpies (in kJ mol-1) and also that Carbon Monoxide (CO) has a triple bond.

Cl−Cl	243

C=O	770

C−Cl	346

C≡O	1074


First I calculated the enthalpy of the bond breaking, so:

CO (breaks to) C + O = 1074 kJ mol-1         
Cl2 (breaks to) Cl + Cl = 243

Overall enthalpy = +1317 kJ mol-1.

Then I calculated the enthalpy of the bond forming, so:

1 x O-C bond = 770              
2 x Cl-C bonds  = 243 x 2

Overall enthalpy: -1256 kJ mol-1.

Now I must calculate the enthalpy of the whole reaction, 
so,
Enthalpy = +1317 - 1256   /   
= 53 kJ mol-1.

It's a project I've been working on for a while. Maybe someone could do me the honor of checking it for me? 


Sometimes it comes to a point where that black room is filled to the edges, and something needs to get out but it can’t.
And I am imploding. 
I am breaking myself against the wall I made to keep that something away from me. 
But what I really did was keeping me out from myself.
And alone in there it has more control over me than I dare to admit.
But how do you tell someone, that every great thing you’ve ever done in your life, you’ve done with and because of a huge amount of madness?  
It took me forward in times anyone would have backed down. 
It shaped me into a remarkable person. 
It taught me about love. 
And it taught me about hatred. 
But most of all it taught me that we can all be monsters in times when we have to defend ourselves or someone we love.
This something taught me what true freedom is, what true kindness looks like and how humanity feels. 
I’m a good person. 
I have never done anything to intentionally hurt anyone. 
Yet I’m a monster. 
Not in your eyes, but in mine, because I see my soul.
I have made choices in my life and maybe they were going to turn out right. But the right way for me have always been the wrong way for someone else. Maybe someone who isn’t that close, but close enough to feel their frustration and their tears when I take something away from them. 
Something that I need, or something I just have to get. 
Maybe it isn’t right. Maybe that someone, who I actually was desperate to get away from, truly needed me. 
Maybe I’ve done wrong. 
Maybe I shouldn’t have risked my own well-being and my relation to everyone I loved just to save those two small someones, who couldn’t do it for themselves.
Yet I did those things. 
Why? 
Because people live by chance. They wait for something greater to happen, for someone lovable to show up. And when they do, they have been too comfortable with what they’ve already got, so they let it pass. 
I can’t do that. 
I spent many years of my life with medication. Years which I can’t even remember, and when I finally woke up from that, most things that I used to love were all gone. 
His smile at the breakfast table, and the big bags of groceries every time he came back home. 
Her tanned face, warm hugs and the cigarette she used to give me behind her back when no one we’re around. 
Their laughter’s in their bedroom when I sneaked by, knowing they we’re doing something they weren’t allowed to. 
And the dog, always so happy to be around. Never allowed in my bed, yet, the only place he slept was there.
And the neighbors kids. I knitted hats for them all. 
Until that one day when they we’re all gone. 
And that one day I became a monster because it was easier to face something dark with darkness itself, than to face dark with a small shimmering light that was on the edge of going off. 
That something inside of me, which I’ve locked in for a very long time, is a small shimmering light which I can’t afford to use. 
But I can feel it growing, and someday, somewhere, somehow I will let it out,
And there will be joy again. 
I was a monster, because I couldn’t afford life. 
And I’m a human, because I do wrong sometimes. 
I’m Maya, because in depths of my heart, that light is spreading.
And I can finally feel it, I am myself again.

**Question 1**: I normally just plug and chug for problems like these (although I'm sure there's a better method I don't know of) but I am confused at how they derived the final answer of B. It seems like f(-x) swaps the sign and order of the domain but I don't have the intuition why.

x(x-1) &lt; x


x^2 - 2x &lt; 0


x^2 - 2x + 1 &lt; 1


(x-1)^2 &lt; 1


x-1 &lt; 1


x &lt; 2

**Question 3**: cos(theta) = cos(1) ... not sure why theta doesn't just equal 1. Completely confused by this one. The actual answer is 5.28.

**Question 4**: Option ""I"" seems to be correct because if x=0 there will be division by zero and thus a vertical asymptote there. I don't know how to find out about the other two-especially ""III"". Can anyone help me with finding minima and maxima for equations like these (quadratic?)?

My teacher shows us using some method that looks more like balancing the total charge of each side. Here is one I'm having trouble with, it's a double displacement reaction:

1350865761.0,7,self.HomeworkHelp,11vbm0,English 101 - I cannot get through this short passage to understand what it means. I just need a general idea of the content.,8,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/comments/11vbm0/english_101_i_cannot_get_through_this_short/,"They say that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer
injustice, evil; but that the evil is greater than the good. 
And so when men have both done and suffered injustice and have had
experience of both, not being able to avoid the one and obtain
the other, they think that they had better agree among themselves
to have neither; hence there arise laws and mutual covenants;
and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just. 
This they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice;--it is a mean
or compromise, between the best of all, which is to do injustice
and not be punished, and the worst of all, which is to suffer injustice
without the power of retaliation; and justice, being at a middle point
between the two, is tolerated not as a good, but as the lesser evil,
and honoured by reason of the inability of men to do injustice. 
For no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such
an agreement if he were able to resist; he would be mad if he did. 
Such is the received account, Socrates, of the nature and origin
of justice.



   Now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because
they have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we
imagine something of this kind: having given both to the just
and the unjust power to do what they will, let us watch and see
whither desire will lead them; then we shall discover in the very
act the just and unjust man to be proceeding along the same road,
following their interest, which all natures deem to be their good,
and are only diverted into the path of justice by the force of law. 


The liberty which we are supposing may be most completely
given to them in the form of such a power as is said to have
been possessed by Gyges the ancestor of Croesus the Lydian. 

According to the tradition, Gyges was a shepherd in the service
of the king of Lydia; there was a great storm, and an earthquake made
an opening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock. 

Amazed at the sight, he descended into the opening, where,
among other marvels, he beheld a hollow brazen horse, having doors,
at which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature,
as appeared to him, more than human, and having nothing on but a
gold ring; this he took from the finger of the dead and reascended. 

Now the shepherds met together, according to custom, that they
might send their monthly report about the flocks to the king;
into their assembly he came having the ring on his finger, and as he
was sitting among them he chanced to turn the collet of the ring inside
his hand, when instantly he became invisible to the rest of the company
and they began to speak of him as if he were no longer present. 

He was astonished at this, and again touching the ring he turned
the collet outwards and reappeared; he made several trials of the ring,
and always with the same result-when he turned the collet inwards he
became invisible, when outwards he reappeared. Whereupon he contrived
to be chosen one of the messengers who were sent to the court;
where as soon as he arrived he seduced the queen, and with her help
conspired against the king and slew him, and took the kingdom. 

Suppose now that there were two such magic rings, and the just put
on one of them and the unjust the other;,no man can be imagined
to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice. 

No man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he could
safely take what he liked out of the market, or go into houses
and lie with any one at his pleasure, or kill or release from prison
whom he would, and in all respects be like a God among men. 

Then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust;
they would both come at last to the same point. And this we may
truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is just, not willingly
or because he thinks that justice is any good to him individually,
but of necessity, for wherever any one thinks that he can safely
be unjust, there he is unjust. For all men believe in their hearts
that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice,
and he who argues as I have been supposing, will say that they are right. 

If you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible,
and never doing any wrong or touching what was another's, he would
be thought by the lookers-on to be a most wretched idiot, although they
would praise him to one another's faces, and keep up appearances
with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice. 

Enough of this.

Hello. Thats my homework question, so any hints will be appreciated.

**The problem statement, all variables and given/known data**

&gt;Paul consumes only two goods, pizza (P) and hamburgers (H), and considers them to be perfect substitutes, as shown by his utility function: U(P, H) = P + 4H. The price of pizza is $3 and the price of hamburgers is $6, and Paul’s monthly income is $300. Knowing that he likes pizza, Paul’s grandmother gives him a birthday gift certificate of $60 redeemable only at Pizza Hut. Though Paul is happy to get this gift, his grandmother did not realize that she could have made him exactly as happy by spending far less than she did. How much would she have needed to give him in cash to make him just as well of as with the gift certificate?

**Relevant equations**

U(P,H)=P+4H subject to 300≤3P+6H

**The attempt at a solution**

Paul can buy 20 pizzas with that gift certificate. I assume that the rest 300$ he will spend on hamburgers which cost 6$, so he will buy 50 hamburgers. When (P,H)=(20,50) the utility he gets is U(20,50)=20+4*50=220. Now, If my reasoning up to this step has been right, I need to figure out another bundle (P,H) which will get as much utility for Paul.

I'm doing a masters year course in Renewable Energy and Distributed Generation.

I feel I should give the question and then what I worked as the solution (so far) and if there are any discrepancies, could you point out where you think there might be some funny numbers for me to re-look over?

So,
A single-phase transformer has 480 turns on the primary and 90 turns on the secondary. The mean length of the flux path in the iron core is 1.8m and the joints in the magnetic circuit are equivalent to an airgap of 0.1mm. If the maximum flux density is to be 1.1T when a p.d. of 2,200V at 50Hz is applied to the primary, calculate:

a) The cross sectional area of the core
b) The secondary voltage on the no-load
c) The primary current and power factor on no load.

Assume the relative permeability of the iron core is 2,200. The iron loss is 1.7W/kg at 50Hz and the density of the iron is 7,800 kg/m³
My answers thus far:


Φ = Flux  V1 = 2,200V  N1 = 480 turns  N2 = 90 turns  f = 50Hz  LFe = 1.8m  LAir = 0.1*10^-3 B = 1.1 T

a) 
Φ = V/(4.44.f.N1) = 2,200/(4.44x50x480) = 20.6 mWb

Area A = Φ/B = 20.6*10^-3 /1.1 = 0.0187 m^2

b) (This is the one that does not sit right with me, it just seems too simple...)

V2 = V1*(N2/N1) = 412.5V

(But also working out this way also tends to make me think that it is correct:)

V2 = 4.44.f.N2.Φ = 411.588V 

(But less accurate as I have to take into account for the flux not being exact. The calculation could also just be cancelled down so that you are just left with the V2.)


I haven't done c) yet as I wanted to make sure this was correct...",,False,self,t5_2r6f3,False,,,True,t3_103o5y,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/comments/103o5y/anyone_any_good_with_magnetic_circuits_in_a/,

The assignment is to account for core themes in the north of Norway, more specifically in Finnmark. 

This course has a high focus on Finnmark because the guy who runs it (Rune Blix Hagen) discovered a rather large body of evidence from the area which hadn't been seen for several centuries, and he has therefore done a lot of work on that specifically. Also, the university I attend is close to the region. 

What I need is for you all to ask questions about this. That will help me get started with the writing. I will try to post answers both as replies and as edits in the post. Thank you all in advance!

**TL;DR:** Ask me questions about the witch trials in Finnmark, Norway. For science.

EDIT: Wups, a ""do this for me"" post. Sorry. Should have scrolled and read that part.

**DRAFT:** 
Finnmark is an interesting subject of research in relation to witchcraft persecution. This region was, per capita, one of the worst in Europe as far as death penalties go. It is also one of the best documented areas in Europe. In this essay I will try to account for some of the main themes of the persecutions in Finnmark, in a slightly comparative perspective on several planes. Differences and likenesses between east and west, between Finnmark and the rest of Norway, and between Finnmark and Bute, Scottland (another remote coastal region with an ""indigenous people"" element) will be discussed. 

In the far north, Finnmark was shrouded in mysteries for most people further south in Norway, never mind people from the European mainland who had heard, if anything at all, mostly tales of Ultima Thule, the polar night, harsh climates, Sami savages, [Hell's gate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domen,_Norway#History_and_folklore) and so on. This is important to keep in mind, because government officials in the area almost invariably came from farther south in Europe, selected by the King's court in Copenhagen.

The persecutions were late to both start and finish in Finnmark, spanning mostly from 1593 to 1692. From a total Norwegian population of around 440.000, Finnmark was home to less than a tenth, counting roughly 3200 inhabitants in an area larger than today's Denmark (not counting Greenland and the Faroe Islands). Among these 3200, some 1500 were of the Sami people.

Eg. Two Random samples of size 400 and 450 were taken from population X and Y respectively. These samples were taken to analyze the daily calorie intake. From the first population X, it was found that mean is 1900 calories with standard deviation of 100 calories, while for population Y mean was 1800 and standard deviation of 150. Assume that the 2 populations have equal variances.

i) Calculate the 99% confidence interval for the true difference of the two means.


Now I don't understand how he tells to assume they have equal variances but he gives me 2 different standard deviations. And I am uncertain how I should proceed :(



EDIT: What I tried working it out so far but I am not sure I worked it correctly.


So I think I would have to use the equation z = [(X1-X2) - Ux2-x2]/σx1-x2

Were X1 and X2 are the sample mean of X and Y respectively

Ux2-x2 = the mean difference of the populations X and Y (U1-U2) which is the mean difference of the sampling distribution.

σx1-x2 is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution found with [σx1-x2]^2= [(σ1)^2/n1] + [(σ2)^2/n2] with n being the sample size take from each population.

Now from 99% confidence I found the z value to be 2.575 (found from the table) and since graph is symmetrical you get +/-.

So I get:  

           -2.575 &lt; z &lt; 2.575

           -2.575 &lt; [(X1-X2) - Ux2-x2]/σx1-x2 &lt; 2.575

               69 &lt; (X1-X2) &lt; 131

And so I got that range for (X1-X2) but I am still not sure if this is correct since X1-X2 is the mean difference of the samples which is not very accurate and he asked for the true difference between the means right? I am reasoning wrong because I just feel like I am doing something wrong.

You don't need to solve them for me, but would you please outline how to do them (what steps I need to take, Ie take the lagrange, set equal to blah, etc) because that is where I'm really lost. There aren't any example problems in my book that are like these and my prof didn't give us any examples like them in class &gt;.&gt;

1. Show that the rectangular box (including a top and bottom) with fixed Volume V with the smallest possible surface area is a cube (a rectangular box with sides x, y, z).

What I have for this so far:
Volume is constant and greater than 0, so x,y,z&gt;0 and x+y+z&gt;0
- V=xyz
-z=V/(xy)
Sa(surface area)(x,y,z)=Sa(x,y,V/(xy))=Sa(x,y)
And I know we want to minimize Sa, but I'm not sure how.



2. Find the extreme values of f(x,y)=x^2+2y^2 subject to the constraint g(x,y)=4x-6y=25 (what does this even mean?)

a) Show that the Lagrange equations yield 2x=4*lambda, 4y=-6*lambda.

b) show that if x=0 or y=0, then lambda=0 and the Lagrange equation gives x=y=0. Since (0,0) does not satisfy the constraint, you may assume that x and y are nonzero.

c) Use the Lagrange equations to show that y=-3/4 x.

d) Substitute in the constraint equation to show that there is a unique critical point P.

e) does P correspond to a minimum or maxiumum value of f? Do the values of f(x,y) increase or decrease as (x,y) moves away from P along the line g(x,y)=0?

so far for this: 
a) gradient f=&lt;2x, 4y&gt;
g_x(x,y)=4
g_y(x,y)=-6

lambda*&lt;2x,4y&gt;=&lt;4,-6&gt;
Lambda_x=2 ---&gt; 2x=4lambda
Lambda_y=-6/4 --&gt; 4y=-6lambda

I'm actually finishing up my last year of college, and I'm in the process of finishing a project for my computer simulation class, which is an upper division computer science class. 

Anyways, I basically have to take some data that I have, and fit it to this odd poisson point process, called Hawkes. I've got a working simulation of hawkes going, and am currently trying to figure out how to program the MCMC(specifically, metropolis-hastings) to find the parameters.

Now then, most things I can find on MCMC involve a fraction that I *think* is (posterior(candidate)/Likelihood(previous))/(posterior(previous)/Likelihood(candidate)), comparing this fraction to a uniform random number from 0-1, and then accepting the candidate if the fraction is lower.

I'm concerned over a couple parts:

* I may not properly understand that fraction.

* I don't fully understand the concept of posterior distributions, aaand

* I have discrete data points, not a distribution, which is what apparently everyone uses to teach MCMC online.

I do, however, have the likelihood function. I'm guessing at a kind of rudimentary level, I could simply divide the two likelihoods (previous on top, candidate on the bottom) and take the minimum with the random number, but I'm worried that that's not good statistics, and I'll get marked off horrendously.

I realize this is kind of an out there question, but I was afraid to immediately post it in r/statistics as they have said they dont do homework help. I figure I'll try here first and then maybe try over there. Thanks for reading!

1329427818.0,5,self.HomeworkHelp,psvbj,"Grammer nazis, can you please review my essay?
p.s. The topic is ""Is man good or evil by nature"";)",7,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/comments/psvbj/grammer_nazis_can_you_please_review_my_essay_ps/,"Man by nature is not good or evil, instead he is selfish, greedy, and cares about allowing himself to rise to power and will do whatever it takes to do so. Good and evil is explained pretty clearly in psychology. Good is the mindset that someone will do what it takes to promote everyone’s development while evil is doing whatever it takes to stop someone else from advancing forward with their development. However man does not simply choose which path is better for them, instead he or she naturally decides which one to choose to meet their needs (Philosophy: Good vs. Evil).
 
Freud explained all of this very clearly in his psychosocial analysis when he stated that man was made up of three parts (Id, Ego). These parts are id, ego, and superego. By nature, man already has id as his or hers dominate mindset, worrying about things like survival, sex, and every other animalistic act that is necessary for his or her own pleasure. The id side of survival is not worried about what others think, and may even act evil to get where he needs to go. Id may even help someone or something because it is necessary for their survival. 

Even though id may seem “bad” in man’s eyes, he is not truly evil. Being evil is purposely trying to set back someone else, Id’s goals are to forward our own self. His goals are not intended to hurt others and does not even “think” about doing so whatsoever. He is not evil; he is just selfish, greedy, and animalistic.

The tendency to want to meet both peoples need is called “superego” (Id, Ego). Superego is the higher educated part of the natural mind set, which searches for ways to help both parties in a situation and advances forwards based on the amount of nurture given. Erikson emphasizes these claims by describing how a person who receives positive development tends to be friendlier, and less shunned, by society (Erikson’s Psychosocial). Superego is not “good” or “evil” however, he and id both just do what they believe is best. Superego just does it in a way where both parties can benefit more often than not.

Now if one is not born evil, how does he or she become an “evil being” as described in novels and movies all over the world (Philosophy: Good)? Becoming evil is not by nature, it is by nurture. Erikson states that if a child has constant negative attention from other people, than eventually he or she will only try to outcast others and make them feel what he or she feels (Erikson’s Psychosocial). So while man by nature is selfish, he is not evil, he is not even good. He just does not have the sympathy needed to worry about others and decide on a better solution than the first thought that came into his head.

The question was about how to solve (n!)/84 = ((n-2)!)/(((n-2)-(n-4))!) for n.  

You can expand (n-1)! to be equal to n!/(n) and in much the same way, (n-2)! = n!/((n)(n-1)).  

You also can simplify ((n-2)-(n-4))! to be 2! because the inside is just algebra.

My work:  
(n!)/84 = ((n-2)!)/(((n-2)-(n-4))!)  
(n!)/84 = ((n)!)/((n)(n-1))((n-2)-(n-4))!)  
(n!)/84 = ((n)!)/((n)(n-1)(2!))  
1/84 = 1/(2(n)(n-1))  
Then you know that  
84 = 2n(n-1)  
42 = n(n-1)  
Thus, you get a quadratic of  
n^2 - n - 42 = 0  
which factors to (n-7)(n+6)=0

Absolute fucking shit. I'm desperate for people to help me look over it, and if anyone here can give me any sort of advice I'd be really fucking grateful.


Statement of Purpose
	When I was young, my father brought home The Private Life of Plants by David Attenborough. I was captivated. I finished it within a week, and watched it over the greater part of a year. When my father subsequently bought The Blue Planet and The Life of Mammals, I knew that I wanted to be an ecologist. Over the years, these goals have evolved and become more refined, but the general idea remained the same. With this goal in mind, I set out on a journey to improve myself and acquire knowledge in the biological sciences. I remained fascinated by ecology throughout high school, working on projects involving the effects of growth stimulants on tadpoles, and scoring a perfect score on my Biology SAT Subject Test. I volunteered for hundreds of hours in the _________ Zoo, and gained experience with dealing with all sorts of fauna, including deers, boa constrictors, and snapping turtles. I also helped develop a few programs to boost the zoo’s popularity. Near the end of high school, my interests shifted towards biochemistry, and I entered college as a biochemistry major. I was lucky enough to be granted the opportunities to intern in various biochemistry labs. As a high school senior, I worked in Dr. ________'s lab, where I studied protein active sites with the help of some graduate students. I learned to operate many advanced laboratory equipments and learned various techniques for keeping good lab notes. As a freshman, I interned in Dr. _________’s lab, where I studied neuronal morphogenesis using pluripotent embryonic mice cells.  As a sophomore, I worked in Dr. ___________s lab, where I was fortunate enough to participate in a high funding study that studied impaired cognitive states using a 3D virtual-reality environment to simulate driving situations. As I continued through college, however, I realized that I wasn’t particularly happy with what I was doing. Remembering the visceral enjoyment I used to have working with animals, I decided to switch my focus towards ecology and evolutionary biology. I worked in Dr. _________’s lab as a junior, where I studied mutualistic interactions between endophytic fungi and plant hosts, namely those that can cause a high increase in plant fecundity. Currently, I am acting as a lab assisant in Dr. _________’s lab, under the guidance of graduate student ________. The project I am currently assisting with studies biotic controls of ecology and the evolution of plant growth and defense in response to these biotic controls. The project focuses on examining the differences between plant tolerance and plant resistance, using different herbivores as biotic controls to influence selections on plants for growth and defense. The questions that the project seeks to answer include the matter of whether herbivores select plants that tolerate damage or whether tolerance is a product of selection. I aim to conduct my independent research on a similar topic. I plan to use Sapium sebifera, the Chinese Tallow, as a study system. My goal in this project is to introduce herbivores as a biotic control to determine the change in herbivore tolerance and growth rate that occurs in the Chinese Tallow. Scale insects are a group of herbivores that have not been used with Chinese Tallow before. A study like this can be significant, as the Chinese Tallow is a noxious invader, and studying such interactions can allow ecologists to better understand how to fight the Tallow’s spread. I’ve also broadened my knowledge by taking all sorts of classes. The fields that I’ve been exposed to include insect biology, conservation, immunology, evolution, genetics, infectious diseases, and biodiversity. I’ve also expanded my base by taking all sorts of psychology, philosophy, and language classes. With all that I’ve done as an undergraduate, continuing my studies in graduate school is the obvious progression. I plan to acquire my Ph.D. with similar research to what I have experience with. Most likely I will be focused on the evolution of interactions between organisms. My prior experience consists mostly of mutualistic plant interaction with fungi and conflicts between plants and invertebrates, but I am also interested in studying population dynamics and how introduction of invasive species and other novel interactions can change the population structure. I hope to work on study systems that are having strong effects on the ecosystem that they occupy, and to publish data that can be significant in understanding the ecological interactions that they have. All things considered, I feel that _______ university is a good fit for all of my needs. The research of Professor ________ is especially compelling, as it focuses on biological interactions and population dynamics. Dr. _______’s research is a great fit for my interests, and I believe that I can definitely cultivate my knowledge and grow as an individual in his/her lab. I would be extremely pleased to work with Dr. ______, and if I were to be given this opportunity, I would do my utmost best to succeed in my studies.

1318292047.0,6,self.HomeworkHelp,l7oh5,English essay Beowulf vs Gawain and the Green Knight. Can anybody proof read 2-3 pages for me?,7,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/comments/l7oh5/english_essay_beowulf_vs_gawain_and_the_green/,"What is expected from the average Scandinavian soldier at the time Beowulf was first conceived, is to aspire to be the alpha warrior. The means of achieving alpha warrior status go by the following; boasting by claiming you are able to tackle any challenge. Then completing said task to reach the final step, reward. By today’s standards Beowulf would be considered a mercenary or a goon for hire. Beowulf’s climb to the top of the ladder is attributed to his boasting, his encounter with Unferth in Heoret gives an idea of what kind of man Beowulf is. After being questioned as to why he lost the race against Berca, Beowulf explains he was distracted by nine sea monsters and had slay them. His claim childishly rejected by Unferth when he implies that even though Beowulf did slay the sea monsters, he still lost the race against Berca.   Being the only man in Heoret that is fit enough to take on Grendle and Grendel’s mother, Beowulf is victorious in his battles and is rewarded for his good deed. It is obvious that Beowulf is highly regarded as the best warrior in the land, but warriors are not good leaders. 


A good example of leadership in Beowulf is king Hrothgar, a man that is conservative in his actions. The type of leader that delegates and arranges an army, and not stand in the front line. Hrothgar knew Beowulf’s downfall will be in battle, when he warned young Beowulf before his departure back home. As time progressed Beowulf became a king, and he is presented with a problem. A dragon has been harassing villagers, and has been causing severe damage. As expected Beowulf doesn't think twice and accepts the challenge, without even considering his old age. Had he listened to Hrothgars advice, he would have had a better chance completing the task with out risking fatal injuries.  In his fight with the dragon his arrogance clouded his judgment, by asking the soldiers he brought with him to stay behind. The soldiers obeyed Beowulf except for Wiglaf, who followed the king into the dragon’s cave. It was a bad decision on Beowulf’s part, because he needed more people in the cave. Granted there was only one iron shield, but the death of a few foot soldiers who are hungry for glory is better than the death of a king. A general should never be in the front lines, the army he’s commanding would suffer a major blow if they lose him. Some would argue and say that a general in the front lines is good for moral, and that Beowulf was brave and fought to his last breath. Yes, Beowulf is a brave man and a courageous warrior, but he’s a bad leader for leaving his people hanging dry after his death. 



On the other side of spectrum there is Sir Gawain, an English knight in Camelot’s round table. Gawain is a good example of the decline of chivalry, and how a knight should never let his emotions dictate his actions. When reading Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, I couldn't help but to think about Eric Idle’s character Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-As-Sir-Lancelot in the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail. He fails every test thrown at him, from the advances of Bertilak’s wife to not disclosing the magic belt to the Green Knight. Gawain even flinched while the Green Knight was delivering his well deserved blow, going against the beheading for a beheading agreement. The Green Knight on the other hand has proven himself as an honorable knight, by abiding the knights code of conduct and by not going back on his word. Gawain fell for Morgan Le Faye’s elaborate plan to test his chivalry and nobility, and has failed time and time again. Gawain’s leadership is non existent, to fight under Gawain’s rule is suicide. The right balance of being courageous and being conservative is hard to achieve, and Gawain is too careful and timid to make hard decisions.


What can be said about leadership in Beowulf and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, is that leadership is found in the side characters Hrothgar and the Green Knight. The leading men in both stories are complete opposites in their flaws, yet they share a similar mindset of obeying authority and getting the job done. Gawain and Beowulf are soldiers that lack the sophistication needed to be leaders, one is too fragile and the other is too agressive. They are better at following orders than giving them, and there is nothing wrong with following orders.

Unfortunately the only course I could get into this semester is General Chemistry.  They used to offer Basic Chem for non Chem majors, but for whatever reason it wasn't offered this semester. Despite the fact that I'm FAR from science minded, I've been doing well up to this point.  Got an A on my first test, and the labs have been more or less easy.

My current assignment for next week's lab is to devise an experimental procedure that demonstrates the relationship between a volume of gas and its temperature when the pressure and molecules of air stay constant.  

So far I've been great at following the instructions in experimental procedures.  But I'm drawing a complete blank on how to do this, I went into this class just hoping to get a C and get out with another gen ed crossed off my list.  The tutors have more or less been told not to help us with the designs (other than to inform us when our concepts are plagued by troll phsyics), and my instructer has thus far not e-mailed me back.
Oh and I've got a Lab partner who is on the school's baseball team?  He's not very bright, and is not avaliable to work with me on afternoons, and most evenings due to practice.  I am fine with this, and have been working alone this entire time and turning in lab reports with both our names on it.  I'd be pissed at him, but there wouldn't be any point... if I give him responsibility he'll just lower my grade.  Plus he makes himself useful during the actual execution of the experiments... does what I tell him, and never messes up recording the right data.  I also know he's grasping the material.  I give him the report before we turn it in, and tell him to look it over and ask me any questions if there's something he doesn't understand.  He get's mostly B's on his homework, and scraped by with an A- on the first test, so I know I'm not just hanging him out to dry.

Trouble is, I've got no clue where to even start.  One guy I know who's a chemistry genius (but also VERY aspy... err I mean socially awkward) told me he used a large beaker, and a graduated cylinder he dipped into the water up-side-down.  Then he heated the water and some how or other he was able to record the change in volume.  I'll be honest... I had no clue what he was talking about, and for all I know, the pressure isn't remaining constant.  At least I know the molecules of air trapped under the graduating cyllinder  remain constant.

Am I on the right track on this?  I'm not trying to cheat, just want to be pointed in the right direction.

Edit: Thanks for the suggestions.  Talked to one of the lab assistants today about it.  He said to just dip a balloon under water of varying degrees of temperature.  While it's under the water I just do my best to wrap a string around it to record the balloon's circumference.  He said the graduated cyllinder idea would work, but only if I devise some contraption that will keep it from tipping over.  I also tested the idea out at home with a boiling pot of water and a pint glass.  I could get the pint glass to float, but it floated all awkwardly, and was extremely difficult to keep from swaying one way or the other.

Anyway, the instructor said everyone just ends up dipping a balloon in ice water, getting shoddy circumference data because it's hard to hold a baloon underwater, wrap a string around it's at the right point, and keep your finger on the right place.  After that the string provided in class stretches considerably when wet.  Apparently the whole point of the experiment is just to see if we can come up with anything, and we simply will be judged on whether or not we try something that ""makes theoretical"" sense.  Doesn't matter how hard it is to execute.  Lollllll  Thanks for the help!

1373772098.0,4,self.HomeworkHelp,1i984e,[High School Maths] The Quadratic Function: Definite and Indefinite Quadratics,5,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/comments/1i984e/high_school_maths_the_quadratic_function_definite/,"Hi, /r/HomeworkHelp!

Here's my problem.

---

&gt;Find the discriminant of *f*(*x*) = 2*x*^(2) + 2*bx* + c.
&gt;
&gt;Hence show that *f*(*x*) can be expressed as a sum
&gt;
&gt;(*x* − *r*)^(2) + (*x* − *s*)^(2) 
&gt;
&gt;of two distinct squares (that is, with *r* ≠ *s*) if and only if *f*(*x*) is positive definite.

---

Okay, so I can find the discriminant of f(x) = 2*x*^(2) + 2*bx* + c.

Δ = (2*b*)^(2) − 4 × 2 × *c*

= 4*b*^(2) − 8*c*

= 4(*b*^(2) − 2*c*)

But I don't understand how it can help me for the second part of the question. Surely to show the result in the second part of the question, all you have to do is find the discriminant of 

(*x* − *r*)^(2) + (*x* − *s*)^(2)

and then show that it cannot satisfy the indefinite case (Δ ≥ 0) but can satisfy the definite case (Δ &lt; 0), and then state that it's positive definite because *a* = 2, so *a* &gt; 0.

I've done that as follows:

(*x* − *r*)^(2) + (*x* − *s*)^(2)

= *x*^(2) − 2*rx* + *r*^(2) + *x*^(2) − 2*sx* + *s*^(2)

= 2*x*^(2) − 2(*r* + *s*)*x* + (*r*^(2) + *s*^(2))

so Δ = (−2(*r* + *s*))^(2) − 4 × 2(*r*^(2) + *s*^(2))

= 4(*r* + *s*)^(2) − 4 × 2(*r*^(2) + *s*^(2))

= 4[(*r* + *s*)^(2) − 2(*r*^(2) + *s*^(2))]

= 4(*r*^(2) + 2*rs* + *s*^(2) − 2*r*^(2) − 2*s*^(2))

= −4(*r*^(2) − 2*rs* + *s*^(2))

= −4(*r* − *s*)^(2)

and −4(*r* − *s*)^(2) cannot be greater than or equal to zero, because *r* ≠ *s* and squares can't be negative.

Therefore −4(*r* − *s*)^(2) &lt; 0. This is the definite case, so any quadratic function that can be expressed as a sum of two distinct squares must be definite, and because *a* = 2, *a* &gt; 0, so it must also be positive definite.

---

That's how I would answer this question. But the question clearly wants me to do something with the discriminant of 

*f*(*x*) = 2*x*^(2) + 2*bx* + c

and for the life of me I have no idea what that is, or why it would assist me in the second part of the question.

Problem is the prof, although he is a really nice guy, didn't teach me anything and I feel like I'm flying blind. 

Premise of my project: I wanted to look at how levels of spending in different areas by national governments effect Gini coefficients. I tapped into the vast statistical database of the OECD and I was able to find complete data from 2006 on 19 countries (I know, in a perfect world I should have at least 25 in my sample size. If someone can explain to me ANOVA then maybe I'll do that). My data base dependent variables include Early childhood education spending per person (SPP), general education SPP, Tertiary education SPP, Defense SPP, Healthcare SPP, Infrastructure SPP, Healthcare (percent of GDP), Defense SPP, Active labor market policy spending per person, and passive labor market policy spending per person. All of the Spending per person info is adjusted for currency and is in the same year dollars. For the independent variable, I have Gini Coefficient before taxes and transfers but I'm looking at adding after taxes and transfer (at disposable income) and/or standard error Gini (post taxes and transfer). However I'm concerned since I don't completely understand the implications of ""at disposable income"" or the standard error of the Gini coefficient. 

When I plug in all the data i've collected into excel's Regression tool (under data analysis) it gives me a multiple r= 0.956, r^2= .914, adjusted R^2 =.838 and a standard error of 0.0204. 

 It also spits out Coefficients, SE, t-stat, p-value, and lower/upper 95% data for each variable.

I'm not completely sure what to do now. I need to somehow put this into a paper that outlines my results. 

Any advice or where to go from here? At this point, even if my approach is all wrong, I guess my best bet it to explain what I have.

This understanding of fantasy is completely valid yet there is also another way to interpret this genre; by looking at fantasy as a form that raises serious issues concerning the implications of humanity and her institutions.  Such an outlook is not unique yet it is not common, in Kathleen Morner’s writing she states that fantasy is “a work that is set in an imaginary, unreal, or utopian world” which may be read as “serious or satirical commentary on human affairs and institutions”. (PAGE NUMBER????) This kind of commentary is found unsuspectingly in popular fantasy through the use of character archetypes and is used as a warning for threats to the way of life of the authors.

               By looking at fantasy novels from different periods of recent history the events that burdened society as a whole become evident; one such topic is the decline of religion and the implications that it has with daily life.  This relation between religion and society is established clearly within the writings of popular twentieth century authors.

               The author C.S Lewis is known to be a well received author, at least in the western parts of the world, and have had great success with his novels which have even had film adaptations produced.  In his novels religion is shown to be a necessity in life, which is a response to how people were moving away from the faith, and it shows how the author was deeply concerned with this and attempts to show his audience that they need to turn back to their faiths in order to attain salvation.  C.S. Lewis was a very spiritual man who attempted to highlight how it is in the best interest of the individual to turn to religion in order to resist the influences of the devil and his associates. (Kilby 39)  This idea of turning to God and heaven for salvation is seen several times in The Screwtape Letters indicating that the author was deeply concerned for how people were not concerning themselves deeply enough with their faith.  This is seen through the actions of Screwtape who “confesses that he is tempted to give up hell for heaven” (Kilby 40.) This confession of Screwtape’s desires reveals that even those who are of great evil has a desire to perform good actions and turn towards God and away from the devil.  This is one response to the changes between the interaction of humanity and the Christian Church, this same concept of religion is again addressed from another perspective by R.A. Salvatore in his Forgotten Realms series.

               The stories written by R.A. Salvatore, based upon the mythology of Dungeons and Dragons, depict the issues of modern religious practices.  Within this fantastical world there exist two primary separations, the Underdark and the Surface World.  The protagonist of The Forgotten Realms series is a Dark elf of the Underdark who flees to the surface in order to escape a society that he feels he can not belong to in good conscientiousness. The Drow or Dark Elves favor the Spider Queen, Lolth their deity, whose favor is paramount and if a group ever loses her favor the destruction the family can and does ensue. This is seen several times within the first novels serving as a warning to humanity to be suspicious of radicalism.  The first time that the reader may observe the brutality that is associated with radicalism is within the first novel of the series when the protagonist’s family destroys a household that has offended their deity.  These forms of sheer butchering of others of the same race show how radicalism enforces these forms of brutish punishment for religious treason.  The second time that this radicalism is truly seen again is in the destruction of the protagonists family, the few survivors are taken into households taken as their own. (Ch. 25, Exile*********)  This calls attention to the growing radical actions of certain religious sects which were, during the time that these novels were being produced, portrayed with negative connotations within the media as they were seen as enemies to the state and of the most common western religion.

               The Drow society shares one key common component with human culture and that is the role of religion within society.  Within the Drow society the religion surrounding the Spider Queen is all that is important as her will dictates order in the seemingly lawless society, similarly in human culture the rules and social practices are derived from religious tenets.  The fantasy genre reflects this concept because in fantasy the religious and political leaders are often indistinguishable. The novels by R.A. Salvatore show that the Drow society is ruled by the largest household which is also the house that lies in the greatest favor of the Spider Queen. (CH. 3[PAGE NUMBERS OVER CHAPTERS*], Homeland) The Drow society has few rules to maintain social order yet has many faith based tenets that it follow.  Specifically when regarding the social hierarchy in which females are granted more power and respect then even the most accomplished males due to the matriarchal nature of the society.  This is very similar to the nature of cultures that have roots in the Christian faith, it has been interpreted that the principal deity of Christianity is a male as it is addressed as Father, and how until recently there has been a great gender based inequality within parts of the world with this religious background.  This goes to further show how fantasy reflects the values of the society to which the author belongs and as such points out the flaws of that very same society.

               The difference between political and religious rules blurs even further in The Chronicles of Narnia.  This series of novels by C.S. Lewis establish Aslan, the lion, as a representation of God, a creator,   seen in the novel The Magicians Nephew, when Aslan creates Narnia from nothing and keeps away evil through use of a magical tree (Kilby 118), which is clearly a retelling of the book of Genesis with use of ethereal representations of God.  In the later novels C.S. Lewis shows that Aslan is not merely a creator of the world of Narnia but is also a leader to its inhabitants, seen in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in which the unity of the “good” creatures of Narnia unite behind Aslan in order to combat the white witch.  This merely demonstrates that religion is the base of society and that once upon a time its religious and political leaders were one in the same.

These political views are responses to movements that went against the teachings of the majority religion of the western culture.  During the time of these authors gay marriage became an issue as it became somewhat accepted within the western world as it was no longer considered a crime to be part of a same sex marriage although it remained to be seen as a grave sin in the Christian faith. This impacted the authors enough for them to write in a manner which highlights the opposition that can be expected from a society that is deeply rooted in faith based culture when presented with an idea that is counter intuitive to the majority religion.

               Religious issues were not the only thing to fear during the time period in which these authors wrote.  For there was a great fear that is associated with other regions of the political spectrum; throughout this time there was the rise in popularity throughout the east with Red or Communist forms of government.  The idea that there was a threat to the current way of life is seen in the most popular fantasy series of our time, in both The Lord of the Rings series and the Harry Potter series.

               The conflict within the Lord of the Rings is quite obvious that there is an uprising of seemingly dark enemies from the south and the east rising up against the great kingdoms of the west.  This should sound very familiar to the events of the Second World War because the parallel is too blatant to not be noticed by an observant reader.  By understanding the correlation between the west being united against the east the reader can establish how it is really allegorical to Democracy being against dictatorships and other forms of Red government; Jane Chance wrote that that destroying the ring meant the “refusal of power as domination by the One”. (61) This statement reads as a standing position against being ruled by a single individual, which is really an attack against communism and the ideals that surround it.  Furthermore she states that the ring makes individuals unable to make their own decisions (60-61), this interpretation of this series highlights that there is a serious threat to the western way of life which manifests itself within one singular element of society which is represented by the ring.  Furthermore it is already established within the novel that the One Ring is evil in nature and so by drawing the proletariat into the comparison by means of the individual having no choice, the proletariat works for the collective instead of the individual, it creates the sub-consciences link between evil and these tenets of communism.  The symbol of the ring further shows how power will corrupt even the most pure hearted of individuals if they are tasked with it. This is seen in the final book of the trilogy, during this book Frodo falls to corruption and falls drops incapacitated and Sam forces the completion of the task by taking Frodo up to the entrance to the fiery volcano. (34-35) this final act is a lesson in what to do when humanity falls behind a corrupt individual, the onus of responsibility falls from the leader to their subordinates meaning it is on humanity to ensure that their leaders do what they are there to do.

               The fear of the communist society and fascist governments is also seen in one of the most popular adolescent teen fantasy novels of our time.  The Harry Potter series has legions of fans of all ages throughout the literate regions of the world, most people observe these novels as forms of escapism which exist only to entertain; yet these novels present a relation between a political war between Red governments and the more accepting democratic form of ruling.  In order to prove this first it must be established that there is a distinction among of the wizarding world’s inhabitants separating them into different groups. These distinctions are made through the ancestry and wealth of family.  Such distinctions are named as such pureblood, half-bloods and muggle borns; which is a very similar style of labeling groups that the National Socialist Party of Germany used to distinguish the different groups of people. (Reagan 128)  Further separation is made to distinguish between upper and lower class pure-bloods, such a comparison can be made between the Weasley family and the Malfoy family.  Both are pure-blood wizarding families but since the Weasleys are not as wealthy and have more children they are seen as lower in the socio-political hierarchy.  The Malfoys side with Voldemort for there is promise of power and continued succession of the pure blood families’ linage. (Laiacono 176).  These ideas that Harry Potter has allegorical sections comparing it to the Nazi party are even shared by the author herself, in an interview between Lizo Mzimba from BBC and J.K. Rowling, Rowling stated after Lizo pointed out Voldemorts impure blood line “Like Hitler!” (CITATION NEEDED) then continuing to state how she feels both Hitler and Voldemort acted similarly by projecting their own problems onto others and exploiting them by turning the public against them.

               Through these representations of corruption within political institutions fantasy authors serve a warning against forms of totalitarian governments and how easily they can be manipulated and corrupted by power; for the writings of both Tolkien and J.K. Rowling were written in an era when totalitarian forms of government were on the rise and were being perceived as a threat to western society.

               All these representations of society have lead to the creation of typical archetypes of characters which are now commonly seen throughout the majority of popular fantasy.  In order to counteract the force that draws humanity from its religious roots divine characters have become prominent and their influence is great, looking at characters like Aslan from the Chronicles of Narnia, Montolio in the Forgotten Realms series, through Frodo and Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings series and many more in other fantastical novels.  All these characters lead to one thing an increasing pressure upon the reader to turn back to the Christian faith by subliminally making religious links.  The second archetype of character that is found in all popular fantasy is the manifestation of and evil force that stems from a form of corruption which is a threat to the rest of the inhabitants of the fantastical world.  This manifestation of corruption is often seen in one character or one group of characters within fantasy novels.  This character is not always a living being but it is always something sentient and has a great effect on all inhabitants of the fantastical world, for instance The One Ring in Lord of the rings and the Crystal Shard in the Forgotten Realms series.  These types of characters both came into existence as a form to call the reader’s attention to real world threats to the western way of life and depicts how one must act in order to maintain the kind of society that they currently enjoy.",,False,self,t5_2r6f3,False,,,True,t3_1d9wse,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/comments/1d9wse/grammar_nazis_unite_and_correct_my_english_paper/,

They sold four calendars more than the number of t-shirts and three times as many hats as calendars. Total sales for the day were equal to $4,312. On Wednesday, the shelter closed early. No T-shirts were sold, but a local organization called to order 500 Calendars and half as many hats for a total of $10,500. What was the purchase price of each item?

3. A building supply has two locations in town. The office receives orders from two customers, each requiring 3/4-inch plywood. Customer A needs fifty sheets and Customer B needs seventy sheets.

Delivery costs per sheet are as follows: $0.50 from the eastern warehouse to Customer A, $0.60 from the eastern warehouse to Customer B, $0.40 from the western warehouse to Customer A, and $0.55 from the western warehouse to Customer B. Find the shipping arrangement which minimizes costs.

So far I have understood this much for number 1:

43  51   92  | 4312

0   250  500| 10500

Now, this is where I get lost. I thought maybe I should do two matrices, one with the t-shirts, hats, and calendars; and then one with the totals, and maybe multiply them? I'm really lost as to what I would have to do to find the totals. Maybe just solve the the matrix I made and get the totals?

Now for number 2:

I think I should do an inequality for A and then for B, and then relate the east on top of east and west on top of west, so it'd be something like

First of all, I'm kind of embarrassed by this, but I had to write a poem and it's how I felt. I basically use the mountain as a symbol for how I feel when I have to do a task.

Here is my poem:

[It looks funny on here so I took a screenshot as well](http://imgur.com/M7KVxvU)

I sat at the base of the mountain,
Staring up at the top.
It seemed like climbing it would be an impossible task,
It seemed surreal.

I sat for days,
Afraid of what I’d gotten myself in to.
The thought of the climb gnawing,
Eating at my insides.

Eventually there was nothing left inside to eat,
So I began my climb.

The progress was slow and numbing,
Like counting the grains of sand at the bottom of a lake.
Constantly having to stop to re-evaluate,
And try to grasp at some sort of motivation to continue.

The climb was difficult,
After each step quitting seemed more and more inviting.
I was almost certain that in the end the work would not have been in vain,
And I would feel accomplished.

It was when I was near the top that it seemed to become easier, 
Each step taking me closer and closer to the end.

Once I took that final step onto the top of the mountain,
I looked around and was confused.
I expected to feel closure but there was nothing.
I sat and felt nothing.
It seemed like it wasn’t worth it.

Even after completing the seemingly impossible,
I was still empty.
I should’ve felt full and proud,
Instead, I felt broken.



I'm not 100% about the rules of poetry, but I feel like this might break a few. I'm not sure how to use punctuation properly but I would really appreciate some help!

Also, I must specify whether it is a lyric or a narrative poem. I believe that it is a lyric because it recalls my feelings.

Thank you!

The goal was to find the force FM in newtons. My prof solved this in class but he literally took up 3 or 4 chalk boards to show the work. My solution only took 3 or 4 lines and got an answer within ~0.1 N of his answer, which I attributed to rounding differences in his massive answer. I asked him about it after class and he said my way was wrong but had no time to show why.

Here was my solution:

M = F * d

24.39 N*m = MFy * 0.06 m

406.5 N = MFy


Using MFy, MFx, and MF as a right-angle triangle, solve for MF

sin(25) = MFy / MF

MF = 961.86 N

a) ethyl benzene
b) 4-bromotoluene
c) anisole (C6H5OCH3)
d) propiophenone (C6H5COCH2CH3)
e) nitrobenzene
f) benzene
g) aniline (C6H5NH2)

From what I understand, benzene is baseline, electron density withdrawing groups make the ring less reactive and electron density donating groups make the ring more reactive.

Based on this I've placed them in the following order starting with the most reactive:

1) aniline
2) anisole
3) ethyl benzene
4) benzene
5) propiophenone
6) nitrobenzene

My problem is that I don't know where in this list 4-bromotoluene should fit.

the molar mass of pyrite = 119.96 g/mol

...and then the wheels fall off. I thought it would be the molar mass of pyrite * 0.143 mol (since that's how much gold you're getting and they have a 1:1 molar ratio), which gives 17.16 g pyrite, but I don't think that's correct?

EDIT: Figured out how to do it.
Density is of the solution not the solute.
2.115 moles is given (molality is mole solute/kg solvent), so 2.115 moles (58.443 g/mole)=123.6 g NaCl and then figure out the volume...we can do that by changing up what the density equation is d=mass/volume...so volume=mass/density. So, we'll divide 123.6g solute +1000g solvent (remember 1kg solvent that was given as the molality=1000g)=1123.6g solution/ density of solution which is 1.180 g which is equal to 2.2 M, which is the answer.",,False,self,t5_2r6f3,1360612936.0,,,True,t3_18brhc,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/comments/18brhc/chemistry_exam_question_that_i_couldnt_figure/,

	Ivan IV Vasilyevich, more commonly known as Ivan the Terrible, was the first Tsar of Russia.  During his reign, which was one of the longest out of any Russian Tsar, he helped start the beginning of a Russian Empire and killed many people along the way.  Throughout his life, Ivan had a very tough childhood, a good period of his life, and a very bad period of his life.  
	Ivan the Terrible was born on August 25, 1530 in Kolomenskoye, Russia.  His father, Vasili III, died from blood poisoning when Ivan was only 3 years old.  Ivan was then pronounced the Grand Prince of Moscow, as stated in his fathers will.  Ivan had one younger brother, named Yuri, who was thought less of and was treated very poorly.  When Ivan was 8, his mother died of unknown causes, leaving him and his brother parentless.  At age 16, he declared himself Tsar of Russia, which basically means he is the one and only ruler of the entire country.  At this time he also selected his first wife, Anastasia Romanovna.  She died in 1560, and after her death he ended up marrying 8 different women.
	In the early years of Ivan the Terrible’s reign, he did some very good things for Russia and this was thought to be the good period of his life.  In 1533, Ivan established very close relations with England.  He and several other London merchants, including Sir Hugh Willoughby, opened up the White Sea for trading routes between Russia and England without any customs fees.  This lasted over 150 years, and it was one of his great accomplishments.  On June 16, 1552, Ivan led a 150,000 army towards Kazan.  The Russians used over 150 cannons and had many battering rams to break through the city.  On October 2, Kazan finally fell, and Ivan the Terrible freed nearly 100,000 Russian prisoners and slaves.  He then celebrated his victory by building several churches; the most famous of these is Basil’s Cathedral in Moscow.  After the defeat of the Kazan, he then destroyed the largest slave market on the Volga River.  Russia was then transformed into many cultures and many different faiths.  In an attempt to gain access to the major trade routes in the Baltic Sea, he launched a Livonian War of Seaward Expansion to the west.  After 24 years, they were unsuccessful, which resulted in them gaining multiple enemies.  
	When Ivan’s wife died in 1560, he was deeply affected by it.  Her death changed who he was as a person and it impacted his mental health and stability.  He then left the throne for a brief period of time before a boyar by the name of Aleksandrova Sloboda begged him to return.  He accepted, on one condition.  He demanded that he should be able to execute and destroy traitors and their estates without questions form the boyar council or the church.  Ivan then went on to execute or torture important members of the boyar clan on accusations of conspiracy.  He then made all the peasants pay a tax 10 times as much as they used to every single year.  This resulted in peasants running away and there was a big drop in production of goods in Russia.  In 1570, Ivan was suspicious that a wealthy city called Novgorod was plotting to kill him, so he burned down Novgorod and all of the cities surrounding them.  In 1581, his daughter in law was pregnant with her first child.  Ivan saw her and thought that she was wearing immodest clothing, so he beat her, which then caused her to have a miscarriage.  When Ivan’s oldest son found out about this, they started arguing.  This ended with Ivan striking his son in the head with his staff, causing him to die.
	Ivan the Terrible died from a stroke on March 28, 1584 while he was playing chess.  The throne was then left to his second and weaker son, Feodor, who died childless in 1598.  Overall, calling Ivan terrible isn’t really the whole story.  Although he did have a very violent life and killed many people towards the end of his reign, he also helped Russia out in very many ways, and I hope people don’t remember him for just being terrible.

This loss in energy content at the second and subsequent trophic levels is **primarily due to the second law of thermodynamics**: whenever energy is converted from one form to another, some energy is lost to the surroundings as heat.

&gt;**In addition** to the loss of energy as a result of the second law of thermodynamics, there is an additional loss involved in the capture and processing of food material by herbivores and carnivores. 

. . .

&gt;Ultimately, **all** the energy used by organisms is released to the surroundings as heat.

How does this happen? How does the percent of energy lost in the form of heat go from *part of* 90%, to 100%? How does the energy used in the capture and processing of food eventually become heat, since it's apparently *not* being converted to heat at the time?

&gt;As energy flows from one trophic level to the next, approximately 90% of it is lost. This means that the amount of energy at the producer level must be at least 10 times larger than the amount of energy at the herbivore level.

I have trouble visualizing this. Why does the producer level have to be *10* times larger? Is it because 10% of the energy goes on to the next level, and 10% x 10 is 100%? If so, *what* is that 100% of? 

&gt;Biomass is the amount of living material present; it is usually determined by collecting all the organisms at one trophic level and measuring their dry weight. . . . **Some organisms tend to accumulate biomass over long periods of time**, whereas others do not. Many trees live for hundreds of years; their primary consumers, insects, generally live only one year. Likewise, a whale is a long-lived animal, whereas its food organisms are relatively short-lived. . . . **In aquatic ecosystems, many of the small producers divide several times per day. The tiny animals that feed on them live much  longer and tend to *accumulate biomass over time.* The single-celled algae produce much more living material but are eaten as fast as they are produced and, so, do not accumulate a large biomass.**

What is the relevance of the organisms' lifespan in determining how much biomass that level adds up to? Even if they get eaten relatively quickly, couldn't scientists still theoretically measure their total living material at any one moment and see that it was a higher quantity than that of the organisms that eat them? And why do the authors keep bringing up the *long periods of time* over which some organisms gain biomass? It seems significant, but I can't quite tell *why* it is.

I'm still stuck, I have to show that energy is conserved in the system but there must be a mistake somewhere, if someone could tell me what I've done wrong, that'd really help.

http://www.imgur.com/Y7rRT.jpeg The above diagram shows a winding drum with a rope and mass attached. If the mass is released, it will accelerate downwards and cause the drum to rotate.


A) given the above dimensions, calculate the moment of inertia of the winding drum if the density is 7900kg/m3. Answer I got for inertia is 4.3255x10^-6 kgm2 


B) write an equation depicting d'alemberts principle for the system. Answer is mg=ma+I(alpha) 


C) use the equation to calculate angular acceleration (alpha).
if a=r*alpha
mg=m(r*alpha)+I(alpha)
therefore alpha=(mg)/(I+mr)
total mass of the pulley is 3.834kg, no mass of the cord is given so:
alpha=(3.834*9.81)/(4.3255x10^-6 +3.834*0.045)=212.668rad/s^2


D) Calculate the linear velocity of the mass after it has dropped 3m
a=r*alpha
a=212.668*0.045 = 9.57m/s^2
v^2 = u^2 +2as
v=root(0^2 +2*9.57*3) = 7.578m/s


E) show that energy is conserved during the motion of the mass dropping 3m

mgz= (mv^2 )/2 + (I(omega)^2 )/2
mgz=3.834*9.81*3 = 112.835J
(mv^2 )/2 = 110.085J
Omega = v/r = 7.578/0.045 = 168.4 rad/s
(I(omega)^2 )/2= 61.33J
61.33+110.085 is not equal to 112.835J so I have gone wrong somewhere but can't see where.

I would really appreciate any guidence.

I'm stumped trying to insert an Applet and sizing-resizing them. I'm new to using media, like inserting Java in a page. Below are (3) examples I'm stuck on. These are quite long but I just want to include what it's instructed in the book to avoid confusion... Our professor missed the day where he was suppose to explain this and now it's finals week.

1.) http://i.imgur.com/oWplz.png - About inserting .class and putting it in a certain spot on a page

From the picture above. I'm suppose to insert the a .class Java applet as both an ActiveX object and a plug-in. Have it set the width of the applet to 700 pixels wide × 30 pixels high but I don't know how to make it a simple square and stick it to the left of a paragraph!

Continuing instructions says: Set the labelpos parameter of the applet to right. (This is from the Text book) Then Insert parameters src0 through src3, text0 through text3, and href0 through href3 to store the source of the button image, the button text, and the button hypertext link for the four linked buttons. Use the values button0.gif through button3.gif for the button images and the hypertext links to the four Robert Frost sites for the values of the text and href parameters.

It continues on saying... If the user’s browser does not support Java, have it display the hypertext links to the four Robert Frost sites (I'm completely lost here). Directly above the first line of the poem, insert an embedded QuickTime Player to play the fireice.mp3 file. Have your code support the QuickTime Player both as an ActiveX object and as a plug-in. Set the height of player to 16 pixels and set the width to only display the
QuickTime play button. Add the src, autoplay, and controller parameters to set the source of the QuickTime audio file, to turn off autoplay, and to display the player’s sound controls. I'll have to use this just incase the user doesn't use QTime: &lt;p&gt;Click to &lt;a&gt;href=""fireice.mp3""&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; the sound clip&lt;/p&gt;

2.) http://i.imgur.com/bnPih.png - Inserting a video, pretty easy

This one looks pretty easy but I just want to make sure I get this right. Sorry, I have no other friends who would help/know HTML... From the Text: Within the div container, insert an embedded object for the trailridge.swf file. The file should be inserted as an _ActiveX_
control for Internet Explorer users and as a plug-in for users of non-IE browsers (The same w/ Java above?). Set the dimensions of the video clip to 320 pixels × 280 pixels (Got this down). Then set the value of the movie parameter to trailridge.swf, the quality parameter to high,
and the menu parameter to false. For users of older browsers, nest within your video object an embed element to play the trailridge.swf video clip. Set the attributes of the embed element similar to those that you used for the object element (Lost again..). If users do not have Adobe Flash Player installed, display the message “To play this clip you need Adobe Flash Player.”

3.) http://i.imgur.com/Hxz3a.png - Inserting a movie using div (inside a div)

Again, sorry for plainly copying and pasting. I don't have anyone to explain this to me and our class jumped into this subject, our professor hadn't explained us how to insert medias in a page because he missed the day for it but it's finals week already...

The instructions from the above link are: 1.)Scroll down to div element with the movie. Within this div element, insert the mandel.swf Flash file both as an ActiveX object and as a plug-in, set the width of the
player window to 320 pixels and the height to 260 pixels. 2.) The fractal movie might take several seconds to load into the Web page. Display a message indicating this fact for both &lt;object&gt; tags, insert the standby attribute to display the text message “Loading movie. Please wait.”
3.) Set the value of the movie parameter to mandel.swf (this is the file name), the value of the quality parameter to high, and the value of the menu parameter to false. 5.) For older browsers, nest an embed element within your &lt;object&gt; tags to insert the mandel.swf file. Include all necessary attributes for the embed element. 6.) Within the embed element, insert the text string “To play this clip, you need Adobe
Flash Player” to have a message for users who do not have Adobe Flash Player installed. 7.) Scroll down to the demo div element. Within this element, insert a Java applet for the Mandel.class file, both as an ActiveX object and as a plug-in. Set the width of the applet window to 280 pixels and the height to 240 pixels. 8.) Within the &lt;object&gt; tag, insert the Mandel.class file using the applet object. Set the width of the applet to 280 pixels and the height to 240 pixels. 9.) If the browser does not support Java, have it display the text “Your browser does not
support Java applets” in place of the Mandel.class applet.

The case is as follows: You are a police officer that is called to repond to a local high school for a student that brought a gun into class. Upon arrival, you are directed to the principals office where he is there with the student. The Principal (Mr. Peters) is quite agitated, even to the point of imtimidation towards yourself and the student (Ronald Stinson). The principal states ""We will not tolerate any student on this campus carrying weapons. I don't neeed to tell you that problems such as this have been increasing over the past few years. This young man will be used as an example to all of our students who may think about carrying weapons at my school""

After asking to see the weapon, the principal takes the rifle out of the closet, to which Stinson says that it is a ""1859 Springfield .58 caliber Civil War musket."" The principal goes off on a tangets saying that the student brought it in to intimidate students and faculty, saying that Stinson could have shot someone, along with comparing the rifle to an AK-47. Stinson was bring it into his American History class, they were discussing the Civil War and he wanted to show his great-great-grandfathers rifle from the war. The principal leaves for a phone call and his receptionist states that Stinson is a straight-A student, has never been in trouble and that she took the liberty of calling his parents to have them come down. 

When the principal comes back in his office, he asks if you are ready to arrest Stinson, you state that it is an antique firearm and probably isnt even capable of being fired, let alone loaded. The principal reples ""I don't care what you think Officer Vasquez. State law is clear on this matter. Anyone bringing a firearm onto school property is commiting a felony. this is a firearm and I expect you to uphold the law."" The case ends as the student's parents arrive.

The questions are as follows:

1) What are you going to tell Mr. Peters and the Stinsons in an effort to resolve the conflict now, even if it is temporary? 2) If an arrest were made, would it escalate into further problems or would it solve the immediate police problem? 3) If an arrest were made, what do you think the courts would do? What do you think the school board would do? 4) What kind of message would an arrest send to the other students enrolled in the high school?

I apologize for the length of this message, but if you do choose to reply (a PM would suffice), could you also please put your name and position within your agency (Officer, Deputy, Sergeant, etc) and the name of your agency. This is a project for a Middlesex Community College (Massachusetts) that I am enrolled in, I understand that any answers might not reflect the views of your departments and will not be portrayed as such.""

* Relationships between the corruption in the church

La historia
Las islas fueron descubiertas en 1496 por Cristóbal Colón.
Su nombre se debe de los perros salvajes que vivieron allí en el tiempo romano del romano científico Plinio. El nombre de los canarios, los pájaros, se debe de las islas. De 1495, los españoles reinaron las islas. Vendedores y aventureros fueron a las islas en su camino al ""mundo nuevo"". Las islas ganaron mucho dinero y edificios magníficos como palacios e iglesias fueron construidas en ciudades como La Palma.
La producción agrícola
La economía de las Islas Canarias está basada en el turismo y agricultura tropical. Los turistas son españoles, alemanes, británicos, suecos, rusos, franceses, suizos, holandeses y otras nacionalidades europeas.  Las islas producen tabaco, frutas y verduras. Científicos se preocupan que las islas están explotadas con producción demasiada. Hoy ninguno de los productores han pensado en el futuro de la naturaleza de las islas. Necesitan cambiarán eso en el futuro.
La cultura aborigen
Las aborígenes de las Islas Canarias llamaron los guanches. Lucharon varias guerras con extranjeros como los españoles, portugueses y la inquisición española.

&gt;b) What temperature (approximately) is at the 50th percentile for this distribution?""

Would the answer for a) be .1% and b) be 85 degress? 

Thanks in advance.


Edit: I'm also having trouble with another question:

&gt;From a sample of 100 voters, you find that the average household income of the sample is $75,000 (the sample mean), and has a standard deviation of 4,930. I claim that the average household income for voters is higher than that of non-voters, and we know from population data that the average household income for non-voters is $70,000. 
&gt;
&gt;So, construct a hypothesis test to test my claim at the 95% confidence level. Do you reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis? (This involves a directional hypothesis, which technically we haven’t covered yet, but we will next week.)

So, 
*n = 100

*Mv = 75,000

*sigma = 4,930

*Mnv = 70,000

*std error = sigma/sqr rt of n = 493

*H0= The average household income of voters equals that of non-voters
*Ha = The average household income of voters is greater than that of non-voters. 

The significance level is 0.05, so if the p-value is less than 0.05, then we reject H0. To find the p-value we find the z score and subtract it from 1. 

To find the z score we follow the formula (Mv - Mnv)^2 /(std. error) = (5000)^2 /493 = 10.14. When compared to the z table, the z score would be greater than .9998. 1 - .9998= .0002 which is &lt; 0.05 significance. So we reject H0. 

Did I do that right? 

Thanks again.  

I figure ""in for a penny"" etc. Here is my last problem to make sure I did it correctly: 

&gt; In the following data—a sample of 10 students—we have their scores on a liberal-conservative scale, with 0 being extremely conservative and 10 being extremely liberal.
&gt;Student L-C Score
&gt;Ann 1
&gt;Jim 6
&gt;Bob 3
&gt;John 8
&gt;Jill 10
&gt;Jack 0
&gt;Barb 8
&gt;Kelly 7
&gt;Joe 7
&gt;Melissa 8

&gt;a) What is the standard error of this sample?

&gt;b) Create a 95% confidence interval of the mean score on this liberal-
conservative scale for the population of students from which this sample was drawn.

&gt;c) On this scale 5 is a true moderate, anything above 5 is liberal and anything below 5 is conservative. We want to test the hypothesis that the student body is, on average, not moderate. Construct a hypothesis test for this claim. You have to give me the alternative hypothesis and your conclusion as to whether you would reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis as well as your reasoning for this conclusion (hint: remember that you want to check and see if the confidence interval includes the value hypothesized under the null hypothesis).

* For a) we find that the value of Mew is 5.8 by adding all the values and dividing by n = 10. 
* Then to find the variance we subtract 5.8 from each entry, then square the result, and then add all of the results to get 99.6 which is divided by n to get the variance of 9.96. Since the variance is sigma^2 , we sqr rt 9.96 to get the sigma of 3.156 which rounds to 3.2. 
* To get the SE, we divide sigma by sqr rt of n, which equals 1.01. 

* For b) we use the formular 5.8 plus/minus (1.96 * 1.01) which equals 3.82 and 7.78 which are the values within 2 std. deviations form Mew to show the 95% Confidence Intervals. 


* For c) H0 = the average student is moderate, or Mew = 5.
Ha = the average student is not moderate, or Mew =/= 5. 
* Since the 95% CI showed the range is from 3.82 through 7.78, and Mew is 5.8, we fail to reject H0.

Using a simple pulley and rope system, a crewman on an Arctic expedition is trying to lower a 6.56 kg crate to the bottom of a steep ravine of height 27.7 m. The 50.3 kg crewman is being careful to lower the crate at a constant speed of 1.50 m/s. Unfortunately, when the crate reaches a point of 15.4 meters above ground, the crewman slips and the crate immediately accelerates toward the ground, dragging the hapless crewman across the ice and toward the edge of the cliff.

If we assume the ice is perfectly slick (that is, there is no friction between the crewman and the ice once he slips and falls down) at what speed does the crate hit the ground? Assume also that the rope is long enough to allow the crate to hit the ground before the crewman slides over the side of the cliff?

Also, at what speed will the crewman his the bottom of the ravine?

-----
box = m1 = 6.56 kg
man = m2 = 45 kg
v = 1.5 m/s
entire distance = d1 = 22.9 m
distance before fall = d2 = 12.7 m
g = 9.8 m/s^2
tension of rope between man and box = T

So, for this first drew the free body diagram for both the crewman and the box.

ƩFx1 =  m1a = 0 (no movement in the x direction of the box)
ƩFy1 = m1g - T - Fn
ƩFx2 = m2a + T

For the readings, we usually have to answer a few relatively short questions, but this one (on Genesis) has me confused. Now to clarify, I'm not looking for an **answer**, so much as I am looking for a bit of clarification of the question.

It is as follows:


Three times in Genesis, a patriarch traveling with his wife among strangers passes her off as his sister:  Abram and Sarai in Egypt under Pharaoh (ch. 12); Abraham—as he is now called—and Sarah in Gerar under King Abimelech (ch. 20; find Gerar on Map 2 of the OSB); and Isaac and Rebekah (ch. 26—again in Gerar under Abimelech).

In no more than 400 words, discuss all three repeated episodes as variations on the biblical theme of the matriarch who enjoys supernatural protection.  **How is each variation made more naturalistic—i.e., more like modern novels where supernatural causality (God or Providence) is explained in terms of natural psychology?**  Be sure to quote words or phrases that support your argument.

The bolded part continues to highly confuse me, as I'm not exactly sure what it is asking. I guess more specifically, what exactly is meant by ""in terms of natural psychology""? Can anyone assist in rephrasing this question so I can wrap my head a bit better on what it is asking? Again, not looking for an answer, just clarification.

This makes the answer to the question - the most weight it can support is 600 N - seem a bit too simple. Did I make a calculation error somewhere? I’ve found other examples in textbooks that show similar calculations, with similar results.

For #3, I just have no idea of how to solve for anything when the third cable is added. It seems to me that it could be added at several points along the lengths of the other two cables? Am I supposed to figure out where it should be added to produce the least tension? I’ve tried to work it out by looking at the length of all the ropes (I know that each cable has a length of ~23.3 m, and that the entire thing is 40 m wide, with the third cable taking up 17 m, leaving 11.5 on either side for DE and BC, but I don’t know any of the vertical dimensions.

I think it would repel as the ring structure allows it to have the effects that a coil usually have (push a magnet into a solenoid). As there is a change in magnetic flux linkage, by Faraday's law there is a induced emf across the ring. Since the ring is a closed circuit, by lenz's law there is an induced current flowing in the ring. However, after the switch is turned on for awhile, the magnetic field would stabilize and stop increasing. Hence, the ring would fall back and when this happens, again there is a change in magnetic flux linkage causing the ring to get repelled again. This results in a jerking motion where the ring is moved back and forth. 

The part I'm concerned about is after the solenoid's magnetic field has stabilized. At that point of time, the ring would not experience any change so naturally it will fall back. But as it falls back it experiences a change so it will get repelled? So causing the jerking motion? Is this correct?

**Script**

The brothers, Scott and Cameron, are in dispute over a missing spear that Scott alleges he loaned to Cameron for use in an important ceremony. The ceremony was going to be witnessed by a girl that Cameron is interested in, so it was important for him to be as impressive as possible when performing the ceremony. Scott gave the spear to Cameron the day before the ceremony and Cameron hid the spear for safe keeping under a bag of yams in a hand-cart  parked in the middle of the village. Cameron reasoned that the spear would be safe in the hand-cart  because it would be hidden from sight and no potential thief would look for a spear in a hand-cart  under bags of yams because yam farmers do not hunt. When Cameron woke on the morning of the ceremony he went strait away to the hand-cart  to retrieve the spear but when he got there the hand-cart  was gone and with it the spear. Cameron followed the tracks of the hand-cart  and found that they led to the main road and disappeared amongst all the other tracks there. Cameron went to Scott and told him that someone had stolen the spear. Scott demanded that Cameron repay him for the loss of the spear but Cameron insists that it is not his fault because the thief of the spear would have stolen it regardless of who was last in possession of the spear. 
Blessing

**Argument**

“I, Scott, loaned my spear to my brother Cameron when he came to me and asked to borrow it for a ceremony he was performing in. Cameron has always been lazy and has never taken the time to craft his own spear, so I felt sorry for him and let him borrow mine. I would never loan my spear if it was to be used for a task where it could become lost or damaged, like hunting, but for the ceremony I did not expect anything to happen to it. I made Cameron promise to me that he would return my spear as soon as the ceremony was over and he would also bring me some meat in appreciation of the favor. The next morning Cameron came to me and told me that he had lost my spear. When I told him to find my spear and return it he refused and said it's not his fault. He has also not given me any meat!  Cameron owes me a new spear and lots of meat for the trouble he has put me through!”

**Response**

“I, Cameron, borrowed the spear from Scott not because I am lazy but because he has always insisted on doing the hunting while I do the farming so there is no reason for me to have a spear. Scott knows that if he ever needed to borrow my plow for a ceremony then he is welcome to use it at anytime. He also knows where it is and that he does not need to ask me to use it. The spear belonged to our household, not just to him and I had as much right to use it in the ceremony as he does to use my plow. I hid the spear in a very clever hiding spot under a giant sack of yams in a hand-cart , but when I went to retrieve the spear I found that someone had stolen it and the hand-cart . I searched for the thief but she is nowhere to be found and my families spear is likely gone for good. When I told my brother about our families unfortunate loss he became unreasonable and blamed me for the thief’s actions. I have tried to explain to him that the thief would have stolen the spear no matter who had it last and that he and I are both victims, but he refuses to stop casting blame on me.” ",,False,self,t5_2r6f3,False,,,True,t3_xqx1j,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/comments/xqx1j/grammar_and_punctuation_check_please/,

1.A perfectly competitive market is in long-run equilibrium. At present there are 100 identical firms each 
producing 5,000 units of output. The prevailing market price is $20. Assume that each firm faces increasing 
marginal cost. Now suppose there is a sudden increase in demand for the industry's product which causes the price 
of the good to rise to $24. Which of the following describes the effect of this increase in demand on a typical firm 
in the industry?

A.In the short run, the typical firm increases its output and makes an above normal profit. 

B.In the short run, the typical firm's output remains the same but because of the higher price, its profit increases. 

C.In the short run, the typical firm increases its output but its total cost also rises, resulting in no change in profit. 

D.In the short run, the typical firm increases its output but its total cost also rises. Hence, the effect on the firm's profit cannot be determined without more information.

^^ I put D

2. In the short run, if marginal product is at its maximum, then..

	 A. average cost is at its minimum.  

	 B. average variable cost is at its minimum.           

	 C. marginal cost is at its minimum. 

	 D.  total cost is at its maximum.

^^^ i really don't get this..:/ I think it's C..

3. In the short run, the marginal product of labor might increase initially as more workers are hired because ...

	 A. the first workers hired get to use the best equipment.  

	 B. specialization allows a worker to focus on one task, thereby increasing her proficiency at that task.  

	 C. the best workers are hired first and later hires are not as skillful. 

	 D. beyond some point, a firm has hired too many workers. 

^^ B?? I think it makes sense that it would be B right...?   

4. If the marginal cost curve is below the average variable cost curve, then ...

	 A. average variable cost is increasing.      

	 B. average variable cost is decreasing.   

	 C. marginal cost must be decreasing. 

	 D. average variable cost could either be increasing or decreasing.

While trying to lead his own life, Winston walks into his own mental and emotional death. The book goes through imperialism, tyranny, and the need for control. With the party constantly watching and scrutinizing, Winston tries to out think them. He begins writing down his thoughts, having relations with a woman, and tries to contact the Brotherhood, in effort to live on his own terms. 
	Keeping a diary seems like such a simple act, but for Winston Smith, it ultimately meant life or death. “Even with nothing written in it, it was a compromising possession.” (Part 1, Chapter 1, pg. 8)Winston was well aware that he may be caught by the Thought Police, and thrown in jail, or killed, but this did not stop him. Something about having his own opinion appealed to him, in a way he had never felt before. This was the first act of Winston's rebellion. In a way, he knew what would happen to him, it was inevitable, but in his mind it was worth it. “..but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp.” (Part 1, Chapter 1, pg.8) A deliberate act of ignorance, that he knew would eventually lead to his death. The human mind cannot think alone, and Winston was tired of being alone. He felt helpless against the party, and if writing a diary meant his death, then so be it. 
	Human relationship is needed for survival, without it, society would become empty. Winston lacked any real companionship, and forgot what it was like to have a woman by his side. ""Sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgusting minor operation, like having an enema."" (Part 1, Chapter 6, pg. 69) The party viewed love and sex as an unnecessary action. Winston, a man of instinct, disagreed. It is believed that Winston did this only to rebel against the party, to show he could make his own decisions. With hate and control all around him, Winston wanted something he could run to, and that he could feel safe with;even if only for a minute. ""They could not alter your feelings; for that matter you could not alter them yourself, even if you wanted to. They could lay bare in the utmost detail everything you had done or said or thought; but the inner heart, whose workings were mysterious even to yourself, remained impregnable.” (Part 2, Chapter 7, pg. 174) Winston's actions are almost admirable. He risked is life, to find love, knowing what the outcome would be. The party rule was absurd to him, he saw no reason for it's strictness. With a life of scattered memories, and a fear of death everyday, Winston did not care anymore. His fate would come in time, but he was going to try to make an impact first.
	Within the book Nineteen Eighty Four, Big Brother is mentioned several times as a saviour of sorts, but never known to be true. Winston, however finds a way to discover the underground society, again risking everything he has.

Specifically, I want to find an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), or I want to proof formally that none such strategy exists.

The repeated minority game is a simultaneous game with three players, where each player chooses an action out of {L,R}. If a player is the minority player in a round, she receives a utility of one for that round. Thus for outcomes LRR or RLL, where outcomes are denoted as a=(a_1 a_2 a_3), player 1 receives one util. All other payoffs are zero. Future rounds are discounted with a discount factor, and mixed strategies are allowed for.

Does anyone have an intuition as to what might be an ESS? Does anyone have an intuition of why there should not exist an ESS? I've been working on this problem for a few months now, with several enlightening moments but no definitive answer. Any suggestions or thoughts are highly appreciated.

If it is true that there are definitive imperfections, guilt’s, and mistakes within all people,  then the claim that people need to clean these blemishes and forget the past should also hold true. People all around the world, at least once in there life have claimed a form of redemption. The feeling, the thought, and most importantly the need of redemption are an integral part of human culture. It is a way to define how people need a way to correct past actions, rescue our mistakes, and to learn from them, whether it be for the better or for the worst.   Religion has outlined the use of redemption greatly. From the New Testament, the crucified Christ was raised so that he could lead us into salvation and deliver us from sin. History has shown that many of the great civilizations have strived to liberate themselves from the errors of their own past. The utilization and context word redemption has been stretched in many different ways. Some people use this term to justify there actions; some people use this to protect their dignity; some use it amend their actions that have affected them or others involved. At the end of all the contemplation, ethical observation, and definitive consequences humans strive to correct their imperfections. People want to redeem their selves in way where they no longer feel guilty of their past actions. In Khaled Hossenis novel, The Kite Runner, Hosseni manages to elegantly illustrate the theme of redemption through life, growth, and maturity of Amir the main protagonist. Amir experiences the three observed stages of redemption; the awareness of his initial actions, the regret of his actions, and the initiative to correct his actions. These three stages of redemption are evident in Amir full awareness of Hassan’s distress, the ensuing events that follow Hassan’s rape, and in his old age, his initiative to finally redeem Hassan.",,False,self,t5_2r6f3,False,,,True,t3_uenvt,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/comments/uenvt/suggestions_and_improvements_are_welcomed_please/,

Astrid’s Viewpoint on Ron Is Twisted Because of Claire


In White Oleander by Janet Fitch, characters are depicted from Astrid’s viewpoint only. Astrid’s biased stances create a misleading representation of some of the characters. Her values and experiences, as well as how she wanted to be treated (in comparison to how she was treated) caused her to love characters more than others. For example, Astrid’s narrow-minded personality caused her to worship Claire and repress any true emotions she had if it conflicts with Claire’s viewpoints. 


Astrid loved Claire because Claire treated her better than Astrid’s previous foster mothers. Because Astrid was accustomed to arrogant mothers that forced her into a tough lifestyle (Ingrid), to racist women (Marvel) and women that starved her (Amelia), to come across a foster mother that legitimately loved her and treated her well was a huge surprise. Astrid clung to Claire and agreed with her every action. Astrid never entertained the thought that Claire was emotionally weak (even after Ingrid warned her about it) or paranoid until Claire killed herself. Astrid immediately went berserk after that happens, and blamed it on Ron and her, rather than realize it was Claire’s fault only. 


Astrid blindly followed Claire’s thoughts and opinions without ever questioning Claire. For example, when Claire had her last argument with Ron, Astrid sided with Claire, seeing if she wanted support, and did not defend Ron. Astrid’s evident support for Claire in that situation was gratuitous, and it ended in her ultimately disliking Ron simply because it seemed he was troubling Claire. After Claire committed suicide, Astrid irrationally destroyed everything in her room and acted like her life was over, as well. Astrid went into denial, questioning reality and disbelieving the possibility that Claire could ever be gone. It is clear that Astrid thinks Claire is the only reason she should be happy and everything that Claire does is rational and right.


Astrid’s true emotions for Ron are hidden by her biased love for Claire. Astrid actually empathized with Ron, and feels bad for him after he blamed him for what happened to Claire. After Claire killed herself, Ron enters a stage of extreme depression and stress, and it is apparent that Astrid feels bad for him; however, before that, she says that Ron “didn’t know Claire” (260). Astrid’s biased love for Claire and pity for Ron clash as Astrid sometimes will blame Ron for having too much power (as evident in the statement, “it’s a man’s world”), but then feel bad for him and hate Claire’s weakness and paranoia.


 It can be said that Astrid does not hate Ron. She empathizes with him; however, her blind love towards Claire clashes with her empathy to create wildly different responses for situations, where she will side with Claire in one occasion and feel for Ron in another. If Ron were home with Astrid and Claire more often, Astrid would have bonded with Ron and her feeling with Ron would have been parallel to her affection with Claire; however, since Astrid only felt the generosity and honesty of Claire, she loved Claire more than Ron. This unreasonable amount of love for Claire overshadowed her empathy for Ron, and so, Astrid’s viewpoint on Ron was twisted because of Claire.

&gt; (A) *L* / 2

&gt; (B) *L*

&gt; (D) *d*

So, basically, I set the left edge of the raft to be at x = 0, the right edge where the person is initially standing to be at x = *L* and the center of mass of the system to be x{center of mass} = 0.5*L* + *d*.

I made up 3 other quantities, *m* being the mass of the person and *M* being the mass of the raft and Δ*x* being the amount the raft moves.

So, I set the center of mass to be (*ML* + 2*mL*)/(2(*m*+*M*)) and solve for *d* in the previous center of mass as *d* = *mL*/(2(*m*+*M*)).

Then, at the end, the center of mass is at the same spot and can be solved for as (*ML* + 2*M*Δ*x*)/(2(*m*+*M*)).

4130 KJ of bond energy for the products.

So if the enthalpy of the products is higher than the reagents, that must mean it is an endothermic reaction (it needs energy to function).

i want to cite the arab spring and say technology promotes democracy, then will argue democratic countries don't attack each other. 

clearly technology is a good thing in developing countries. it helps spread aids awareness, reduces the stigma attached to aids, and promotes anti-retro virals in the area. technology is constantly trying to cure diseases and already has, reducing the risk of a massive outbreak, and protecting the human race.

technology can deflect the negative negative outcomes of global warming, saving millions from being displaced from their homes, saving countless lives from raging natural disasters, and the current ecosystem as we know it.

counter arguments:

globalism will destroy culture: culture will evolve just as it always has?

globalism causes conflict: nope, because technology promotes democracy. what a bout china? they suppress flow of information.

For the last essay I have to do in my writing class, we were assigned to address an issue in a community. The first community I thought of was this one! The issue I decided I should address is the one of disrespect towards new posters here on reddit. I feel this is an issue because it has the ability to deter a new poster from wanting to post here again. I want this community to grow even bigger than it already is, and hating on new posters can prevent that. In the memo to my instructor, I classified this as being a type of cyber-bullying, and that I would do more research on that subject.
While one could indeed argue that the disrespectful posts I am speaking of could also be seen as a sort of ""hazing"" of new posters, it is still an issue that I believe needs fixing.
My suggestion for criteria to fixing this issue would be to add a ""no inflammatory comments"" rule to sub-reddits, and maybe to have a moderator specifically for enforcing this rule.

1317167887.0,5,self.HomeworkHelp,ktig2,Basic Philosophy Help. ,5,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/comments/ktig2/basic_philosophy_help/,"I have 8 questions that I've been working on figuring out. I'm an engineering major and this class isn't the greatest, but I need the credits for it.

What I'm looking for is help just understanding the basics of what each question is asking.

1. Asserted on p. 7 is that, ""to give an analysis of a statement is to make as explicit and as clear as possible the necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of the statement being analyzed."" With an appeal to pp. 5-6 distinguish necessary and sufficient conditions. Explain the Requirements for a Successful Analysis and show the significance of the distinction between necessary and sufficient conditions for analysis.

2. Roger Bacon understood science as description of experience. Since no two things are exactly alike, he did not believe scientific laws are possible. In this he echoed Thomas Hobbes who argued, 
	because the constitution of a man's body is in continual mutation, it is impossible that all the 	same things should always cause in him the same appetites, and aversions: much less can all 	men consent, in the desire of almost any one and the same object.
How do concepts allow avoiding this conclusion, and what significance does doing this have for human functioning? Explain your answer.

3. In class it was asserted identity by commonality is a necessary condition of deductive reasoning, and identity by similarity is a necessary condition of inductive reasoning. Make clear the nature of these two forms of identity and show how each presupposes the other. Also asserted in class was that science presupposes the mutually supportive character of induction and deduction. Science is assumed a method by which laws are induced from which methods are deduced from which laws are induced, etc. Circular in nature, Robert Audi concludes,
	If we consider science in historical perspective and do not realize it, it turns out that there is no unqualified answer to the question of whether what is called scientific knowledge is knowledge as I have been conceiving it in this book. If we assume that there are some scientific propositions which are strictly true . . . then we apparently have no good ground for thinking that they cannot be known (or at least believed with ample justification).
Explain why Audi concludes, ""there is no unqualified answer to the question of whether what is called scientific knowledge is knowledge.""

4. Expressed in class was that concepts exist to simplify reality. Explain why this is necessary and how concepts achieve this objective. What is often sarcastically referred to as ""political correctness"" can be understood as a product of inclusive disjunction. Make clear why political correctness can be understood in this way, and then show how this development runs counter to the conceptual purpose of simplifying the experience.
5. Appealing to lecture, explain what a concept is, making clear how concepts and objects are different ways of understanding the same thing. Provide an account of analysis given the nature of a concept, looking at pp. 7-8. Incorporate in this discussion why there can be no analysis of an object, only a concept. Consider in this respect Earle's p. 89 categorization. ""Metaphysic Designates activities under two main headings. 
	a. the analysis of basic categories,
	b. the inventory of basic kinds of things.
and his somewhat hasty p. 90 judgment ""there is really not very much to say about being qua being.

6. According to Earle on p. 28, ""it is generally assumed that propositional knowledge, unlike know-how, can be fully verbalized."" Why cannot know-how be fully verbalized employing the concept of analysis in terms of criteria? What does this tell us about the nature of propositional knowledge? Identify what additional property of propositions distinguish them from declarative sentences. Finally, what is meant by the assertion on p. 24 that, ""statements and propositions are not the same thing?""

7. On pp. 26-27 Earle asserts that ""we should distinguish belief as a propositional attitude - that is, ""believing that"" - from belief as confidence - that is, ""believing in."" Rather than certainty there are psychological attitudes. Distinguish them and explain their psychological character by appealing to the discussion of Cartesian Doubt on pp 11-12. Show how these attitudes are manifested in the philosophies of Soren Kierkegaard and Jean Paul Sarte. 

8. Claimed on p. 19 is that ""Philosophy is the only academic subject that focuses on conceptual clarity."" Accepting this, what is the significance for science of Earl's claim on p. 16?
	Metaphysics, also known as ontology, is defined in terms of the key question: What is there? 	This is a deceptively simple question, since it involves the most basic and pervasive contrast in 		human thinking.: the contrast between appearance and reality.
In answering this question, consider Rene Descartes' three ""doubt-generating arguments"" listed on p. 12. Do these arguments presume appearance and reality or not, and what do they tell us about this distinction behing "" The most basic and pervasive contrast in human thinking?""
	Now what relevance does ""the contrast between appearance and reality"" have for philosophy, explaining your answer? Considering Descartes' skeptical arguments, the twentieth century Austrian philosopher Edmund Husserl implemented the method of epoche, ""putting aside"" the question of the existence of ""reality,"" leaving us with ""appearance."" It is this move which leads to phenomenology. What significance, if any, does Husserl's approach have for philosophy as ""the only academic subject that focuses on conceptual clarity?""


My answer to #1 is example: 
1.

	A necessary condition is a common property of members of a set
	A sufficient condition is a similar property of members of a set.
	There are three conditions to have a successful analysis. Each analysis will have analsandums, which is what to be analyzed, and analysans, which is what is doing the analysis. 
	1. The analysandum and it's analysan must mean the same thing.
	2. The analysandum and analysans must be alike in truth-vale.
	3. The analysans must be more clear than the anysandum. 

	1. X is a senior
	2. X needs to fulfill general education requirements.
	3. X has completed all classes required to complete a mechanical engineering degree
	4. X has a GPA of 2.0 or greater.

	These conditions come as a package to determine if a student is able to graduate. To graduate, the student, X, has to meet all the necessary conditions. Condition 1, 2, and 4 are necessary conditions to graduate. Condition 3 is a sufficient condition. If a student is able to graduate, you know he is a senior, has fulfilled general education requirements, and also has a GPA of 2.0 or greater because of the necessary conditions. You wouldn't know if he has completed a mechanical engineering degree, because it is a sufficient condition. If you did know a student will graduate with a mechanical engineering degree, you will know he is a senior, has fulfilled general education requirements, and has a GPA of 2.0 or greater because the student has fulfilled the sufficient condition, along with fulfilled the necessary conditions. To make an analysis explicit and clear is not possible as everything has infinite properties.

I start by trying to find the charge of each plate. I do this by using V = E*d where V is the voltage from the battery and d is the entire 25 mm distance. I get E = 960 V/m

I then use E = (k*q)/r twice where r1 (the distance from the positive plate) is 22.5 mm and r2 (the distance from the negative plate) is 2.5 mm to find each of the plates individual charges. I get q1 (charge of positive plate) = 5.4*10^-11 C and q2 (charge of the negative plate) = 6.67*10^-13 C.

Finally, I use Voltage (total) = [(k*q1)/r1] + [(k*q2)/r2] to get V = 24 V. This answer is wrong, and I have no idea where I've messed up. I'm fairly sure that I've made all of the correct unit conversions, so I'm thinking I'm using the wrong equations, but I don't know.

Anyways, here are the questions - any help would be appreciated:

1) Looking only at **local potential** what could have resulted in the changes [dotted] from the normal [line]?

http://imgur.com/BN0VX

I chose:
    -Increase Na+ outside cell
    -Dec. Na+ in cell
    -increase activated nicotinic receptors

Aside from that, one other option which seems plausible to me is decreasing the voltage gated K+ channels. What I'm questioning is whether this is an option, because I recall my prof. saying that only chemical, thermal, and mechanical channels are involved in local potential[maybe i heard wrong].

2) In a resting cell what might increase the rate of transport through the Na/K pump?

I chose:
    -increase conc. of Na+ inside
    -increase conc K+ outside 
    -increase ATP inside
    -genetic mutation which allows pump to move Na and K from one side to the other faster

Other options which I see as possiblities are:

    -increase # of action potentials in cell
    -increase # of pumps in membrane - I think I questioned this because rate of transport to me meant how fast the stuff was getting through the pump, maybe the question is asking overall?

3.  This is the bit where I got really confused,  so i saw that it says to calculate the mass of the hydrogen sulfide, 
    so i checked the ratio between Al^2S^3 : 3H^2S,  which the sulfur has a 3 : 3 or 1 : 1 Ratio,  which should mean that the 3H^2S has 0.06mol,  right?
4.  I used n = m / M to convert 0.06mol into 3H^2 S's grams,  so
     m = n * M

This growth is taking place in an LB + ampicillin plate. Only the cells that have taken up the plasmid will be able to resist ampicillin. 


This is where confusion starts:
Therefore, any cells without the vector or insert should no produce any colonies?

Can the absence of ligase still result in a loose binding of the vector and insert to produce about 100 colonies opposed to a lawn? Or will the absence of ligase result in the production of no colonies?

And without the insert, there should be no colonies produced because the insert contains the DNA that is to be replicated?
