Ask me anything!",239,24,351,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/19c7eo/i_am_tyll_hertsens_editor_at_innerfidelitycom/,"Hi Redditors! 

Thirty years ago I use to travel a lot fixing scanning electron microscopes. I had a Walkman and thought it sounded like crap.  So I bought some Beyerdynamic DT801 headphones. They were much better than the stock earbuds, but still didn’t sound as good as I hoped. So I bought a Discman. Better again, but still not good enough. I thought about what might be missing for a long time. Then one day, in a brilliant flash of neurons, I realized that the wimpy headphone amp circuits in the Discman might not be fully capable of authoritative control of the headphones. What I needed was a miniature power amplifier for my cans. I set to work building one, and when done I was very happy to hear my cans blossom into full throat.

And so it began. 

Some ten years later I had the opportunity to start a company and remembered that little headphone amp. If I felt the need for it, others also would. [HeadRoom](http://www.headphone.com) was born. HeadRoom was responsible for the first commercially available portable headphone amp in 1992. In later years, we built the first USB powered headphone amp; the first headphone amp with crossfeed; and the first balanced headphone amp. 

I spent a lot of time encouraging enthusiastic headphone listening on-line first on Chu Moy’s HeadWize headphone forum, and subsequently on [Head-Fi.org](http://www.head-fi.org). I was one of the people responsible for the first Head-Fi national meet. I’m often called the grandfather of the hobby, which might be taking it a little far, but I have been there all the way along, and I truly love the activity.

I few years ago I left HeadRoom to take the position as Editor in Chief at [InnerFidelity](http://www.innerfidelity.com), a sister publication to [Stereophile](http://www.stereophile.com) in Source Interlink Media’s Home Technology group, which in addition to Stereophile includes: [AudioStream](http://www.audiostream.com) (computer audio);  [AnalogPlanet](http://www.analogplanet.com) (vinyl reproduction); [HomeTheater](http://www.hometheater.com) (home theater obviously); and [ShutterBug](http://www.shutterbug.com) (digital photography).

InnerFidelity reviews products and reports on all manner of personal audio gear including: headphones; headphone amplifiers; desktop computer speakers; table-top radios; smartphones; and other related gear. I have a strong belief in the value of objective measurements (I measure a lot of headphones, and will be measuring amps shortly), but I also believe the human hearing system is exquisite and that subjective impressions cannot be fully explained by objective observation.

Many of you will want headphone recommendations, I’ll be happy to respond, but most of my recommendations will be found on [InnerFidelity’s Wall of Fame]( http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/innerfidelitys-wall-fame). I suggest looking there for more detailed info than I’ll be able to post here today.

I’m looking forward to our dialog…ask me anything!

**I've updated this guide as of 6/11/12. **

IEM section still in progress.


AMP #

* 0 - amp unnecessary (reaches 110 dB SPL with 0.6V)

* 1 -may improve with amp on portable sources, amp unnecessary from computer (reaches 110 dB SPL with 1.2V) [Fiio E6 is sufficient]

* 2 – improves with amp on all sources (reaches 110 dB with more than 1V)

* 3 - amp included

 
Format: AMP # - Full Name (version) [price range in USD]: notes

**Under $20**

IEM

* 0 -Monoprice 8320 ($7): For $7, these inner-ears have some serious fidelity for their price. They can punch with the other budget-fi inner ears in the sub-$50 bracket pretty darn well. Microponic cable when worn straight down and the cable gets tangled a lot. A little bright, but with decent bass. Blows other cheap IEMs like what you would expect from Skullcandy out of the water.

* 0 -Phillips SHE3580 ($10): V-shaped response curve that sacrifices the mids. With equalization, mids come out rather nicely. Surprisingly deep sub-bass.

* 0 – MEElectronics M6 ($15): Solid cabling from MEElec with little microponics, relatively comfortable, Solid extension at both ends and above average soundstaging for the price. All-around sound that is good for the price. 


Clip-On:

* 0 -Koss KSC75 ($15): Koss still has a budget beast with the KSC75. ""Fun"" sound signature. Slightly muddy bass, but full mids. Very forgiving and can be driven out of portable sources easily. Killer value. Comes with a lifetime warranty. 

**$20-$60:**

Semi-open or closed:

* 0 -Monoprice MHP-839 AKA 8323 ($21): Rebrand of the Kicker HP541, a $50 headphone. Destroys other $20 full-sized headphones like the Sennheiser HD202 or HD201 out of the water. Slightly muddy bass that extends low and powerfully, rich and forward mids, smoothly rolled off highs.

* 0 - Incipio Forte F38 ($30): These are a rebrand of the Fischer Audio FA-004s AKA the Brainwavz HM3s. In its price bracket, it truly punches far beyond. It has a v-shaped frequency response curve. Compared to the Panasonic HTF600 and the MHP-839, these have a bit more clarity. The clamp on these is a bit odd, because it comes in at a slight angle. The sound isolation on these is a bit low.

* 0 -Koss Portapro ($35): Basically, an improved KSC75 which is capable of getting a better seal due to its headband design. It's the KSC75 in headphone form that is slightly improved.

* 0 -Panasonic HTF600 ($30): Very warm and forgiving headphone with a heavy bass emphasis. Bass can be described as slow and muddy, but it has an overall very pleasant sound signature. Rumbles with sub-bass frequencies nicely.

* 1 -Superlux HD681 ($38): Very good detailing for its price bracket. Semi-open design, but it isolates about as much as a low isolation closed headphone, like the Creative Aurvana Live! or the Sony MDR-V6. Nice, tight impactful slightly emphasized bass. Slight V-curve due to midbass hump. Bright highs. 

* 1 -Superlux HD668B ($50): These are very similar to the Superlux HD681 in terms of sound signature. They have a removable cable and stock cables of 3' length for portable use and 10' use for home usage. Slightly deeper bass, but it's a little less tight. Highs are a little less bright, but still relatively bright.

* 1 -CAD Audio MH310 ($47): Closed back Superlux. Expect very similar sound to the other Superluxes, but closed-back. Their fidelity is slightly lower due to this design choice.

* 0 -JVC HARX700 ($40): This traditional $30-40 headphone choice is still a decent one, even though it is a bit more expensive now. Relatively neutral presentation, but laid back. Not the greatest isolation and the bass leans more to boomy than it does to tight. Behind the Superluxes in terms of detailing. 

* 0 -Sony XB500 ($50): The other budget basshead headphone. Responds very well to equalization. Bass is very, very powerful and extends deep. Once equalized, has tight bass. Leaks some noise and falls behind the other headphones in this bracket in terms of detailing.

* 0 -Creative Aurvana Live! ($60-90): Rebrand of the discontinued Denon AH-D1001, a headphone that was a budget champion at around $100 from years past. Now it has been brought back and improved upon in the form of the CAL!. If you can find this headphone for $70 or less, it is likely the highest quality choice. Warm sound with a bass emphasis, good bass extension, lively highs and good balance. Less isolation than most closed headphones, isolates about as much as the semi-open Superluxes. Very comfortable. Price fluctuates a lot.

**$60-$150**

Closed:

* 0 -Sony MDR-V6 ($75): Classic studio monitor. Has been in use since the 80s and still sees use today. Neutral sound presentation, relatively punchy bass, highs can sometimes be bright. Below average isolation for a closed back headphone. 

* 0 -Shure SRH-440 ($70): Studio monitor headphones that are quite detailed for the price, superior detailing to the MDR-V6. Neutral sound presentation, might be slightly weak on the bass. Has a removable cable. Heavy and not very portable.  

* 1 / 2 -Fostex T20RP/T50RP ($60/75): Cheapest modern planar magnetic headphone on the market. Can rival headphones several times its price after modding. Becomes very dependent on amping after modding. Stock sound signature is very mid-centric, but modded sound signature also has a very deep and powerful bass. The T20RP is the closed variant of the headphone and comes with slightly different damping compared to the T50RP. They share the same driver.  

* 1 -Koss Pro DJ100s ($50): Bass emphasized DJ headphones. Average comfort and isolation. Very forward mids and very clear vocals. Above average soundstage for a closed headphone. Coiled cable. Requires a very good seal for bass. Lifetime warranty. 

* 1 -KRK KNS 6400/8400 ($100/$150): Very clean and detailed for its price bracket. 6400 is very midcentric without much bass (can be fixed with EQ), whereas the 8400 fills that hole (does not require EQ). Quick, tight bass decay that does not resonate. Not for bassheads at all. Above average soundstaging for a closed headphone. Murderously detailed and will reveal flaws in source.

* 0 -Audio-Technica ATH-M50 ($120): Still a fan favorite at Head-Fi. Borderline bass heavy. Recessed mids. Slight V-shaped frequency response. Can handle any genre thrown at it, versatile all-arounder. Slightly muddy bass. Not worth it at the $150-160 price point it is often found at.

* 0 -Skullcandy Aviators ($120): The only truly good and cost effective Skullcandy ever made. Mid-bass hump with borderline “one-note” bass and not much bass extension. Solid upper-bass and treble. Surprisingly competitive in its price bracket. Has the Skullcandy style.

* 1 -Digitech Pro Monitors($70)/Brainwavz HM5 ($100): Rebrands of the popular Fischer Audio FA-003. Big comfortable headphones with a neutral presentation. High detail, high isolation. Detachable cables (1.3m and 3m). Great all-arounder that is very good for its price point. The Digitech version does not have one of the detachable cables and has a 3 month warranty compared to a 1 year warranty. The headphones are exactly the same, though.

* 1 -Shure SRH840 ($140): Studio monitors with a neutral presentation that leans a bit to the bright side. 




Open:

* 0 -Grado SR60i/SR80i ($80/$100): The classic Grado sound – very bright presentation with very forward mids. Punchy bass that drops off quickly. Narrow soundstage, but still maintains the open airy sound. Quite clear for its price point. Very love it or hate it sound. 
* 0 -Alessandro MS-1 ($99): Read the above for the Grados and make it slightly more neutral and less bright. For those who want a less bright alternative to the Grados. 
* 0 -Audio-Technica ATH-AD700 ($100): The typical “gamer’s headphone.” Very wide soundstage with clear and detailed mids and highs. Very underemphasized, but tight, bass.  

**$150-$250:**

Closed: 

* 1 – Ultrasone HFI-780 ($150): Good tight bass. Poor all-arounder, but excellent for bass-heavy genres. Odd high bright high treble energy. Sometimes criticized for an odd tonality, not suggested for jazz or classical which requires a natural presentation. 
* 1 -Sennheiser HD25-1 II ($200): The prototypical portable headphone. Good isolation, very portable and durable, great detail and clarity, aggressive treble with a punchy and quick bass.
* 0 -V-Moda M80/V80 ($200): Very stylish portable with a slight bass emphasis (mostly neutral presentation) that is built like a tank. Indestructible build quality. Comes with consumer features like an in-line microphone. Better lows than the HD25-1 ii. Good punch and dynamics.
* 0 -Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro ($200): Fun, full bass response. Has the typical Beyerdynamic brightness that can be sibilant. Comfortable velour pads. Bass can be muddy, recessed mids, exaggerated midbass. 
* 2 -AKG K701/2 &amp; Q701: (~$230-250): Neutral presentation with tight bass. Bass is most criticized part of headphone as it can lacking in presence. Difficult to drive headphones due to low sensitivity and low impedance. Articulate, analytic, and detailed sound.

Open:

* 0 -Grado 125i/225i ($150/$200): This is the Grado sound, but better. Every step up has better matched drivers, they have a better earpad for fidelity compared to lower models. 
* 1 -Sennheiser HD598 ($175-$230): Very comfortable velour pads. Relatively fun signature with a mid-bass hump. Wide soundstage. Good clarity in highs, tight and punchy bass. Very regal looking. All-arounder headphone.
* 2 -Sennheiser HD580 ($160-200): This is a discontinued headphone. It has a very similar driver to the HD600 and shares many of its characteristics. Probably the greatest bargain in this price range for the fidelity. Very detailed, very balanced, good sound staging, great mids. Bass is a little loose. Comfortable.

1357250955.0,148,self.headphones,15wunp,[GUIDE] DACs and Amps,166,18,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/15wunp/guide_dacs_and_amps/,"One of the biggest questions I have seen around here is whether or not an amp or DAC is needed and if so which ones to get. This will only cover the basics of headphone amps and DACs, and will only cover the budget purchases. 

**What is a DAC/amp?**

When you play any sounds out of your computer or phone or MP3 player, they are pure digital signals in the form of 0s and 1s. In order for headphones to listen to that signal, they need a device to convert it into an analog signal. This is a Digital-to-Analog Converter, or a DAC. 

A DAC by itself, however, won’t output the signal to be strong enough by itself. This is where the amplifier comes in. It amplifies the analog signal from the DAC to a level where it can be audible on the headphones. 

All sound cards, for example, typically combine the DAC, amp, and recording parts all into a single unit. DAC standalone units have the DAC, but require an amp if they want to be used with headphones. Amp standalone units will only take a signal from a DAC or output from another amp and amplify it.

**Should I get a standalone DAC?**

 All modern computers have DACs and amps built into them, whether in the form of your speaker outputs on the back or the headphone audio ports. The issue is that these are typically not points where most computer companies focus on, and they typically use cheap parts there.


Typically, a more expensive DAC will have a cleaner sound that will be closer to the actual reproduction of the music with less distortion when compared with the stock one in most laptops and computers. As great as that sounds, this is typically one of the smallest return for your $ unless your device has a poor DAC.


For example, my $300 laptop has an audible buzzing noise when I use its headphone ports. The buzzing is loud enough that it can cover up details in the music that my headphones would otherwise pick up. I can immediately hear a sound quality difference if I use an external DAC. 


**Should I get a standalone amp?**

Aftermarket amps are typically needed in one of three situations.

1.	I have a standalone DAC that needs an amp to function.
2.	My headphones are not loud enough.
3.	My sound card/stereo receiver/MP3 player outputs with a very high output impedance which is causing my headphones to be voiced differently than they were originally tuned.

If you fall under any of these three cases, you should consider buying an amp for your headphones. 

**How expensive of an amp do I need to pair with my headphones?**

There actually is a lot of lovely math behind this. [Long story short, this article explains it far better than I could do so here. ](http://www.apexhifi.com/specs.html) Typical mobile devices will have about 0.6V of output. Computers typically have about 1V of output, but this varies wildly. Budget portable amps have an output around 1.2 – 1.9V. 

Amps on the level of the $99 Schiit Magni [6.2V into 32 ohms] or $150 O2 [7.3V into 600 ohms] will power anything short of the extremely power hungry headphones (Hifiman HE-6 or AKG K1000) to reasonable volume for almost anybody.

**The Equipment**

Legend:

Amp Name

Price: $$$

Claimed or Measured Voltage @ Low Impedance: Voltage before hitting 1% distortion for low impedance headphones (typically current limited)

Claimed or Measured Voltage @ High Impedance: Voltage before hitting 1% distortion for high impedance headphones (typically limited by voltage cap)

Reviews: Links to useful reviews.

Overview:  Quick overview.

-------------------------------------------------

**Fiio E5 / E6** [Amp] [Portable]

Price: $15-25

Claimed or Measured Voltage @ Low Impedance: 1.27V into 15 ohms

Claimed or Measured Voltage @ High Impedance: ~1.3V into 10,000 ohms

Reviews: [Fiio E5](http://www.head-fi.org/products/fiio-e5-headphone-amplifier/reviews) |  [Fiio E6](http://www.head-fi.org/products/fiio-e6-headphone-amplifier/reviews)

Overview: This portable amp is one of the cheapest that seems to give quality results. The Fiio E5 has better build quality then the E6, but the E6 has better equalization options on the go. They have their issues when used as a desktop amp because there is a high pitch whine in the sound while they charge. For someone looking for a cheap portable amp, these are a good choice.

**Behringer UCA202/UCA222** [DAC]

Price: $25-30

Claimed or Measured Voltage @ Low Impedance: 0.18V into 15 ohms, external amp suggested.

Claimed or Measured Voltage @ High Impedance: 1.1V into 10,000 ohms.

Reviews: [nWavguy Review](http://nwavguy.blogspot.com/2011/02/behringer-uca202-review.html)

Overview:  As a straight DAC/Amp combination, the UCA202 has issues. It has a high z-out, which will mess with the sound of some headphones and make crossover BA IEMs not work correctly.  The output into another amp, though, is fine. This is one of the least expensive DACs that will be a solid improvement over most integrated audio DACs. 

**Fiio E10** [Desktop] [DAC &amp; Amp]

Price: $55

Claimed or Measured Voltage @ Low Impedance: 1.55V into 32 ohms

Claimed or Measured Voltage @ High Impedance: 1.65V into 10,000 ohms

Reviews: [Head-Fi Reviews](http://www.head-fi.org/products/fiio-e10/reviews) | [Headfonia Review](http://www.headfonia.com/the-latest-must-have-the-fiio-e10-usb-dacamp/3/) | [nWavguy Measurements](http://nwavguy.blogspot.com/2012/01/fiio-e10-dac.html)

Overview:  If you’re strapped for cash, this is one of the most inexpensive ways to get a solid DAC and amp. This was a decent buy at $100 not too long ago, so there is great value here. There are concerns about build quality in the Head-Fi reviews, but the measurements and Headfonia review coincide and suggest that from both a subjective and objective level this is a solid piece of audio equipment. 

**Fiio E7** [DAC &amp; Amp] [Portable]

Price: $60-65

Claimed or Measured Voltage @ Low Impedance: 1.3V into 32 ohms

Claimed or Measured Voltage @ High Impedance: 1.34V into 600 ohms

Reviews: [Head-Fi Reviews](http://www.head-fi.org/products/fiio-e7-usb-dac-and-portable-headphone-amplifier-black/reviews)

Overview:  The Fiio E7 is like a slightly lower output, better build quality Fiio E10. The DAC inside measures as good or better than most other budget DACs below $50. The amp inside is a small tick better than the $20 ones. All together, this makes a standalone value package that can’t be beaten for the money. 

**JDSLabs cMoyBB** [amp] [portable]

Overview: The cMoy has always been a very solid portable amp and JDSLabs makes quality products. Reviews suggest that sound quality better when using it with AC power. These are not suitable for high current, low impedance headphones like the higher end orthodynamics or the AKG K701/K702/Q701, but it works very well with higher impedance loads like the Beyerdynamic series or the Sennheiser HD600/650 series.  

**Schiit Magni** [Amp]

Price: $99

Claimed or Measured Voltage @ Low Impedance: 6.2V into 32 ohms

Claimed or Measured Voltage @ High Impedance: 8.83V into 600 ohm

Reviews: [Head-Fi Thread](http://www.head-fi.org/t/640783/schiit-magni-headphone-amplifier)

Overview:  In my opinion, this is the amp to get when it comes to bang for your buck. This amp will drive anything short of the most power hungry headphones ever made. Subjective reviews check out. The measurements check out. Blind-testing against the O2 suggests that they’re discernibly different using $700+ headphones, but still amps of similar quality. Others have reviewed that the Schiit Stack (Modi + Magni) is pretty much indiscernible from the nWavguy stack (ODAC + O2).

**Schiit Modi** [DAC]

Price: $99

Claimed or Measured Voltage @ Low Impedance: Requires external 
amp.

Claimed or Measured Voltage @ High Impedance: Requires external amp.

Reviews: [Short Review](http://www.head-fi.org/t/642401/comparison-and-review-o2-odac-vs-magni-modi) |  [Headfonics Review](http://headfonics.com/2013/01/the-modi-and-magni-insane-schitt-at-99/)

Overview:  The Modi has been almost universally praised as an excellent DAC. The combination of the Modi and Magni have likely dethroned the Objective2 stack as the premier value amp + DAC. It is capable of using 24-bit audio which means that you don’t have to worry about dynamic range when using the Windows volume control, whereas most other cheaper DACs fail to get this resolution. It uses a ¼” plug, which is suitable for higher end headphones which often require an adapter. That said, there are currently no independent measurements to really show the objective quality of the Modi.

**Objective Stack is below in the comments.**

",163,27,158,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/172cc2/i_am_jamey_warren_ceo_of_headroom_ask_me_anything/,"Hi fellow headphone listeners,

I'm the new CEO at HeadRoom (headphone.com) but I have worked with the company for over seven years. We're a relatively small team and we all wear a lot of hats. I was fortunate enough to be involved in a lot of cool projects over the years. From headphone measurements to product development and website design, it's been an awesome ride as a headphone geek and music lover.

Full disclosure - I'm doing this AMA with the desire to learn more about what is most important to you, our customers. I am not trying to market our company here but I am hoping to improve our business through your questions and input. 

I hope to answer every question with an honest answer. That said, there may be details about our business that I cannot share for various reasons but I will do my best to answer those questions without giving away our secret sauce. 

It is just me answering these questions so please be patient.

**UPDATE: I think the majority of your questions have been posted and answered. I'll be checking occasionally to see if there are any more I can answer.** 

You can always reach me via email, jamey@headphone.com or call and ask for me.

Thank you all so much for the great discussion and sharing your thoughts. This has been awesome!

Cheers,

I think we should stop providing same old answers to the same old questions we get 100 times a week.  I don't know about you, but I'm really sick of seeing ""what's an amp/dac and should I get one?"" or ""best headphones under $30"".  

Also, the sheer amount of people who favors M50 is just overwhelming. ""Recommending because I have it"" should be the biggest taboo in recommending headphones, as it is in Head-Fi.    

What's your thought on this?  I'm kinda sick of seeing people with actual knowledge of hi-fi headphones answer questions to a bunch of dumbasses who's only looking to buy a cheap alternative of Beats.

EDIT: [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/utnfy/athm50_question/) is exactly what I mean.  I mean, WTF?

EDIT2: it seems like M50 fanboys are crowding this thread also.  I'm not saying they are bad, their cost-performance value is very impressive.  But if you haven't tried other cans that is comparable, you shouldn't really recommend it so much.  How do you know if they are better than HFI780, DT770, HD598, and such?  You need to know that one quick listen is usually more helpful than a 1000 appreciation threads and reviews when you are dealing with sounds.

EDIT3: one more thing that led me to posting this thread... [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/uv42j/are_the_p5_bowers_and_wilkins_worth_my_time/).  not only the general /r/headphone users are lazy, immature, and ignorant, they are unappreciative and stuck up.  I don't know about you, but if someone writes me an informed response that is longer than my entire post, I feel inclined to show at least a little gratitude.  Treating people who's trying to genuinely help you like a Best Buy salesman is not acceptable to me.

I've always appreciated good sound quality (don't get me started on guitar amps and pickups). 

For the about 6 years, I used a pair of Sennheiser HD465 headphones. By no means bad headphones. But they were incredibly bass-heavy and murky. Great for listening to rap and electronic music, but not much else. Keep in mind I'm a poor grad student, so I held onto them as long as possible (still have them, no hard feelings against them). Besides those headphones, I have a set of beyond shitty Altec Lansing speakers. So that's how I've listened to music for a long time.

This past week, I sprung for a set of Sennheiser HD280 Pro headphones. Oh man. They're not the nicest headphones in the world - they retail for about $100, I got mine on sale for $80 - but holy shit. Just listening to music all over again. I put on some old SRV and Hendrix albums, and I can hear the hiss of their amps, the rattle in the kick and snare drums. I put on a Ryan Adams album and I could hear his breathing, the stool under him squeaking. I realized there were all of these little human elements in my favorite albums that I was missing out on. Thanks to such an amazing flat line frequency response, and such a clear, crisp sound.  These headphones have made me excited to listen to music again. Everything sounds so different now.

I hope I don't get downvoted too much, just wanted to share how much these headphones are really rocking my world right now.  ",,False,,t5_2rcyx,False,,,True,t3_q28kb,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/q28kb/well_i_just_had_a_headphones_epiphany/,

This post is for people looking to buy cheap, good sounding headphones. If you’re already read some of the guides on the sidebar, you might have a few ideas for a pair you’d like to buy. I’m here to give as much information as possible on what I consider the highest value headphones in this price bracket. This is a more in-depth post than the other headphones guides and will focus solely on headphones that are under $30. 

###**The  Headphones**


###Koss KSC75

**Cost:** $15

**Pros:** Phenomenal sound quality for the price, pretty solid on the comfort scale, nice fun sound signature, very moddable, good for working out. 

**Cons:** Low sound isolation (this also means sound leakage). Not a full sized headphone. Treble can be considered spiky for some. Sub-bass roll off. Clips fall off easily.

**Voltage to 110dB SPL:** 0.69V at 60 ohm impedance (calculated from provided Koss sensitivity and impedance #s)

**Links of Note:**

[Best Headphones Guide Review](http://www.bestheadphonesguide.com/2012/05/koss-ksc-75-review/)

[InnerFidelity’s Wall of Fame](http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/innerfidelitys-wall-fame-ear-pad-open)

**Explanation:**

Are you intending to spend less than $20 and you don’t have sound isolation as one of the biggest priorities? Buy a Koss KSC75. There is nothing that comes close to competing with it in this price bracket. Furthermore, the Koss KSC75 is capable of fighting even beyond its price bracket – it’s very possible to argue that it is better than all of the other headphones in this post in terms of sound quality.

They have a kind of Alessandro-line tuning to them that is a lot like Grado, but more subdued in the treble. You still have the treble peaks, the emphasis at 2khz, the shouty vocals, but you don’t have the treble set nearly as piercingly high. Even if you don’t like the overall tonality, just equalize the darn thing – you’re not going to get better sound for $15. 

**Measurements**

Here are the measurements done by purrin, one of the best headphone measuring guys around today.

[Here is the frequency response of the headphones.](http://i.imgur.com/oWnmJ.jpg)

[Here is the waterfall CSD of the headphones.]( http://i.imgur.com/KlhKs.jpg)

One thing to note is that the waterfall CSD of these headphones is exceedingly clean for the price. Do you want a fun comparison? [Here is the waterfall CSD for a pair of Grado RS1s.]( http://i.imgur.com/6tawl.jpg) The Grado RS1s cost $695 new. Look at the axes and compare the sound decay rates. Believe it or not, the Koss KSC75, on the whole, has measurements that imply that in many ways the driver is quicker and more accurate than the Grado RS1s. Just think about that – these are $15 headphones that are coming close to arguably beating $695 headphones by these numbers. Even if you don’t believe that the KSC75s belong with the better Grados (and most people don't), everyone certainly finds them to be one of the absolute best in their price bracket.

**Sonic Reviews**
That said, typically speaking, people don’t consider the Koss KSC75 to be a headphone that is competing against the high end Grados. There are certainly people that prefer the KSC75 to them, but you’ll find few real comparisons between the two. One example of someone that prefers them to the lower end Grados, at least, is the link in the Best Headphones Guide review. 

**Other Things of Note**

The Koss KSC75 is considered a headphone that is very moddable. These mods will influence the overall sound of the headphone. I’ve decided to run down a few of the basic mods that you see done to KSC75s. 

Common mods include the quarter mod, where you take a quarter and place it on the headphone pads, then exacto-knife around it. This brings out the highs and mids more. The Kramer mod involves drilling holes in the housing to increase the treble. There also is the resistor mod, which involves soldering in a 75 ohm resistor into the headphone to increase the amount of bass. [Looking at the impedance graph for the Koss Portapro, which uses the same driver, we can calculate that we can expect a few dB increase in the mid-bass region centered at 100hz when we add this resistor.]( http://www.innerfidelity.com/images/KossPortaPro.pdf) Basically, add the resistor for a bass boost. 

#You can often find a cheap headband for the KSC75s by buying a cheap Parts Expression headphone. The headband fits. [You can buy this for $2 + shipping.](http://www.parts-express.com/pe/pshowdetl.cfm?&amp;Partnumber=240-015&amp;scqty=3)

#.

###Monoprice 8323:
**Cost:** $21-23 + shipping

**Pros:** Solid mid-bass slam, removable cable, surprising build quality for the price, good sound isolation, warm headphone with a decent mid-range. 

**Cons:** Recessed treble, narrow soundstage, pretty high clamping force.

**Voltage to 110dB SPL:** 0.25V at 43 ohm impedance (using the measurements from InnerFidelity)

[InnerFidelity’s Monoprice 8323 Measurements] (http://www.innerfidelity.com/images/Monoprice8323.pdf)

**Explanation**
In the computer world, Monoprice is known for being a champion of value cables. In the headphone world, they’re known for putting out two of the best low cost headphones that are out today. For IEMs, they have the Monoprice 8320s. For headphones, they have our Monoprice 8323 (MHP-839). It’s a rebrand of the Kicker HP-541 headphones, which typically sold for $50. Back several years ago, they were considered pretty darn good headphones for $50. Imagine the community’s surprise when they surfaced selling for only $21. 

These do many things which other headphones in this price bracket DON’T do. For example, they have a removable cable while also being light-weight enough to use on the go. If you want to use them in the home, swap in the 3m cable. If you want to use them on the run, use the 1m cable. Furthermore, if one channel starts dying because of a small break in the cable, you can just buy a new one for a dollar or two, rather than replacing the entire headphone. For this reason, the Monoprice 8323 has been my standby recommendation for students looking for a beater headphone to toss into their backpack and take back and forth from classes. 

**Measurements**

[The only published measurements for the Monoprice 8323 is the InnerFidelity graphs.]( http://www.innerfidelity.com/images/Monoprice8323.pdf) 

You can see a roll-off into the sub-bass frequencies and a hump in the mid-bass. The %THD+noise implies that the headphones, for the most part, have good power handling. Furthermore, the distortion is quite low for a headphone of this price bracket. The low distortion numbers combined with the relatively square looking 300 Hz square wave back up impressions that these have a pretty tight bass response.  

The treble looks pretty receded, though. You can see the huge chunk that is taken out in the frequency response. This is why the headphones don’t seem to have that kind of sparkle that people like in audiophile headphones. At the same time, the peak at 10khz is bigger than you would normally expect from most headphones. This probably lends itself to the sibilance that people sometimes complain about with the 8323. 

**Sonic Reviews**

Starting with the highs and moving down, I described the sound of the treble in the Monoprice 8323 before as “grainy, but smooth.” I think what I always found weird about their treble is that it is simultaneously receded and sibilant – that’s a combination you don’t see too often in headphones. It’s like bringing the worst of both worlds together. Their highs weren’t necessarily bad, and I’m certain that you could tame the sibilance and bring out the lower treble with equalization, but their stock treble is definitely the weak point of the 8323. 

The mids were not bad. They have forward sounding mids, which is a trait that I like in headphones, but I do know that some people do not like it. For the most part, though, there isn’t anything truly exceptional in the mids, but they do a good job presenting them.  I agree more with MudPie’s review, rather than MalVeauX’s review, on Head-Fi because I found the mids pleasant, but I disagree that the MHP-839 is a “mids-monster” in their price bracket.  

The lows are where the Monoprices have a strong point in their price bracket. They’re bass heavy headphones that roll off the upper mids and treble for a very warm sound. The bass is tight and punchy with solid extension for a budget headphone. It’s certainly north of neutral in terms of overall tonality, but it is a great bass presentation from a budget headphone. 


**Other Notes**

Yes, the Monoprice 8323s are moddable. [Here’s a great guide from Armaegis.](http://www.head-fi.org/t/610542/mod-monoporice-8323) You could probably get away with just doing some simple damping mods with some felt that you find around the house and not going the whole 10 yards or spend much money at all. Furthermore, people like to put DT250 or Pearstone velour pads on the 8323s. Velour pads, which will set you back around $20, typically reduce the bass response on the headphones and are significantly more comfortable and less sweaty than the 8323s. If you really like your 8323s, these are a perfect upgrade for long-time listening.

(that i was happy about)

What makes it worse is that i looked online, and found that my mum had purchased it $90 more expensive than the RRP... ($200 on the Beats by Dre website) and my mum said while handing it to me that it was what others my age were using (im 16)

My first real FWP and i feel terrible :(((((

but besides that, any suggestions on a pair of IEM's between $50-$150 that have good build quality, sound good, and don't look absolutely ridiculous in the ears?

also first post ever on reddit (y) &lt; that is a thumbs up, not asking for thumbs up or upvotes or whatever

EDIT: So in the end i decided to postpone buying a new pair of IEM's and instead decided to keep the Beats (im not gonna die without a new pair of earphones, nor am i going to suffer wearing a pair of Beats), my other pair of IEM's arent in too terrible shape so they should last another couple of months or so. A lot of people have recommended purchasing the Hifiman RE400's so when i feel like it (maybe in a couple of months or so) i will most likely go ahead and purchase them, thanks for the comments and recommendations :)",,False,,t5_2rcyx,1360135367.0,,,True,t3_17xil3,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/17xil3/so_my_parents_bought_me_beats_by_dr_dre/,

Thanks!**

It seems that there is an ever growing number of headphone request posts that are very vague and leave us asking the same questions, ""Budget, genre, use?"" and so on. In a hopes to help people be more concise when looking for a new product as well as allowing us to help easier I'm writing this basic outline on what **needs** to be posted when asking for headphones recommendations. If the posts don't follow this format then I will be removing them, so please read and submit your questions in this manner so we can help.

First things first though, read [this](http://www.head-fi.org/a/headphone-buying-guide) headphone guide. I put a lot of work into it and it will help you a lot. Now if you're still not sure then here's what needs to be answered when you're posting a new thread seeking recommendations:

* **Budget** - We need to know how much you want to spend.
* **Source** - What are you plugging these into?
* **Requirements for Isolation** - Do you need a lot, some, or none? If you're not sure what isolation is, more isolation will block outside noises, none will not.
* **Preferred Type of Headphone** - Do you want IEMs, full-sized, or on-ear? 
* **Preferred Tonality** - Do you prefer highs, mids, or lows, or do you like them balanced? 
* **Past headphones** - What have you used in the past, what did you like about them and what didn't you like about 
* **Preferred Music** - What do you listen to?

This is the information now necessary to ask for a headphone recommendation, unless you're looking for a friend/family member, even then we still need as much of this information as you can provide. Any headphone posts that do not follow this format as of now will be deleted and need to be re-submitted. This is to not only help the community, but to help the user who is asking the question. 

Additionally, if your post gets removed, we will now use flair/tagging to indicate why a post was removed, typically, it's one of the following:

* Missing information (In other words, your post did not follow the requirements for a recommendations post
* Frequently answered (If you are the 3727th person to ask about M-50's, it's very likely that answers to your questions can be found through search)
* Off-topic/not headphone-related.

**Amp and DAC Explanation**

After you've decided on your headphone be sure to check out SanjiWatsuki's [DAC and Amplifier](http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/15wunp/guide_dacs_and_amps/) guide that explains amps and DACs in good depth.

This is another headphone based on the famous Koss 60-ohm driver that is found in the KSC75, Sportapro, and the Portapro. Much like the KSC75, the Portapro has been considered one of the better value headphones for quite some time, but I haven’t seen it suggested as much lately. Regardless, a headphone has to be doing something right to last for over 25 years and still be considered competitive.

**Measurements**

[First off, let’s compare against the KSC75.](http://i.imgur.com/HKvuL.png)
These measurements look legitimate and we can verify them against the InnerFidelity measurements. The basics of the story? Treble is receded almost pretty 3-5 dB or so from the KSC75, a headphone considered bright. This treble recession shows up in the reviews as the lack of sparkle in shimmer in the Portapro. Furthermore, the bass is bumped up, anywhere from 2dB to a whopping 5dB at 20hz. The housing can’t perform miracles, though, and the Portapros are still rolling off the sub-bass frequencies.
We do not have a waterfall CSD plot for the Portapro, but my speculation is that it would look similar to the KSC75. In the  InnerFidelity measurements, we can see that one driver still has a divot at 5khz – this implies that they still have the treble spike at 5khz. That said, in the HeadRoom measurements, the divot is significantly less than the KSC75 one. This MIGHT imply that the ringing is not as much at 5khz.
 
The InnerFidelity measurements also show high distortion into the bass frequencies – this is indicative of the somewhat muddy bass response. It’s difficult for cheap open driver headphones to not roll-off the bass and get increasing distortion into the bass frequencies.

**Sonic Reviews**

Unlike the Alessandro-Grado tonality of the KSC75, the Portapro has a much more bass heavy and treble light presentation. At stock, this can be appealing for people that avoid the treble heavy headphones. They’re nice and solid headphones for rock and pop due to the bass curve.  The mid-bass is emphasized enough to leak a bit into the mids, however, which gives it the slightly muddy sound. Overall, though, it’s also that mid-bass hump combined with the recessed treble that results in these headphones being a nice unfatiguing laidback headphone.   

**Other Notes**

Most of the mods that exist for the KSC75 are also done for the PortaPros. You still see Kramer mods (which might be nice to bring out more of the treble), quarter mods, pad replacements, recabling, etc, etc.

**Will these benefit from an amplifier?** It's possible. Buy the headphones first and see if they are driven to a nice volume before going out to buy an amplifier.

###Superlux HD681

**Cost:** $35

**Pros:** Old school, barebones AKG style.  Surprisingly neutral through most of the frequencies. Decent bass extension (rolls off after 40hz). Pretty comfortable. Good soundstage due to semi-open design.

**Cons:** Sound leakage b/c semi-open design. Very bright treble. Build feels a little cheapish.  Design stolen from AKG. Not portable.

**Voltage to 110dB SPL:** 1.10V at 34 ohm impedance (using the measurements from InnerFidelity)

[Hardcore HD681 modding @ Rock Grotto](http://www.rock-grotto.co.uk/HD681.pdf)

**Explanation**

Superlux is a Taiwanese company that is very good at stealing things from other headphone companies. They have a Sony MDR-V6 clone, they have a Audio-Technica wings on some of their headphones, they have the AKG style on these headphones . . .  That said, Superlux has always brought some of the highest caliber sound quality for the price. The HD681 is the cheapest well-known Superlux headphone and it sounds very similar to the slightly more expensive HD668B.  Just because it is the least expensive Superlux of the well-known bunch doesn’t stop it from being a fine headphone.

**Measurements**

The Inner Fidelity measurements show a headphone that is surprisingly neutral. The highs are bright, yes, but the mid-range and bass is just flat. Just about everything here is just solid for the price bracket. When it comes to the measurements, there’s really not much else to say about the Superlux HD681 besides “look at how flat the frequency response is.”

**Sonic Reviews**

There is a reason why the  Superlux HD681 has gotten 5 stars on every single Head-Fi review. They are, of all of the full-sized headphones, my personal pick for highest value. Superlux represents a big step up from the Incipios, the HTF600s, and the 8323s and really define their own bracket.

The bass is relatively tight and solid and you can definitely tell that it extends pretty deep. It was nice and quick, able to keep up with songs with faster bass, but were also capable of rumbling well. They don’t have the raw bass quantity of the Panasonic HTF600s, but the tightness and overall quality of the bass is nicer.

The mids are slightly forward and nice. The highs pick at the mids a bit, because the treble is definitely emphasized on these headphones, but they are nice and crisp.
The highs are very bright and were too bright for me. It’s certainly shiny, but also a bit sibilant and piercing. I agree with Tyll – if you can equalize out the treble, these are a brilliant sounding headphone that punch beyond its price.

**Other Notes**

As far as I know, the HD681 is not a commonly modded headphone, but I did attach a link in the links section to a pretty hardcore mod. The design of the HD681 is so close to the AKG K240 that the velour pads from the K240 will actually fit the HD681.

###Superlux HD668B/Samson SR850:

**Cost:** $50

**Pros:** More bass than the HD681. Removable cable.  Slightly more bassy than neutral. Nice soundstage.

**Cons:** Can warm up your ears and get hot. High clamping force. Low isolation. Emphasized treble. Feels cheap. Unfit for portable use.

**Voltage to 110dB SPL:** 1.81V at 65 ohm (from InnerFidelity numbers)

[Comparison to M50 &amp; HD668B](http://www.head-fi.org/t/554328/superlux-hd668b-review-vs-audio-technica-m50-and-superlux-hd681f)

[Headfonia Review](http://www.headfonia.com/superlux-hd668b/2/)

**Explanation**

This is probably the most well-known Superlux headphone. Since it was discovered, the HD668B has been a suggestion for this price bracket. It has a surprisingly warm tonality with its mid-bass hump. This gives it a bit more of a full sound compared to the less expensive Superlux HD681. It’s one of the only budget headphones to have a removable cable, which is certainly one of its nicest features.

**Measurements**

[Here is a link to the InnerFidelity measurements of the HD668B.] (http://www.innerfidelity.com/images/SuperluxHD668B.pdf)

Looking purely at the frequency response, you can see that these are more bassy than the HD681 but are very similar. They have the same linear type of mid-range with a small hump at 2khz while having really emphasized treble response.

On a technical level, these are slightly worse than the HD681 measurements. You may notice the increased amount of jitter in the frequency response and the large amount of ringing in the square wave. This implies to me that there is a sketchy, really wavy type of waterfall CSD that would be generated from these results.

Another thing to note is the SHARP jump at 5khz that doesn’t exist in the HD681. This implies to me that there is likely a large ringing in the driver at this point that would show up in a waterfall CSD. Luckily, 5khz ringing isn’t the worst, but that is a very sharp jump which reminds me of the [DT1350’s sharp jump at 7khz.](http://www.innerfidelity.com/images/BeyerdynamicDT1350.pdf) You can see how that translated into a waterfall CSD for the DT1350 [here (measurements from Purrin at Changstar).](http://i.imgur.com/9bHsQ.jpg)

Personally speaking, I think the HD681 is a safer buy in terms of sound quality, but the HD668B has gotten rave reviews despite warning signs.

**Sonic Reviews**

The HD668B is very similar to the HD681, except generally bassier and more full sounding. They share the same strengths, the same weaknesses, but they have slightly different sound signatures and the HD668B has a removable cable. I personally consider those to be the two biggest differences between the HD681 and the HD668B.

1373945673.0,47,self.headphones,1ie0oc,A plebian's comparison and review of Audeze LCD2 &amp; Beyerdynamic T1,51,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1ie0oc/a_plebians_comparison_and_review_of_audeze_lcd2/,"First of all, let me state that I am relatively new to this kind of thing. My daily headphones go between ATH-M50's (office) and Sennheiser HD598/Grado SR80i 
(home), and until this last weekend those were the best headphones I've ever used. However, thanks to the very inviting and friendly Mr. Sutton of Nice Cans here in Austin, TX, I had the opportunity to listen to and compare side by side Beyerdynamic T1 and Audeze LCD2.

This is my first review and I don't have plans for more, I simply thought it would be fun to throw my two cents into the pool. Thoughts and discussions are of course welcome, but if you get upset and passive-aggressive over a headphones review then you need to reevaluate your life priorities.

Edit: Music was played as uncompressed .WAV files from an iPad LOD into the Musical Fidelity M1HPAP DAC/amp.

**Comfort/Build Quality/Design**: Beyerdynamic wins this one with the phrase ""awesomely comfortable"". If asked whether I thought the HD598 or Beyers were more comfortable, I couldn't choose. They don't look bad either, but the LCD2 are way sexier. For all their seductive looks, however, I couldn't imagine having anything more than a one-song stand with them. I'm having trouble coming up with a metaphor for a gorgeous woman trying to suffocate my ears, but suffice to say that the clamping force was way high. (EDIT: Apparently, they become more comfortable after continued use. This doesn't surprise me as the T1s were probably used a bit more... I tried on fresh Beyer's at Guitar Center and they weren't nearly as comfortable, even though the earpads seem to have the same design.)

**Sound Quality and Attributes**:
**Audeze LCD2**: I've heard these headphones described as ""dark"" and kind of wondered what that meant until last weekend. Well, apparently it means ""to hell with treble."" Don't get me wrong, though, the mids and lows were just So Good. In three words, they sound precise, rich, and engaging. While the T1's seem to me more suited to live music because of their realistic presentation and soundstage, LCD2 is a pair that seems to really shine with well-produced studio work. This is no fault of the soundstage, which is very good, but rather because they sound more dreamy than real. Still, I found myself straining to hear Gillian Welch's higher guitar harmonies and Miles Davis' cymbals and such. Ultimately, this was their fatal flaw: if your treble is so reduced that you can't hear instruments, you're missing out on a part of the whole experience. (I've heard that the LCD3 actually fix this, so I'm currently accepting donations for a future review ;) .)

**Beyerdynamic T1**: The high mids and treble of these guys are everything the LCD2 was not: highly detailed, accurate, realistic, beautiful and airy. Perfect, really, in so many ways. That being said, if these are your go-to headphones, you're the kind of guy whose ears were offended by the live cannons at your last performance of the Overture of 1812; you believe that subwoofers are for hip-hop hooligans and that 100 Hz is ""low enough"". This sentence is the first time you've read the word 'dubstep' and you will never listen to a single song with double bass drum kicks. I'm exaggerating, of course: these headphones have lows, they're just kind of lame. It's meant to be present and audible without being offensive to your ears while you critique the way a particular violin vibrato. The lower mids were unoffensively good, like having a conversation with a nice Mormon fellow about the weather. Still, as I mentioned earlier, the soundstage is unreal and live music sounds absolutely spectacular.

**Summary**: Enjoying such a large variety of music, I'm a 'neutral' kinda guy. Now, maybe my priorities are out of whack, but the idea of spending the cost of a flight to Hawaii or Europe on a pair of headphones is not something I want to do **twice**, just to cover all my bases. I used to think that these kinds of headphones have only tiny variations on a flat response, and that such subtleties would be lost on my plebian ears. I was wrong. I actually found the pairing of the T1 and LCD2 ironic, in that they have perfectly complimentary flaws. If I could give the engaging lows and rich mids and modern look of the LCD2 to the beautiful, delicate highs and the airy comfort of the T1, you'd have something I'd really start saving up for. In the end, though, I'll be putting my money away with something else in mind.

**TL;DR** When they're good, they're really really good, but both have fatal flaws: LCD2 are so lacking in treble that some instruments can barely be heard but with rich and dreamy mids and lows, whereas T1 are too weak in the low end but delicate and beautiful and spacious in the highs.",,False,,t5_2rcyx,1374015001.0,,,True,t3_1ie0oc,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1ie0oc/a_plebians_comparison_and_review_of_audeze_lcd2/,

After nearly a month of extensive A/B comparative listening with the 3 headphones in my possession, I think I have reached a conclusion so here's my review for your reference.

Note that I was searching for the best one out of the three for me to keep, so a lot of my impressions is comparing one pair to another. As a result rather than doing 3 separate reviews I will be instead doing a comparison review of the 3 possible pairings of these 3 headphones. This way it'll give people an idea of how I think these three cans stack against each other, and at the same time offer a reference point for comparison (for people who own one/two of the three).

Headphone list and details:

* **Sennheiser HD 650** (650): stock cables/pads, silver drivers, my primary headphones for the past 3 years (many hours on them)
* **Sennheiser HD 800** (800): stock cables/pads, S/N 21xxx, purchased new a month ago (~80 hours on them)
* **HiFiMAN HE-500** (500): stock silver cables/velour pads, purchased new a week or so ago (~30 hours on them)

Amp list and details:

* **Little Dot MK III** (LD): OTL tube amp, stock 2x 6H6PI power tubes, non-stock 2x Mullard M8161 EF92 driver tubes, purchased new 3 months ago (many hours on them)
* **Schiit Lyr** (Lyr): Hybrid amp, non-stock 2x NOS National/Matsushita 6922 tubes, purchased used a few weeks ago (many hours on amp, ~100 hours on tubes)

Source:

* **Creative X-Fi Titanium HD**: sound card, 2x LME49720HA TO99 opamps (no longer used as I went digital), purchased used 3 months ago (many hours on them)
* **Schiit Bifrost**: DAC, with Uber upgrade, optical S/PDIF input, RCA output to amps, purchased new 2 months ago (many hours on them)

Newest official drivers are used for the sound card, on Windows 7 64-bit. Music is played through foobar2000, WASAPI output to sound card optical S/PDIF to DAC. File format varies, but mostly 320kbps MP3, 256kbps AAC, and FLAC.

I will begin with a surprising discovery that I made: the Lyr is not as good at driving the Sennheisers as the LD. This is something I did not know/expect until I A/B tested between the LD and the Lyr (I have a custom made high quality RCA spliter cable so I have both amps playing simultaneous for easy switching). The bass strength of the HD800s is slightly but noticeably weaker on the Lyr, and hits harder + fuller on the LD. The difference is subtle but is definitely there and noticeable. This is something that took me absolutely by surprise as the Lyr has tons of power to spare. The HE-500s' bass on the other hand feels a bit weaker on the LD, and is more effortless + impactful on the Lyr (even more subtle than the HD800 difference, but still noticeable). Initially I planned to do all my final comparisons of the headphones on the Lyr, but after this discovery I decided to mix up the pairings to get the best result possible for each of the headphones. So for this review, the 650s and 800s will be driven by the LD (on lowest gain setting), and the 500s will be driven by the Lyr.

**HD 650 (LD) vs HD 800 (LD)**

When I first heard the HD 800s I was not too impressed. The sound was much brighter than the 650, and the bass was lacking quite a bit. But after I've had some hours on the 800s, either they opened up or I've grown to like them (or both), but I began to really like them. The clarity and detail of the 800 is absolutely amazing compared to the 650's smooth, muddy sound signature. The bass on the 650 hits quite a bit harder than the 800, which I think can be attributed to a number of reasons. The rolled off treble on the 650 definitely brings the bass forward, and the muddiness of the signature helps boost the impact (more rumble). The bass on the 800 is tighter, feels more controlled, and extends a bit lower than the 650. Some say the 800 has the ""right"" amount of bass, but I personally wished that the 800 had a bit more punch in the lows, while maintaining its level of tightness and control.

The mids and treble is where the 800s shine. People spoke of the ""650 veil"", but I never truly noticed it until I compared it with the 800. When I swithced from the 650 to the 800, the sound felt so much clearer, it literally felt like a fuzzy screen was lifted between my ears and the music. The 650's mids are very smooth, to the point where I think creamy would be the best word to describe it. It makes for a very laid back sound, but a lot of details are lost compared to the HD800. Instrument separation was much better on the 800, which becomes very apparent when there's a lot of things going on in the song (e.g. chorus of many songs). The 650's treble rolls off but the 800's does not, which can make the 800s sound bright, but not too bright or harsh in my opinion. I did not notice the infamous 6kHz/10kHz peak on my 800s, but the raised treble compared to the 650 could be a bit too bright for some people, and possibly cause more fatigue. There were a few (very few) tracks that I tried which sounded a tad bit harsh on the 800s, which the 650 simply smoothed over, but it was not much of a bother for me at all.

The 650 has noticeably slower decay than the 800, which I think contributes to its smoothness/muddiness. The 800 is quite quick in comparison, and you notice the silence in between successive notes a lot better.

The soundstage of the 800s is simply uncontested. Switching from the 800 to the 650 feels like I've put a box over my head. A lot of it is due to the driver positioning (angled on the 800) and the ear cup chamber (much better on the 800) I think, but the end result is a much more airy sound from the 800s - you feel less like you are listening to headphones. The soundstage on the 650 is not bad, but is quite far from the 800.

In summary:

* **Bass**: The 650's bass packs noticeably more punch than the 800's, but the 800's bass is tighter/clearer and extends a bit lower
* **Mids**: Veiled, smooth/muddy, laid back on the 650s, clear, detailed but not harsh on the 800s. Much better instrument separation on the 800s, and much quicker decay
* **Treble**: The 650's treble is rolled off in comparison to the 800's, which makes the 800s sound brighter and more neutral (as no particular frequency range is emphasized)
* **Soundstage**: Significantly more spacious sound on the 800s
* **My Verdict**: The 800s are much better overall than the 650s. Perhaps if you mainly listened to EDM or similar genres, and crave lots of bass, then the 650 could be better (but in that case you should look for another pair of even more bass-heavy headphones)

**HD 800 (LD) vs HE-500 (Lyr)**

Since these headphones are being driven by different amps, it allowed for a much better A/B testing setup as I had them both plugged in and playing, and simply switched the headphones on my head very quickly. It also allowed for me to pre-adjust the volume level to match, since these headphones have different impedance and sensitivity levels (not a problem for 650 vs 800).

The 800 and the 500 are actually quite similar. I bought the 500 because from what I read/heard, it is supposed to be a fusion of the 800 and 650, i.e. with stronger bass impact + smoother signature than the 800 and better details + clarity than the 650. In reality the 500 is a lot closer to the 800 than the 650. The bass extension and quantity are almost identical, with a subtle difference being that the 800's bass feels slightly thinner than the 500's, which had a bit more rumbling feeling. This difference is very subtle in fact that I don't even feel confident that I can tell them apart in a blind test.

The mids and treble on the two are also very similar. Both offer a lot detail and clarity, and both are very quick (the 500 is a little faster I found). I found the 500's sound to be slightly smoother than the 800's, but there is something that made finding detailed differences very difficult, and that is the soundstage. The 800 has such a large soundstage compared to the 500 that it really trumps all other minor differences in their sound. Music sounds very close to the ears through the 500s, but on the 800s I feel more like I'm in a room listening to speakers (more natural).

There is a small difference in the sound of these two cans that I noticed which is a bit hard to describe. Certain sounds, especially percussions, sound a tad bit more real on the 500s. Claps sound slightly crisper, and drums sound slightly more like a real drum rather than a recording of it. The difference is very small but definitely there, and I think it might be due to the nature of planar magnetic drivers - they have more uniform movement as the magnetic field acts relatively equally across the whole surface.

I'll talk about the amps for a bit. The 800 and the 500 both sound very good on the LD. When I received my Lyr, I tried the 500 on it and noticed the slightly more impactful and effortless bass. This was expected, as the HE-500 takes quite a bit more power to drive properly (not nearly as hard as the HE-6 but still harder than most dynamics), and the LD was not designed to drive low impedance orthos (it only outputs 100mW at 32Ohm). What was surprising to me was the reverse difference with the HD800. The bass, especially the deeper ones, did not quite hit it all the way on the Lyr, but had more strength on the LD. I was so shocked that I switched between the two amps repeatedly 20 or 30 times to make sure the difference was indeed there. I can say that it is very noticeable in certain tracks that I'm confident I can tell the two amps apart in a blind test. I'm not exactly sure what the cause is, as the Lyr clearly has more output power (even at 300Ohm) than the LD. Both amps drive both of these headphones very well though, but the LD has an edge over the Lyr on the 800, while the Lyr does better with the 500. There is not much sonic difference between these two amps other than what I mentioned here (as far as I can tell at least).

In summary:

* **Bass**: Extension and impact are nearly identical. The 800's bass seems slightly thinner compared to the 500's
* **Mids**: Very similar, both offer amazing detail and clarity. The 500s make certain sounds (particularly percussions) sound a bit more realistic than the 800s (nature of planar magnetic drivers perhaps?)
* **Treble**: Very similar, neither have treble peaks that stand out
* **Soundstage**: Significantly better soundstage on the 800s
* **My Verdict**: Both are very detailed, neutral headphones. In terms of sound it comes down to the larger soundstage of the 800 vs the slightly more rumbly bass + the slightly more realistic sound of the 500. In the end my pick was the 800 + LD, as the 500 felt quite heavy and not as comfortable as the 800

**HD 650 (LD) vs HE-500 (Lyr)**

Since the 500 is very similar to the 800, a lot of the things in the 650 vs 800 section also applies here. The 650 has much punchier bass, but the 500 has deeper extension. The 650's mid range is veiled and dirty compared to the clear and detailed mid of the 500. The 500 offers details in the treble that the 650 simply does not match.

In terms of the soundstage, these two are actually quite similar. The 500's is more spacious in comparison I think

In summary:

* **Bass**: The 650s' bass hits harder and is more impactful than the 500s by a wide margin. The bass on the 500s is tighter and more focused, which could be partly why it seems to be weaker. However the 500s' bass extends deeper than the 650s, dipping down to near 20Hz without dropping in strength.
* **Mid**: Lots of detail and clarity on the 500s. The 650s have a very smooth texture, ""creamy"" comes to mind as the closest to describe it.
* **Treble**: The 650's treble is rolled off, which makes the 500s sound brighter and more detailed in comparison
* **Soundstage**: Similar, with the 500s having an edge over the 650s.
* **My Verdict**: I would go with the 500s over the 650s, definitely a step up in sound quality in almost every aspect (unless you are a basshead maybe)

**Comfort**

The 500s are quite heavy (almost double the weight of either one of the Senns). I found the stock headband to clamp a bit too tight on my head, but a $13 headband padding on eBay makes it a lot better. The 800s are the most comfortable, being light with large ear cups (though for people with smaller heads/faces, the large ear cups could be uncomfortable). The 650s are very comfortable as well, but they clamp pretty tight (even after 3 years of use) compared to the 800s. I would say the HD800 is the most comfortable, followed by either the HE500 with the headband pad or the HD650.

**Conclusion**

In the end I chose the HD800 + LD as my main gear. The LD is definitely not doing the HD800s justice, and I plan to get a better amp in the future. To be honest, all three headphones are amazing and I would've been happy with any of them. Thanks for reading, and I'll leave some pictures here of the setups used in this review.

I plan to expand this subreddit to be the best it can be. I will do so by adding/improving a few aspects of this subreddit:

1. I will add flair that everyone can change or that has to be moderator approved. Not completely sure.
2. I will upgrade the sidebar.
3. I will add a good posting guideline.
4. I will try and start some different posting trends in this subreddit.
5. I will become a more active moderator. Meaning that I will be stricter on useless comments and circlejerks.
6. Lastly and most importantly, this subreddit is **YOURS** i can only moderate it. Help the people that need help, post interesting things, and try to further this subreddit in any way you can. If you have any specific issues with this subreddit or discourse in this subreddit message me or any of the other moderators. We are here to make /r/headphones as good as it can possibly be so *you* have a place to post. Thank you to those of you that already work hard to make this subreddit amazing and to those of you that will in the future.

In the coming week i will post a few threads on the specific details of every change I make with an explanation of how to best utilize these changes. Thanks for the advice and thanks for all of the help.

EDIT:: As a precursor to my future post I want to let you know that detrimental complaint will not be accepted. I am doing everything i can to try and stop the ""what headphones should i buy under $100"" posts. However i want all of you to realize that these posts wills still be their because the community is expanding. This expansion means an influx of people that are new to audio and are looking for an intro into this world. Please accept them and give them helpful information. If you have different opinions about these posts ignore them and go about your merry way. Now on the flip side start reporting posts with bad titles.

MAAAAAN this is what I was looking for,37,1,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1i7vz4/hd_558_maaaaan_this_is_what_i_was_looking_for/,"I always thought I was a ""basshead"", hearing everyone(most people) say ""if you like DnB, electronic, EDM etc get the XB500"" so I naturally thought I should look for bass heavy headphones. I thought any non bass boosted cans would disappoint me. 

I brought the TMA-1 and while they sounded good for Netsky and other in your face DnB and dubstep, they sounded so bad in metalcore and also ambient chillstep. They didn't have any soundstage and they were really muddy. (I'm not an audiophile but I could still tell this)

I bit the bullet and researched again for about 2 days. My criteria this time ignored the bass but went for a flat sound with a great sound stage and separation. The HD 598 and 558 were the 2 contenders and I wanted to save money and I know of the foam mod so I got 558.

Let me just say, I have only had them for 2 hours and I haven't taken them off my head. The bass is PERFECT. It can reproduce bass exactly how I believe it was made in studio. Treble and mids are not drowned out like the TMA-1, so metalcore sounds excellent, the soundstage... oh my. For ambient music it sounds BEAUTIFUL! So happy with this headphones and I think I found THE pair. 

I see people saying ""no bass"" when reviewing these cans and people recommending them beats or XB, I can see why. If you think these have no bass, that's your answer but really, if you think having that bass is nescessary or that these cans won't have bass... wow they do, creamy as hell. I took the flat response wrongly I think.

TLDR: fuck yes, 558s are perfect for me.

In this system I have a very good turntable, phono preamp, $1k cartridge, $1.5k integrated amp, streamer and great speakers. I sold all my headphones about a year ago and just use some cheap (but nice sounding) IEM's for daily portable listening. The other day I threw on some Alessandro's and was blown away. All the detail and impact just came rushing back to me as I realised what I had been missing for the last year. I have owned some pretty high end headphones and amps (Alessandro MS Pro, HD650 etc) but I had forgotten how good they sound.

So my question is, what makes headphones sound so much better than a lot of speakers costing thousands more? Is it because they are on your ears? Is it because they block out more noise?

I bought the headphones and a set of backup L-CUSH earpads from Amazon, and they came fully warrantied. 

Rating scale: 

5 - Spectacular.

4 - Very good.

3 - Could be better.

2 - Meh.

1 - Utter shit.

**Build Quality:**

Some may say that these are not well built, but I wholeheartedly disagree. They are very sturdy, just don't throw them in a bag, or at a wall or something.

**4/5**

**Comfort:**

Now, I'll give two different ratings for the two different cushions I got. 

*L-CUSH* are essentially bowl-shaped pads that convert them from on-ear to over-ear 'phones. They are a little stiff at first, but not bad. They breathe incredibly well, and offer a slightly more airy sound than with the standard pads. If you wear them wrong, the housing will pin your ear to your head, but otherwise, they are very decent.

**4/5**

*Stock cushions* are very nice on-ear pads. Whilst they do get very hot very quickly, they are lush, and don't squeeze your head too much. If they weren't as plush and wonderful as they are, the heat would bring them down to a 3.

**4.5/5**

**Initial Impressions:**

At first, you will open the box, be amazed at the length and girth of the cable (it's at least 7mm in diameter). Then, you will excitedly plug them in. You'll put on your favorite album. And what happens next? Frankly, you will be disappointed. **THIS WILL GO AWAY.** I cannot stress that enough. The highs will be too high, and the cymbals will be a bit static-y. In addition, the pads will be a tiny bit stiff. I promise, this will not last. 

**Hang in there— you didn't waste your money.**

Within an hour or two of continuous burn-in time, the static will go away, and the highs will equalize themselves. Put them on again. Put your favorite album back on. You should enjoy this immensely. Highs will be crisp, mids will be bright and warm, and the bass will be tight, and even give a bit of rattle if you play the right song. If you are thinking of getting a headphone amp; don't. You won't need it. I tested these with the following albums—

""The Hollow"" by Memphis May Fire

""Ground Dweller"" by Hands Like Houses

""If You Were A Movie, This Would Be Your Soundtrack"" by Sleeping With Sirens.

These albums absolutely sound brilliant with these on.

**4.5/5** (solely because of the mini heart attack you'll recieve)

**Overall** 

Get these headphones. They can do anything. (pictues will be added if requested)

**4.5/5**

**EDIT:** As some have pointed out, this scoring system is kind of crappy, and have also pointed out that there are far better headphones than this.

Of course, the floor salesman asked what I was mainly looking for and I said headphones, then he points out the shelves stocked with Beats, the 50 Cent ones, whatever you want to call them, and I grimaced and said I wasn't really interested in any of those headphones.

Apparently, the store owner noticed and asked me what kind of headphones I have and what are the best headphones you can get (ha!), so I told him I owned Audio Technicas and Grados and went on to mention Sennheisers and a few other brands. He was surprised because his friend recently asked if they carried Grados. This lead to a lengthy discussion about quality headphones and other merchandise of the sort. Long story short, I told him I wouldn't touch Beats with a ten foot pole if you paid me, and pointed him to Head-Fi and some good resources. This was shocking having an owner of a franchise like this really interested in possibly more high quality cans. Corporate isn't very likely to change their game, but it's refreshing that store owners might set new paces.

Just thought I'd share this story; self post so whatever.

**tl;dr**: Grossed out by Beats, told RadioShack store owner to visit Head-Fi, brought audio peace to corporate owned businesses.

Which is why I'm also expanding the scope a bit - I've started adding individual product pages for some of the headphones, and an index of manufacturers, here are some examples:

* [List of manufacturers](http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/wiki/headphones)
* An index page per manufacturer, example: [HiFiMAN](http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/wiki/headphones/hifiman)
* Product pages for individual headphones, example: [RE-400](http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/wiki/headphones/hifiman/re-400), [HE-500](http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/wiki/headphones/hifiman/he-500)

I'm going to try to add such individual pages as I have time, but it would be _awesome_ if you guys would contribute to this as well, and add pages.  Here's how to do it

1. URL should be hierarchical, so `/r/headphones/wiki/headphones/hifiman/re-600` would be the product page for the RE-600, while `/r/headphones/wiki/headphones/hifiman/` is the index for hifiman headphones, and `/r/headphones/wiki/headphones/` is the list of all manufacturers
2. If the manufacturer you want to add a headphone for isn't in the list already, add it to the index of manufacturers
3. Create the page for the manufacturer, following the same template as used for HiFiMAN, and add links to the headphones you plan on adding.  If it is a current model, add it under a ""Current"" heading, and if it a discontinued model, add an appropriate heading (and if you know when production started and ceased, feel free to add that info in paranthesis
4. Create the page for the headphone, following the template from the RE-400
5. If the headphone has been reviewed by a member of /r/headhpones please add a link to it in the review section

**Edit:** Also, if the headphone you are writing a product sheet page for is in the [list of recommended headphones](http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/wiki/recommendations) change the link on that page, so that it points to the product sheet instead of an external page.",,False,,t5_2rcyx,1369064446.0,,,True,t3_1ep5g5,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1ep5g5/wiki_expanding_the_scope_of_the_recommended/,
1364935958.0,29,self.headphones,1bjgrz,Anyone have an idea why spending serious money on headphones is frowned upon by the general public?,49,20,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1bjgrz/anyone_have_an_idea_why_spending_serious_money_on/,"So, a few times it has come up in conversation with other students at my university that I've been saving up for a pair of $700 headphones (Hifiman HE-500s) for over a year, and this fact is met with utter disbelief a lot of the time. When they ask me to explain, usually I'll talk about how it can be when you start focusing on listening to small details on good recordings in lossless formats, people will generally drop it and understand that it's just a hobby like any other. But some people won't drop it, who find it completely ridiculous. I know plenty of people who aren't audiophiles, just with wealthy parents who spend $300 on Bose headphones who don't put any thought into bitrate who think that it's ridiculous to spend more on headphones.

And then it really struck me when a person asked me why I would spend so much money on a pair of headphones, when I'm not a professional musician. This same person owns an $800 D-SLR camera. And then I realized, tons of people who consider themselves photography hobbyists, or even those who don't own much more expensive cameras than we own headphones, and probably do not use them as often, but no one really bats an eye at people spending money on that. What accounts for these things being considered differently?",,False,,t5_2rcyx,False,,,True,t3_1bjgrz,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1bjgrz/anyone_have_an_idea_why_spending_serious_money_on/,
1364267376.0,30,self.headphones,1b0ppc,Mad Dog Review - First Review Attempt!,32,2,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1b0ppc/mad_dog_review_first_review_attempt/,"Be gentle oh great audiophile wizards!  Attempting to get my vocabulary and baseline in order.  I've attempted to follow other review formats... I also learned that these headphones do not function on high gain as the O2 amp starts clipping.

**TL;DR** - Great fairly linear headphones that seem to reproduce tracks as recorded.  I went into this looking for something with clear, responsive bass and well rounded mids/highs and they more than delivered.  (Also, first pair of $300 headphones and planar magnetics to boot)  Will definitely be keeping this pair of cans for as long as they last me until I decide that I need to spend more money.   The next set will probably be a pair of HE-500s if I can find an excuse to buy them along with a mid-tier Schiit stack.  (No need to headphones at home, unfortunately.)  

For a person looking for an even sound, they take the cake as compared to the AKG 550s and DT880s.  I found the highs too strident in the 550s to where it was painful to listen to some tracks and the bass is more well rounded than the DT880s.  I guess punchy, but definitely not in your face.  At first, they sounded a bit dull but when I adjusted there were some tracks that I wanted to take it down a notch.  

9/10!  I think I'll only be able to get a better soundstage/signature by dropping twice the cost on another pair of open headphones.

**Setup** - O2 AMP (WAU16-400 tranformer), O2 DAC, V-Moda Cable, Mad Dog (Alpha Pads), FLAC audio

**Build Quality/Comfort** - Definitely feels like a solid pair of headphones.  I'm a bit wary of the hinges that connect the actual cans to the headband, but other than that they are pretty solid.  The lambskin pads feel fantastic, but it gets a little bit warm under there.  (I have longer hair).  The quality of the pads are great, but I feel that the stitching might need some love in a year or so.  The squishness of the pads are great and break in easily and will probably seal better as they form to my head.  The extra headband that Dan throws in under the standard Fostex one feels great and is a solid piece of leather.   The only thing that annoys me a bit is that the cables that connect to the headphones poke out so when I take them off my finger has a tendency to snag one accidentally which I'm sure will go away once I get used to them.   The clamping force on these is ideal: nice strong hug, not too soft and not cutting off circulation.

They are a weighty pair of cans, but after wearing them for 6 hours straight I'm none too worse for the wear.  No pressure points and ears are happy.  

**Isolation** - The sound isolation is pretty good.  (Better than the AKG 550s that I tried).  Currently listening at a normal volume of a bass heavier song and the only thing I can hear is the gentle whirr of my desk fan and some people talking faintly if I focus in on it.   As for leaking sound, when the cans are on, little to no sound leakage.  If I crank the volume, sound will start to leak out and your cube mate might be able to hear you.   When taking the headphones off, sound leakage is as expected.   With the sound on at a reasonable listening volume, it pretty much drowns out 95% off the open office space.  You will definitely be in your own world once you put these headphones on.  Cables are great and no sound issues to note.


**Sound** - Overall, they produce great highs, mids and bass.  The soundstage seems feels a bit ""cramped"", small room I guess would be describe it, but they are sealed cans so that's expected and an necessary evil of working in an open office.   The detail on these headphones are fantastic and the bass is much tighter than my TripleFi10s (amped via the O2 with a Null Audio Lune cable.) with similar highs/mids, but a bit ""darker"" sounding.  However, compared against the TripleFi10s, the details far surpasses them.  (I might have to upgrade my TripleFis now...)   

Overall, best headphones I've owned (only ones I have owned have been in the 200 and under range).  The sound can come across as a little fatiguing, but I believe that is because I'm not used to such detailed sound.  Dan mentions that if people want more bass to pick up the ones with the Dog pads and I can't imagine anyone needing those for more bass, IMO.

**Songs** - Linked with YouTube videos for reference.  I also tried to pick well mastered tracks for testing, but I may have failed since I am not that awesome to be able to tell that much.

**[Tool - Jambi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNojdoI_D_M)** (Known for a bass heavy riff, distorted guitars and varying vocal levels)
Bass is fantastic and you can clearly distinguish an well enunciated bass guitar that is clearly separated from the drums.  The vocals are well separated from similar frequencies and sound great.  At 1:15, on my TripleFis the vocals will usually meld into the bass but is well detailed here.  Cymbals sound great and are a bit light, but you can definitely focus in on them through the bass.   The guitar comes through well also.   I do wish the highs were a bit warmer, but I knew this coming in that these would be dark sounding headphones.  

**[Dengue Fever - One Thousand Tears of a Tarantula](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_7plOQvzA)**  (Cambodian psychedelic rock)
Guitar comes across as warm and smooth.  Bass is there and not overpowering and the highs aren't strident at all.  This track sounds a bit more claustrophobic for what I would like it to be mainly with the chanting/echoing vocals that come in around 2:20 or so as I imagine listening to this sound with a large sound stage.  No sibiliance to note.  I would like for the brass to come in a bit more, but I think that's just how it was mixed.  At 4:16 the instruments start to blend together a bit, but you can definitely separate them.   

**[Glitch Mob - We Can Make The World Stop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-k_Eg7zXuc)** - Bassy accompanied by a lot of mids and a smattering of highs.
Bass is great as usual and mids roll across.  The higher frequency ""sound fx"" come across as detailed and pleasant.  No wincing experienced like I had with the K550s.  Not much to note here since the track signature doesn't change too much.

**[Aloe Blacc - I Need A Dolla](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR6oYX1D-0w)** - Vocals/piano in the mids, soft bassline
Brass sounds great with the soft bassline.   The bass does sometimes overtake the softness of the brass, but again, probably mixing.  Voice is very clear and detailed.  Cymbals are clear and enunciated.  

**Eric Johnson - Cliffs of Dover/Manhattan**
Guitar sounds beautiful/crystal clear and with the way that it is mixed, you can almost tell that the bass drum has been separately mic'd which detracts from the overall mix. (I guess testament to how detailed the Mad Dogs are?)  Cymbals are great as well.   With the way this was mixed, you can almost pick apart each of the separate channels used for this.   Manhattan sounds beautiful and was immersed in this song.  Man, Eric Johnson sounds fantastic on these cans.

So a flat response is of high importance. These headphones have amazing reviews but there are always people in the comment sections disagreeing and often suggesting other pairs of headphones (usually for the wrong reasons and of different price ranges). When I say wrong reasons I mean people suggesting something with a less flat response because they liked the sound more, people suggesting other headphones for better comfort etc.

I want to know. In the SAME price range, for the purpose of STUDIO MONITORING, are there better ones and which ones would you suggest?

EDIT: In terms of **frequency response** the 'Sony MDR-V6' beats every other headphone within its and maybe higher price ranges.

I'd like your opinion on some quality headphones, but first a little bit about myself:

I began seeking higher quality audio out of necessity of apartment living and having a little old lady living below me. I recently began to invest in headphones for music/gaming. 

My music tastes are pretty simple. I enjoy almost every genre. I don't have many lossless audio files, and while I'm curious how they'll sound with a decent headphone setup, I am unsure if I'm willing to go through the trouble of collecting lossless audio (unless I **really** enjoy the album).

Gaming wise, I just play an hour of WoW a day (if I have time) and maybe a few games off of steam. I'm not really a gamer. I spend a lot more time just listening to music and reading.

My first investment was the Astro A40 headset w/ amp. It was the biggest piece of shit I've ever bought. I was severely disappointed. My in-ear buds I purchased for a third of the cost sounded better.

I then began to do research, and I decided on getting the *Asus Xonar One* DAC (with built in headphone amp) that I should be receiving later today.
 
I am aware most audio enthusiasts stay the fuck away from ""gamer"" type audio solutions for good reason - more money is spent on marketing than R&amp;D. However, Asus Xonar One did go through the trouble of actually following audio enthusiasts preferences of a DAC &amp; Amp on forums and articles. This and the cost compared to other models powering up to 600 ohms, I thought it was an easy choice for getting my feet wet.

With no real budget limitations, does it make sense to get a flagship model with the expectation of the item lasting 20+ years? Or should I get a lower end model to test the waters?

Any advice will be appreciated :) 

**EDIT**

I feel sort of silly now. I suppose my budget for headphones is $3,000. I seriously wasn't expecting any headphones/amps you guys are throwing at me :P - $30k headphones!

I suppose another concern of mine is whether the nicer headphones will be lost on me if I don't consider myself a true audiophile (at least not yet anyway).


** EDIT 2 **

I got my ASUS Xonar One DAC hooked up. I do believe I a significant difference in my Audioengine 5 bookshelf speakers! However, I played a FLAC &amp; MP3 of my favorite song: I couldn't notice a difference.

I can't wait for the headphones! I'll probably wait till Apirl before I commit. I think Best Buy in my area has some mid range headphones I can try out. I'll keep this thread updated. 

Thanks for all your comments! I was afraid that the headphone/audiophile people would be snobs, but you guys are great! Great community here!

The goal for the wiki is to collect resources, both those found in the sidebar, and good ones posted as stories here, as well as provide a single place to keep moderator policies and archives of past moderator announcements.

For now, the wiki is relatively sparsely populated.  Eventually, we hope that the wiki will be your one-stop shop for preliminary research, and gear reviews written by [/r/headphoners](/r/headphones), as well as provide answers to frequently asked questions.

Now, the wiki being sparsely populated is intentional - a wiki is, by nature, a collaborative resource, and it needs _your_ help to become a good resource.   This means that the Wiki is open to editing from anyone - with the following two prerequisites:

1. You need to have gathered at least 100 total karma points here in /r/headphones - these karma points can come from either comments or posts. 
2.  Your reddit account needs to be at least 10 days old

If you are unsure whether you have a total of 100 karma points in /r/headphones or not, you can find you per-subreddit karma breakdown in the sidebar on your own user page, just click the link that says ""show karma breakdown by subreddit"", and a list appears.

Note that the karma and account age requirement are not there to discourage anyone from editing or participating - it is simply there to prevent spammers from polluting the wiki using automated tools.

Some relevant pages you should visit as you familiarize yourself with the wiki:

* The [New pages](/r/headphones/wiki/newpages) article - if you want to create a new article for the Wiki, this page contains instructions on how to create a new page, and works as a place to list new pages so others can have a look at it.   I will look in on this page from time to time, and categorize the links, and put them on the front page (or on a sub page
* The [sandbox](/r/headphones/wiki/sandbox) - if you want to test out features of the markdown syntax, and you want to play around in a safe environment, without accidentally damaging other articles, this is the place to do it.
* There is a [live list of recent edits](http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/wiki/revisions/) to the wiki - if you check this page out, and you see pages being created/edited that _clearly_ does not belong in /r/headphones - such as spam, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fheadphones) with the link to the page that clearly does not belong.

Also, on every page in the wiki, there is a ""Talk"" section.  If you want to discuss something regarding a specific page in the wiki, please use this function.  Also, if you are intending to make major changes to any page in the wiki, please use this function, and discuss which change you are intending to make with your fellow redditors.

Note that some pages will be protected from editing - this applies to the wiki front page, and any posts regarding /r/headphones moderator policy. We also reserve the right to protect pages from editing if they are victims of destructive editing wars.   Please report any spam, pages that are being vandalized, or where destructive editing wars are taking place.

Comments? Questions? This is the post to ask.  A question for you: Is the 100 karma requirement the right number?  Should it be lower? Higher?

1332367565.0,25,self.headphones,r7el6,A non-audiophile look at HD-800 and Schiit Lyr,31,6,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/r7el6/a_nonaudiophile_look_at_hd800_and_schiit_lyr/,"This is meant to be a mini-review of two fine pieces of equipment I've acquired. I'm by no means an audiophile, but I thought r/headphones might want a break from recommendation threads and hear what someone has to say about some gear.

http://imgur.com/ezenz

So about a year ago on the recommendation of a friend I got a Fiio-E7 and AKG-K701. I saw a few pictures of the K701 and fell in love with the aesthetics. A quick look online at a few reviews confirmed to me at least that I would like the neutral nature of the K701 as I listen to a ton of classical, light rock, rock, and some pop music. Fast forward a few months and based on some strong reviews and recommendations on r/headphones I bought the HD-800 and a Fiio-E9. After being somewhat disappointed when comparing the HD-800 and the K701, I decided to get a better amp and acquired the Schiit Lyr, which I've been using for a few weeks together.

All of my music is either 320k Mp3 or FLAC and I'm currently still using the Fiio-e7 as a DAC. If I ever acquire music at a higher bitrate I'll probably jump to the Bifrost, but for now I fail to see why I need it. Keep in mind I'm no audiophile so getting a better DAC is low on my priority list in terms of subjective improvements. I've had the opportunity to borrow and use some other great headphones as well such as the Beyer DT-770, DT-990 and the HD-600.

First I'd like to comment on the difference between the E9 and the Lyr.  If you've never owned a good amp, I'd like to caution you that the amp can get hot, really hot. However, it seems to be the norm so while I was concerned at first I no longer think about it at all. In terms of subjective audio quality the Lyr was definitely an improvement. I can't really describe the sound difference without using some typical audiophile babble but if you've ever played a stringed instrument, I almost felt like the Lyr had ""vibrato"" without actually vibrating strings. The low range on the Lyr was definitely more enhanced. If I had one complaint about the Fiio amps it's that at first the bass on both the K701 and HD-800 disappointed me greatly and that the highs on the K701 were sometimes shrill. The Lyr improved things on both fronts. Build quality wise the E9 had an annoying audible hiss when moving the volume pot. The Lyr on the other hand, looks like and is built like a tank.

When I first received the HD-800 I expected to plug it into the E9 and feel instant audio-nirvana, blowing my K701 out of the water. What I got instead was confusion and general inability to distinguish major differences. In reality the HD-800 provided me with some more bass (not quite thumping bass like a sub-woofer), but no other huge improvements over the K701. The mid and high ranges felt more or less the same. In fact I felt like if I just artificially EQ'd in some bass on the K701 I could get roughly 95% of the HD-800. Despite my initial disappointments, after roughly 6 ~~months~~weeks of using the HD-800 and contrasting it to the K701, DT-770, and DT-990, I can say for certain that the biggest win of the much more expensive cans is detail and clarity. If I really sat down and concentrated on nothing else (no reddit, no games, no books) but my music, I could definitely appreciate the separation of instruments and ability to pinpoint specific sounds within a track on the HD-800. If I just used my headphones as sort of a background while doing work or gaming would I notice a difference between the HD-800 and K701? Not really, the K701 would be 90% good enough. But if I decided to sit down and appreciate the music, the HD-800 was hands down much better. So was it worth the $1k+ difference? Probably not, but I'm happy with my purchase nonetheless. One key pro of the HD-800 that people should appreciate more is the comfort of the earcups. Everybody I've shown my HD-800 to has commented on how amazingly comfortable they are.

So in conclusion, are the HD-800+Lyr an improvement over the K701+E9? For sure, but more like a 25% or less increase in audio quality. I think for the average non-audiophile a $200 set of cans and a $100/$150 DAC/AMP combo would definitely suffice. But, for anyone seeking to melt into their music, the HD-800 will blow your mind with its detail.

  They have a very nice thick atmosphere of bass that is always tight and controlled.  Mids are slightly recessed( after having 3 mid-dominant headphones I can use a change in sound signature, though), with nice treble thats not bright, nor veiled.  

They sound quite big-  They obviously sound closed, but they do have a nice soundstage that keeps everything distinct and defined.

They ultimately remind me of a slightly darker, much more capable Audio Technica ES7.  The sound is embellished and it's not very neutral, but they sound great- sort of like what Beats would sound like if they were worth $300.  These are pretty forgiving of recordings, so it's a joy to kind of throw them on and not be bothered by good or bad production.

The build quality is excellent-  these feel solid and industrial.  All around really satisfied- these are pretty great for portable use( I've been listening to them a lot at home), and they fold up to nearly the size of a baseball with clipped batwings 

Compared to the Sony MDR 1R, these definitely have more bass with more recessed mids.  The Sony soundstage is also definitely bigger, and a more comfortable headphone overall.  Build quality is definitely not on par with the mostly-metal V-Moda construction.  Both are pretty great overall, though.

I received my pair of ATH-M50s (LE if that matters) in the mail yesterday and I'm really enjoying them. The detail is incredible and I'm really liking the sound! I just have one small concern with the bass that maybe you guys can help me out with. 

When I was researching these headphones people were calling them very ""bass heavy"", but my pair doesn't seem to produce much heavy bass at all. I can hear the bass and it can go low without faltering. If I put my hands on the cups I can feel them shaking on the outside from the bass but I'm just not ""feeling"" the rumble **in** the cups that I expect from heavy bass. 

I don't mind it this way but I'm worried that the headphones are not supposed to be like this and there is something wrong or defective about them. I did let them play all last night as an attempt to burn them in with the volume turned up relatively high (not to the point of distortion, but kinda high). Is it possible that I somehow damaged     them by doing this? I hear no distortion or rattling within the cans while music is being played even at high volumes so I'm unsure. 

Also, if it helps, I've had them for only a day and maybe have 20+ hours of playing time with these. I'm just playing them through a laptop with an internal equalizer. I've listened to mostly every genre on these so far including very bass-heavy genres but nothing produces a physical ""thump"". (Also, by no means am I an experienced audiophile as you can tell.)

**TL;DR**: Are the ATH-M50s supposed to have thumping bass where your'e supposed to feel it physically thumping on your head or are my headphones fine and my mind is just fabricating problems?

**EDIT:** After taking some advice from a friend, I tried plugging my M50s into something else and turn the volume to full. The bass wasn't incredibly thumpy, but I could actually feel it and just sounds improved when plugged into my old iPod nano. My music also seems noticeably louder when turned up all the way on my iPod compared to my laptop (though I don't find it unbearable like some people say it can get).

The company started with Joseph Grado in Brooklyn, New York, who specialized in not only making audio equipment, but even inventing and creating many audio designs over it’s near 60 year history. Joseph Grado has since been inducted into the Audio Hall of Fame and has passed the torch onto his, very capable, nephew John. Grado has been making quality headphones that audio enthusiasts rave about and has built quite the following. If you haven’t heard about Grado then it’s time to start!

**Pros:** Price to quality ratio, modability, clean and lively sound, and build quality is sound. Strong mids and punchy mid-bass with clean highs.

**Cons:** Sub bass is lacking and comfort is nothing to brag about.

**Preferred Genres:** I’ve greatly enjoyed almost everything through these with the exception of most electronic music or deep bass focused tracks. Rock, indie, and jazz all sound great.

**Amp:** Subtle changes through an amp are noted, mostly a cleaner sound. I recommend and amp, but it’s certainly not necessary.

**Listening Set-Up:** iPod Classic or Computer/ODAC/O2.

**Packaging**

The Grado SR80i come in what many audio enthusiasts call the Grado Pizza Box. It’s simply a cardboard box with two small circular windows showing the cans. The box design is reminiscent of the 80s in style. The SR80i are protected by a styrofoam holder that fills the box. Included is a piece of paper with warranty information among some warnings. The SR80i are fitted with a 1/4th plug that pulls off to show the 1/8th plug. This is simple and efficient and it’s worked for Grado for years. 

**Build Quality and Design**

Much like the box, the aesthetics of the SR80i are very classic looking, vintage if you will. This design is either a huge turn on or turn off, depending on your preference. One thing that can be said is that it’s minimal and efficient. The headband is simply a metal frame wrapped in leather, or a leather like substance, with no padding. The headband adjustors are held in place by the left and right indicators and slide up and down with enough resistance to prevent them from moving unintentionally. The cups of the SR80i are made of plastic with a black grill that has an SR80i button on it, the outside of the cup has the brand and line information. The pads are rather thick and cover the driver. They are a bit stiff and itchy, but they break in rather quickly without much discomfort. The cable comes from each ear and joins at a y-split. The cable is thick and inspires confidence of the build quality. 

The headphones are light and put only slight pressure on the top of the head. The pads are a bit itchy and hard which can cause discomfort, but over time this lessens. The pads do, however, get a bit hot. In-fact the SR80i feel like closed headphones in that regard and it is due to the thick pad that covers the drivers unlike most open headphones that simply have a cloth in between the driver and ear, allowing for air to come in.

**Sound Quality**

I’ve been using the SR80i exclusively for the past two weeks, though I have been listening on and off for two months before. I have noticed no noticeable burn-in, nor have I with an amp in comparison to my iPod. These are ready to go out of the box into whatever device you would like. My test tracks can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kV06aqWRCc8tdD_Sss4D5i0orsql1Xb0WVyrimIXXL4/edit?usp=sharing).

**TL:DR**
The SR80i have been highly recommended since they have been released due to their impressive sound to quality ratio. These have a clean and lively sound that is best described as mid and high focused with a touch of warmth from the mid-bass to balance these out nicely.

**Lows**
When people think of Grado the first thing that generally comes to mind is their mids and highs, which makes them suitable for rock music and similar genres. That sentiment is mostly true. Many people go on to say that the bass is lacking in the SR80i, this I don’t agree with. The very low frequencies are definitely shy, there is no denying that. This makes the SR80i sub-optimal for bass heavy genres. Going up in the frequencies though, the SR80i are a very competant headphone. The mid bass adds a touch of warmth to the bright presentation of these headphones making these headphones more balanced than a lot of people give them credit for. The mid bass is punchy with good presence. The level of the bass is more than acceptable for rock music, or similar genres that have a focus on vocals and guitars. In-fact I think the amount of mid bass is near the perfect amount for many genres. 

**Mids &amp; Highs**
The mids and highs are the reason why people buy Grado. They are forward and clean while having a very natural sound throughout. Vocals and guitars shine through the SR80i, clean and detailed with a strong presence. The mids and highs are certainly not limited to those two instruments either, in-fact I haven’t heard an instrument that sounds bad on these, from horns to stringed instruments. The mids and highs are forward, this gives a more lively sound, music comes to life through the SR80i. I won’t wax poetic, I’ve said what needs to be said and that is that the mids and highs shine.

**Presentation**
Like the lows, the presentation hurts the SR80i. The sound is presented in a narrow manner that can come off as congested at times. Fortunately the instrument separation is great on these, even though the presentation is narrow the instruments have their space. Depth isn’t a strong suit of these either, in-fact the SR80i remind me of seeing a venue in a small square shaped room. Positioning is decent though, it’s not impossible to pinpoint where things are coming from despite the small soundstage, but it isn’t as easy as a headphone like the Audio Technica Ad2000.

**Conclusion**

Despite the shortcomings of the SR80i they have become one of my favorite headphones. Musicality is the word that comes to mind when describing the SR80i. I don’t think about the details of the music, I simply enjoy it. They are detailed enough to nitpick albums and their mastering if you’d like, but it’s easy to put these on and throw on your favorite album to relax with. The Grado SR80i are available for $100, this is a standard price anywhere you go, and it is more than a fair price for these. I put these on par with any other companies offerings in the same price range from Sennheiser to Audio Technica. These are an excellent value, even at $100 and anyone looking for a first set of headphones would be more than satisfied with these.

1360190676.0,25,self.headphones,180ztk,Just got my Audio-Technica ATH-A900X. First impressions for anyone interested.,30,5,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/180ztk/just_got_my_audiotechnica_atha900x_first/,"These are my first pair of nice headphones, I thought I'd say a little bit about them for anyone considering getting their feet wet with a similar purchase or for those eyeing this particular model. If you're wanting to read something from a guy who's had dozens of pairs of several hundred dollar headphones, I'm not your guy.


Fit/Comfort: After reading many reviews from all across the internet, I determined that most people either had a love/hate relationship with the non adjustable wing-style support mechanism. I have what I believe to be an average sized-head, and I'm going to take a leap here and quantify that. I measured the ol' dome at 22.5 inches around. Nobody bothered to state that in any of my previous reading, and as people's opinion of their head size can be a little subjective I thought that would be helpful. I will say at first it can feel a bit foreign, but after wearing them for 2-3 hours today on the maiden voyage I must say they were quite comfortable. The pads only felt the slightest bit stiff initially, but still provided great isolation. As they are brand new, that's as stiff as they'll ever be, so I'm going to go ahead and say no issues there.

A note on the wings: There is a way to disassemble the wing mechanism, remove the spring and lengthen it to add more pressure if desired. While I feel no need to do so at this time, it is quite easy. I copied and pasted instructions form a head-fi review, but don't feel right posting it here without being able to give the right person credit. PM me for the instructions if that interests you.


Build quality: No complaints here, some have complained that a $250 pair of headphones shouldn't have as much plastic, but as far as I'm concerned the metal's in all the right places, and they do seem quite well made. They're light enough to be comfortable but heavy enough to maintain a solid structure and premium feel. The nylon (I think) wrapped cord keeps it from getting tangled or caught on your skin, and is a very nice touch. It's plenty long, 3 meters I believe.


Sound: I wouldn't consider myself an Audiophile any more that I would consider myself a wine snob. While I have a deep appreciation for both sound and wine, I wouldn't call any headphones (in this price range) objectively inferior to any other for everyone, it's all a matter of what you're after and what does it for you. I'm also aware most people break in their headphones before thinking they can truly comment on the quality of sound. If there's interest, I'll update this post with my findings regarding a break-in period and how/if the sound changes for me. 
With all that out of the way, I can only say I'm blown away by these. So far I've only heard them plugged straight into my phone, and into my computer (built in sound of an Asus motherboard). With a 42 ohm impedance, both devices were able to adequately power my new friends, though I do intend to buy a headphone amp in the future for my home theater setup (suggestions are welcome, I'm still researching those). I spend most of my time with these at my computer, and that is the basis for the following. I found the sound to be wonderfully balanced, so much so that I had the equalizer pulled up on my computer expecting to play around, but after twenty minutes I still couldn't bring myself to move anything and just left it flat. As you may have read elsewhere, these are not 'basshead' headphones. By this I mean they will not feel like you have a couple of 12"" Kickers strapped to your noggin, but in no way is the bass from these underrepresented. The warm, controlled bass doesn't pound the ear but rather fills your mind. I'm not high I swear, that's just the best way I can think to put it. The mids were the most detailed I'd ever experienced, and that's what sold me on these over the AKG K550's, which I was also considering and had a chance to try. It's just a whole new level of clarity. The highs were a bit sharp for the first hour or two, but settled down quite nicely. I even revisited some of the songs I first listened to and didn't find them harsh at all, so maybe there is something to a break in period.


That's all I have for now, I've never reviewed anything really, but after all the input from others I've read while making my decision I figured I'd give a little back and share my thoughts on this wonderful device on my head.

After lots of research, I was able to try a range of headphones at B&amp;H in NYC. I found the AKG K550 to be anemic in the low bass area, Grado SR80i and 325 to be excellent but, unfortunately, open-back, the Custom One Pro to have ""artificial"" sounding bass at all settings, the list goes on. They only had the 250-ohm version of the DT770 available for testing, and the V-Moda M100 wasn't available in the store yet. **To my surprise, the ATH-M50 sounded best.** 

I also found that my iPhone wasn't really powering even the M50s, so i  picked up an E17 amp (note, I was also thinking about getting a cheap CMOY, but the E17 will work nicely as an remote DAC/amp with my PC).

So, can anyone give me some guidance on how I should use the E17?

* EQ off on the iPhone, right?
* I'm using the iPhone's headphone jack for now (no LOD) - what volume should the iPhone be at?
* 6 or 12dB gain?

1349616575.0,23,self.headphones,11346m,Audiotechnica M50: First Impressions,34,11,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/11346m/audiotechnica_m50_first_impressions/,"I bought mine on amazon, which usually has the lowest prices and best reliability, they were $160 after everything. I received the package a few days later only to find out they were available in white and also in silver, I was too excited to care really, as black looks good for any occasion. The box was standard, firm with a plastic cover on the front to view what was inside. The headphones were recessed in a plastic sleeve inside the box itself in the position recommended for wearing in one side of the head (DJ style). I opened the box and removed the set slowly, it was a good weight, maybe a little less than a pound disregarding the cable. I chose for the compact spiral cord style but it's also available in straight unbraided. I believe the cords are the same length, but the spiral style can only stretch a foot less then a straight cable, as it risks ruining the cord. I laughed to myself as I encountered something I thought I might, which was trying to reset the headphones to a wearable configuration as they're highly maneuverable to use any way you'd like, I overcame this little hiccup with no distress. 

Something you should prepare for in your first few usages is the new smell, which is that of ink, most likely from the cables dye. This doesn't seem like a big problem but it almost was, as it's strong enough to be nearly noxious in a small area that isn't well ventilated. After several uses though, it was aired out enough and remedied. 

Putting them on was a welcomed experience, they clung to my head like a newborn to its mother; it was a great relief that they felt so good on my noggin, I have a rather large head and finding headphones it like looking for four leaf clovers, the scariest part was now over. The default 3.5mm connector is the most sturdy part of the ensemble, a classy industrial looking peice that connects to almost any outlet with no hassle, except of course an iPhone with a case, no problem with my handy dandy extender cable. The 1/4"" connector is included with a simple screw on design that makes it both semipermanent, for those who use only that connection type, and quickly removable.  A great feature that I found admirable was a spring on the base of the plug that relieves stress on the cable; I really take my hat off to Audiotechnica for this, since it really goes to show how much time and effort went into the design and outlook on long term usage. As for the spring, it really shouldn't be tampered with as it can come loose without too much effort, it can be reset easily but it quickly becomes annoying. I should also mention that the cable is not interchangeable, it's permanently connected to the left cup; the 1/4"" thickness of the cable is reassuring in that it will last the entire lifetime of the headphones. 

No headphone is perfect, but these are perfect for the intermediate headphone enthusiast. They seemed large until I put them on, then I realized they were just right; for carrying, the cups fold up toward the headband to make them about the size of a nerf football. The carrying case is a joke, just a cheap pleather case that literally must have cost them nothing to produce, it's blatantly obvious Audiotechnica included it only as a loyalty to standards. The cups are big, but not overwhelmingly so, just enough to give your ears enough room inside. The ear pads are made of a synthetic material, I've seen them beat up before on an old pair with no sign of cracking or peeling, which is more than I can say about my old Bose Triports; they will show their age though, personally I feel breaking them in makes them more comfortable. Your entire ear should be engulfed in either side, with the full surface of each padding resting against your head, this even distribution of pressure makes them seem almost unnoticeable. If you have a large than normal head, they will clamp tight and will get uncomfortable after awhile; again, breaking them in fixes most of these problems and clamping force can be reduced by placing them on a shoe box the first few nights while you play pink static on high volume. After burning them in, I noticed the bass loosening up I bit to what it is now, of course whether that's in my head is up for debate.
The head band has just enough padding, like that of a wrestling mat, and rests on the top part of your skull more welcome than the elaborate cut-out cushions that some makers try to stick on there. The cups flip to every possible direction, and like I stated earlier, can be fashioned for wearability with only one ear covered. 

My first song was Clock Catcher by Flying Lotus on his album Cosmogramma, which is a fast paced experimental jazz with precise beats and a good amount of bass. I put the volume to about 40% and hit play, as I listened to a song I had heard many times before, I couldn't stop myself from grinning. I had never heard all parts of a song come together as they did from the m50's, so well balanced and all encompassing, I understood at that moment what studio headphones were.
I don't want to sound like an idiot from the masses who buy Dre Beats because it's the first time they've heard bass from a headphone. The bass from these are deep and resonating, though a little loose, which makes for a more personal sound if that doesn't come off as too weird. The responsiveness is not lightning fast but I could find no slugishness when listening to quick acid jazz like Aphex Twin. The quality from these are a perfect balance of the price, I can't think of anything I would rather spend $160 on, with no hyperbole I feel it to be one of the most satisfying purchases I've made on anything. The mid ranges, such as vocals, have a unique effect of sounding further away from the rest of what you're listening to. I was a bit thrown off by this and didn't know what to think, but after wearing them for awhile I found it useful as it let me focus more easily on either characteristic of music. One of the only things I didn't find likable were the medium highs, which can sound tinny and somewhat piercing at times; don't let that aspect cause you to lose hope though as every other quality of these cans outshine it. The worst part of picking out headphones, for me at least, is the comfort factor; I cannot enjoy the sound coming from a headset if I can't enjoy the feeling of the set themselves, needless to say, comfort is paramount. I've tried the Sennheiser 598's, which I heard were very much wearable, needless to say I was very displeased with them, reasons which I stated in my review; a testament to how picky I am, furthermore I had never worn studio cans before but were intrigued by the build. This set is rock solid, a bit of plastic, a bit of metal, no cut corners and they breathe confidence when they're on display; I imagine they could be dropped from a second floor window and still be golden, but I won't use mine for the test.

If you haven't heard studio headphones before, you may not even like them at first, it can be described as an almost fake sound because it's designed for a flat frequency response; other headphone makers like to assign their own sound signature by accentuating ""warm"" sounds to make whatever you're listening to more pleasing to the ears. Buying these headphones are like buying a well designed engine, with one purpose, pure performance. They have an impedance of around 40 ohms, so they can easily perform to their maximum capabilities on a mobile phone. It was disconcerting how loud these were on my iPhones maximum volume, they could easily blow your ear drums or permanently damage your hearing with short use, which is why I always have my volume limit set. The isolation is at about -9db which is satisfactory, the ear pads create a solid seal and listening to anything at all makes regular ambient noise disappear.
If you are still getting used to high quality cans and don't feel like spending hundreds of dollars on HD 600's or Denon 5000's, do yourself a favor and grab these today. At the time of this posting, you can find them in the low $100 range. Whether they are your only set, backups, for travel; they are an essential stepping stone for anyone serious about sound and having them will only improve your life.

1376416612.0,21,self.headphones,1kainf,VModa M100 and Sennheiser Momentum Comparison,29,8,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1kainf/vmoda_m100_and_sennheiser_momentum_comparison/,"Disclaimer: Things will be spelled wrong, grammar will be used incorrectly, and silly terms like rumbly are going to be utilized as if they mean something. 

So I recently acquired a pair of VModa M100s to compliment my Sennheiser Momentums. I believe these headphones are two of the primary competitors when people look at purchasing over-ear headphones in the $300 range so I hope this comparison will be useful. I've had the oppurtunity to listen to the Momentums for hundreds of hours as they've been my primary travelling headphones for the past six months, the M100s I have about 100 hours in on.

**Sound**

Both headphones sound good, however, the Momentums have a definitively better overall sound. The Momentums have a warm sound, the treble is relaxing and the bass is prominent in a punchy sort of way. As far as isolation goes the Momentums seem spectacular. I work in a library and our third floor is the designated quiet area. I've spent quite a bit of time up there and no one has said anything. Conversely, I spend a lot of time riding public buses with drunk college kids and my iPhone easily powers the Momentums to levels where I can't hear them. My Schiit Modi DAC was a nice improvement on the sound of the Momentums, adding a bit of improved clarity to the mids without negatively affecting the sound signature. Overall the detail on the Momentums seems to me very precise and what ultimately matters is that I really enjoy the signature of the Momentums.

The VModa M100s are not as precise. The treble is relaxing again and the bass is powerful, it's more rumbly and less punchy than the Momentums (I told you those technical terms were coming). As someone who listens to a lot of rap, I really enjoy the M100 bass. Where the M100s lack is the mids. The mids sound congested and snuffly compared to the Momentums. The isolation on the M100s is not as good as the Momentums, I can clearly hear the music from the cans when the volume is around mid to high; however, the M100s get louder than the Momentums and from a listener perspective I still can't hear shit going on around me. One thing I really disliked about the M100s was that plugged into my Modi the bass was terrible. The mids were greatly improved, but the bass went from powerful to disappointing, but this might just be something I need to play around with in my computer settings. Overall the M100s are a fun pair of cans, especially if you enjoy hip-hop.

**Appearance**

Both pairs of cans look spectacular in their own way. The Momentums look very refined and classy. The leather is beautiful and the steel headband adds to the refined look. I originally purchased the Momentums over the M100s almost entirely based on the appearance.

As for the M100s, I originally thought they looked kind of cheesy in the images I saw online, in person however they look good. More of a street look than the Momentums, but still something I'm not ashamed to wear around town. The option for custom shields also adds to the appearance appeal for the M100s.

**Durability** 

The M100s are built like tanks. The images I saw online of them made them look slightly flimsy and worried me. In person they're quite durable. The best way I have of putting it is that I'm not afraid to shove them in my backpack. The M100s squish into a neat little package that easily fits into small spaces. Finally, the cord that comes with the M100s is one of the sturdiest feeling cords I have ever seen. 

The Momentums look fragile but after six months with them I can confirm that they are beasts. Again, I regularly shove these cans in my backpack, I've worn them through an Upstate NY winter, in thunderstorms and hail. The only concern I have is that the cable is beginning to chip a little where it connects to my phone and for some reason Sennheiser wants $80 for a replacement three-button cable (although I can't find the replacement site now). The other problem with the Momentums is that they don't compact at all like the M100s, as a result, they take up almost twice as much storage space. 

**Comfort (holy shit, I forgot comfort, that's how comfortable these both are for me)**

Comfort on both cans is something I see people complain about frequently; however, I find comfort is not an issue with either pair of headphones. These headphones lead me to the realization that I have small ears. Surprisingly the M100s were more comfortable for me long term (3+ hours), surprising because the leather on the Momentums feels heavenly at first, but after a few hours my ears just prefer the M100s. Comfort in headphones is always really subjective, for these cans it seems to come down to whether or not the cans rest on your ears, or over them. If the headphones fit over your ears I don't think comfort is going to be in issue, if they end up on your ears I could see it being a massive problem. The good news is that Sennheiser just realized a pair of Momentums targetted as on-ear, and VModa is looking to release their XL pads, which look amazing, soon! 

**Overall**

I really enjoy both headphones. If I had to recommend one pair I would recommend the M100s for anyone who listens to primarily rap, and the Momentums to anyone who listens to more instrumental types of music. 

Equipment:
Roughly half the listening was done between my iPhone 4s and whatever God awful sound card my computer motherboard has (the motherboard is a GIGABYTE GA-Z77X-UD5H I believe). I did test the Schiit Modi for a bit on both cans, but for the purposes of this review it was just straight out the sources. 

Highlights: 

M100s: Run the Jewels

Momentums: Daft Punk Random Access Memories

If you have any specific questions or feel I left out something big (which is entirely possible) let me know.

2. The DT770s are $150, which I believe is relatively cheap.. but they are from eBay, and refurbished with a warranty. The M50s are from sound professionals for around $130 with the removable cable mod. Is the removable cable mod really worth it or would it be better to get the M50s for $100 compared to the DT770s?

1371531192.0,23,self.headphones,1gkfaq,Review of Bottlehead Crack (for wiki),26,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1gkfaq/review_of_bottlehead_crack_for_wiki/,"This post is just for the wiki. I just noticed a 'reviews' section and figured I would write what I know about the two amplifiers I own, the [Bottlehead Crack](http://www.bottlehead.com/store.php/products/crack-otl-headphone-amplifier-kit) and the [JDS Labs Objective2](http://www.jdslabs.com/item.php?fetchitem=O2Full). This review includes information about the Bottlehead Crack amplifier.

This review will include impressions with the Sennheiser HD 650.

I will offer my impressions of the speedball upgrade kid, upgraded potentiometer, upgraded tubes (both input and power tubes), and other miscellaneous upgrades.

**Information**

The [Bottlehead Crack](http://www.bottlehead.com/store.php/products/crack-otl-headphone-amplifier-kit) is a pure tube amplifier created and sold by Bottlehead Corporation. It has no solid state in the signal amplification path. The Crack is a relatively inexpensive pure tube amplifier, as it does not have an output transformer. This makes the Crack output transformerless (OTL) and thus it has a high output impedance. Because of this, it is best paired with headphones with high impedance (technically higher than ~120ohms, but most recommend over 300ohms). It is a notoriously good pairing with Sennheiser's higher-end headphones, most notably the HD 650 and HD 800.

You must build the Bottlehead Crack - it is only available as a DIY project (with the exception of Ebay). It is, however, *very* easy to construct. Bottlehead provides excellent instructions as a PDF on a disk that take you through the process step-by-step with good visuals and a consistent and understandable number scheme. Things you will need in order to build the Crack include:

* Soldering iron
* Solder (recommend a eutectic solder)
* Multimeter 
* Phillips-head screwdrivers (small ones, mostly)

Everything else required to build the Crack is included in the kit. The kit comes with alder wood sides, which are unfinished. You can stain them with any oil-based wood stain. The top plate is circularly-brushed aluminum, and can be painted/powdercoated to your liking, or left as-is. You can also create your own custom housing for the amplifier.

The folks over at Bottlehead are very nice and responsive to email and phone. Note that the Crack is from a small company and can take some time to ship. Mine took approximately 4 weeks. This could change as the Crack becomes more and more popular.

The Crack can also be ordered with the [Speedball constant current kit](http://www.bottlehead.com/store.php/products/speedball-upgrade-for-crack-amplifier). The speedball is a great upgrade for the input tube, as it enhances sound quality and allows for a whole new spectrum of input tubes to be put into the Crack.

**Build Impressions**

Like I have mentioned, the Crack is pretty easy to build. It took me about 10 hours, mostly because I was being very cautious, as I had never soldered before. It was a lot of fun and definitely worth the time.

The Crack base is as well-built as you make it. I wood glued the base together overnight with angle clamps to ensure proper angle and compression. I suggest placing the top plate onto its groove before letting the glue dry to ensure proper fit.

The construction itself is very rugged. The parts are held into the top plate via machine screws and nuts. Just attach them firmly and you'll be fine.

The nice thing about the Crack is it is mostly point-to-point soldering (with the exception of the speedball upgrade), so repair is very easy if something were to happen.

**Sound Impressions**

The Crack certainly has the typical tube amp sound. It brings forward thick, full mids and rolled-off highs. The bass is rich and powerful. I'll go through lows, mids, and highs.

*Lows*
The lows change a lot depending on the tube configuration you have. But I'll describe the stock tubes. The bass is weightier with the stock 6080A than a solid state amp. It sounds fuller, richer, and darker. It is both crisp and smooth at the same time. It is not as punchy as the O2, however.

*Mids*
The mids really stand out with this amplifier. Everything is thick, beautiful, juicy, and melodic. Midbass is a little pronounced, giving the music a deep and involving feel. This actually reminded me a little of the ATH-M50s. Depending on the tube you put in, the mids can be resounding, sort of like being in a concert hall. Male voices sound deep and melodic, and female voices sound smooth and soothing. You definitely lose some crispness and cleanness as a tradeoff for the musicality in comparison to solid state.

*Highs*
Tube amps roll off highs. Cymbals change from a ""cschh"" to a ""schh,"" adding a lushness to the sound. This is where you will notice a really laid-back feel. You definitely lose crispness here and end up with a much softer, squishier, more comfortable and non-fatiguing sound. It's great for things like soft rock and more laid-back music, but for cymbal-heavy metal you may find it lacking. Once again, you can alter this with tube composition. I personally like my highs a little crisper than the stock tube configuration, as I listen to a lot of progressive metal.

**Tubes**
So the best thing about tube amps is... tubes! You can replace two tubes in the Crack - the input tube (stock is 12AU7A), which is toward the front of the amp, and the larger power tube (6080A) located toward the back. Both tubes affect the sound, though most people would say the input tube affects it more so.

Tubes can be sort of thought of as little equalizers that do more than boost frequencies. They may very well increase bass, but they also change the clarity, instrument separation, soundstage, impact, airiness, and musicality of the music. So it's a supercharged equalizer that has the ability to make music sound completely different - hence people describing tube amps as ""colored.""

For input tubes on the stock amp (without speedball), you can replace (or ""roll"") the tubes with:

* 12AU7
* ECC82 / E82CC
* ECC802
* 7316 / CV4003
* Others, but the above are most common

With the speedball's double heater current, you can add in an E80CC or 12BH7, as well.

For the driver tubes, you can replace them with:

* 5998 (most common)
* 6AS7G
* 6N13
* 6H13C
* 7236

Different tubes provide substantially different characteristics to sound. I will highlight those that I've owned:

* 12AU7A - stock driver tube. It's a good tube; it has punchy mids and mid-bass with average treble. It's pretty standard and nothing special.
* 12BH7A - ""Upgraded"" 12AU7. It sounds richer, fuller, with more pronounced mids. Highs are fairly unremarkable, but bass is a little bit more forward than a 12AU7.
* E82CC - I accidentally bought a Telefunken E82CC (won an auction with a ridiculously low bid, like 1/3 average cost and it was new in box), and it sounds amazing. This tube costs quite a bit ($85 new old stock, NOS), but it really brings the mids forward. It also adds a lot of instrument separation and much increased musicality. Treble is crisper than a 12AU7, and bass it a little punchier. Overall, this tube is much more musical than the others and is notorious for being so.
* 6080A - Stock power tube. It's pretty plain, but has nice, punchy midbass. A relatively crisp-sounding tube.
* 6AS7G - An upgrade over the stock tube. It brings out the mids a lot, and makes them pretty resounding and really fluid. Notes seem to hang in the air longer with this tube than the others. Bass impact is reduced relative to stock tubes and is less punchy. This is a much smoother and more liquid tube than a 6080.
* 6080wb - I got 2 Bendix 6080wb tubes with slotted plates recently. It's a pretty rare and expensive tube, but it is undeniably better than the 6080A or 6AS7G. Bass became thunderous when needed and extremely punchy and clear. Mids are very nice, forward, and separated with a great midbass punch. Guitars sound excellent. Treble is a little less rolled off than the normal 6080 and much less rolled off than the 6AS7G, so cymbals are a little more lifelike and crisper. Overall, a *great* tube for rock.

The great thing about the Crack is that you can tailor the sound to your preference. Like heavy lows? Grab a 6080wb. Like relaxed mids? Grab a 5998. Like soft and fluid musicality? Grab a 6AS7G.

**Speedball upgrade kit**

The [speedball](http://www.bottlehead.com/store.php/products/speedball-upgrade-for-crack-amplifier) constant current upgrade kit is an excellent upgrade for the Crack. It made an **enormous** difference in the sound of the amp. Everything was more musical, fluid, forward, and involving. The background was darker and the foreground was cleaner and clearer. It also gives you the ability to add a greater variety of input tubes into the Crack. Another thing to know is that tube rolling is more pronounced when you have a speedball kit in your Crack. That is to say that each tube will sound more characteristic with a speedball.

I *highly* recommend purchasing a speedball kit with your Crack, or at least soon after. It makes a bigger difference than any other upgrade in this amp. In my experience, the sound difference was greater between the base Crack and Crack with speedball than the difference between the O2 and base Crack. It really was remarkable.

**Summary**

The Bottlehead Crack is a DIY amplifier that gives you a great ""tube sound."" It rolls of highs, making them more lush and softer. Its mids are very forward and fluid, giving a rich, full nature to your music. Lows are weighty and plentiful, though the stock tubes may not be as punchy as a solid state amplifier. Compared to a solid state, music is more involving and simply more musical, whereas solid state is more analytical and dry (dare I say boring!). The two tubes can be swapped (so-called ""tube rolling"") for other tubes that can drastically affect the sound of music, making the amp colored. That being said, you can increase what you like to hear in music and decrease what you don't.

1369343120.0,20,self.headphones,1exfgd,A survey: High-res vs lossy (from legal sources). Can you hear the difference? (X-post from /r/audiophile),25,5,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1exfgd/a_survey_highres_vs_lossy_from_legal_sources_can/,"**Edit:** Survey is now closed - I will post results soon in a new thread, and comment on some flaws in the test.  Also, expect the test to be rerun soon with new test files (and more choices)

**Edit 2:** [Results here](http://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/1eyono/survey_results_highres_vs_lossless/)

Well, the question here is, when I don't have the constraint of keeping the topic readable:

Can you hear the difference between a 24/88.2 ""Studio master"" lossless edition of a song, and the 44.1 KHz ""Mastered for iTunes"" lossy (256 kbps) AAC version of the same song?

This is something I said I would do in the [thread about the HDTracks version of ""Random Access Memories""](http://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/1et48i/daft_punks_ram_from_hd_tracks_2488_version/).  Note that it took me some time from when I first decided that I wanted to test, until it was ready, because I wanted to keep the test within legal limits - in other words, I had to search for a candidate clip of about 30 seconds, and I also wanted to find the right candidate, which took about 50 complete listens of the album.

I've prepared two clips of the intro to ""Lose Yourself to Dance"":

1. One from the [high-res version you can buy on HDTracks or Qobuz](http://www.discogs.com/Daft-Punk-Random-Access-Memories-%C3%89dition-Studio-Masters/release/4581717). This file is originally in 24/88 format, and the only thing that has been done to it is to cut it to length and saved as WAV.
2. … and one from the Mastered for iTunes version, converted to WAV, and very carefully upsampled to 88.2 kHz so file size and sample rate matches.

I've then prepared a Google survey that basically seeks the answer to one question: ""Which clip do you prefer, A or B?"". It asks you a couple of extra questions about your system, and what equipment you primarily used for listening to the test clips, and your system settings. Note that you should only fill in the survey once.

* [Google survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BVXFR4FLdKw8KpB6vPu2g5c5dcxfK8nwTpCsNt7GWQM/viewform)
* [Test files](http://www.mediafire.com/download/i15jzh46pza5nip/lossy-vs-lossless.zip) (25.5 MB zip) - [Mirror 1](http://media.veven.org/2013/05/lossy-vs-lossless.zip)


I'll keep the survey open until I have a reasonable number of responses, and will publish the data shortly after that (I'll quite probably publish the raw data, so people with a background in statistics can analyze them).      Please participate - since this is only two short clips, and merely asking you to subjectively tell which clip you prefer - it could take as little as five minutes, or as much time as you personally like to spend on it.

Both different pitches to make matters worse.  I was really hoping someone could point me in the right direction for headphones that could handle this type of music.  I love noise cancellation headphones because I dont have to turn the volume up as high. I obviously don't want to cause more damage to my ears in my attempt to sooth them.

I am hearing impaired as the result of multiple tympanostomy tube surgeries leaving my eardrums perforated and scarred unable to heal closed. I love listening to music, but my hearing makes it difficult to enjoy when headphones can not put out enough volume (I wear hearing aids in my daily life although I can still manage without them). So today I am seeking some general advice from you.
I have up to this point been using Studio Beats by Dr. Dre (simply because they are loud and bass-boosted), but I am seeking something with a bit more quality that my weak hearing can still enjoy.

These are my listening preferences: Loud, bass heavy - a punchy bass not rumbling (DNB), crisp sound quality, comfortable for extended periods, overear, also I would like the headphones to be closed so as to give a close to ear effect. I listen to a lot of prog rock such as Tool, Porcupine Tree, and Karnivool just to give an example of what kind of ranges I listen to most frequently.

I would truly appreciate your input here at /r/headphones as to what you think might work best for me. I don't really have a price limit per say, but I would like it best to keep the purchase under $150.

I've also demoed lots of other headphones at length (borrowed from friends and demo at stores and head-fi meetups) but there are so many that I can't remember them all. If you ask about any headphone then chances are I would have at least heard them briefly. I used to travel to Shanghai and Singapore frequently and spend lots of time at the headphone shops just to demo headphones.

Notable headphones I've heard at length include: Audeze LCD3, Hifiman HE-6, Hifiman HE-500, Hifiman HE-400, Stax SR-007 MK2, Sennheiser HD600, Sennheiser HD650, Sennheiser HD598, Sennheiser Momentum, Sennheiser Amperior, Sennheiser HD 25-1-ii, etc...

**When and how I got into the headphone hobby:**

I started caring about sound quality about 3 years ago when I was a high school student. The first expensive headphone I heard was a Monster Beats by Dre in an Apple Store. I was blown away by what I thought was amazing sound quality. I began to research headphones then bought my first headphones, Audio-Technica ATH-M50s. I held on to that until I got into university. Then I got a fairly good paying research assistant job which allowed me to buy lots of headphones.

Early in my headphone career, I picked up the Monoprices and used them as a portable headphone to throw in my backpack and such. I've recently returned to the [Monoprice 8323](http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=108&amp;cp_id=10823&amp;cs_id=1082302&amp;p_id=8323&amp;seq=1&amp;format=2) armed with cotton, plasticine, tape, and acoustic foam to see what I could do about these headphones. 

**Introduction**

The Monoprice 8323 are a $20-30 headphone that is often suggested as one of the best headphones in its price range. It is possibly the only sub-$30 headphone with a removable cable.

**Setup**

ODAC -&gt; O2 -&gt; Monoprice 8323.

Very overkill for the headphone, but I might as well see these guys at their highest potential.

**Build Quality and Comfort**

These are not an exceptionally comfortable headphone at stock. My ears almost seem to press against the plastic of the baffle. It's mildly annoying for small periods of time, but uncomfortable for long periods of time.

Although I commend Monoprice for having a removable cable at this price range, no one I have personally suggested it to has had to replace their cable. Of the two people that I know personally that have owned it, they both broke the plastic on it. One of them had a rather large head and eventually snapped the headband right now the middle, the other broke his after it tumbled off his table and he was left with only one ear piece connected. I have accidentally broken a cable on my 8323 while on the go when it got caught on a chair, however, so I will attest that it is a great feature.

Despite this, though, they are probably one of the most solidly made $20-30 headphones. 

**Review**

Stock, I've never really liked the sound of the Monoprice 8323. I've always felt that something was -off- about the treble. Their upper-treble almost seemed emphasized, because there was sibilance in songs which I didn't hear with other headphones. 

The mids on the 8323 were rather forward. They were not quite as forward as the HTF600 or the Koss Pro DJ 100s, but they were more forward compared to my other headphones. If you're a fan of forward mids, it's a solid pick here. The high mids seemed underemphasized, making the vocals seem almost dulled around the edges. 

The sub-bass was rather significantly rolled off, but present. The mid-bass made itself rather known, but it was of the more ""thumpy"" style bass, rather than the leaner punchy bass.

This overall balance with the thumpy bass and the odd lower-treble made the sound very thick. Instrument separation was difficult because of the very thick sound. 

The soundstage was nothing to write home about. It wasn't exceptionally poor, but it wasn't anything great. 

**Mods Tried**

**Cotton behind the driver (1 and 2 layer)**

This emphasized the upper-treble even more. The treble was unbearable in songs like Queen's Old Fashioned Lover Boy. 

**Electrical tape over vents**

After taping up the vents, the upper-treble receded a bit. It didn't solve the lower high-mid issues, but the sibilance issues disappeared.

**Electrical tape over entire baffle**

The sibilance issues returned. It seems that if you're taping to try and reduce resonances, use caution.

**Silverstone Acoustic Foam behind driver**

This seemed to have cleaned up the sound a bit. The upper-treble was emphasized even more, causing sibilance issues, but it wasn't as bad as the cotton mod. The high-mid issues were still there, but less apparent.

**Brainwav HM5 pads**

These pads fit nicely onto the headphone without any tape or O-ring modding. The comfort was significantly better, but the high-mid issues seemed even more apparent. I think the pads sucked even more of it out. The thumping bass was reduced -- I think the pads reduced the bass overall.

I also attempted the HM5 pads with the cotton, and the issues with the cotton by itself were still apparent.

I also attempted the HM5s with the cotton and the tape mod. The sibilance issue wasn't as bad, but it was still not good.

**Acoustic foam + electrical tape over vents**

With stock pads, the upper-treble sibilance seemed to get balanced out. For the most part, we have the benefits of both of the previous mods, but it doesn't solve the bass issues or the high-mid issues.

With the HM5s, there was still enough upper-treble emphasis to really annoy me with the sibilance. 

In the end, I ended up using stock pads + acoustic foam + electrical tape over vents. It didn't solve all of the fundamental issues I had with the sound of the headphone, but the upper-treble was handled and the sound was a bit clearer.

**Conclusion** 

I still am a firm believer even after modding that the 8323 is not the best sounding headphone for the money. I'd go with the Brainwavz HM3 (AKA Incipio Forte F38), Koss KSC75, Panasonic HTF600, and JVC HA-S400B all over the Monoprice 8323 for fidelity. That said, they aren't WORLDS behind, but I think the high-mids issue is enough to knock it down below them. 

There is a definite issue with the the high-mids in my opinion -- a quick EQ to add 7-8dB to around 3.3khz relative to the rest of the spectrum really evens out the sound for me. I also prefer a leaner bass than the 8323's bass, but that's just opinion in terms of bass response.

I do believe that they are more balanced than the other budget headphones, though. If you can drop a big bump to the 3khz-4khz region, the sound is about as neutral as you're going to find in this price bracket. 

Overall, I believe that the 8323 has a place in the budget brackets, but I think that spot is of a portable headphone with a very easy to replace cable. It's a great, cheap headphone that you can toss into a bag and take out on the go without feeling too bad about potentially breaking it.

**-Source:** I plan on getting an amp at some point when my budget allows it (within the year), but for now it will be my Keyboard (Roland Fantom G8) and laptop (games, movies etc). I typically only play for myself (no professional work) on my keyboard; I just happen to have a friend who works for Roland and got me a serious discount.  I also have a set of electronic bagpipes and would love to use good headphones on them as well.

**-Isolation:** Not a requirement - this will be in home use only - I have a pair of crap IEMs for the gym and travel

**-Preferred Type:** Full size/Over the ear are the most comfortable

**-Tonal Balance:** I am definitely a basshead when it comes to the type of music I enjoy listening to the most, but I also play a lot of music, most of which is classical. I'm thinking more balanced here but I'm not sure.

**-Past Headphones:** AKG K 26 P. I bought them because my roommate had them and I loved the bass. I bought a pair of my own and loved them until the headband broke. I fixed them several times until the copper broke at several places in the line as well and I gave up. I liked the heaphones overall, but boy did they hurt my head over a long listening session. Since then I have just stuck with 15-20 USD IEMs because I travel a lot, and before this last year or so played mostly on my acoustic piano.

**-Preferred Music:** I listen to pretty much everything except for modern country - eg Mozart, Johnny Cash, Nina Simone, The Beetles, Muse, Streetlight Manifesto, Britney Spears, Carnage, Flux Pavillion, The Hush Sound, Movie/Game OSTs. Again though, these headphones are not so much for listening to music as they are for playing it and occasionally watching movies/playing games if I don't want to bother the neighbors at 3 am with my sound system.

I've done some browsing  and really like the Sennheiser HD 600, HD 650, and the HiFiMan HE 400. I was leaning towards the HE 400 or the HD 650, but they are at the maximum of my price limit.  I would feel a little buyer's remorse going that high, but music/sound is important to me so I can rationalize the cost.

If there are any other suggestions/advice/comments I would love to hear them before I take the plunge.

* IEMs don't tend to stay in my ears well. I have never had a pair that I could keep in.  
* I need headphones that can travel and be outdoors. I listen to my music primarily at the gym, walking around campus, and working outdoors with lawn equipment.  
* I would prefer headphones that don't leak a lot of sound. I get really annoyed by people sitting in a class or the gym when I can hear their music as clearly as they can. (Just a personal pet peeve).  
* I'm looking at $150 as about the top of my price range.  
* My music spectrum is pretty broad. I listen to rock, rap, country, some techno, and even some purely instrumental music. I would like to have headphones that can accommodate all of these genres well.

",21,4,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/14703c/embarrassed_by_my_headset_razer_megalodons_want/,"OK a bit of background first.This is asking for advice for HEADSETS and HEADPHONES and SOUNDCARDS, just want to make that clear.

I'm a heavy PC Gamer and also a games journalist. I've been mildly content with my Razer Megalodons for about 6 months now until I realised that I was *putting* up with them because it was the easy thing to do. I'll admit the whole ""7.1 surround sound and external sound card"" reeled me in, but that was before I did and real research. 

Now I want rid of them, finally having some money to spend. After looking on the internet for a few days now I'm pretty overwhelmed with the choice that is available.

**Budget**

I wouldn't like to spend any more than £250 on a headset/headphone, although I'm open to suggestions. Just remember that I'm planning to buy a sound card as well to make sure I'm getting the most out of them.

That being said, I'm looking to spent no more than £150 on a sound card purposely for headsets/headphones.

**Usage**

I'm a PC Gamer, it's kind of my job. I play pretty much every genre out there but I feel these Razer Megalodons are just, weak. They are currently open, which has an annoying tendency to spill sound out and onto my microphone while playing. I think I'd rather go for immersion above anything else, so maybe a closed design would suit me? 

Also because I play games, skype, interview etc, A decent mic is a must. This is why I have included Headsets in this post, primarily because they seem the most suited. However, I have heard that they are limited to what Headphones can achieve. If it's something I'm missing out on I want to know, I don't mind venturing into it and buying say an external mic like a Blue Yeti or Snowball.

I have rarely used the visualised 7.1 surround sound the Megalodons offer, mainly because so few game support it, but also because if you're talking with someone they sound horrible. I've been told Dolby Headphones do a better job at it, so maybe keeping it as an option would be nice. But I would love a great sense of positional audio for games such as FPS's and mainly Horror games. 

**What do you listen to?**

Everything, and I mean it. If I had to choose any sort of music it would be Rock e.g. Queen etc. But my library is incredibly varied so I wouldn't like to say I only listen to a single type of genre. 

**Current findings**

I'll show you what I've been looking at before I sought help here:

I've been perusing a number of different web locales dedicated to quality headphones, including this one, and recently decided to make a well-guided purchase of the Sennheiser HD 25-1 II's, as I'm sure many of you are familiar with. 

Although these are a relatively humble pair of cans from what I've seen, they are easily the best headphones I've ever owned or even used. All my life I've heard my music through my blown out car speakers, Ipod ear-buds, and tinny laptop speakers. I dismissed the misgivings of the few audiophiles I ran into, thinking I heard my music just fine, that I didn't need to spend hundreds of dollars on equipment that would somehow improve the quality of my listening experience.

As the title suggests, when I unboxed these puppies, slid them onto my cranium, and played Radiohead's ""Paranoid Android"", I was *blown the fuck away.* I heard Thom Yorke like I've never heard him, he was so fucking raw and beautiful. I heard noises I've never heard before, and I heard the ones I'm familiar with in a completely different way. I am in the process of re-discovering all of my music, and I am cherishing ever blessed second of it. Every cymbal crash, every lyric, and every guitar riff is so naked and crystalline, I've already started to choke up a few times just re-hearing the songs that I thought I loved just the way they were coming out of ipod earbuds.

So, yeah, I just wanted to say thank you to r/headphones for being a great community that edged me in the right direction. Happy listening!

TL:DR Sennheisers are re-invigorating my life and my balls.

**Budget** - I'd like to spend around $150-200 but I can go up to $250 (and would be willing to for both quality and good design)

**Source** - I'll mostly be using them to listen from a computer (at home/work).

**Requirements for isolation** - Sound isolation is fairly important to me, though I mostly plan to use them at home

**Preferred type of headphone** - Over ear or on ear

**Preferred tonal balance** - I like bass but I also don't want something *too* powerful or thumping. I liked the bass of the Klipsch Image One headphones but after listening to more balanced pairs (like the B&amp;W P3s) it was overwhelming. 

**Past headphones** - I haven't owned an on-ear pair in several years, but I've tried other people's pairs for a few hours of listening. I have mostly used in-ear headphones and in fact do still enjoy my Shure SE215s and Etymotic Hf5s - I just want a better on-ear pair. I don't think I'd have any issues I've read with headphones being too small as I have small ears and a small head

Etymotic Hf5 - Good: noise isolation and overall sound quality (as well as the design and size). Bad: Not good for bass heavy music
Shure SE215 - Good: noise isolation and overall sound quality, bass
Shure SE315 - Really underwhelming. I expected a lot more for the price (and the fact I've liked Shure headphones at other price points) and I'm hoping to avoid another underwhelming pair at this price point

**Preferred Music**: I listen to a wide range of music, but particularly rap, funk, jazz, classical, and indie rock/pop

It takes the digital signals in an mp3 or FLAC file, and converts them to an analog signal. This digital signal is usually very weak, so it is passed to an amplifier which I can then listen to through my headphones.

This is essentially what a sound card is, but buying an external DAC/amp is usually better because the sound card found in a phone or laptop is supposedly not very good.

That's about the extent of my knowledge on DAC/amps, but I still have some questions.

First of all, I appreciate good sound but wouldn't really consider myself an audiophile. I tried testing the difference between a 128 bitrate file and 320 kbps a while ago and could barely hear a difference. If the difference in getting a DAC is about as great as switching from 128 to 320, then I'll have to pass up on buying one.

Second of all, what does it mean when people refer to a ""USB"" DAC? From what I can imagine, you plug a DAC/amp into where you normally plug headphones, and then plug your headphones into the DAC instead. How does a USB port relate to this?

Third, what difference can I expect from buying a DAC or amp separately as opposed to buying a combo DAC/amp?

Lastly, when people refer to a DAC as ""portable"" does that mean I can use it with my smartphone? I have seen DACs that can be used with iphones because of their docks, but what about android phones where we don't have those? Will a micro USB port work?

Going to give a rookie review of the Beyerdynamic DT770 PRO-80s!,21,5,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/onrgd/alright_got_my_first_pair_of_audiophile_quality/,"After receiving a lot of good input from this subreddit I felt it was only fair to give some input in return, so after a few days with the DT770 Pro (80 ohm) I'll try my best to tell you what I think.  Mind you I only have my previous shitty pair of headphones to compare them to, so it might sound like a more generous review than you're expecting (or spot on). I'll try and review a number of different areas which concerned me before making my purchase.

**1) Style/Looks

These headphones are massive, I look like I'm ready to go direct Airliner traffic at the nearest Airport!  However that's not a bad thing as I wasn't too concerned with style and was actually hoping to get a larger set of headphones that fully enveloped my head.  However they do carry their own certain charm look pretty badass in their own right; nothing looks cheaply constructed and they even externalized the wires that normally would go through the headband so you won't be forced to destroy your set if the wires get tangled.  The soft velvety material providing padding to the ears contrasts nicely with the blacks of the headphones.

**2) Comfort

This was an important factor for me as I spend a lot of time working and travelling with my headphones on.  My prior set squeezed a lot and would give me a headache after a few hours use so I made sure to do a lot of research and there seemed to be unanimous praise for the DT770's comfort.  Did they live up to the praise? Oh hell yes!  Even though these bitches are huge, they're easily half the weight of my prior Skullcandy's, and the padding feels like a couple pillows around my ears.  So far I've had them on for about 5 hours and I've yet to get fatigued from squeezing.  The padding does, however, have a tendency to make me sweat a bit and this might effect others more or less than me (I generally don't sweat much).

** 3) Build Quality

I was actually quite surprised to find that the headband is constructed of solid metal which makes them look and feel very solid.  The rest of unit are constructed of hard, thick plastic that feels like it would hold up well for quite some time and nothing creaks or twists unnecessarily, keeping everything where it should be.  I am noticing something rattling around in the right ear-piece, it sounds like a tiny plastic ball-bearing that I'm hoping to get out in some way.

** 4) How does it sound?!

This is where I'm going to show my novice stripes as I really don't have much to compare it to.  So far my testing has been limited to a number of different sources on my laptop; these sources have been Spotify (high-quality stream subscriber), Pandora and my personal MP3 collection

Streaming from Spotify is sort of hit and miss... I subscribe to Spotify so I have a high-quality stream, however to really get the full effect I need to have both the Spotify volume and my computer volume at full-volume or else it's too quiet.  This is probably due to the headset being an 80ohm impedance and would probably benefit from a small amp here. However once the volume is at a good level I was blown away by how much different my music collection sounded, I'm hearing instruments and layers I never even knew existed in my music and it's blowing my mind.  The only problem I'm facing is since all my volume meters are at full blast I can't really get much more out of it and it seems some of the sounds are peaking due to being forced through at such a high level.  The effects are even worse on Pandora due to the lower quality stream.

My MP3 collection fared a lot better than Spotify, and I actually had to turn down the volume here.  Most of my songs in my library are between 192kbps and 320kbps and these sound absolutely fantastic.  I was a little worried I'd be overwhelmed with bass from what I was reading online, however the bass sounds more... organic and part of the song rather than drowning out the rest of the music and this really adds to the experience.  I just re-listened to First Snow by Emancipator and sat here with goosebumps at how freaking good it sounded.

It was extremely obvious if I came across any mp3 with a bitrate lower than 160kbps as the headphones allowed me to clearly hear the compression artifacts and muddle missing portions of the song.  This is actually a good thing and allows me to appreciate the quality of these headphones more.

With my MP3 collection I literally feel like I'm surrounded by the music and everything sounds natural and not forced or processed.  And with these headphones enveloping my head so well, nobody around is able to hear my music so I'm not disturbing my co-workers.

So really overall the sound quality is fantastic, better than anything I've heard or knew was possible, so I can only imaging what the top-end flagship models sound like.

I'm a little bummed out about the Spotify stream however I'll probably pick up an E6 or E11 portable amp and hope that gives me a touch more oomph.

** 5) Portability

This was a minor concern of mine, as portability is fairly important (hence why I went with the 80 ohm version).  While they are massive, they do fit nicely in my travel bag without any issue at all... but I knew this really wouldn't be a problem when I purchased them. They're definitely not for any kind of sport but would be great to have for plane rides or long trips on the subway.

** Conclusion

So would I recommend the DT770's? Hell yeah I would, I've already had my co-workers try them on and they were blown away by how good they sound.  They have some minor quirks and flaws that aren't bothersome to me and have a great combination of durability, sound quality and comfort.

I'll try and update after a couple hundred hours of usage and trying it on other devices like my phone or ipod and let you know how they sound... and if I grab an amp I'll be sure to update!

So thanks for listening

UPDATE: I plugged it in to my Droid Charge (w/ voodoo sound) and fired up Spotify and it sounds night and day better than on my laptop.

What do you like about yours?  I'd prefer more personal answers than the generic, ""it's warmer"" and ""laid back"" posts but post what you can.  It looks pretty, too.

Some more discussion points: 

What do you think is the price point when tube amps start to shine, as I hear lower end tube amps just don't sound very good?

How big of a difference do the different tubes make?  How often do you replace yours and does it depend on the type/model of the tube or the amp it's plugged into?

Heat?  I have a class A amp, it's stupidly hot.  



EDIT:
Another question!  What is the effect of mixing tubes?  I'm assuming it depends on the design of the amp, but does each channel get their set of tubes, and can you calculate/predict the resulting sound?  Or is it some weird magic that happens in there?

And a follow-up to the difference in tubes question.  What about the differences in the amps themselves?  Do the amps act primarily as the vessels for the distorting tubes and it would be hard to tell the difference (relatively) between two amps?  I guess the question is how much of the distortion could be attributed to the amp?

1371520553.0,16,self.headphones,1gk3kz,Review of Bottlehead Crack and JDSLabs Objective2 (for wiki),20,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1gk3kz/review_of_bottlehead_crack_and_jdslabs_objective2/,"This post is just for the wiki. I just noticed a 'reviews' section and figured I would write what I know about the two amplifiers I own, the [Bottlehead Crack](http://www.bottlehead.com/store.php/products/crack-otl-headphone-amplifier-kit) and the [JDS Labs Objective2](http://www.jdslabs.com/item.php?fetchitem=O2Full).

This review includes information about the JDS Labs Objective2 amplifier. I will review the Bottlehead Crack in a separate thread for organization.

This review will include impressions with both the Audio Technica ATH-M50 and Sennheiser HD 650.

**Information**

The [JDS Labs Objective2 Amplifier](http://www.jdslabs.com/item.php?fetchitem=O2Full) is a long-time low price standard for solid state amplifiers. It was designed by [NwAvGuy, and he has a great blog detailing its creation.](http://nwavguy.blogspot.com/) The O2 was designed as an amplifier with little to no distortion and able to power relatively power-hungry headphones at a very low cost. You can consider the measurements made by NwAvGuy on his blog. It is a tried and trusted amp that was designed to be simply a ""gain on a wire"".

This amplifier can be purchased built from [JDS Labs](http://www.jdslabs.com/item.php?fetchitem=O2Full) in the US or [Epiphany Acoustics](http://epiphany-acoustics.co.uk/products-page/headphone-amplifiers/ehp-o2-portable-headphone-amplifier/) in the UK. There are other manufacturers and modifiers of the O2, but they will not be listed here (search Google). The cost of the O2 can range from ~$130 - $200 depending on the configurations you choose.

You can also build an O2 yourself using NwAvGuy's blog. There are hundreds of resources available. You can purchase parts from Mouser to do this, and it should cost you less than $100.

**Build Impressions**

The build of the O2 is controversial. The JDS Labs O2 is very rugged piece of hardware. It has a milled aluminum housing with a machined faceplate. It has two depressible buttons - one is the power, which illuminates a red power LED adjacent to the volume knob, and the other is a gain switch, allowing for multiple gain configurations (1x, 2.5x, 6.5x, whatever you set it to). The volume knob from JDS Labs is aluminum with two rubber rings for grip that functions normally and feels good to turn. The O2 takes a 1/8"" (3.5mm) jack as an input and has another 1/8"" (3.5mm) jack as an output. The power supply is not included. The O2 requires a ~14V and 200mA power supply, which can be purchased from JDS Labs or Mouser. The O2 comes with 2 9V batteries, giving about 6 hours of battery life as a ""portable"" amplifier.

The major downside of the JDS Labs O2 is that all of the connectors are in the front of the amplifier. Yes, ALL of them -power input, power button, output, volume knob, gain switch, and input. 

Additionally, the ODAC can be added into the housing of the O2. The ODAC will, however, replace the batteries, and thus it can only be used with a power supply.

**Sound impressions**

This amplifier was used and tested on Sennheiser HD 650s, Audio Technica ATH-M50s, and Rock-it Sounds R-50s. I will note the sonic characteristics with only the HD 650s and ATH-M50s here. 

The O2 is very much a ""gain on a wire"" amplifier. Sound is accurately represented with near zero distortion. It provides sufficient power for *most* headphones, excluding some planars and more expensive wound driver headphones. Thus, I'm not sure I can adequately describe changes in sonic quality as a blanket statement, but I can explain changes to the HD 650 and M50 sound.

HD 650s, as everyone knows, need an amplifier for both volume (arguable) and sonic quality. I argue that the O2 is sufficient, but not optimal, for these headphones. They become louder, as you'd expect, but also gain bass control and volume. The bass becomes clearer and more impactful. Mids become slightly fuller, but not by too much. Treble is clear as a bell, though still recessed (because they're HD 650s after all). That said, the O2 does not substantially change a headphone's frequency response! If highs are tinny and bright (see AKG K/Q701), they will stay that way! Same can be said with bass. Bass *mostly gains control and clarity, not volume relative to other frequencies*, so don't purchase an O2 to boost bass response. 

The M50s change very little with amplification by the O2, and I would not recommend purchasing one just for them. The bass becomes marginally more controlled, but only marginally. Honestly, I couldn't tell a difference in mids and treble with and without an O2.

**Summary**

Overall, the O2 amplifier is a great deal. It compares head-to-head with the Schiit Magni, but is more expensive. At the same time, it offers reliable, time-tested performance, gain switching, and the ability to add an ODAC into the same housing. Downsides include all ports being on the front of the module and its price relative to the Magni.

I would recommend getting an O2 for people looking for a good price/performance ratio for low-mid to mid-tier headphones. I recommend it or a comparable amplifier for the following headphones:

* Sennheiser HD 598
* Sennheiser HD 600
* Sennheiser HD 650 (if you want a boring amp... I'm biased toward tubes)
* Beyerdynamic DT-880
* Beyerdynamic DT-990
* AKG K701/K702/Q701
* HiFiMan HE-300
* HiFiMan HE-400
* Any headphones with similar power requirements (i.e. most within the range of $200 - $500)

1371438715.0,15,self.headphones,1ghpop,Review: Sennheiser HD 600 with a HE-400 &amp; HD 598 Comparison,23,8,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1ghpop/review_sennheiser_hd_600_with_a_he400_hd_598/,"I have also posted this to Head-Fi, [click here.](http://www.head-fi.org/products/sennheiser-hd-600/reviews/9152).


Here's my thoughts on the HD 600. During the review, I'll be throwing in the similarly priced HE-400 and the lower end HD 598 for comparison. Be warned, these are not direct comparisons. I have sold my HE-400 and HD 598, but still remember how they sounded on certain songs and if I don't feel comfortable about any statements towards them I simply won't post them.  


**Build Quality/Design/Comfort (3.75/5):** These are really comfortable, they have a bit of clamping force but you will easily get used to them. They weighed a lot less then I expected and the pads are made up of very soft material. I would say the HD 598 is more comfortable because it has less clamping force and softer pads, but the HD 600 is still excellent in this category. The cables are removable but they aren't as thick and don't feel as sturdy as the HD 598's cable. These are plastic with some metal, the plastic doesn't feel very cheap, but to me they don't look or feel like a $400 headphone in your hands.

 
**Lows (4/5):** The bass has good power at the mid-bass area, but under 40hz is lacking a bit in impact. The bass is not the fastest, I noticed the HE-400 had quicker bass when I listened to upbeat Techno, like the song ""E"" by Drunkenmunky. I would say the HD 600's bass is adequate, it never wowed me with power and speed, but it didn't sound anemic or very slow either. It did well with Trap, rap, and dubstep showing good extension and moderate power but it doesn't exaggerate the bass which makes those genres enjoyable to some. Comparing the HE-400 I actually think the HD 600 has more perceivable bass in most songs, because of it's stronger mid-bass which you hear more in music, but at the same time the HE-400 will seem to have more bass if you play a song that relies heavily on sub-bass. Comparing the HD 598, I simply felt the HD 600 had just a touch more quantity wise.

 
**Mids (5/5):** The mid-range is less forward then the HD 598 making the 600 a bit easier to listen to without fatigue. The mid-range is smooth, vocals almost never seemed to be harsh or sound fake in any way. The HD 600's mid-range felt a bit more full then the HE-400, mainly in the upper mids. I felt the HE-400 was a bit recessed in that area, even with new velour pads.
 

**Highs (4/5):** The treble in this headphone lacks some detail and excitement. The treble is not veiled, but I couldn't say it is bright. The HD 600 has close to neutral treble that makes it very easy to listen to. Cymbals still have some sparkle and energy but it isn't overdone in any way, sibilance rarely occurs on well recorded tracks and when it comes it isn't heavily exaggerated. If you like a relaxed signature, this will probably be a 5/5 for you. If you want a more dynamic sound with excitement, you should probably look elsewhere. I think the treble was less bright and fatiguing then the HD 598 and HE-400.
 

**Soundstage (3.75/5):** The soundstage has a good size to it but it doesn't always give you that out of your head sound with some headphones. This is kind of a good thing, because the intimacy the HD 600 gives you can be more exciting. Sometimes when I listened to my previously owned HD 598 and the Q701 I auditioned these headphones seemed to make some songs sound too far away, which made me lose excitement. The HD 598 has a larger soundstage, not only in width but also in height. I listened to ""Kitchen Sink, Boxcutters remix"" by Amon Tobin and I could tell the song sounded smaller on the HD 600 while the 598 was larger. I can not comment on the HE-400 because I don't feel comfortable with my memory regarding soundstage on them.
 

**Amping &amp; Synergy:** The HD 600 is a bit harder to drive then your average headphone but it scales incredibly well. It sounded good out of my phone, even better out of my Vintage Fisher 400 Tube stereo + JA-S55 stereo, and excellent out of my mediocre headphone amp (RA53b). Comparing the sound from out of my cellphone to the 30+ year old receivers or my headphone amp wasn't a night and day difference, but I noticed the treble was more relaxed and less sharp, plus the bass had increased power.

 
**Final thoughts:** The HD 600 is a great headphone that can handle almost all genres. It has a smooth and relaxing signature that I personally love. You will need to look elsewhere if you want a fun and more dynamic experience, but if you're looking for a easy to listen to headphone that won't make you too bored the HD 600 should be near the top of your list.",,False,,t5_2rcyx,False,,,True,t3_1ghpop,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1ghpop/review_sennheiser_hd_600_with_a_he400_hd_598/,

1369895848.0,15,self.headphones,1fbmum,because nearly every post is asking for advice I thought I'd do a mini review: AKG K240S,21,6,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1fbmum/because_nearly_every_post_is_asking_for_advice_i/,"Thought I might share my opinion in case somebody was looking into these headphones and nearly everything on this subreddit is people asking for help or talking about M50's (hehe).  
Firstly I'm using an ODAC into an O2 and FLAC files.  

I just received these cans three or so days ago, I also ordered velour pads (the only thing that will make a sound difference between the K240S and the MK2, so unless you want the 5m coiled cable save yourself the cash they are the same headphone).  

Straight away I was pleasantly surprised, they sounded quite balanced with a slight boost towards the lower-end of the spectrum giving a little warmth but sounded very natural and life-like, I listened for about 5 minutes then put some pink noise through them for a couple hours to loosen the drivers up a little.  


After I put them back on I put my first test song on, don't laugh but I always use ""Lovesong"" by Adele, I find this track is perfect for testing headphones; the guitar starting on the left and then followed by the one on the right seems to show just how wide the soundstage is as well as showing how they reproduce high mids and acoustic guitar, then when her voice comes in it shows how cans perform with treble and then as the bass comes in it shows how cans handle the bass and how they handle a lot of content happening at once.  I can usually tell within the first 30 seconds of listening to this song if I will like a headphone or not (treble is important!).  I was really surprised with these headphones, the guitars sounded awesome having nice top end while still retaining some body, and when Adele started singing I knew these cans were good, the treble and high-freq content does not feel limited or rolled off at all (except it has no 'air', i.e. no super high frequency content) and sound extremely life-like with her voice, being able to hear every little rasp in her voice is quite an intimate experience (oh God what am I writing haha), the bass was nice when it came in as I expected from what I had read although the bass didn't intrude at all and I really don't think these are bass heavy as some people say, also when everything is happening in the song these cans handle it well, not blurring any details or smudging any lines between instruments.  

Basically these cans sound like a slightly less detailed AKG K702 with more warmth, a smaller soundstage and no air (OH AND NO BUMPS UNDER THE HEADBAND); unfortunately they don't possess the 'air' that a lot of people write about in reviews (I suspect they haven't heard brighter or more detailed cans like the K702's or HD800's) which would have been nice but for the price these can be had for I highly recommend them.  Also the velour pads added a little bit more bass but I've just been using the pleather ones as they're bigger. I've tried a lot of different stuff through these and they handle it well, especially good with stuff like Red Hot Chilli Peppers although they still aren't forgiving on tracks like 'Californication' where the Limiter had the fuck thrashed out of it and resulted in clipping (WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT) which shows that they are somewhat accurate, although I probably wouldn't trust these as a predominant mixing/producing headphone.  They're somewhat comparable to a poor-mans HD600, giving a very speaker-like representation but still being able to give treble when it is there (this means shit recordings will still sound shit).  I think I might be rambling on and I really have no idea where this review was going.
**EDIT** I've been listening to some more tracks with these, holy shit they sound a lot more expensive than they are! 
Listening to ""Feeling Good"" by Michael Buble is really really impressive.  the mids are sublime, his vocals sound so natural! the big hits all have authority and the space in the recording is very life-like.
Nirvana sounds really nice through these.  
Even listening to ""Still Grey"" by Pendulum through these is really nice, good bass, snare and hi-hats are nice (I actually prefer using the 240's over my MDR-V6's for drum and bass, the snares hats and crashes can get a bit painful with the V6).
I decided to try to listen to some Michael Hedges through these as I'm used to listening to him with my K702's and HD600's, I was pleasantly surprised, everything sounded great and just like it should (minus the 'air/sparkle').  These headphones are definitely in my recommend list, for somebody just getting into it or even somebody with more expensive 'better' cans it is really hard not to be impressed by them.


**TL;DR:** Ever wondered about the 'AKG Mids' or 'AKG house sound'? TRY THESE. They're excellent headphones for the money and a good stepping stone to those who want to see what less than $100 can get them in the way of sound quality.  They compete with my better headphones, great all-rounders. Oh and also they look awesome being all old-school gold and shit. see this link http://www.acquris.se/images/akg_k240.jpg they also have AKG written in gold on top of the headband which looks cool and they're 55 ohms so portables will handle them fine.

I finally ordered a pair on wednesday, and I was excited, expecting a nice upgrade in sound quality.


After using them all day today, I've decided to return them. I haven't noticed any improvement. I've tested them back and fourth with the Panasonics, and I just cannot tell any difference whatsoever. They are more comfortable, but that's not enough to justify $100 more.

Was I wrong in assuming they'd be worth the extra money? Should I even bother upgrade to anything &lt;$200 and expect a substantial improvement, or should I just stick with the Panasonics?

Any recommendations would be appreciated.

**Budget:** &lt;$200

**Source:** PC and maybe phone if they are portable enough (not a requirement)

**Preferred Type of Headphone:** Full-Sized, Circumaural

**Preferred Tonality:** I do like bass a lot, but not at the loss of mids and highs. Balanced would probably be best.

**Preferred Music:** Lots of everything. Probably mostly metal and electronic.

Threads. First, a [pic of them](http://i.imgur.com/PqrTV.jpg). 

The ES10's essentially replace my ATH-ES7's and the venerated ATH-M50's, which I sold, so this review will focus on comparisons to those two sets. I used to use the ES7's as a daily commute portable, and the M50's as a hotel-travel portable. I liked the sound of the M50's more, but I thought they looked too stupid on me for daily public use. The ES10's are now my all-purpose portable set.

First let's focus on one of the main reasons most people would buy these guys: the looks. I must say all my fears of looking stupid are gone. These babies look even better on someone's head then they do on their own. Nice and flat against the head, and they don't have the stupid angled portion that sticks out like the ES7's (which I and many others remedy by physically bending the headband). They can blend in when you want to blend in, but they can also stand out in a classy way. **10/10**

Comfort is as expected, about average for a supra-aural headphone. I can wear them for a couple hours with only minor discomfort near the end. I might upgrade to lambskin pads down the road, but for now I have no complaints. **7/10**

Build quality is acceptable for the price, but durability is below average. The M-50's are much better if you are throw your cans around a backpack with no hard case. The cable is what you would expect from $20 headphones, and the titanium cups are prone to scratch. I have covered them with a clear skin to keep them shiny. The headband is very good and there is little to no creaking. **8/10**

Isolation is in between my two previous pairs: less than M-50's, but more than ES7's. Leakage is minimal. **7/10**

Sound quality: Take this with a grain of salt, as I have spent less than 2 days with them, and they are still running-in. They sound pretty similar to the M50's. Less grainy, less up-front presentation. Clarity and separation are definitely better than the ES7's, and slightly ahead of the M50's. Bass is deep and controlled, but bassheads may want more impact and quantity. They are not bass-shy by any means, but coming from the ES7's they definitely have less bass. **9/10**

Value: Are they worth the price? If the M50's look better on you than they do on me, or if you don't care about looks and mostly care about isolation, durability and sound, then probably not. The two are close enough in performance that unless you can get the ES10's for less than $250, I'd recommend the M50's for 90% of people. But for those who want to show up the beats crew, have a little extra coin, and want to eek out a bit more quality sound out of their portable headphones, then the ES10's fit the bill. I am definitely keeping them. **6/10**",,False,,t5_2rcyx,False,,,True,t3_13xufg,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/13xufg/new_cans_came_in_first_impressions_inside/,

I was coming here to ask you guys if you could help me on picking out a new pair of headphones. I've bought a few pairs of headphones in the past few years (usually cheap/mid-range priced Sennheiser headphones) and have been pretty happy with them, but they haven't really given me the right sound that I want.

I listen to many types of Metal (Death Metal, Black Metal, Thrash Metal, etc.) and a lot of the Metal I listen to has what are called ""bass drops"" which is just a really low frequency sub-bass, and I can never find the right pair of headphones to pick up that frequency right. Usually it just makes the split second of the song really muddy sounding, or just doesn't pick up the bass at all. 

That being said, the headphones I get usually have the right amount of highs and mids. I never have any problems with that at all. So if a pair of headphones with good, heavy bass have good mids and highs, then I am totally happy!

The type of headphones I am looking for would definitely be the full sized headphones that cover the entire ear, instead of just resting on the ears. And the closed or open part really doesn't matter to me, as long as they sound good!

I'm looking to spend $400 or less on these headphones, and if they need an amp, that would be awesome if someone could give me a suggestion on that too!

Any help at all with this would be greatly appreciated! I've been meaning to do this, but was too lazy... But seriously, any help whatsoever with picking out headphones would be amazing! Thank you!

Lots of good ideas and comments in this thread.  I really appreciate everyone who is contributing. 

I jumped the gun and bought the AKG K550s.  Why?  After tons of reading, I convinced myself that all the headphones in contention are probably going to be amazing (as sloppyjalopy says below).  The Shure's were a bit heavy for my taste, and while I was convinced the ATH-M50s would be excellent, I wanted to avoid the ""but what if I spent $100 more???"" line of thinking, and just went for the AKGs.  (Standard irrational consumer thinking.)  The others weren't available in town without ordering, and I'm impatient, so here we are :)

I haven't broken them in, of course, but they certainly blow away the shitty Sony noise-cancelling-with-noise-cancelling-turned-off set I have been using at work.  I have Grado SR125s at home, and the K550s seem more at that level -- or beyond; way better lows already obvious.  (Using my Grados at work wasn't an option since they are noisy as hell for anyone nearby.)

First impressions vs old Sonys:

* With music off, I can't hear myself type (isolation)
* sound stage!
* highs / detail!
* ear cup padding is extremely soft and nice

I will break in the K550s for 24 hours or so and post an update later if anyone cares.

**update 17-Jul-2012:**

I have at least 24 hours on these now.  I don't notice much difference from when I first got them.  They still sound incredible and am still really happy with the purchase.  I will say agian that they isolate really well, and I can blast it pretty loud and no one seems to be bothered.  Worth the money, IMO.

I do like the Grado tonality, so I often equalize my Koss KSC75s to match the Grado style (peak at 2khz, hot treble). I just like KSC75s equalized to sound like Grados better than real Grados. I really don't think that you get what you pay for when you buy Grado -- you get a house sound that is very fun, but the headphones themselves are unremarkable to me.

I also think that almost all of the low-end Ultrasones are terrible for the price and that there are almost always better alternatives. I've found exactly one situation where I'd ever suggest that someone purchase an Ultrasone, and that was when the Ultrasone Ozma5 was an amazing price ($25-40)... but it should be pretty telling that I would only suggest an Ultrasone when it was down to Superlux price levels.

1371593864.0,13,self.headphones,1gm5kg,My Review of the LFF Paradox,17,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1gm5kg/my_review_of_the_lff_paradox/,"(Posting here to add to the headphone wiki)

The LFF Paradox is a modified Fostex T50RP with the aim of sounding completely neutral and costs $495 from LFF's [official website](http://referencesounds.com/paradox.html).

I love my Paradox. I've owned them for 6 months so far (received them on December 2012). They are my favorite headphones of all time. LFF, if you're reading this I want to thank you for delivering me audiophile nirvana!

**Stock T50RP Sound**

My memory of the stock Fostex T50RP sound is very vague. I didn't listen to it for very long since the sole purpose of buying stock T50RPs was to get them modded into a Paradox. What I did remember is that it had a mid-centric sound with no peaks. However it lacked extension in the treble and bass.

**LFF Paradox Sound**

When I received the Paradox I initially thought they had too little bass and the mids sounded dry. However after about 2 weeks I stopped going back to my Fostex TH900s and listened to the Paradox exclusively. I just needed to get used to the neutral sound after only owning colored headphones in the past. 6 months later and the Paradox never fails to satisfy.

The sound is neutral from top to bottom with only a slight increase in the lower midrange which isn't unpleasant (makes vocals sound warmer). The midrange sounds incredibly detailed and realistic, very similar to the LCD2's mids. The bass extension is fantastic, it only starts to roll off after 30hz. Bass impact is good, the drivers can push air and deliver rumbling sub-bass when the recording calls for it. The treble is perfect. It extends effortlessly and has the perfect level of emphasis, very smooth with no peaks. The soundstage is the best I've heard out of any closed headphone. Not quite as good as most open headphones but still VERY good. There were many times where I had to check if the sound was coming out of my speakers, no joke. The Paradox sounds amazing with any kind of music I throw at it. It presents music the way it was meant to be heard without introducing any coloration or distortions given that you use a transparent amp (I recommend the O2/ODAC). The Paradox is good for evaluating source equipment as they sound transparent.

I've owned a few other top of the line headphones in the past (Fostex TH900 and LCD2) and the Paradox beats them both. TH900 had too much treble and the bass was bloated. LCD2 had far too little treble but was otherwise pretty good.

**Durability**

The Paradox is fairly durable and can take some abuse. I've knocked them off my desk a few times and squeezed them into my tight backpack without them getting crushed or deformed. The T50RP was designed to be a professional headphone used in recording studios so no surprise there.

**Leakage and Isolation**

Sound isolation is ok. Not enough for trains and buses but ok for places with small amounts of background noise like a restaurant and park.

Sound leakage is similar to something like the Audio-Technica M50s. It does leak a bit. If you're in a silent room and listening at moderate volume levels, a person sitting next to you can hear what you're listening to fairly well.

**Amp/DAC pairing**

The LFF Paradox is best paired with the O2/ODAC combo. It provides a neutral and transparent sound with a huge volume headroom. I personally use a Leckerton UHA-6S.MKII since I wanted USB charging and a pocket sized form factor. The sound of the UHA-6S.MKII is pretty much the same as the O2/ODAC except it can't go as loud. It's not much of a problem except for very high dynamic range recordings.

You can use the Paradox straight out of an iPhone/iPod but the volume is going to be rather limiting, I find myself listening at close to maximum volume with my iPhone 4 for most songs.

**Comfort**

I purchased a third party headband pad to improve comfort which can be purchased from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Replacement-Leatherette-Universal-Sennheiser-Beyerdynamic/dp/B00862522A) and [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Headband-Cushion-Comfort-pad-fit-GRADO-SR60-i-SR80-i-SR125-i-SR225-i-Headphones-/190702643884). It is a good alternative to the suspension headband if you don't want the headband shaking around when you are walking. You will need to stretch the headband pad significantly to fit it on the Paradox/T50RP. Don't worry about breaking the headband pad from stretching, it won't break.

Comfort is very good with the headband pad mentioned above or the suspension headband. Comfort is not as good as the Fostex TH900s and Denon D5000s but good enough for me to wear all day without complaints. Using the stock headband without padding or suspension headband causes discomfort after about an hour, too much pressure on the top of my head.

**Conclusion**

The LFF Paradox is the best closed headphone on the market if you strive for neutrality, detail, and transparency. At $495 it is a steal compared to flagship headphones like the Sennheiser HD800 ($1500) and Hifiman HE6 ($1,299).

Feel free to criticize my review, I'm open to any feedback.

I'm not too much of a bass head but I spin Burial and the like a lot so it wouldn't go unnoticed. I currently use Sennheiser hd595's, which I love to bits but bought an iBasso t3 portable amp to give them a little more kick and help shoulder the lows (something the senn's didn't deal with very well).

(All sidebar information provided.),15,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/193yuc/headphone_suggestion_for_a_newbie_all_sidebar/,"**Budget**- I guess I'll say 50-100$. But if something like 150$ will really give me that much more, I'll go for it. But 150$ is a ""limit"". If it goes beyond that, I hear a sweet range for audio is 150-300$, I may bite if the deal is too good to ignore.

**Source** - It's going into my laptop jack. I have 2 actually; one of them is a normal jack, the other is S/PDIF jack (not sure). I read up and it's apparently Dolby enabled? How would I make use of that? (Ignore price for that suggestion if you would like.)

**Req. for Isolation** - I would only use them at the comfort of my desk. So isolation req. is minimal.

**Preferred Type of Headphone** - I want the best bang for my buck, ignore shape/size, just want best sound and build quality for what I'm paying for.

**Preferred Tonal Balance** - I know I don't want Beat's bass. To be honest, I don't know what too much mid/high range balance sounds like. So I can't say I  have a preference there. Hopefully you can read what I'm using them for and suggest based on that.

**Past headphones** - 

Current: [Sony in-ear](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Sony+-+Earbud+Headphones+-+Black/4987667.p;jsessionid=68EDD0F2B24A4431426AAE69399C7C2B.bbolsp-app02-115?id=1218589747316&amp;skuId=4987667#tab=specifications)

and [for my gaming](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16826265046)

I can't comment too much on the sound quality of these, or especially the difference between them, as I didn't hear any. Functionally, they all did the job they were there for. But none of them blew me away when I put them on. Functionally they were fantastic; durable, flexible, and operational.

**Preferred Music** - I like to listen to a lot of lighter music; classical, instrumental. I could follow it up with some trance/ vocal trance. Then finally go to an alternative rock or reggae next. I would like to use them for gaming, and especially a game like Counter-Strike, where hearing where your opponents footsteps, could be very useful. So I'm not looking for the headphones to blast me away, but to be precise with information in that sense.

Currently I own all of these headphones (in search of finding ""my"" sound sig) and thought it was a good idea to jot down my impressions of them. Better do it before I get rid of all of them except for K550 to upgrade to HD650.


  Setup: Computer -&gt; Hotaudio Dac Destroyer -&gt; Magni -&gt; x



**SR60i**: Very uncomfortable for extended usage until Reverse quarter modded Senn HD414 pad + Beyer replacement headband. 
Very good for rock and single instrument music(ie. Piano/Violin solo). Little light on bass. Vocals jump out over everything else (due to protruding mids).    
   


**K271 MKII**: Originally for the office and replaced by K550. Fairly comfortable for extended usage with velour pad.
Sounds pretty neutral with slightly recessed mids. I would have to say it sounds veiled and distant.


**DT990 Pro**: To be honest, I didn't find this one very comfortable. Pretty strong clamping and pressure on top of the head made me keep shifting the phones around.
Pronounced highs were prone to frequent sibilance. Bass was tight and controlled. Not very good for vocal music.



**AD700**: Very comfortable and light on the head. Sometimes, those wings clamp down a little harder but adjust to the right position and they stay on there for a long time.
Neutral and good separation of instruments. Clear mids and highs but a bit muddled lows. Great for orchestral music.



**K550**: Very comfortable but sometimes headband gets a bit pressuring at the top. 
Very neutral. Unlike K271, crystal clear highs and mids. Just the right amount of bass to complement the music.  
  
  
  
Personal preference: K550 &gt;= AD700 &gt; SR60i &gt; DT990 Pro &gt; K271 MKII 



Learned my lesson that neutrality is not everything when enjoying music.

My current thought process was to do something along the lines of adding ""slits"" in the ear cups to not have the cups press into the glasses. The only problem I'm coming across with this is the fact that in order to do this, a permanent change would have to be made, and also some sound may leak out etc.
I'm leaning towards making something similar to what I said above, you would add it onto your headset that would add onto the padding on the ear cup. This way it's universal and can be taken off, and used on another headset.

Anyways, it's still early in the year. I've got quite a few more months to come up with something. Thanks again guys!

Help?,14,2,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/x2ika/just_received_my_akg_k240_seriously_suspect_that/,"Immediately after getting the package in my hands I ripped it open, and got my headphones out. It came in a brand new box, unopened, which was reassuring. But once I started investigating the headset, I became suspicious. It didn't seem like it was made of the materials I had seen in pictures. Furthermore, the edges of the leather didn't line ut properly, So I decided to look at pictures on the 'net, to see if I was wrong.

Upon looking at pictures on the web, I was sad to see that my headset was not similar. Sure, the materials looked off, but the real unsettling part was that the images had ""Made in Austria"" printed by the chord plug. Mine had nothing printed there, but instead I have ""Made in China"" printed on a small sticker on the inside of the headband.

The box they came in looked just like the original box, except for this detail. the picture used was [this](http://www.musiciansbuy.com/mbx/zoom.aspx?sku=K240S&amp;n=AKG%20K240S%20Studio%20Headphones), except the ""Made in Austria"" sign was poorly photoshopped out.

Can anyone confirm if these are fake or, against my own convictions, actually real? I will post pictures once I get the chance.

...


EDIT: So, I think I should be sorry. AKG actually do produce some of their headphones in China. Also, the materials and stuff that I mentioned seem to have been non-issues, and just me overreacting and being paranoid. The poor photoshopping was unnerving, but I guess it could be justified. The materials probably only looked different due to lighting.  
I'm tempted to delete this post, but I'll leave it up in case anyone else starts to worry.  

...

EDIT 2: Okay, pictures:  

* [Here](http://i.imgur.com/HEyY6.jpg) is my headset. My primary concern is the fact that it was made in China, not Austria. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/x04a5.jpg) is a picture of the left side, the entrance for the chord, with the ""Made in Austria"" mark missing. Here are two pictures [1](http://i.imgur.com/CeEvD.jpg) and [2](http://i.imgur.com/9fTSw.jpg), 1 being of the headset laying so as to show the sticker, and 2 is up close, reading ""Made in China P.R.C."".
* I mentioned the leather ""not lining up"", which probably didn't make a lot of sense. That ended up not being a problem, as I'll explain. Here are two pictures: [3](http://i.imgur.com/D2Idw.jpg) and [4](http://i.imgur.com/PZciN.jpg). In 3, you see the edge of the leathery fabric covering the ear pads. In 4, I have stretched that edge a bit back. When I opened the box, this edge was stuck to the plastic, streached back half a cm or so, on both sides. This made it look as though it had been sloppily assembled. However, after wearing it for a bit, the leather loosened from the plastic, and now it lines up as seen in 3.
* I should note that in the above pictures, the logos are not simply printed on top of the glass/plastic. This part of it feels genuine, but then I don't suppose it would be hard to fake.
* The buildquality itself was another of my worries. I bought the Sony MDR V6 in addition to these, and they were about the same price. Now, the V6 came first, and they actually felt like a hundred dollars.That is, I could feel that they were wourth my money from their weight and the materials. However I am only an aspiring audiophile, and so I am not able to discerne quality from sound alone just yet, but from what I can tell my AKGs do not feel like a hundred dollars. The leather is not real, though it looks like it from pictures on the net, and it does not feel very durable. The casing is made of light plastic, which feels very flimsy, and again not at all like the impressions I get from internet pictures. This doesn't mean anything ofcourse, I am just trying to explain why I felt the way I did in the beginning. I am sure they are wourth their price for their quality, given that they are real.

So yeah, sorry to interupt, as this doesn't look like anything in particular. Just me being overly paranoid. Now I've documented what I saw to a painfully and embarrassingly detailed degree, which i hope should clear everything up.

**TL;DR:** It was all in my head.

If I could sum up my experience after listening to only about a dozen songs with these, I would say just this: Wow! If these $23 headphones sound this good, I can't wait to hear what a $100+ set sounds like!  For anyone looking for great quality at just over $20, these are definitely a good value.  I can't speak to the comparable Panasonic model i've read about, as I never heard those before, but I am absolutely content with the sound of the 8323's.

I have read about people hearing things in certain songs that they haven't heard before and this happened on just about all the song's i've listened to so far.  I also remember reading that these are rebranded and made by Kicker, but I don't know how valid that claim is.

If there was one thing I could change, so far, it would be that when they are on my head they sort of don't follow the curve of my head. It almost looks like they are more squared off and don't flex/bend in the middle.  Maybe this is common (sorry, i'm new to this), but it does look awfully goofy! I don't really care that much about the way they look though.

Bottom line: If you are considering the 8323's as your first set of decent sounding headphones, I say go for it!  I hope this helps someone down the line.

1370539239.0,14,self.headphones,1fsw0j,The $100 IEM question,15,1,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1fsw0j/the_100_iem_question/,"I'm currently using UE500's as my IEM for portable music, got them for $25 a few months ago. They sound fine, but they really don't wow me all that much. As a birthday present to myself, i'm looking into a bit of an upgrade. 

The two main IEM's that i've been considering are the SE215 and the RE400, but I have a few concerns for each of them.

SE215: I looooove the build on this guy, the detachable cable, the memory wire, the appearence, the around the ear style, all of it.  But i'm not too sure if it's going to give me a huge upgrade in sound quality over the UE500. The signature seems very similar, with a marked bass emphasis and a rolled off treble. I do like bass, but i'm looking for a much more detailed and balanced sound than I've had from my previous IEM's.

RE400: Basically the opposite concern, the sound quality seems fantastic for the price, but I don't know about the build quality or it's ability to stay in the ear. I do plan on running with these from time to time, although it won't be the primary usage, so their ability to stay in the ear while running is something i'd like some input on. Also I've heard the SE215 has better isolation, which isn't hugely important to me, as long as the RE400 isolates *enough*. 

Also microphonics. I *hate* microphonics. The UE500 is probably one of the least microphonic IEM's i've had. (Maybe its flat cable has something to do with it), but I've had previous IEM's that are very microphonic, and it's always bothered me. 

So if anyone here has experience with either of these IEM's, and would like to specifically address the sound quality of the SE215, the build quality and ability to stay in the ear of the RE400, or the microphonics of either of them, it would be greatly appreciated. Also, if you have any other IEM's to suggest around the $100 range, that's awesome too.

1368158670.0,12,self.headphones,1e1st0,Bose AE2: let's just get rid of sound frequencies that cause listening fatigue - mid bass and sharp trebles.,22,10,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1e1st0/bose_ae2_lets_just_get_rid_of_sound_frequencies/,"I posted that I have gotten the Bose AE2 about 3 weeks ago, mostly for the comfort, and received exactly zero votes -I guess people really hated Bose huh?

Well now 3 weeks has passed, how are these Bose holding up? How good does it sound?

""Interesting"" is the word that comes to mind.

Personally I have found that two part of the sound frequency really contributes to listening fatigue.

First, the sharp trebles. This is why people referring to certain headphones (Senns etc.) as having rolled off trebles and stating that they prefer it that way.

Second, the mid-bass, the ""boom"" ""boom"" part of bass, the part where the air rushes into your ear and pounds your ear drums, and after a while gives you a headache part.

For Bose AE2, it's as if the sound engineers responsible said, ""hey, I know, let's get rid of those two parts of the frequency. No, not dial it down a few notches, but to turn the knob from 10 all the way to 1.""


A popular phrase is ""no high no low, must be Bose"", yet the AE2 has plenty of high and sub-bass; the mid-bass and piercing treble though? Those goes bye-bye.

What resulted is something that sounds so so wrong in terms of neutrality and life-likeness, yet so very right if you're tired from a busy day of work, or just came out of a shower after working out, and just want to lean back and listen to music.

I mean at those times the cut of those sharp trebles really hurts, and your ear drums are so so sensitive to those mid-bass poundings, yet the Bose AE2 tune them down to anemic levels, everything just sound so.... agreeable.

So in the end I have to say the AE2's sound signature is extremely wrong, yet it is very enjoyable when you're tired and just want to relax.

It's like the opposite of grado - making everything sounds relaxing rather than exciting; and in the right mood/circumstance, it might be exactly what you're looking for.",,False,,t5_2rcyx,False,,,True,t3_1e1st0,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1e1st0/bose_ae2_lets_just_get_rid_of_sound_frequencies/,

Garage1217 design these so that they have a variety of different sounds that they put out so I'll do this review as far as how the amp sounds with a certain set of tubes and a certain set of headphones instead of a generic one so that it doesn't come off as if this amp only has one sound because it doesn't -- the tube has a massive effect on sound and I feel that to do an amp review without also treating it as a tube review wouldn't be an accurate indication of the amps sound. 

First will be the RCA Clear top 12AU7 with Fostex T50RPs modded to BMF spec (minus felt over the drivers and treble reflector). 

Treble - Great extension - with this tube in the amp is pretty bright. Not harsh at all. Cymbals come out well in a hot sense but not fatiguing.

Mids - This is where most of the emphasis is on this setup. Vocals are pretty aggressively prioritized to the extent that they dominate the sound sig if if they weren't totally killed during mixing of the song. Mids are on the brighter end of things but are super smooth which them a treat too listen to. Guitars cut through when necessary and the tube does a great job at creating a wall of sound effect when necessary.

Bass - Not exactly the tube for a basshead. Its there, and its super tight but it doesn't have the aggressive punch that other setups can have on this amp. That said, in general the kick that this amp has is quite a large one so don't be deterred by that statement - it reflects more on the particular tube that I have in at the moment than it does the amplifier. 

Detail/Soundstage - Terrific at it on all accounts. Soundstage is massive and even on closed headphones with a smaller one, the instrument separation is terrific enough that things don't feel crowded at all - kind of like each part of the song has its own pocket to fit into.

Powering abilities - The amp puts out almost a watt and it shows in that it drives hard to drive headphones such as Fostex T50RPs post modding and AKG K702s very effectively. I know that other amps can do it volume wise but not as effective as this does because the extra power adds more bass response and detail.

Just one sidenote - this is an amp that you'll want to keep away from a tv or things like that - its open design makes it someone sensitive to RFI. Computers, other amps, wifi etc are no issue though - just my plasma tv that created noise. 

EDIT: Also I have a decent amount of headphones and tubes so this is going to continue kinda like a series of reviews if you will.

1358477538.0,11,self.headphones,16skwy,Just received and gave a listen to my new Denon AH-D2000... pretty damn good.,14,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/16skwy/just_received_and_gave_a_listen_to_my_new_denon/,"Definitely not the best time to buy these headphones due to the prices nowadays, but I saw a refurbished pair on Amazon.co.uk for around $320+shipping, and I impulsively pulled the trigger.

They finally arrived today.

**My setup**

Denon AVR-391 receiver from Best Buy (so no, nothing fancy), fed from PS3 via HDMI.

**Other headphones**

Sennheiser HD650 (old black silk membrane version), also used to own Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro 80ohm for over a year.

Impression on the Denon:

**Build quality**

Pretty good, but I thought the piece connecting the ""U"" shaped bracket to the headband feels thin and plasticky for a part that's designed to be the most weight/torque bearing part of the entire phone. The Beyer DT770 in comparison was much much tougher in the critical part of the assembly - I also love how Beyer textured the cup's plastic, basically making them scratch proof; and the HD650 has a nice clear coat on their plastic parts which feels tougher than Denon's satin, scratch prone plastic cups. 

Denon do have good build otherwise, the magnesium cup rim and the U bracket; as well as what appears to be stainless steel headband adjustment rods especially inspires confidence.

**Comfort**

Amazing.

It's not the earpads - they're not as soft as the velour pads on the HD650 and DT770 Pro 80, but the clamping force of the headband is almost non-existent.

When people say it feels like it's going to fall off when you shake your head too fast - it's 100% true. But I'm not using these portably and I love the light force on my head, the HD650 feels like a vice in comparison (still plenty comfortable on their own).

**Sound**

Very very fun/exciting pair of headphones.

Even going from memory, these are definitely better than DT770 in every way except for the sibilance (""ssss"" sounds) amount - a bit too much; I feel like retroactively kicking myself for not getting these instead back in the day.

However it's that sibilance combined with the much bigger soundstage that makes it feels way more hi-definition than the old DT770, and even the HD650.

Compared to the HD650, much bigger soundstage, the different musical cues stand out much more amongst each other. On the HD650 the instruments sounds a bit bunched up compared to the Denon, where each instrument come from a much more distinctive direction.

Problem with the Denon is that they're much more fatiguing than the HD650, because of the sibilance combined with the recessed mid.

Yes, the mids are definitely recessed, compared to the HD650 the vocals's volume are a notch down from the rest of the instruments, this leads to me turning up the volume to hear the vocals better but which compounds the tiring sibilance.

I'm probably going to try EQing on the computer to see if I can get them to sound better. They're not bad as they are though, I can definitely enjoy them straight out of the receiver.

**Conclusion**

Overall I'm very, very happy with my purchase. To me these headphones are a perfect complement to my more laid-back and darker HD650.

It makes me curious how much better the D5000/D7000 is, but a thought about the current prices takes me back down to earth =).

Anyways, those headphones are great and I'm going to be enjoying them for a long long time.",,False,,t5_2rcyx,1358480147.0,,,True,t3_16skwy,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/16skwy/just_received_and_gave_a_listen_to_my_new_denon/,

1354602760.0,14,self.headphones,1490tl,The Holiday Decision: To V-MODA Crossfade M-100...or not....,14,0,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1490tl/the_holiday_decision_to_vmoda_crossfade_m100or_not/,"Hey,

So this is my first ever non-comment posted to Reddit, so hopefully this works out well. I am getting my first ever set of proper headphones for Xmas this year, and I need some advice.

Before I start my story, I'll cover the following:

**Price Range:** I'm looking to spend no more than $350AUS on the headphones, and I may purchase an portable AMP/DAC with separate money if needed.

**Usage:** I'm looking for a totally portable setup, using them on the in public and at work. So only closed headphones, and circumaural if possible The headphones will be running off my iPhone 5, and I will amp them if necessary. 

**Music Tastes:** I'm a big rap/hiphophead, and these genres account for at least 50% of all my listening. The other 50% include some of my favorite artists, like The Gorillaz, The Mars Volta, The Beatles, The Arctic Monkeys, Blink-182, The Offspring, Deadmau5, Powderfinger.

Ok, so let get to it. After hours and hours of reading [Head-Fi](http://www.head-fi.org/) and related sources, I decided that I was going for the [Audio Technica ATH-M50](http://eu.audio-technica.com/en/products/product.asp?catID=5&amp;subID=39&amp;prodID=266), with the [Fiio e5](http://www.fiio.com.cn/product/index.aspx?ID=6&amp;MenuID=020301). Then I realised I had more money to spend, so I started looking at the [Audio Technica ATHESW9A](http://www.amazon.com/Technica-ATHESW9A-Portable-Wooden-Headphones/dp/B0030O0Q2U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354601863&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=audio+technica+esw9a), then the [Sennheiser HD25-1 II](http://en-de.sennheiser.com/dj-headphones-noise-reduction-hifi-stereo-hd-25-1-ii) (but they looked like they were going to get uncomfortable sitting on my ears.

It was then I went on V-MODA's site and saw the [Crossfade M-100's](http://v-moda.com/crossfade-m-100/). My first thought was *fuck yeah*. But further research revealed these are brand spanking new, few people have them, and as such, its still early days on whether they are worth the asking price of $310 ($340 shipping to AUS). But I do have a massive soft spot for them developing, just on looks alone.

And now I'm overwhelmed. 

So my questions are: 

**1. Am I looking at the right things?**

**2. Does anyone here have the M-100's?**

**2a. How do they rate compared to other headphones you have?**

**3. Advice on portable amps's (I know the whole iPhone 5 DAC issue)**",,False,,t5_2rcyx,False,,,True,t3_1490tl,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1490tl/the_holiday_decision_to_vmoda_crossfade_m100or_not/,

Total rube here, been lurking for a couple weeks trying to absorb everything and make an informed purchase but I think it’s hopeless. So at the risk of creating another redundant “what should I buy?” topic, well, what should I buy?

Relevant information!:

- I’m looking for a pair of over-ear headphones, closed if possible. Sound leakage is pretty important - I’d like to use these in my shared office, the library and while my partner is trying to go to sleep. Sound reduction is nice, but it’s not a priority.

- I’m (obviously) not a sound engineer or doing any sound editing, so this is just for making my music sound as nice as possible. If it matters that much, I mostly listen to jazz, classical, and rock.

- A few years ago I owned a pair of Bose AE2 that I liked just fine, but it seems out of favor here. Is there an option to get that kind of quality without paying a premium for the name?

- Durability is nice, but I’m not a barbarian who tosses things around willy-nilly. Something that won’t break from throwing it in my bag is all I need.

- Finally, the price point - I’d like to spend less than $100, though up to $150 is fine. It’s a bit low, but consider me someone who you’re trying to turn into an audiophile - In a few years I might have a great sound system that I can trace back to this preliminary purchase.

In short: wow.

compared to the old tips, the new tips have doubled the isolated (after ~ 5 washes, the tips get firm compared to super malleable and it becomes impossible to fill your canal with them like they're supposed to, instead they start to only block the entry), added more rumble/energy to the low end (subbass was brought pack period, but midbass got a bit louder) the detail is far better, subtle touches are audible again, and the most noticeable is the improved soundstage.  I think this is more a side effect of the drivers being closer to my eardrums now, but holy crap.  They can now make stuff sound way closer than they could before.  

tl;dr if you use IEMs with foam tips, be sure to change them it makes a massive difference.     

edit: oh yeah, and listening to them while fresh tips are expanding (takes ~30s the first few times) is very strange.  They start off very bright with no isolation and slowly move into bassy with extreme isolation.",,False,,t5_2rcyx,False,,,True,t3_10qky2,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/10qky2/i_forgot_how_strange_this_is_putting_fresh_tips/,

I wrote up my [first impression here](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/106wn7/i_just_got_my_earpods_heres_my_initial_impression/).

During the initial discussion about these someone here (I think it might have been /u/Uncle_Erik or possibly /u/keanex) speculated that the EarPods sonically would have more in common with an open over-ear headphone than with an IEM.  

Well, whoever wrote that is right.  A little prolonged listening with the EarPods reveal many of the same qualities as a good pair of over-ears.  And a few I haven't heard from any headphone, ever, including the Staxes I had on loan for almost a year: An actual sound stage from headphones. At one point, I took my headphones off to verify that I hadn't accidentally switched back to output from speakers.  That was quite uncanny, and not something I expected.  

Mind you, it's not on every recording, and the effect is not quite that of a speaker, but it was a huge surprise.

However, as I hinted at in my review, I'm not trying to pretend the EarPods are perfect - they _are_ after all a $30 headphone (But I suspect people would gladly pay $50-60 for them if they weren't made by Apple).

Which brings me to the title of this post:   I would _love_ to see a no-holds barred approach to this _type_ of headphones from an established manufacturer.  If I could get the openness of the EarPod sound combined with the detail level and tonal balance of a high-end headphone, I would be an extremely happy man.",,False,,t5_2rcyx,False,,,True,t3_107enn,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/107enn/dear_headphone_makers_i_want_a_noholds_barred/,

It's fantastic to meet you. This is the subreddit I never thought to look for. Amazon.com reviews just don't cut it for me anymore, bass doesn't tell the whole story. I need help. Now.

As a 15 year old, I don't have much experience in the field of audio. However, my dad worked in a stereo shop for many years, and is (was) what I'd consider an audiophile. He definitely knows his stuff when he talks about audio, but his ears aren't what I expect they used to be. He's satisfied with Pandora streaming through his blackberry on his car stereo. It's painful for me to listen to. Pandora's compression techniques absolutely **ruin** the highs, and his car's stereo is boomy regardless of the input. I tell you this to explain that my primary source of audio knowledge and experience is no longer adequate. I hope you at /r/headphones will save me.

In my room, I have [this Harman Kardon stereo receiver](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00198BOAM) and a set of [Polk Audio Monitor 7's](http://www.polkaudio.com/homeaudio/specs/recent/monitor7/). Needless to say, my ears are spoiled. I'm becoming more and more spoiled by this audio set, and few other sets that I've heard can compare. My dad has a speaker set in our living room paired with Arcam products. Those speakers are Ruark Crusaders. They're fantastic as well, but they're not used often.

As a teenager, I stay up late and wake up late. Unfortunately, the rest of my house does not, which means I can't be loud with my speakers when I want to be. I've had to turn down the volume to a point where it is nearly unenjoyable to listen to my music at night, and would like to end this compromise. A year back, before my ears raised their standards, I bought a pair of Sennheiser HD202's. Today, I found them, and put them on. It was terrible. *Of Monsters and Men* was just bad to listen to. The sound is beyond my description (I'm 15, remember?), and I **need** an upgrade. 

I'd like to spend under $100, though ~$120 wouldn't be beyond reach. I've found [these Sony MDR-V6's](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00001WRSJ), and am ready to pull the trigger on them, but I need second opinions. And third opinions. And fourth opinions. You get the idea. Last time I bought headphones, I regretted it (HD202). I'd not like to make that same mistake again.

**Here are my requirements and uses.**

* Comfort is a must. I'm not looking for ear-buds.

* I'd like there to be little audio ""leakage"". I don't want my sound getting out. I don't mind if it gets in.

* I **DON'T** want boomy headphones. Boominess is one of the reasons I find the HD202's unacceptable.

* I **DON'T** want tinny headphones. Shrill sound is difficult to listen to for long periods of time.

* I'd like to spend under $100. $120 is my limit. If there is a marginally better product for $150, that's alright, too.

* I'll be using these plugged into my computer. It uses a standard 3.5mm headphone jack. If I were to plug this into my stereo, I have a 1/4"" adapter.

* Cord length must be greater than three feet, or one meter.

**Here are the music genre's I'll be listening to.**

* Rock (from Woodstock to 2012)

* Metal (not death-metal, more rock-like metal)

* Folk (similar to folk, anyway)

* Blues (Clapton-like blues)

* Raggea (only sometimes)

* Piano

I listen to a lot. Pandora (on the desktop, where high quality audio is used) opens up a lot of doors for me. Please assume these headphones will listen to everything except hip hop, rap, and dubstep.

I'll be cross posting this to /r/audiophile in hope for more responses. Thank you all in advance! I'll be posting some of my other questions separately, seeing as how long this post has gotten.

**TL;DR** I need over-ear headphones for night-listening, budget = ~$120.

1376107176.0,14,self.headphones,1k2lb7,Magni vs the O2 and Results of ABX Testing,18,4,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1k2lb7/magni_vs_the_o2_and_results_of_abx_testing/,"Hey, r/headphones

So apparently I was lying a while back when I said that I wouldn't do a blind abx test. To back this up a bit, a friend of mine purchased a Schiit Magni, so we decided to compare it to the o2 since one of the things that we've seen around here a lot is the idea that all ""transparent"" gear should sound the same or at least in a blind abx test. The results were interesting. 


As far as our method goes, we decided to make all parts of the setup identical (same set of Denon D2000 headphones, cables, and ODAC) except the Magni and O2. Then we started abx testing in two methods. For both methods, we took 30 seconds of listening in which we knew which amp we were listening to based on verbal confirmation (before this we had only spent about 15 minutes on each other's amps). After that, we  started blind testing and left the song playing pulling out the headphone cable between each declaration of an answer until 10 answers were recorded. For the first test, after each pull out of the cable at which either a change or no change could occur, we had to name which was the Magni and which was the O2 based on the 30 second preview that we had. Both of us got between 4 and 6 correct in each of our 3 sets of 10 trials. For the second method (fourth set of 10 trials), we simply had to declare if the amplifier switched. I scored a 9 out of 10 correct and my friend scored a 4 out of 10 correct. 

I'm sure you're saying at this point that because the results of the blind abx were inconclusive, that there is no sonic difference. That's not the case though. During most of the trials, we both had moments in which we knew (and usually exclaimed it out loud in the form of expletives) that we had screwed up which was which and the data showed it in that once the switch got made in our mind, we guessed correctly that there was a change, but got confused on which was the O2 and which was the Magni. The other thing that we noticed was what exactly we were listening for was different -- after we finished abxing we debriefed as far as what in the tracks we were listening to for the giveaways of which was which. For a certain track, one of us would say vocals and the other bass kick or one of us guitars and the other piano. Upon re-listening to the track without commenting on which differences we heard, we were able to understand where we had gone wrong. On some tracks there was no difference between the vocal presentation, but there was in the bass and vice-versa. The other problem that we noticed with abxing is the mental pressure aspect. The idea that there could be no change (and the subsequent desire to not look like an idiot by getting it wrong) created a scenario in which the test was not necessarily about what was being heard -- it was about the game being played. I had many times in the test where I detected a change or no change -- and then the second guessing started. Would he really put a no change there? Would he really switch? Once the doubt in what you heard becomes apparent, the awfulness of auditory memory shows up and you begin to invent differences all in the name of not of the inherent desire to not want to look as if your ears are inferior in terms of detecting differences.  It's equivalent to taking a scantron test and noticing that every single correct answer is A except you aren't detecting differences on something reliable like knowing a fact. We found that with sighted listening, since the mental game was out of the equation, we were better able to focus on differences in general sound signature and individual details at the same time instead of attempting to focus on mind games and sound at the same time. 

So without further hesitation, here's what we heard during our abx trials and sighted listening. Keep in mind that these are generic impressions based on listening to both amps on the same track set  of tracks and that these impressions might not apply for every single track that one listens to. 

1) The O2 has a much cleaner presentation as far as detail retrieval

2) On certain songs, the Magni suffered as far as sub bass. It was almost non-existent on some tracks and on others it appeared as a fuzzy fwump noise while the O2 delivered a precise thump

3) The Magni's vocals almost have a veiled warm and thick quality while the O2s were somewhat brighter

4) The O2 has more sparkle on instruments such as guitars and piano
 
5) The O2 has a better soundstage as far as width and better placement of things within the soundstage

Noise canceling",14,2,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1jvzzy/please_god_help_cant_take_anymore_noise_canceling/,"tl;dr; Otherwise quiet office interrupted by regular burp/groans, max volume yawns, overload headphones and high volume whisper singing. Advise product?

I recently bought the mdr-nc200d noise canceling headphones. I did not understand that they choose their own level of canceling. Train, plane, office. No manual control found after briefly talking to support.

Here is the issue. My office is mostly quiet. I share a large room with two people who are fairly new. I am too, but about half a year ahead. It started with one who used headphones, on irregular intervals they would increase volume loud enough to hear. Other times they might just loudly whisper along to the song (conversation volume). That and the occasional short phonecall for personal stuff (leaving isn't difficult). They also weren't adverse to leaving their headphones on when she left for 5 minutes. Lastly apparently 1 hour before normal end of day was apparently the listen to music louder hour. My favorite is when twice they remarked on how quiet the office was.

They stopped all but the phone calls about 2 weeks ago when they started getting angry at coworker 2 for yawning and burping loudly. They had mentioned the yawning before (didn't find it bad then) but things recently got very excessive. I'd estimate coworker 2 burps loudly followed by a loud groan 3-5 times in 30 minutes (often in succession), and loudly yawn 3-5 times in an hour proud. This is probably heightening my awareness of noises as then follows 15 minute nut chomping periods or slurping of his regular fresh coffee.

This Monday coworker 1 got upset enough to start burping several times in retaliation, messaging me a couple times to try and express their irritation. Tuesday they came over after coworker 2 left to tell me not to take lessons from coworker 2 because he was unprofessional and not considerate. Additionally my major anxiety now from the noise is coworker 1's verbal passive aggressive angst. Or trying to get me to agree with them about how annoying coworker 2 is.

The extra irony is I think coworker 2 started using headphones to drown out coworker 1 and is now less aware of his noises (also drumming the desk).

So anyway I don't think the headset is detecting the right atmosphere since I have to push a button for resetting the mode and what I want canceled out is infrequent and brief enough to not be feasible.

Is there something short of earplugs that can give me piece? I sometimes listen to audiobooks (music distracts me, I listen to books I know for background noise) so I'd like that to still be on the table, but that isn't enough alone to drown this out and I am not just working but learning on the job and taking over some mostly completed software projects so silence is often necessary.

While writing that last paragraph coworker 2 burped, then yawned, burped twice, then yawned again. No manager is likely to hear this enough to act, due to reasons relocating is unlikely, none of us will be gone soon.

I'd be willing to drop 200$ on the new headphones or more if it's needed but prefer not to break the bank. Ideally I'd enjoy it sounding like I was 6ft under the ground. I do not care about aesthetics, and comfort only if I can't McGyver something to improve it.

Never spent more than $25 on them before, but that's only because I've been broke my whole life. For the first time I'm making a bit of a better living, so I need to feed my ear.

I listen to a wide variety of music, and I do record some music at a friend's house. He's got a decent recording set up, but only one pair of decent headphones. We record mostly rock. Think if 90s hard rock had a hangover into the 2000s, then make it a lot less good than that sounds, and that's the kinda music we make.

I also game a little, but not frequent enough and nothing intense enough to make that my focus. Music is priority one. If I had to pick a genre, I'd say I mostly listen to alternative (I know that's broad, I'm doing my best) and some post hardcore. It's important to me that my headphones be flexible/neutral-ish.

I'd prefer to keep it under $100, but I can peak above that if you really sell me on it.

I know some people are bass obsessed. I want my bass to be solid, of course, but I don't necessarily value it over mids or treble. People obsessed with subwoofers only make me twitch. They ignore two thirds of the song.

Initial research has lead me to Shure SRH440 and Sony MDR-V6 (the latter possibly with Beyerdynamic EDT 250 Earcushions).

1371728299.0,12,self.headphones,1gpzbg,My opinion on Beyerdynamic T1 vs. AKG K701,14,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1gpzbg/my_opinion_on_beyerdynamic_t1_vs_akg_k701/,"So, basically I've had K701's for quite some time, about two years to be precise. As time went by I was buying (and then ended up selling) pretty much every headphone on the market, excluding flagships. We're talking HD558, HD598, HD600, HD650, DT-770Pro, DT880 600, DT990 Pro, AKG K550, Q701, Ultrasone HFI-2400, Hfi-780, Sony V6, etc. But somehow, it never crossed my mind to ever replace the good old K701 with any of them.

Sure, HD650's and DT880 600's came close to beating them, as well as obviously the Q701 and K550 (excellent closed headphones btw, 90% of K701 quality), but it never happened and I always ended up selling those headphones. 

There's just something about K701's:  detail, soundstage, airy sense space, speed, dynamics, great presence and liveliness, excellent extension in both directions and reasonably neutral frequency response with a slight brightness to it.  Those are all positives as far as sound goes, and no other headphone mentioned beforehand beat them as a combination of all these attributes. Oh, sure, K701's were outclassed by some of them in one area or another, bass comes to mind first, but they were never beaten overall.

Well, recently I bought the T1's, after many weeks of saving up for them and breaking my head whether I should get them or maybe HD800's.  I went for T1's, without ever even seeing them in person, let alone hearing them. My liking of all other Beyers was the only quarantee that I was doing the right move.

So...they've been here for a week now.  My setup is not ideal. It's currently just a Nuforce HDP dac/amp, which sounds wonderful with K701's and sounded great with HD650's too. Sound files are all lossless, mostly 24/96, 24/192's and SACD's.


T1 and HDP...well...it does sound good, but it's not an effortless action so to speak. Volume wise its ok, its about the same as with the K701's, never have to turn all the way or past 70% to get really loud. However, for a headphone that came out in 2009, and costs almost 1500$ in my country, compared to a headphone that came out long ago, and costs 350$ in comparison, they're surprisingly (and rather disappointingly close).  Sure, T1's sound slightly more natural, they have a bit more bass, a LIIIIIIITTLE bit better sound resolution and transparency, and a little bit better imaging. They separate sounds a bit better and different instrument bleed into one another less. There's also a slightly better central image and soundstage depth.

 But, K701's still beat them on excitement, they beat them on soundstage size and airiness, they beat them in presence and liveliness, and probably in detail presentation. They're not MORE detailed, they just throw detail in your face.

 

So... are the T1's worth almost 5 times more? In my opinion, no. I know, I know...my setup is not ideal for T1's, and its a bottleneck not allowing them to show their best, but the fact they get beaten by K701, and clearly so, in ANY way, is an amazing testament to the quality of todays mid-tier headphones. I know that I'm not getting a full potential out of them with only the HDP. BUT, look at it this way:

HDP ($500) + K701 ($350)  vs.  HDP($500) + T1 (1500$). 

The cheaper combo is definitely not inferior in any way, just different in presentation, and it beats the more expensive combo in certain very important areas. To put it in simple words, if I was blindfolded, and had no clue which headphones I'm about to listen to, and someone changed these two while playing the same music, I would come up with two conclusions.  Number one, I prefer the K701 and I think it sounds more ""hi-fi"" and more enjoyable. Ok, this is personal, it depends on taste. Number two, I'd probably think the other headphone is a DT880, not a T1. You expect from a flagship to totally annihilate todays mid-tier (world class 5 years ago) headphones, but sadly, it just doesn't happen.  Even if T1 improve quite a bit out of a better source and a better amp, they still won't completely outclass the K701, or DT880, or HD650...in a same way as for example HD650's outclass the HD558's, or K701's outclass the K272's. 

And I doubt that they will improve a lot. I've heard people talk about HD650's as if they turn into a monster once you used them with a high end amp and source. Well, I've used mine way back with a cheap Pro-ject headbox SEII headphone amp and heard them out of Burson, Woo Audios, Lehmann BCL, etc...there was an improvement, but not nearly as dramatic as expected. So,  I think I have a right to believe T1's won't completely transform either, and unless they do, they're simply not worth a step above DT880/990 or HD600/650 or K701/2, unless you really are ready to pay 1000 dollars more for 5% better performance.


I am not saying T1's are bad, they're excellent headphones in every way. The problem they have is the fact that much cheaper DT880 600 ohm is excellent in every way as well, and only slightly worse, for a much lower price. To put it in car terms....I always though that going from DT880 to T1 would be like going from BMW 3 series to a BMW 7 series. Well, in reality its more like going from a 330i to a 335i.

-I like a nice, overall balanced tone to my music, although I do have a slight preference for some punchy bass, so long as it doesn't drown out my mids and highs.

Alas, here it is

Denon D2000 with FIIO E7/E9 vs AKG K702 with Little Dot I+ and Voshkod EF95 Tube/OPA2134 opamp Shootout

*Disclaimer -I know this is unorthodox because there are a bunch of different variables but I thought it would be interesting to have a full setup shootout instead of just an headphone or equipment one. The reason for this method is that I feel like certain headphones have certain amp preferences to sound their best so it would be unfair to put the headphones against each other on a source that would disadvantage them from the get go so these are two of the best setups that I can provide for these headphones. My reasoning behind the setups is that I feel that the AKGs are too cold to use a solid state in order to sound best and that the tubes provide nice warmth and the Voshkods in particular because they are warm but very detailed. An OPA2134 was used due to its clarity and separation. The hybrid design of the little dot adds to the bass enough to make it contend. Denons on a solid state because they are very musical and warm but I feel that they come off as less detailed and a tad muddled with tubes and need the solid state to tighten them up a bit as well as to bring out the mids. 

Disclaimer #2 - At the end I'll name a ""winner"" based on which setup wins the most songs. I do understand that this may be influenced by song choice but I'm going to try to keep it as balanced as possible. Also impressions were done so that I wrote while the headphone in question was playing and named a winner based on a combination of which notes I took sounded better for the most part and memory to fill in the gaps because I want to rely on memory as little as possible as it can be more distorted than spur of the moment impressions. I did not supply ratings in stars or points as exactly what the scale means may entail different things for different people. I figured simply writing impressions would be more imformative. 

Disclaimer#3  - Don't stop reading after the first chunk of songs and think I'm a basshead and thus that this is unfair. I  just can't listen to bassy music late at night if I plan on sleeping. 

This shootout will be divided into sections based on genres 

Section 1 - Hip-Hop and Electronic

Song #1 - Survival of the Fittest by Mobb Deep

Denon - Loads and loads of bass here. It really captures the dirty feel of the song well due to the more forward less soundstagey presentation. Clean vocals. It takes this round. 

AKG - Close contender. The bassline had less impact although it was tighter which hurts the feel of the song a bit. It just sounds less gritty which fits the style better. The soundstage does make the hook sound better as it provides a presentation that puts it at the extreme left and right while the bassline goes in the center which is interesting.

Winner: Denon D2000

Song #2 - Strobe by Deadmau5

AKG - Absolutely insane. Things are going on everywhere due to the massive soundstage and there is no shortage of bass kick and subbass when necessary. It really showcases the things that I love most about this headphone namely its ability to layer different parts together as well as present sound in a way that different things occupy entirely different spaces so it feels like things are playing in different pockets of space so to speak. They also have a very large amount of snap on the clap sounds which I find very awesome. The sparkle in the melody is also amazing. 

Denons - Good - As expected bass presence is greater with this setup which makes it very fun in its own right. A much closer together presentation which I feel does a disadvantage to this song because one of its best qualities is its ability to entrance the listener through the way that it uses soundstage. In addition the claps could use more emphasis. 

Winner: AKG K702

Song #3 F**k S**t Stack  Reggie Watts

Denons - As usual the strength here is its ability to extend and the impact that the beatboxing has in this case. It sounds better than other songs mentioned such as the Deadmau5 song because the impact occurs lower in the frequency spectrum than clap sounds. This song doesn't use a particularly massive soundstage so I don't find its presentation style to be a big deal at all.

AKG K702 - Less impact than the denons. Vocals slightly more forward. Small sections which do use an expansive soundstage sounds better. 

Winner Denon D2000

Song #4 - Harlem Streets by Immortal Technique

Denon D2000 - Absolutely terrific. Subbass is very prominent, you can feel the direction of the scratching done on the turntable shift, and the snare kicks have a large amount of body. Soundstage on the drums that spend most of their time in the left side are weak so they don't fit in the best. Guitar sounds very warm and melodic. Vocals are clear and non sibiliant.

AKG K702 - Absolutely terrific in its own right. Tighter than the Denons presentation, less subbass but its definitely there. Drums which are highly biased towards each side sounds prominent. You can still feel the direction of the turntable shift. Vocals are cleaner. Less bass quantity. 

Winner: Very very slight edge to the K702 for its clarity and separation

Song #5 - How To Be Eaten By A Woman by The Glitch Mob

AKG K702 - Super super clean. Synth is amazing here not because of its rattle but because of the fact that the soundstage works great with the exaggerated presentation that that they use. Very good separation and the parts that should kick do it fairly well. Subass is lacking a bit. 

Denon D2000 - This song doesn't particularly need a massive soundstage so that's not a problem. What soundstage it does have it uses effectively. Synth has more impact and rattle to it which makes it a fair amount better here. In addition the more full way that these headphones present drum sounds gives it an edge.
 
Winner - Denon D2000

Song #6 - Germany to Germany by Ratatat

Denon D2000 - This song really shows what these headphones do best especially during the fade in intro which is go from a thinner sound when necessary to a full on wall of sound which it is necessary. Synth sounds wonderful and full and even on the FIIO which has a relatively cold opamp in it in the OPA2134 it still sounds very warm and musical. As expected bass is terrific and the extension is wonderful. 

AKG K702 - Massive soundstage which creates a wall of sound in its own right as Ratatat really uses all of the space available. Cleaner, smoother, more laid back sound which I think really works well for this song. More detailed and the higher synth notes sound smother as well. These extend well and aren't bass lite at al. 

Winner AKG K702

Song #7 - 2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted - 2pac and Snoop Dogg

AKG K702 - Nice separation,  subbass is very nice and the backup vocals are well placed on the left and right side. Hi-Hat Snaps are very very tight and impactful which is terrific. They're bassy enough that I thought these were the Denons for one second so as you can tell I'm not with those of you who call them bass light.

Denon D2000 - This one is going to surprise a bunch of you - I prefer the lower bass stuff on the akgs here as I think its much tighter which works better with the way the riff is designed which is that there is a bit of space in between synth bursts that the akgs communicate better. Doesn't extend much lower than the akgs at all. Less snappy and smaller soundstage. Vocals are more recessed on the Denons

Winner AKG K702

Section 1 Score - AKG K702 4 Denon D200 3

Section 2 - Rock (Includes Alternative, Emo, Screamo, Punk, Ska-Punk, Black Metal etc just for efficiencies sake)

Song#1 - Schism by Tool

AKG K702 - Bass riff comes out well in the intro,  soundstage is a bit of a disadvantage here as I think one of the strengths of tool is their ability to create a wall of sound. The presentation of the akgs is a bit distant and while it's an interesting take on things I don't think it fits the song very well. Guitars are very sharp and edgy which is nice but the biggest letdown is the lack of togetherness of the presentation.

Denons - Uhhh wow. The musicality that these have really complements tools sound. The guitars have more crunch than harsh edge which I prefer a lot better on this recording. Drums have a more full and less distant impact than the akgs which really helps out the way that they sound. The darker presentation also works really well for the Tools gritty, industrial sort of sound. Mids don't sound recessed at all on this setup so vocals come out nicely. 

Winner: Denon D2000

Song #2 - Laid to Rest by Lamb of God

Denon D2000 - This is fricken insane. The guitar attacks relentlessly, there is a massive wall of sound and the growls just sound absolutely nuts. Just wow. I'm in shock. 

AKG K702s - Great, nice separation, vocals more forward. Just doesn't have the same relentless attack that the Denons do that is quite honestly terrifying. 

Winner: Denon D2000

Song#3 - New Noise by Refused

AKG K702s - Sound nice but that's the problem. I didn't get slammed nearly enough on the guitar entries or the short chord punches during this song. The screams sounded very nice and the song detailed but I need agressiveness on a song like this and the AKGs just didn't have enough. 

Denon D2000 - Much more aggressive than the AKGs which makes the loud sections as well as the off kilter guitar riff  have a more powerful effect. Screams sound more aggressive too and this just has a more forward feel to it which works great with punk. Bass kicks also have more punch which is very nice 

Winner: Denon D2000

Song #4 - Sell Out by Reel Big Fish

Denon D2000 - Horns are very strong which sounds great, guitar is nice and tight, mids aren't recessed at all so vocals are pretty prominent.  Harmonies are nice and smooth.

AKG K702 - Upstrokes come out cleaner on this setup, horns sound great, vocals are more forward, sounds smoother an energetic. 

Winner AKG K702

Song #4 - Point/Counterpoint by Streetlight Manifesto

AKG K702 - Acoustic in the intro sounds great. Vocals are awesome very forward, horns are clean and separate. Electric sounds great. Nice separation and very detailed. The soundstage really shines when they place different horn parts on opposite ends of the soundstage.

Denons - Sounds pretty energetic, presentation is darker -- more of the lower end in the horns and guitar comes out compared to the trebly feel of the akgs which I enjoyed more than the denons. More bassy. Vocals a tad recessed, not very much though. 

Winner AKG K702

I'm too lazy to go through all the text removing them)

Pros: Good bass, very ""fun"" sound for electronic music
Cons: Not the best sound for other genres other than electronic music

Just got these headphones a couple of hours ago, and I'm writing this while listening to them out-of-the-box and unamped.

And since this is my first review, I hope you'll find it useful. And I'm trying to focus on the musical aspect, not really technical, especially because I'm not really familiar with all the terms smile.gif

First things first: I bought these for their ""fun"" sound, and this is what I'm focusing on on this ""review"". These are by no means, the most clear, detailed, balanced sound you can find, specially in this price range. That being said... let's start. I separate this review in:

1. Design / Build / Comfort

2. Sound

3. Accessories

4. Value

5. Conclusion


**1. Design / Build / Comfort**

As most of you should know, V-Moda has some very nice designs. Photos really don't do justice to the LP2s.

As for the build, you can really feel the quality when holding them. They seem extremely tough, while still looking sleek (unlike the HD 25-1, that feels like a tank and looks like a tank).

Comfort-wise, I'd say they're quite comfortable. I use glasses, and most headphones annoy me after 30 minutes / 1 hour. But I've been using the LP2 for almost 2 hours now, and while they don't ""disappear"" on my head, I feel I can go on using them for a longer time (and I haven't even bent the headband to loose the clamping force a bit).


**2. Sound**

Well, like I said, these are not balanced (they really have strong bass), and they're not very clear and detailed. But for electronic music (drum and bass, dubstep, house...), they're really ""musical"" and fun!

I'll admit I was expecting more from the sound, but once I played a techno set (MP3 320kbps), I got myself ""dancing"", and I realised for the reason I bought these cans, they're really worth it! The bass is impressive, mids and highs are a bit muffled but they're still quite clear considering the amount of bass.

Unfortunately, for other genres, the bass is too strong, and even lowering thru EQ, the mids and highs are not as clear as in other headphones, like the HD 25-1. So, to my ears, the LP2 is really tuned for bass-heavy electronic music (and by tuned, I mean in a fun way, not analytical way).

Listening to this track house (http://soundcloud.com/frenchexpress/malinchak-if-u-got-it), the bass and sub-bass are really present, while vocals remain clear and highs a bit crisp (again, considering the bass amount).

To sum up, it's a very bass-biased sound, but mids and highs are still there (unlike the Beats Solo). The sound is very fun, and I'd even say it's like a club sound around your ears (considering one goes to a club to have a good time, not really analyze the soundsystem biggrin.gif).


**3. Accessories**

Wow! Accessories! A nice case, 2 cables, an extra pair of shields, small cloth for cleaning the shields, 1/4"" adapter... after getting the DT-660 and finding only a pair of headphones and a 1/4"" adapter inside the box, opening the LP2 box felt like Christmas when I was child!


**4. Value**

This is the most subjective part of the review... I wanted a pair of around-ear headphones, but not so big (like the Pro 900) so I could still use them as my portable cans. Also, I wanted a very fun, club-like sound (I listen to a lot of electronic music).

For this reason, and considering the build quality and all the accessories, I think the price is quite fair. They're not cheap, but I wouldn't say they're expensive either (I got them new for 164 EUR at Amazon).

Are there better-sounding cans in this price range? Sure... I have the HD 25-1 II, and while I admit their sound is much better (sonically) than the LP2, for me, they're not as fun and engaging as the LP2 can be.


**5. Conclusion**

I'm really happy with my purchase. I was quite worried due to the high amount of bad reviews, but decided to pull the trigger and was not disappointed!

If you're searching for a pair of good-looking, portable, around-ears headphones, with a fun, bass-heavy sound to listen to electronic music, you should consider the LP2.

My ModMic broke after a short amount of usage - 1 to 2 weeks. The magnet inside of the microphone portion that hooks the microphone to the headphone popped out, and because it was either pressure set or something was bent or other issues, it would not go back in.

I contacted GTDevice.

No response after 3 days.

I contacted GTDevice again.

No response after another day.

I contacted GTDevice a third time, and quickly received a response. It was explained to me that the previous emails had never been received - that's fine, I've got a hold of you now!

I told them what my problem was and they said they'd ship the cap and mount parts to me free of charge. Cool! Though, I had expected to need to send the microphone in, and, as a result, had removed the adhesive from the headphone. No problem! They'll send one of those too.

So the package ships. 4-5 days and it should be here!

5 days pass - email in the inbox. The package had been returned because of an error on their end. It's now on its way to me again.

Overall, the support has been... well, I'm getting what I want, and it's only a little slow. Still, the downright politeness and courtesy that I've gotten is paramount. No marketing speak, just down to earth explanations, simple answers and no excuses.

Source: Aune T1 tube amp. Said to be able to power 600 ohm headphones.

Requirements for isolation: None

Preferred Tonal Balance: Fun, V shaped. Bass should be tight, but plentiful. Not overflowing and exhausting like crappy car audio systems ie: stock mazda3. Rented that car last weekend - awful awful sound.

Past tried headphones: V-Moda M80, Incase Sonic, Beyerdynamic DT880 250 Ohm, Beyerdynamic DT880 600 Ohm, Sennheiser HD700, Shure 440 and 840, Grado SR80i, SR325i.


Currently looking at the Beyerdynamic DT990.


For reference, the other headphones I'm considering are the Philips X1, the V-Moda M100 (I don't like the M80's neutrality), the Sennheiser HD 600.


I've been looking high and low for a pair of great phones to have at home. I've tried HD700s, all the Grados and a bunch of AKGs. I own a pair of V-Moda M80s.


I'm looking for something with a little more of a fun sound signature. Tried the 880s and found them to be more neutral. I don't like neutral so much as ""fun"".


The thing is, I find that headphones from 100-300 fall into a ""similar quality of sound but either more neutral or more fun"" category. The sound doesn't improve much but the different equalizers change.
I've already had and tried a lot of headphones in the past. I'm hoping the DT990 is going to break my idea of this category of headphone. I want something that really blows my mind. For example, I love Grado SR 325is but they're more for rock and unless you have a really bass-biased amp, I don't think I'll get the sound I want,.. 


The only thing holding me back on the DT990 is the price. With a price this low, I'm scared that it won't perform. I know it's wrong to judge by price, but at this point, I don't want to be pouring in increments of sub-$300 into headphones if I never get fully satisfied. I've been willing to drop up to $450 for a while but haven't found anything perfect.


Can /r/headphones provide some feedback on the DT990, the pricing and perhaps suggest a better phone?",,False,,t5_2rcyx,False,,,True,t3_1k9bho,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1k9bho/fun_headphone_for_300450_sick_of_the_same_tier_of/,

At school I work in an architecture studio- its a very tall vaulted room that echoes quite a bit of noise if it gets loud. We work at individual desks at our own computers. I don't need to worry a LOT about bothering other people with my music since it is an open area and not a library but I still don't want to be overly noisy.

**Budget**- $150-$300. $300 is really my upper limit I'm willing to spend.

**Source**- I'll be using my desktop computer to play music, games, movies etc. The headphones will rarely move from my desk so portability isn't really an issue.

**Isolation**- I don't mind having outside noise and a little bit of outside noise is fine- having people hear me from 10' away is fine but I don't want to be audible from 50-60' away across the studio.

**Headphone type**- I'd prefer full sized headphones. I'll be wearing them for hours on end so comfort is a must.

**Tonal Balance**- I listen to a wide variety of music so I require balance. I do play games so good bass (though not overpowering) is important.

**Past headphones**- My current pair are Sony MDR-XB700. I like the comfort and full sound but the mids and highs seem to be lacking.

**Music**- Classical to EDM and everything in between. Like I said- I require a balanced sound.

Here's a review.,13,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1dislx/just_got_some_rockit_r50s_iems_120_heres_a_review/,"I received my newly-ordered Rock-it R-50s in the mail today and figured, since it's an IEM at a pretty popular price range, I'd review them for this subreddit. There are other reviews at Head-fi also, if you want to learn more. But these are my experiences.

Setup:

* iPhone 5 &gt; Rock-it R-50

Compared to:

* ODAC &gt; O2 &gt; AudioTechnica ATH-M50
* ODAC &gt; Bottlehead Crack with speedball &gt; Sennheiser HD 650

[Unboxing album with some extra blurbs](http://imgur.com/a/5B00I)

To begin the review...

**Boxing**

I don't really care about boxing, but some people do, and I often see it in reviews. So I'll tell you about the packaging. The boxing on these is minimal, which is fine. It looks like the headphones are marketed toward teenagers, given the styling of the box. Their [website](http://www.rockitsounds.com) is similar. This contrasts most of my gear, which is targeted to more adult audiences. But I tried not to make judgment yet.

**Accessories**

The R-50s come with a nice clamshell case, which is rigid in construction yet soft to the touch due to the fiber weave. It reminds me of a Skullcandy case I had years and years ago. They didn't skimp on this part, which is good given the price of these IEMs (though they don't cost as much as what some of you have!).

The tips provided are minimal for what I would consider ""acceptable."" Three sizes of silicone tips are provided. They are all single-flanged. They fit *alright*, but I personally prefer deeper seating, given my experience with Etymotics in the past. That being said, they isolate about as I'd expect a single flange tip to isolate. Not as good as an Etymotic tip or a custom, but there's quite enough passive isolation.

They came with an airline adapter. This is weird, I think. But whatever, you get an airline adapter. Maybe it's useful for those of you who fly a lot.

**Build Quality**

I think the construction is pretty good. The braided cord seems a little flimsy and thin, but at the same time has held up well to my handling. I won't really know until I use them for awhile. Hopefully they'll do better than my Etymotics that sheared in several places.

The housings are made of plastic with a rubber coating. They seem pretty durable. Like I said, no way to know until I use them for a few years.

There is memory wire near the housing at the area that goes over your ear. I think it's pretty nice, and it helped them stay in place when I put them on. But at the same time it made them stiffer and movements of my hair or ears made them move slightly. This is another thing that I haven't decided is good or bad.

**Sound Quality**
The part you've been waiting for. I'm going to break this down into lows, mids, and highs.

*Lows*

The lows on these are present, but not heavy at all. Impact is decent, but not great. The bass sounds great, however, in that is it clean, precise, and fast. Personally, I prefer this type of bass, so it works great for my taste. These are by no means, however, a basshead IEM.

*Mids*

The mids are the star of the show. I really like mid-centric headphones that are clean, clear, inspiring, and beautiful. These IEMs provide very nice, analytical, crisp mids that are pretty forward. They are not full and juicy like my HD 650s with Bottlehead Crack, but cool and crisp, like a chilled glass of water compared to a mug of hot chocolate. They are impactful and precise, but not thin. They're definitely thinner than my HD 650s, but not unsubstantial. The detail of the mids is excellent, particularly for this price point.

*Highs*

The treble on these are wonderful, also, but not as good as the mids. I like forward treble, so it works for me, but some people may think of them as a little harsh. They're sparkling, crystal clear, and lively. Everything is very detailed and crisp. The highs on these are actually better than the HD 650s, in my opinion - but only ever so slightly. That's probably because I think forward treble is a good thing, and the HD 650s definitely don't have forward treble, especially with a tube amp.

**Synopsis**

These are very good IEMs for the price. They are not bass-heavy by any means, and are not for the basshead. Bass is detailed and clean. Mids are extremely good - detailed, crisp, and precise. The highs are very good - the provide a forward, clear experience with possible sibilance to the the sensitive. The build quality is good, accessories are minimal. Overall, very good value at $120.

I wanted CIEMs for a while now but wasn't really prepared to shell out a lot of money for them. So when I heard about [Cosmic Ears \(CE\)](http://www.cosmicears.com/) I jumped at the chance of getting a pair of affordable CIEMs.

I opted for the ""Sport"" model from the old line-up. This is a single balanced armature with an emphasis on bass. I happen to like bass so for around 100 euros without shipping this sounded like a good deal.

Well, unfortunately, most of what could go wrong did go wrong but Phil Gartell from CE made everything good so I'll just focus on the monitors for this review.

* **Making impressions** You have the option to buy a DIY kit from CE to make your own impressions but since I had three sets of impressions made at an audiologist which all weren't good enough, I'm not too sure how an amateur could get better ones. One tip though: clean your ears before making the impressions. Earwax interferes with the molding process.

I decided to go ahead and have the monitors made inspite of less than perfect impressions. This does mean that CE couldn't give me a warranty on fit, but we proceeded anyway.

* **[How they look](http://imgur.com/a/gVAo2#6)** As you can see, they are a gorgeous translucent purple and, inspite of the issues with the impressions, they fit perfectly. These are full-shell and are, as a consequence, huge. Nevertheless, they are flush with my ears and do not give me a cramped feeling like you'd get with a IEM that goes deep into your earcanal. But make no mistake, these monitors go deep aswell.

My reference monitors are the RE0s and the Panasonic RP-HJE900. Two distinctly different IEMs that cost about the same. I like the RE0s for their analytical clarity, but they're not ""fun"". The Panasonics are fun and a fantastic allrounder but alas, replacement cables are hard to find.

* **How do they sound?** *Listening to them right now on a Cowon J3, no Jet effects. Music ranging from electronic, bass-heavy dance music to Slayer, modern classical, folk, ambient and some pop at mostly 320kbps mp3s.* 

* **Bass** These monitors are bass-heavy but seem to roll-off before extending down to 20hz. Bass is snappy and detailed, warm but not pushy. To me the bass is presented as-is, naturally. I quite like it, tbh.

* **Mid-range** Slightly veiled but not recessed with adequate separation/sound stage. I find the mid-range to be detailed, very much so actually. It opens-up the music and makes you listen carefully to what's going on. Good stuff!

* **High-end** Just a touch of sibilance at higher volumes and I can't say there's a sparkle or airiness to the high-end but it's sufficient, I guess.

In conclusion: If you are looking for affordable CIEMs that sound great Cosmic Ears is a no-brainer. Could you get better sounding IEMs for around 100 euros? I don't doubt it to be honest, but what fit and comfort is concerned, nothing beats CIEMs. And as far as soundquality goes: they beat the RE0s with ease.

I'm specifically looking for headphones this time around, since I have a good standalone mic now. This seemed like the place to go, but this is all new to me so bear with me a bit x_x

I use my headphones with my PC, which primarily involves gaming and music. My music is largely instrumental, and would probably lean towards the likes of rock and classical. I also use my headphones with my PS3. 

I use my headphones whenever I am at my PC, which is 6+ hours every single day. As such, comfort is very important (although, sweaty ears isn't something I've found to be a problem). With so much use, I also need durability. My last two headsets each lasted about a year, which I don't want to become a trend.

I'm not particularly concerned with leakage or isolation. I live with other people and tend to like being aware of what's going on still, so a lack of isolation is something I see as a plus (but not a dealbreaker). I tend to be in my own room though, so leakage isn't really a concern either. Perhaps contrary to all that, I tend to prefer a Circumaural design, but so long as it's comfortable I have nothing aginst supra-aural. In-ear is out of the question.

When it comes to the actual sound quality, I am not especially picky. I'm not an audiophile. I do appreciate good quality, but I'm basically looking for the best quality I can get after all other concerns have been met.

Aside from that, cord length isn't particularly important, but I need a 3.5mm jack. I would like a single cord as opposed to a Y, and in-line volume control is a big plus, but not a dealbreaker. I'm not interested in also getting any kind of amp or what not.

I'm looking to spend around $80-140, but for the right pair I could go a touch higher. Also, I live in Ontario (Canada), so shipping and all that. 

The top contender so far seems to be the Sennheiser HD 518, but getting them in Canada for a good price seems tricky. 

Anyways, any other suggestions to add to the list? I've got time before my current headset gives out, so I really want to find the right candidate.

I submitted this over on r battlestations but people don't have too much interest. 

Here are my comments:
I don't know about ""favorites"", they all do their own thing, but I'll give some brief comments.


**LCD3** 
Fantastic all around. It's hard to find fault in the sound. The bass, specifically, is amazing and very clear. When you try these for the first time (or the LCD2s), you will get a feel for what ""extended"" bass sounds like. It is very clearly not a 1 note thud. Many claim that LCDs are uncomfortable, I actually find them to be quite comfortable. Really the only negatives is that you can't tilt your head forward too much (e.g. looking down when reading / writing), and under the cups it does get a little warm where the leather touches your skin. I have to lift the ear pads up from time to time and rub the skin quickly to clear it. Another note - burn in ACTUALLY exists for these. The membrane is tight when you get them. They sound incredibly muddy. Give it ~24 hrs and it gets so much clearer. (I never believed in burn in before. I am now willing to admit that at least for planars, it exists.)


**HD650** 
Fantastic. Best value of the bunch. Does almost nothing wrong. Even head-to-head with the LCD3 it does a fantastic job. Buy these and know you are getting 80% of top of the line sound! I love them. The only negative, you are kind of removed from the music, they aren't quite as in your face as they could be. It's sort of like you're sitting at the back of the concert hall. They are the most comfortable headphones I own. The clamping was a little tight when I first got them.


**Grado SR325is** 
I was a little disappointed with the build quality / comfort of these. The clip that holds the cups to the headband is slightly broken on mine. I guess I can send them in for repair. I checked my buddy's pair and he has the same problem! I also can't wear them for long periods of time. The ear pads don't distribute the weight evenly and they kind of jut into your ear.   The sound is fun, at the expense of fidelity. This is an exaggeration, but essentially what these sound like is everyone took your songs and equalized it so that the treble is roughly the same brightness level. It makes for a really clear / fresh sound. That sounds like a negative but it's really not. For short periods of time it's interesting. Further, at low listening levels these sound great!


**Audio Technica ATh-M50s** 
I like the sound quality on these. They are a step up from most headphones on the market. That being said, I personally find the ear pads to be uncomfortable. They make my ears more sore than any other headphone that I own. I gave these to my roomate eventually and he does not report having the same problem.


**Bose QE15** 
Do they have the best sound in the world? No. But they do what they are intended to do very well, they provide decent sound quality with excellent noise cancellation and comfort. These cans are very comfortable. I put them on whenever I go on trips, my roommate has someone over, or I just really need to concentrate. I think everyone should have one pair of closed / noise cancelling headphones.",,False,,t5_2rcyx,1360342814.0,,,True,t3_184xb2,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/184xb2/my_new_lcd_3s_and_battlestation/,

I got the straight cabled version and I used electrical tape to bundle a section together to make it shorter, so the cable length isn't a problem any more.

I got them for 110$ brand new.

Sound Quality: These things sound pretty nice, lots of bass but not enough for it to be obnoxious, mids are nice too.

Highs are just a slight bit harsh but I only really notice on a few songs.

the soundstage is pretty narrow, but these are closed headphones.

Isolation is pretty good, these block sounds well and also don't leak hardly any sound.

Comfort: unfortunately these headphones do start to get a little bit uncomfortable after about an hour at which point I have to take them off.

Overall these are pretty good for public or home use, just not for long periods at a time.





HD 598

I got these for around 215$ off Amazon, kind of pricey in my opinion but I do really enjoy them

Sound Quality: these sound great, the wide soundstage is extremely appealing to me. The bass is a bit weaker than the m50's but it's not a turn off.

When I paired these with my fiio e07k I found the sound quality and bass to improve. I raised the treble because I felt it lacked some un amped (but that might be just me, I might be a slight treblehead? if that's a term)  

Comfort: these are really comfortable, I could wear them all day, way more comfortable than my m50s

Isolation: None, being open headphones these leak sound a lot, everyone will be able to hear what you're listening to within the same room. I would not use these in public.

the one downside to these headphones is that they don't feel as sturdy as I would like, but I don't plan on bringing them outside the house so it shouldn't be a problem


Overall for just home use I would say the HD 598 beats the m50, but I constantly use both these headphones and would recommend them both for anyone looking for an entry level pair.

I am no expert on the subject, but I thought I'd give it a shot.


Little background on me. I am a ska kid who loves all music has to offer. From jazz to punk, from orchestra to acoustic singer/songwriters I dig it all. I had originally bought a pair of Sennheiser HD 280s for use in a studio our drummer is building. He is going to school for audio engineering and recording and he helped me pick out a good set of headphones to spend on. I fell in love with the higher quality sound I was getting. The problem was I could not wear them for long periods of time. They made my ears sweat and clamped rather hard. Great when monitoring or listening to a mix down, but NOT so much when trying to kick back and enjoy music. This caused me to look around. With my birthday coming up and no one really knowing what to get me I usually get money from relatives. These headphones where the result. My listening background comes from studio monitors (one set of yamaha hs80ms and one set of M-Audio) and my HD 280s, as well as various crappy ear buds, and a pair of razer gaming headphones. So lets get started


* Comfort: As I said part of the reason for the upgrade was a comfort level that wasn't being achieved before. These things fit like a glove. The cups seem to fit my head just tight enough to make a good seal and sit perfect on my head without worrying at all. The velour pads are comfortable and I have been wearing them hours on end every night since I got them listening to various music and such without any sort of discomfort. Big plus side to these, because in my opinion a headphone should not only sound great but allow you to listen to your source audio for as long as you want without even thinking of them being on your head. These are the first headphones I have had that really achieve that.

* Jazz: I love me some good jazz, and everything I listened to seemed faithful here. The horns hit perfect. I heard these headphones really shine in the highs and they did not leave me disappointed. It was amazing. The horns seemed to really pop and come alive. 

* Ska: I love ska, but most bands in the genre lately can not afford decent recording equipment. But I took my tardis and went back to the age of two tone for my listen here. I went with both Madness and The Specials and neither disappointed. It isn't the ""quickest"" music, but after hearing that these headphones can sometimes have troubles with fast music I put on One Step Beyond just to see what was up. They not only kept up but I was noticing extra instruments I hadn't got a chance to hear in the rhythm section. The bass line chugged along and gave a great feel to it.

* Blues: Eric Clapton provided a beautiful way to test music of various tempos of one of my favorite genres. His vocals came through admirably. He has a way of sucking you in without you realizing and these headphones highlighted that vocal tone well. His guitar popped well. His solos where clean and precise. I went from Layla to Change the World and both where amazing to listen to. There is a certain magic to the blues in different tempos and I can't wait to get more from other blues greats in less lossy formats (my bb king was my dads ripped... around 200 kbps... sad sad day. I went in on his computer recently and switched his zune software to rip at least 320 mp3...)

* Electronic: I also like some techno from time to time so I took a listen to some techno I had on hand. Deadmau5 and Daft Punk where on the menu here. I am not a basshead, and sometimes worry about speakers and headphones when listening to techno which is always mixed bass heavy giving more bass and ruining my experience. I am here to say with these not a problem. The low end seemed to come out at just the right time with both of these artists. Good techno music for me lives and dies by the artist knowing how to sculpt his bass in a way that it is highlighted but never interferes with the melody (one of the reasons I don't like Skrillex and the other dubstep oriented folks). I also was planning on watching Tron Legacy. Got the blu-ray and wanna see what a good score will do to these headphones in a movie setting, but I have not had the chance yet.

Pros: Great sound in a comfortable package. I already feel like I got my moneys worth with these headphones. Perfect sound for me. Some may not like the low end, but as I have said I am no basshead. I prefer my bass to have a nice punch but not be overpowering. These headphones deliver that. The bass isn't recessed and low like I was worried about. It has a punchy authority but you never have to worry about it getting muddied in the mix. The mids and highs really sing. Vocals are beautiful. Also it is being driven on my Bithead dac/amp combo and is proving not super hard to drive. 

Cons: While not a deal breaker for me these headphones have a bit of a weird construction. The plastic throughout is light and provides a great experience when kicking back and just LISTENING. If you are going to wear these out a lot I would be worried traveling with them. For me they are going to be on my desk a lot so I don't mind it, but the connection to the cups and the ear band seems like if pulled just a little to hard it'd pop straight off. Other then that though it has a nice give in the band though that allows a nice fit on your head. 


Overall I am SUPER happy with my purchase. I am becoming a bit of a Sennheiser fan, and my ears have thanked me.",,False,,t5_2rcyx,False,,,True,t3_v6u9j,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/v6u9j/was_requested_so_here_is_my_first_review/,

Back in the summer of 09', I was inspired to consolidate my audio paraphernalia. These headphones have lasted me a long time, and are absolutely wonderful closed cans; I had them long before I started modding them, but now that they're supremely portable **40gb**, (8+32gb) **20 hour** cans... I use them even more! =)  Those scratches accumulated over four years of toting.

In my current revision, I have a main input jack for the Clip+ that I installed after removing the cable and moving the internal diode board, as well as an auxiliary jack that automatically disconnects the Clip+ jack.  I also replaced the stock circular pleather earpads with plush oval pads that fit my ears better. I managed to fit a CMOY/button cells inside the right earcup, but I eventually took it out because I found it almost transparent.  The clip on the Clip+ was ripped off and the back sanded flat to reduce size and keep the cans foldable, while double-sided velcro was used to attach the Clip+.  I used a technique i learned from ""Captain Odegard"" to make the ultramini plugs; each component of the plug was separated and soldered individually, then epoxied together and finished with heatshrink.

In my first attempt, I left the clip on the Clip+ and I only installed one jack, and also integrated a CMOY amp into the right earcup, powered by a strip of button cells.  The amp was a great theory, but poorly executed; it wasn't worth the battery life and making the cell strip was not fun, and less fun to replace.  I also used a far-too-long 12-inch interconnect with standard size jacks.  I considered installing a bluetooth receiver where the amp was and almost did, but I decided against it since bluetooth sucks.  Also, I Rockboxed the Clip+, so yes... I'm playing helicopter on my headphones in one of those pics.  Also plays FLAC, OGG, yadda yadda... sorted by tags and folders.

I'd like to use this money to enhance/add to my current setup (I even have buy-in from my SO!). Good folks of /r/headphones what should I do?

My current setup:

* Musical Fidelity M1CDT
* Musical Fidelity M1DAC
* Decware CSP2+ (SET, OTL preamp/headphone amp)
* Grado PS-500

Options I'm currently considering:

* Buying a second, non-Grado headphone.  Planar magnetics may be out here due to my amplifier - anything conventional up to 600Ω should be okay. Those of you that own multiple sets of headphones without running multiple setups - how do you handle this?  Do you just end up using only one pair, while the others sit unused?  Requirements here would be:
    * No isolation requirements (open is fine)
    * Full-sized
    * Relatively neutral (but not Etymotic flat - although I love my hf5's, they are fatiguing)
    * Previously used: CX300, Sony MDR-NC11, hf5, SR-80i, PS-500
    * Music: Mainly Classic 70's Rock, but also Jazz, Country, Pop, basically everything/anything.
* Investing in a vinyl source (i.e. turntable and pre-amp) - how many people here listen to vinyl through headphones?  Are headphones just too revealing for vinyl?  Am I just going to hear pops and crackles all the time?
* Power-amp(s) and bookshelf speakers, aka heresy.  Or possibly the two integrated together (powered monitors).  This was the original intent behind the CSP2+ - having it do double duty as a preamp and headphone amp.  This has various factors stacked against it atm... but just out of interest how many people have their main systems doing double duty like this (headphones &amp; speakers)?
* Quit buying shiny pieces of electronics, and earmark the money for spending on more music to play on my existing system.

I've not really included any streaming/HD based sources here - partly because nothing I've seen on the market really tickles my fancy here.  One of the reasons I like my current CD player based setup is that it's offline - which means I can sit back and listen with no IT related distractions (e.g. reddit).  I'm open to suggestions here though!

Mods: I'm hoping it's okay for me to not strictly follow the ""headphone recommendation"" format in this case, since I'm not asking for a straight headphone recommendation.

Either way, done some reading also at the recommendations etc btw like I said I'm quite new and yeah really cant make a choice I guess.

Let me help you with some info:
- I am willing to spend 100-300 dollars/euro's ( yes quite flexible, but the cheaper the better )
- plugging them into my phone mainly, but also PC.
- Isolation.. I'll use them mainly at public transport and in the gym
- I am not sure on what I prefer, full cover of my ears or on my ears.
- think I am looking for an overall good balance, but i like some bass.
- never really had headphones in the past
- I listen to all kinds of music, but mainly pop,hiphop,rap and rock

What an awesome read, this sounds like my situation! On this site you will find there is a free DSP that introduces 'crossfeed' to mitigate the 'superstereo' effect of headphone use. Furthermore, there are plugins ready for download for some popular media players:

Some more googling turned up this media player for OSX that includes bs2b natively:

1366574810.0,10,self.headphones,1ctflx,Cowon's Z2 PMP: the complete review,10,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1ctflx/cowons_z2_pmp_the_complete_review/,"This is not a 1-day review, this is not a week of use review, this is not a first impressions, not an unboxing.  None of that fluff, this is everything you could ever want to know about the Cowon Z2 that you would care about *using it as a media player.*

Basically, it's a fairly chunky $300 PMP, operates rather like crap, but sounds phenomenal. The headphones I have plugged into it (extensively) are, in order of how long I've used them with it, coincidentally they are also in order of headphone nirvana and goodness...:

* Shure SE215s

* Sennheiser IE80s

* Heir Audio 3.Ais

Sections will be in order of relative importance. 

----

##Sound Quality:

The Z2 is the best sounding device I own.  I don't have anything else really that decent, but it beats the living crap out of my old second gen iPod touch.  Comparing it to the Zune HD is rather interesting.  The zHD has a far stronger amp in it (I think ~5dB), but has much higher output impedance.  I'd estimate the zHD has somewhere around 6-8ohms output impedance, but no measurements are available that I could find.  The Z2, very importantly, has *output impedance below 1 ohm.*  There is not a headphone in the world that will have insufficient electrical dampening with it.  It will not(\*) alter any headphone's sonic character when it feeds them.  I don't think it would really be strong enough for 80 ohm or higher impedance headphones, not if you wanted to listen fairly loud anyway.  

Next up: response.  The Z2 is not an O2.  It is not perfectly level from 20/20k, it rolls off the ultra highs and ultra lows *around 2dB at the extremes,* it is not enough to be worrying, but the zHD does have noticeably *bigger* bass.  

Now, the Z2 has a *completely and utterly black background.*  My 3.Ais, at 17 ohms impedance and 107dB sensitivity don't reveal any hiss at all out of it.  If background noise bothers you, you will find none at all.  

The Z2 is incredibly detailed and finessed, *however* be wary.  If you buy music from iTunes, it tends to either screw up, or reveal something similar to vinyl pops but in the bass in iTunes files.  It does *not* happen if I make my own 256k VBR AACs, does not happen with 400k AACs, and does not happen with 512k AACs.  It is *not* an issue inherit in its AAC decoding.  The Z2 will not leave you wanting to pair it with an external amp to reap sonic rewards.  The Z2's stereo separation is also great, again, best in class...

----

##Operation:

The Z2 is clunky.  The D3 seems like it was a beta 0.5, and the Z2 feels like a beta 0.9.  The UI has between 1/4 and 1/2 second of delay on first swipe, which dies down to a noticeable, but not infuriating &lt;1/4s delay on subsequent swipes.  This ""resets"" in 7 seconds of not touching the screen.  Speaking of seven seconds, that's an important number.  The media buttons, play/pause/prev/next *stop working* after seven seconds of screen inactivity.  The volume controls continue to function, however.  That's pep peeve #1, if I stop playback to talk to someone or whatever, I need to turn the screen on to restart it.  The player also is extremely specific about files.  It supports every format under the sun, but to get artist/album/genre fields read correctly is random.  My library is ~20GB of content at the moment, and at the letter F it stops reading artist stuff correctly, despite the metadata being perfect, and defaults to artist being &lt;unknown&gt;, though it still interprets album correctly.  

The internet browser and wifi work fine for casual use, but are not the greatest for serious stuff.  The document app is useless, since it can't make files, only view specific types (and curiously, it can't open PDFs).  Android apps can be sideloaded, but the play store is not supported.  

The UI is good enough, and 90% of the time I'm just using the music app in folder view mode (my folders are artist -&gt; album) for the best browsing, and it works reasonably well for that.  The UI is much better on the zHD for music though, especially with on the fly playlist expansion.  

---- 

##Battery life:

Battery life is ok, it runs about 20 hours without using jeteffects.  With jeteffects in use, it gets ~14 hours.  

However, it cannot sleep.  The device is completely incapable of truly sleeping.  The sleep function merely turns the screen off, it won't even stop playback.  In sleep, it still eats the battery, dropping 14% overnight if you forget to turn it off.  If you turn it off, the meter will still say you lost 2-3% overnight.  It really can't hold a charge that well...

----

##Build Quality:

Build is *nice,* but it is not the little tank my zHD is.  The device must be mostly plastics, because it is very very light for its size.  The screen is covered in gorilla glass, and the rubberization of the whole backside makes it feel good in the hands.  I've dropped it 4ft into a thin layer of snow with ground beneath it and got some ""chewed pencil"" (but shallower) dings on the corner, nothing else.  

I've gotten it wet, rather wet from rain and snow, *not submerged or subjected to pressurized water* and it just chugged along.  Cowon makes no claims to it being waterproof, but it will not short out in rain.  

----

## Playback, JetEffects, &amp; Sound ""Enhancement""

Playback is smooth, but there are no gapless transitions.  There is a very small to very large gap between tracks, depending on CBR vs VBR, and filetype.  It isn't huge, but it's there.  When you resume or begin playback, it makes a little micro-skip, the first 20ms or something stops and starts again.  Not a huge deal, but every pause has that on it.  Rarely, but sometimes it will refuse to play a file; producing 5 seconds of silence followed by skipping to the next track.

The *physical* next and last buttons can have anywhere from zero to five seconds of delay on them, depending on track length, position, bitrate, and CvsVBR, that is *annoying as hell* very often.  The UI buttons have a consistent delay of somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 second.
JetEffects is a built in package of stuff run through the music app, it has an EQ, a reverb thing, and some bass and stereo modifications.  The EQ is really, really nice, and behaves very much like a hardware EQ.  You get 3 programmable frequencies per band, wide/normal/narrow band, 5 bands, and +/- 12 units (not dB) per band to adjust with.  The EQ is really nice, only JetEffects feature I would use.  There's ""Mach3Bass,"" guess what it does, and ""BBE+,"" an artificial stereo widener that I would never use.  

----

##The bottom line

The Z2 is a hell of a playback device.  Most of it is flaky, but it sounds exceptionally good, and has a touchscreen for speed of navigation.  The lag times and lack of snappiness suck, hard, the battery life isn't great, and the lack of working sleep sucks, hard, but it has no competition.  There's the iPod, offering 423423414134 other functions in the same package, but worse sound output.  There's sony's players, which don't sound as good, have no microSD card slot, and don't have the file support.  There's the zHD, which is decapitated and doesn't sound as good.  It's unique in the touchscreen+fidelity+microSD combo, and if that's what you want, you are getting a Z2.  The X9 exists as well, but it is *very* sluggish (resistive, not capacitive touch) and bulky.  

It's... worth it if you can afford it, and the only better sounding players are usually bigger, heavier, have worse battery life, and have godawful UIs while costing over 2x as much .  There is no way to get straight DAC output (unless you could get audio over USB working in the newest android, but I am not sure the firmware can be updated to that, Cowon doesn't have a DL for it), but the SQ and low impedance make that a nonissue, unless you need to drive some hungry cans, for that I would probably start looking at an iPod + line out -&gt; DAC -&gt; AMP, but then you're transportable, not portable.

Source - I plan on buying either a O2/ODAC combo or a Magni and Modi, whichever suits the headphones better. 

Requirements for Isolation - I do not need any isolation, and I will be using them at home only. 

Preferred Type of Headphone - Full sized/over ear. 

Preferred tonal balance - Overall balance, with punchy(but not exaggerated) bass. 

Past headphones - Currently using crappy Turtle Beach X12s with a Xonar DG, so this will be my first real headphone set up, and I would prefer open headphones to closed. 

Preferred Music - Primarily rap, rock, electronic, and classical music. 

Location - Canada

So far I have come up with a few headphones but I still can't decide which: Hifiman HE-300, Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro (250OHM), and finally the AKG K701. If there are any other headphones in my budget range that are any better, feel free to recommend.

Because of the nature of my job, I often need to dodge athletes, get down low and double over to reach the crap that rolls under cabinets, and somewhat rarely end up having the  phones tugged on. I like to work at a fast pace and move around a lot.

So I'm looking for headphones that are:

• Comfortable, yet fit fairly snugly. 

• Can fit through the port on the otter box lifeproof case (i5). 

• Durable, so that my wallet doesn't need to cry too much if they are mangled. 

• Great sound would be a huge plus, though I'm not expecting anything ridiculous like studio-level sound (I can't afford it even though the inner audiophile really really wants some, and I would never want them to get trashed). 

• Decent cord length. I'm 6'4"", so some headphones end up being just a bit too short for me. I can measure some old headphones that fit well if needed. 

• Last and least important would be a built in mic, but this is very low on the list and really a minor convenience to me.

I tend to wear them under my shirt to avoid most snags. I don't know quite how to express the tonal qualities I'm looking for, so I'll try listing some artists and music I like listening to:

Eisbrecher (Boese Maedchen)
Celldweller 
Pendulum (The Tempest, Dusk pt. 1)
Lindsey Stirling (Radioactive cover)
The Prodigy
Rammstein
Imagine Dragons
The Crystal Method
The Glitch Mob
Linkin Park
Phutureprimitive
VAST (Touched, Lost)
Rob Zombie
Zeromancer (Erotic Saints, Hollywood)
Explosions in the Sky
Nine Inch Nails
Kruder and Dorfmeister
Seven Lions
Madeon
Isosine

The following Soundcloud artists

VOICIANS
fuckmylife (deadmau5)
Kill Paris
Paul Udarov

Some dub/drum - step

And just for fun any of the Epic Rap Battles of History.

I listened to some Pink Floyd, LCD Soundsystem, Sex Machineguns, Dengue Fever and Glitch Mob while trying them out.  They ended up presenting warm highs that were clear and definitely not grating.

Also, according to Stereo Exchange, everyone in the store owns a pair of them and their sound engineer friends love them, etc. so, I want to believe, but my gut is telling me no.  

Thoughts?

EDIT: Another thing that threw me off was that one of their reviewers on Phonon's website, Carlos ""Storm"" Martinez, said he compared them against Sony 7502 and said they blew them away.

I have some very specific wants in headphones, I have looked at the guides in the sidebar, and tried a couple searches, and while I find myself going ""well this has most of what I want"", nothing seems to fit my exact need.

That being said, I know this subreddit gets almost nothing but requests for suggestions, so ... sorry, I don't know where else to look.


So, the following are the features that I would like in my pair of headphones:

* Mid-Range: $200-$300
* Closed: I'm a bit picky here, I own a pair of [these](http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-audio/razer-carcharias) currently, I bought them primarily because the cans are made of cloth, and they're closed. The one complaint I have with them is that the cans are **too small.** I don't like my ear being touched at all by the headphones, I'm looking for something that will encapsulate my ear without touching it. Comfort is a big factor for me as I plan to wear them constantly.
* Removable cord: This one is huge because I am constantly breaking my headphones's 3.5mm jack. I had a $120 pair of studio monitor's break that way, after a few failed solder attempts, I gave up and tossed them. I'd like to be able to replace the cord if the jack happens to break.

Something with a removable microphone would be nice, as it could replace my gaming headset as well, but it's not required.

these are going to be used primarily to listen to Ska, HipHop, watch movies, and play games on.

Sorry if I sound like an asshole.

1349477714.0,10,self.headphones,110mhj,A rather extensive review of the Beyerdynamic Custom One Pros!,11,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/110mhj/a_rather_extensive_review_of_the_beyerdynamic/,"These arrived in the mail on tuesday, and since then I've been trying every single type of music I own with different settings and different devices. I would like to put it out there that the only frame of reference I have for these headphones are the years I've been listening to the music mentioned in this review, and my other devices that I own: if you want to ask me a question about how they compare to the M50's or any other circumaural headphones, I'm afraid I cannot answer that. The only other experiences I've had with above-standard phones are the Beyer DT990's and the Klipsch X10's: and seeing as one of them is open-back and the other one is an IEM, it would be impossible to relate to them. So this is all just my opinion, but I'm going to try and make it as open as possible for you to make a decision. (Maybe it's a good thing I have no relational experience, no preconceptions?)

I tested these with a Cowon S9 and M-audio 2496 soundcard. This review is mostly done with the Cowon, but I can tell you the sound that comes out of the 2496 sounds largely the same as Cowon, if not a bit more powerful at low volumes.

First of all, the construction. These things are solid. The headband gives a little bit of lateral rotation just like most other Beyer cans, but it still feels sturdy. My DT990's have the same freedom, and after 6 years it's still not a problem. The leather ear pads that come with it feel a little hard which I'm sure will loosen up over time, however I've purchased some DT770/990 velour pads for it (more on this later) which are far more comfortable. The casing is made from a good quality plastic which doesn't look like it will break anytime soon. And of course, if it does, you can just replace the part! I know that the product has just launched and the accessories / spare parts catalogue is minimal at the moment: I'm assuming when the other two cans in the product line come out then the selection will become larger. 

An issue I encountered when I wanted to start listening to music on the go is that the cable that comes with it is 1.5m. This is too long to be moving about with, I'm not sure why it didn't come with a 1.2m cable like most other headphones: I'm guessing this is because they planned it more for home use? The cable is thick enough to not get tangled easily, and is replacable with a different cable if you wish. The connection is very tight into the body of the cans, further enhanced by a small slit in the cable that lines up with a dent in the body, and makes a satisfying click when it's pushed in. This particular cable isn't going to come out any time soon. I've ordered a 1.2m cable for the time being from amazon until I can find somewhere that will sell a proper Beyer cable, and I don't think I will have an issue with a generic cable. I know that they sell new ones on their website, but from the UK it's £5 for the cable plus £20 delivery. £25 in total, come on Beyer: you're not Monster are you?

So, the bass selector. I played about with it for a day or two and found the same as everyone else who has bought them: the 3rd setting is perfect. Fully opened, this is bass overload (perfect if you're into that sort of thing), fully closed and partially closed are too weak. I guess it really is all down to personal preference, but once you've been mucking about with it for a few hours, you'll find a setting you're happy with and probably never change it again. I haven't changed mine since Tuesday night.

Something to mention which I shouldn't be shocked about, but didn't expect it: the further you open the selector, the more sound leakage you'll get. It's not much, but if you're in a quiet room then it's better to close off the bass a bit if you don't want to disturb anyone. This really only affects people who listen to the music loud, however if you do this then enjoy going deaf in your older age ;)

Even with the slider all the way open, the bass is clear and doesn't compress the rest of the spectrum. I can still hear the trebles as loudly as I can with it all the way closed. It really does only affect the bass, which is really nice when you are not used to it.

And now, the sound. I have a very wide taste in music, so I'm going to list a wide range of styles and what my opinion of them is. One thing I can definitely say, the infamous 'Beyer Mids'? Not here. I just can't hear any dip in sound in the mid-spectrum. When listening without EQ or effects, I can hear those frequencies perfectly fine, the bass and treble does not overpower the mids in any way. My DT990's seem to have this, so that is one thing I can be sure of :)

OK, lets get on to the music. I'll list the actual songs / albums I listened to, so you have a better idea of what I experienced.

**Rage Against The Machine - Eponymous** - One of my favourite albums of all time, and consequently I've read that it's a brilliant way to test speakers due to it's pureness: no SFX, no samples, just 4 guys, 4 instruments and a clean recording. First thing I noticed was the bass kick. I shit you not, I have *never* heard it that clean. The cans provide a fairly hefty punch every time, and combined with a bass guitar, the lower frequencies never feel like they are struggling for power. Morello's guitar work is on show here, hearing subtleties in his work. The vocals do seem to take a backstage to everything else, but what I can hear is concise.

**Daft Punk - Discovery** - The soundstage is huge (as Daft punk planned, I believe), and you can really hear the compression around the basskick prominently (again, I think they planned that too). What results is a very strong sounding experience.

**Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here** - That guitar solo at the beginning of Shine On stands out. I started to notice a pattern throughout my testing, the drums on most albums seems to have it's own soundstage seperate to the rest of the music. This is no exception, the toms and hats are just gorgeous.

**Hardcore to the bone - Vol. XVI** - I like gabber. There I said it. I wanted to include this because it's a full frontal assault on the headphones, with almost all frequencies being used at the same time with heavy distortion and fast changes. The cans managed to survive it, although I wasn't blown away by it: perhaps I'm just used to hearing it through DJ headphones, so the clarity that these headphones usually have just seem to lose some the genre's charm. Considering that not a lot of people listen to this genre, I don't think anyone needs to worry about this.

**Hans Zimmer - Inception OST** - hmmmm. The more ambient pieces were clear and beautiful, but the heavier orchestral pieces seemed to lack any high frequency, everything was in the bass and mids. This caused it to lose some of it's power, so I tried a different orchestral album to see if it was the recording or the headphones....

**Cinematic Orchestra - Les Ailes Pourpres** - I tried all of the Cinematic Orchestra's albums because I'm a big fan of them, but this in particular because of the aforementioned comment. Yeah, it's just Inception. This album came alive with it's plucked harps, soaring string sections and xylophone pieces that just radiate with goodness. CO's other albums were equally as good, really bringing to life the saxo's and the trumpets of Man With a Movie Camera. 

I could add more, but it's a long review anyway. I mentioned about the Velour pads earlier, and I can safely say that my ears are cool and comfortable. I haven't noticed any different in sound: not that I was expecting to, but I'm sure somewhere someone has asked that question. I think there might be a bit more leakage of sound, and there definitely is a different in noise isolation (I can hear a lot more around me with the velours). The leather pads are better at keeping sound out, but of course will get uncomfortable after a long period of wear.

A side note, I felt like the sound came alive when I added a custom EQ + BBS setup on my S9. Best mp3 player I've ever bought.

So yeah, overall, I like them. I think the only nuances are the cable and the size (they're huge!), but the cable is replaceable and size doesn't really matter anyway. I would recommend trying them before you buy though, as I'm sure someone with some more experience with other over-the-ear headphones will be able to make comparisons to other sets!",,False,,t5_2rcyx,False,,,True,t3_110mhj,http://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/110mhj/a_rather_extensive_review_of_the_beyerdynamic/,

Anyway, I plugged the O2 to my soundcard and the DT 880 to the O2 and hit play: nothing. I then tried my onboard headphone amp and the sound was fine. 

After a few tries the sound started working on O2, but it was skipping, and sometimes only the left channel worked. After wiggling it left and right and plugging it in and out a few times it's now working pretty well. However, my other headphones worked well, so it seems that the O2 input doesn't fit jack of the DT 880 perfectly? I hope it works from now on.

Then I did a left channel vs right channel test, and I immediately found another problem: the channels were reversed. I tried using another headphone amp so the problem was not O2, so the DT 880 is clearly faulty. However, I figured that I can use them just as well by just wearing them reversed. Returning them would take weeks so I don't think I'll do that. Sucks though if I ever happen to resell them.

That is another reason I was looking at the A700 over the AD700 (soundstage less important).  I'll be getting a zalman clip mic to go with whatever I get.

I checked some reviews and the AD700 seem to be great for wearing with glasses but couldn't find as much about the A700.

So hesitantly, using these two pages as guides, [1](http://www.head-fi.org/t/508459/sr60-mod) [2](http://gilmore2.chem.northwestern.edu/projects/showfile.php?file=grado_prj.htm), I dove in.  Now I'm a nervous dude, so letting my newly bought babies steam in nearly boiling water was not fun.  Nor was poking holes in felt an inch from the precious drivers.  But I did that, and more.  [Here](http://imgur.com/a/aQnnN) is a photo album of the mods I did.  I can't recommend doing these things enough.  The sound difference is absolutely enormous.  So now I ask: what do the wonderful and knowledgeable people of /r/headphones think?

I listen to a lot of bass heavy music, and I want a pair of comfortable cans as well. I'm also considering the ATH-M50's becasue they are slightly cheaper too.

Could you tell me which is best?

Also as far as audio quality what kind of formats give the best sound quality.

(I also have a pair of Logitech Z-2300 speakers for my computer that I love but I can't always use those.)

Anyways I'm budgeting myself to around $150 for the full headphone replacements and $50 for the IEMs.

The full-sized will be used for gaming, movies, and music, as well as Skype and the like. The IEMs will be used exclusively for music (iPod with at least V0) and iPad when I can't carry around the full-sized.

My musical tastes range from lighter stuff like The National/Depeche Mode/Mumford and Sons to hardcore/metal/hard rock with everything in between. So in general rock music I suppose.

Open headphones are fine, though there are times where that would be impossible to use respectfully I guess you could say, if an open pair is recommended I would pry pick up the cheap Monoprice for the other times. Besides that, comfort and cord-length are the only other important things I can think of since I'm pretty tall and have a weird head with windy ear canals. I know for both attachments/mods can be used though.

So from my research this is what I have found recommended at times-

Full-sized:

Audio Technica ATH-AD700 Open-air Dynamic Audiophile Headphones

Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone

Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO

Sennheiser HD 558 Headphones

Creative Aurvana Live! Headphones
	
Audio-Technica ATH-M50 Professional Studio Monitor Headphones

Others mentioned include Grados (don't remember the models)


IEM:

Monoprice 8320

Brainwavz Beta

Brainwavz ProAlpha

Brainwavz M1

So what does /r/headphones recommend?

Also, do I need an amp? Should I bother with a mic as I have a [Logitech desk mic](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-981-000246-USB-Desktop-Microphone/dp/B002RL84OY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341357123&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=logitech+mic)?

Anyways, thanks for reading and hopefully you can help.

The headphone buying guide and a few threads here were a huge help to me when choosing what would be best.  They're to be used as all-around headphones exclusively at my computer for gaming/music, so I was just looking for something well-balanced and moderately priced.  After using Bose QuietComfort for about 5 years... Wow, what a difference.  I'm not a huge audiophile by any means and I know I'm not even using the headphones to their potential, but I'm a big fan of spending your money on quality and getting what you pay for.  They're comfortable and everything sounds so much clearer and crisper--it just sounds ""clean"".  Even Diablo III is a world of difference. Before I would turn up my headphones really loudly just to get the sound out of them, now the volume is only about half-way and I'm hearing sounds that I've never heard before.  I saw people complaining that the bass notes on these didn't ""hit hard enough"" but considering I'm big into electronic and things like synth-pop the bass notes are perfectly fine, and anything heavier I think would be overbearing for prolonged use.  Anyway, thanks for being a solid resource and making a novice audiophile out of me... because I'll never go back.
