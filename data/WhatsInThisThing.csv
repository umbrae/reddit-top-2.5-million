So I got to thinking: how can we keep this sub alive?

Simple. This sub can be a catch-all for anyone who has acquired a safe, mystery box, piggy bank, briefcase, birthday present, treasure chest, oak barrel, thumb drive, bottle, locker, storage unit, abandoned home, bomb shelter, antique can, maybe even a confidential file. These people then post a picture of the object, and we as a sub can all guess what's hiding in said object.

So what do you guys think? Good idea? Share your thoughts.

***TL:DR - Not an April Fools joke, sorry. Decided to attempt to crack by hand and update weekly***

Hi safechasers :) Thanks for hangin' out. I took a brief Reddit holiday for a week to bury my Grandfather and decided to leave it for a bit longer until the whole april fools thing blew over. 

I'd like to say a personal thanks to all the kind users who sent me and the mods mail since I saw you guys last, special shoutouts to /u/xG33Kx, /u/Daxmau5, /u/godmoderage and /u/IWHBYDBTDGOTFF for the kind PM's amongst the wall of orange, I was considering taking people's advice and just not posting again until I had it open, but you guys helped me trust Reddit again :) As a relative newbie, the wall of abuse was really hard to take, and I started dreading logging in.

/u/x3oo sent through some [awesome links](http://carlitoscontraptions.com/2009/07/gentle-safe-cracker/) for making a safecracker, I might give it a go with an old Playstation Slimline I have lying around, building it will probably take longer than trying every number by hand though, according to /u/jasperspaw, who sent:

&gt;* Fact. The built in manufacturer's tolerance is sufficient that you can dial every second number. 50x50x50 is 125k combs to run through.
&gt;* Fact. The design has a known defect that they fixed by not setting any wheels on numbers under 20. Some older models left the dial blank between 0-20. So it's 40x40x40, which is 64k, way under a million.
&gt;* Fact. You don't have to dial the full sequence for every trial #. Dial 4x left to 20,3x right to20, 2x left to 20, 1x right to the drop in. Then dial 1x left to 22, then right to drop in, 1x left to 24, et c. You'll be able to feel the cam contact the wheel each time you pick it up to move to the next number. You can do this with the first 2 wheels, but it takes more concentration, so it won't really save time. Advancing the third wheel like that will help a lot.
&gt;Something else. A lot of people use a single # combination for convenience. Try simply 4x left to 20, then 22, 24, 26...

&gt;Note: I often set my personal safes with #s in the forbidden zone. It makes it harder for locksmiths to get at my shit. The problem with the ""forbidden zone"" is that after you unlock the safe, the wheels bind when you try to lock it, and you need to dismantle it to unjam it. That takes tools that a manager/executive doesn't have available late on a Friday after firing someone. So, you can use those numbers, and test it, and if it doesn't jam, it's fine, Most users follow the instructions.


I'm taking the slow route and putting some brains into it, instead of paying someone and sacrificing anonymity. I just want to crack this thing myself, and learn some cool things about vaults and locking mechanisms along the way. It doesn't matter if there's nothing in it, it doesn't matter if Reddit wants a big fake ""Move that bus!"" moment, and it's not about attention or karma or anything else.


I will attempt another live stream when possible, with decent enough warning for people to see it properly, If you can help in any way with building a safecracking machine, or programming arduino boards etc - drop me a line, or check out the solutions thread.  I'm going to bed, I'll try and reply to any questions later.

[META QUESTION] Should I just forget the updates and post a link when we open it? Or would you rather see how we're doing?


Thanks for everything :) DSMS

After the safe was opened, my brother and I briefly went through the contents, but for the most part we're waiting for my other brother to be able to join us so we can all go through it together.

I took a few pictures of the process of it being opened, and a few pictures of the goodies inside, which can be seen here.  http://imgur.com/a/5ZqAa

On a funny note, there was this box that had a bracelet in it that my brother said I should have...and when I got all the cotton out of it I had to laugh.  Setting there, between the top of the box and the cotton was a folded up piece of paper with my grandma's writing on it.  It was the combination to the god damned safe.  lol

Everything is locked back up, except for the envelope addressed to me from my grandma.  That I have on my desk right now.  It's bank notes from foreign countries.  I have yet to go through them though, as I've been trying to get this post organized for you all.

I hope you all enjoy.  :)


Edit:  Thank you all for such crazy huge feedback, I'm glad most of you enjoyed it.  I had lots of fun answering as many of the questions and comments as I could.  :)

And for the few of you who were really mean about my picture taking, I'm sorry you found it so offensive.  I don't think anyone really realizes how extremely dark that basement is, even with the lights turned on.  You have to wait a little bit just to get your eyes to adjust when you walk around down there, so I really did as best as I could.

I thought that bad pictures were better than no pictures, and I really didn't have a lot of time to take them.  And honestly, I thought at least a couple of them didn't turn out so bad for what I was working with in the dark down there.  If you don't like them, then just don't look at them.  There's no reason to be so rude about it.  :(",Unlocked!,False,self,t5_2wn3k,1363931496.0,solvedcase,,True,t3_1arjai,http://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsInThisThing/comments/1arjai/update_on_my_grandpas_safe_it_has_been_opened_and/,

Bumping this thread because not much to report, I called the NZ distributors today and they recommended four safe cracking companies that would be able to get into it, the one we have already called is the first one they recommended, and even another safecracking company said they were the 'best in the business'. We're working to set up a time for a technician to make a site visit to inspect the crank handle and see how much work it will take to repair, one can possibly inspect it tomorrow and the other company is booked up till friday.


I need to travel north tonight after work so I won't be around to reply to comments sorry, I'll try and reply to as many as I can get to though. Please downvote any lame trolling activity to hell, insults are just repetitive and boring and miss the point of this subreddit completely.


Thanks! This sub is just the beginning :) DSMS

[EDIT: I guess I should crosspost this to the main page, so the people get it]

**Commonly asked questions:**

* No we will not drill it. Anywhere. There is already a hole, we are working on getting an endoscope.


* The tape IS very interesting, apparently it was stuck to the dial originally holding it in place. We are trying all sorts of different theories surrounding it.

* The handle is completely ground off, the safe experts assure me this will not be a problem.

* We will look into starting a KickStarter once we have a RELIABLE QUOTE from a reputable company, thanks for all your interest and support! Please don't try to start your own, that loses me all credibility. We will provide reddit with all the facts as they come to light (this feels like a press conference)


* We have permission to crack the safe from the (current) owner as long as we DON'T DAMAGE ANYTHING. 





=============================================

**[Old update from yesterday as per header, can't change it sorry]**

Been at work all morning, ran through a few comment replies, huge thanks to the [solutions thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsInThisThing/comments/1ag3ri/official_solutions_thread/), we got through a tonne of stuff last night and the manual really helped as we were entering the numbers wrong. Also a massive thanks to my mods who have been teaching me how to reddit, please understand the wall of text is *very* hard to keep up with, but I'm slogging through it and every upvote for a good post helps. We're dropping all the meme posts so the sub can develop itself, and it's great to see people getting into the spirit of it and submitting their own. This whole thing isn't about the karma, it's all about finding out WHATS IN THAT FUCKING SAFE!

**WHAT WE'VE DONE**

* Contacted a safe expert. We couldn't do this yesterday because it was a sunday night, we rang a few locksmiths just incase and they started to get really suspicious and didn't take me seriously. It's now monday afternoon here in NZ and I've been ringing around different places, should have an email quote tomorrow from them, but I'll be ringing around a few different places in the meantime and trying different people.

* Tried a bunch of combinations using the manual and factory settings from the solutions thread, plus as many as we could keep up with on the chat. The 3g coverage was terrible last night and it was almost impossible to keep up with. The live stream was really just supposed to be proof that the safe existed :P

* Tried sticking a security camera in the hole. It didn't fit. We've had an offer from a local guy in my PMs, but his number got lost in the wall of orange so I'm trawling through my inbox looking for him. 


**WHAT WE CAN'T DO**

* Damage the walls, floor or roof in any way, even if they can be repaired (Like drilling a hole). The walls and roof are nearly ten inches of solid reinforced concrete. If we put a camera in it'll be through an existing hole, we can't smash into it. 

* Drill the door. We don't want to damage the locking mechanism before a safe expert can inspect it. We are getting quotes and will update as we get them.

* Blow it up. But thanks for the suggestion!




Thanks for your help and patience, the first few hours were always going to be a shitstorm but now that the dust is settling, I hope this subreddit can be fun and engaging for everyone. If you can help in any way PLEASE drop into the [solution thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsInThisThing/comments/1ag3ri/official_solutions_thread/) or crosspost, and make sure if you see a post like this you bump it to the top.

 And no, it's not from that most disapponting of redditors, u/liesaboutredditgold. Your quest for gold (my guess) is going to get faster and easier, and it's going to be in your hands instead of relying on the tight schedules of the companies you've contancted, or on your own budget. I almost feel like Oprah. Not really at all though. 

I've secured an borescope in Auckland. I can have it sent by courier tomorrow, NZ time. Probably to a different address than where the safe is because of privacy concerns. I'd just ask that I please get it mailed back to me when it's done.

It will record video straight into your laptop, so while streaming would be ideal, if it's posted immediately after being recorded, that would probably be easier and minimize delays. A second simple web cam can capture the action. I can get take the video files and slap them together with some prewritten background info, add some music, credit who ever helped, have OP review it, then post it to youtube, probably within an hour or two of the safe contents inspection, barring power outage or total internet failure. Or, you could live stream it or pretend it's live, if that's what you're in to. Lots of sites do that. I prefer the story being told in the video, because this is a kind of amazing story.

This is the internet though, not requiring Peter Jackson's film teams shooting 3d at 48fps.

The borescope is simple and easy to use, thin and 2 meters long. That's the game. Minimize delays. I'm  just kind of over all the safe memes, and memes about safe memes. 

AS OP's said, it would of course be awesome to have it opened and be inside. Maybe if it was Capone's tomb and Geraldo Rivera was there.

But maybe if there's nothing worthwhile in there, there's no need for it be opened. And since there's already a hole, I say let's get it going rather than waiting for an appraisal on Friday. You can make as much of a little news event, if that's what you're into. I recommend keeping the focus on the contents of the safe. That's what intrigues me, not people talking about the safe.

This could be a wrap, by the weekend. Unless we find there's need to open the safe, and I really really hope there is. 

Otherwise, I might have to make my own safe. With gold, and drugs.

I'll bet you one big silver coin that if there's silver or gold on cash or drugs inside, there you will no longer have to be waiting for open times in their schedules. Everybody with real world safe cracking skill will be breaking down your door (althought they'd really only need to pick your locks) to get a crack at it.

And if you do make some cash, maybe you'd consider a donation to preserve New Zealand's amazing natural environment for the next time I'm able to get out in it.

TLDR Please PM me where to send a brand spanking new boroscope.

Just as a neighborhood-wide yard sale was closing down one evening, my buddies rolled in looking to make a deal. They loaded up on old video games and 80s heavy metal records like usual, but also picked up a mysterious item: an *ancient* VCR. The guy selling it was just going to throw it away, but my friends paid him a quarter for it because there was an unlabeled tape stuck inside.

[The mysterious VCR.](http://i.imgur.com/zCJst4x.jpg)

This thing was massive: modern car frames are made out of lower grade steel than this thing. Immediately upon getting this cold-war era monstrosity back to our ratty college pad, they plugged it in to watch the tape. Unfortunately, but not unsurprisingly, this relic would neither play nor eject the tape. The screws embedded in the case were lodged in place and resisted all attempts to turn them.

The only thing for it would be to forcibly remove the tape from the VCR and put it in another player. This was the point that I got involved, and I had just the tool for the job.

[The tool; precise as a surgeon's scalpel.](http://i.imgur.com/bfJOM5l.jpg)

We spent some futile minutes banging on the metal casing on top, but made nary a dent. Can you imagine hitting a piece of current consumer home electronics with a hammer and having the hammer bounce off, your blows harmless? Neither can I.

[Naturally, all safety precautions were being observed.](http://i.imgur.com/L6oT6Z6.jpg)

After wailing on the reinforced lid like savage apes, some genius had the idea to flip the VCR over and dig up through the plastic on the bottom. This immediately yielded better results as the plastic had grown brittle over time.

[We were making progress in no time.](http://i.imgur.com/eNdu24V.jpg)

The cover was removed, exposing a soft underbelly of boards and corroded wires. Rich veins of multi-colored circuitry and electronics were revealed and tore away with each blow. Real progress was finally being made in extracting the tape, but we were tunneling in the long way through; a way that would have us literally removing every bit of the VCR from its protective shell.

[The mining continues.](http://i.imgur.com/NXGEitZ.jpg)

Small pieces of technology routinely rocketed out of the hole when we swung out hammer, and larger pieces began piling up so quickly that we laid down newspaper to try and contain the mess somehow. Wires were cut and pulled, bizarre mechanisms were ripped apart, all for the sake of retrieving a video tape may or may not even be playable.

[Some of the mess.](http://i.imgur.com/Ta7G7Us.jpg)

Finally, the gruesome work was completed and the tape was revealed. Yet victory continued to elude us, as it was lodged firmly the metal ejector assembly, with some of its precious magnetic tape still wrapped around the reader heads. 

[The assembly comes free of the case.](http://i.imgur.com/ZNO2LOb.jpg)

We ceased the wanton destruction and took up screwdrivers to gently disassemble the final obstacle.

[Dirty, but whole, the tape was finally free.](http://i.imgur.com/J5KIN8c.jpg)

Concerned about its usability, we decided to to a bit of cleaning with a q-tip. It was *caked* with dust.

[The cleaning.](http://i.imgur.com/u1mDfpJ.jpg)

Clean, wound up and free from its prison, we wasted no time in popping the tape into a VCR.

[There was a moment of static where we thought it might not work.](http://i.imgur.com/UyDl2qz.jpg)

But then...

[CHUCK NORRIS](http://i.imgur.com/OFsEP1e.jpg)

Yes, it was none other than the ubiquitous Chuck Norris starring in a positively dreadful film where he could morph into a bear to combat nature crimes. It's called [Forest Warrior.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116341/?ref_=sr_1) I do not recommend that you watch it.

We checked out the whole thing and it seemed like someone had basically just recorded TBS for a while during the mid-90s. There was also a copy of Teen Wolf on the tape.

___________________________________________

Ok I originally posted this in the last thread, but I'm crossposting this so you guys get so see where we're at. 

* I called the NZ distributors today and they recommended four safe cracking companies that would be able to get into it. The one we have already called is the first one they recommended, and even another safecracking company said they were the 'best in the business'. We're working to set up a time for a technician to make a site visit to inspect the crank handle and see how much work it will take to repair, one can possibly inspect it tomorrow, they charge about 100 bucks an hour and the other company is booked up till friday. I've also emailed pictures to their technicians and I'm waiting to hear back from them. 

* I got a PM from a local NZ locksmith and we have exchanged contact details, they're keen to get a look at the beast and have a go at cracking it, also they may have an endoscope we can use to get video from inside the vault.

* I met with an ex safe installer last night, he thinks it's the same kind of safe his uncle used to install and he's emailed the pics to his old coworkers to see if they know anything about cracking it. 

We basically need help with the combination now, that's going to be the expensive and difficult part unless we can figure out how to do it on our own. If you have any tips for **cracking a safe by ear**, please drop into the [**Solutions Thread**](http://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsInThisThing/comments/1ag3ri/official_solutions_thread/) and make sure you upvote any good ones to the top for visibility. The mod team are working on getting some rules in the sidebar, check out [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsInThisThing/comments/1ai17j/mod_post_lets_get_this_subreddit_a_little/) to find out what's happening, or give us some feedback :)


I need to travel north tonight after work so I won't be around to reply to many comments sorry, I'll try and reply to as many as I can get to though. Please downvote any lame trolling activity to hell, insults are just repetitive and boring and miss the point of this subreddit completely. I *knew* this was going to take ages, this is why I made a subreddit, so people could keep up with the progress over days, not hours.


Thanks! This sub is just the beginning :) DSMS

_____________________________________________

**Commonly asked questions:**

* No we will not drill it. Anywhere. There is already a hole above the door so we do not need to drill into the wall / mortar. We are working on getting an endoscope. We can't drill the door incase we damage it before a safe technician can look at it.


* The tape IS very interesting, apparently it was stuck to the dial originally holding it in place, and the current tenants removed it. I asked, and it had been spun since, many times. Keep going with the theories though, I like the length theory better. We are trying all sorts of different ideas surrounding it.

* The handle is completely ground off, the safe experts assure me this will not be a problem.

* We will look into starting a KickStarter once we have a RELIABLE QUOTE from a reputable company, thanks for all your interest and support! Please don't try to start your own, that loses me all credibility. We will provide reddit with all the facts as they come to light (this feels like a press conference)


* We have permission to crack the safe from the (current) owner as long as we DON'T DAMAGE ANYTHING. 

* Live stream comments - if I can get another video of it by tomorrow I will, the original livestream was only supposed to be proof the safe existed

I live in London now, but I'm going back up for a long weekend on the 25th of this month. Here's the proposition; I go into the attic as soon as I get back, find a chest I actually have a key for (I'm not going to be doing any lock picking, I have no patience or skill in that area) and photograph its contents for you. It's maybe not as exciting as finding a locked safe or a mystery room, but it's something I know I can deliver, so there will be no disappointment. Unless I accidentally choose a chest full of tax returns of something.

This way, if you actually want to get some karma out of this, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FUCKING DELIVER. Once you open it up, then you may post a link to get some of that sweet sweet karma.

1365170967.0,1291,self.WhatsInThisThing,1bqem4,I have a locked high-security safe at my house. Previous owner was arrested for being a bookie.,1822,531,509,http://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsInThisThing/comments/1bqem4/i_have_a_locked_highsecurity_safe_at_my_house/,"[UPDATES!]  Took some new pics and a rather pointless video. I guess I'll post them to r/bookie_safe since I was dumb enough to create it.  I can update here as well if that's easier for everyone.

 [Original Post] Bought this house last year and found out after a month or so that a cabinet in the garage had a 12"" wall safe encased in 1,500lbs of concrete that's rebarred into the foundation.  

Previous owner was a real estate agent who bought it as a rental and never opened the safe.  Owner before him was a stock broker who was disbarred and subsequently arrested by the local police for running the largest sports gambling ring in my state.  He went to prison for 10 years and died there.  He gifted the house to his daughter who sold it to the real estate agent.

I've had friends offer me $2,000 or more for whatevers inside.

I've been told it will cost me $400-600 to open it by the company who put it in in 1981.  They no longer have any records of the safe combination.

Would you like me to share my journey to open that bitch and see what's inside? 

Unlike OP of r/whatsinthisthing I will not disappoint.

*EDIT: NEW PIC! [Proof] (http://i.imgur.com/6uIAnWI.jpg)

Update :  I've been told drilling through the concrete in the back and then through the 1"" steel body may not be as hard as it sounds.  Does anyone have ANY experience with this sort of thing?  How many, and of which type of drill bits should I use to get through the metal out skin, concrete, and then plate steel of the safe itself?   Also, I'm thinking I'll at least go over to the house tonight or tomorrow and sledghammer that wood off just to A) give Reddit some nice update photos and B) find out what the rest of that pig looks like.

* Edited to update with accurate info about previous owner.  My bad for being over eager to post the story this morning.

I always buried / hid stuff with the idea of retrieving it years after. Most of the time though, i was unable to find my stuff back. 

So when we moved into our new house 3 years ago, i wanted to do it right. I buried a ""treasure chest"" - a locked cash box - in the ground of the garden, just before we put in the lawn. 

My son was 7 months at the time. For his 10th birthday, I want to get him a metal detector (maybe sooner if i really cant wait)

I imagine he will try it out in our garden..eventually he will find his *real* birthday present that was buried there 10 years before..

Here's a [picture](http://i.imgur.com/BhrzlUw.jpg) of him unwittingly holding the box. 

edit: sorry if this is a double post. Reddit behaved really weird, my posts appeared then re-appeared so i deleted all the previous ones.

edit 2: There seems to be some misunderstanding about what's in the box. Here's what i remember putting in it:

- a commemorative Euro coin
- 2 handwritten birthday wishes from mom &amp; dad (probably a bad idea)
- an ammonite
- a USB stick with a series of photos, including the one above
- a [Cook Island Dollar](http://www.imgur.com/5XuCvGC.jpeg) i got from my grandpa after one of his travels

BEFORE I GIVE IT A SHOT, we need to make sure we're clear on something, Reddit. I FULLY expect this to be a long term thing requiring indepth research and multiple attempts, which is WHY I MADE A SUBREDDIT. Hopefully, once this thing is open, it can help other people to get into locked things, or at least steal from their landlord and gap it to Monaco or to China..

EDIT UPDATE

UPDATE: Internet connection was knocked out completely, I've been scrolling back over the live chat and trying random numbers and also the locksmiths suggestions, top post in the suggestion thread is what I'm trying currently. It's stupidly crazy to try and keep up with
This is a project I will be undertaking OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, It's not gonna just break open unless we get really really lucky today. I tried to take suggestions live over the stream but everything crashed so badly that it wasn't possible. A lot of people don't seem to get that this will probably not happen instantly, we're trying the solutions we've been sent but internet access is patchy at the moment as the wireless hardly works in this basement
Still here, still working on the safe, I want to tackle the dial first and I'm looking up what to listen to for safecracking. Next is the keylock, and the manual that was submitted is a huge help, and finally I've been pledged a welder to tack a handle onto the door (won't be tonight though, sorry.) All the suggestions are (mostly) helpful, so thanks, and wish me luck!

We need a redditor safecracker, the locksmith companies started getting really shifty and suspicious haha

We've started a safecracking party and we've got a bunch of mates here giving it a shot, there's WAY too many posts here to reply to them all, please don't worry about the troll flaming, that's just what happens unfortunately.

**Opening a commercial safe is not an overnight process!**

 - As of 3/26/13, /r/WhatsInThisThing has only been a community for 10 days.
 - Finding a locksmith that can open a commercial safe can be expensive. This is even more expensive if the safe turns out to be particularly difficult to open.
 - People have lives. They work, they have families, responsibilities, ect. Give them a reasonable amount of time to deliver.
 - It would be nice if they would deliver in a somewhat timely fashion, but don't bitch and moan if it isn't opened by the end of the week. *(Yeah people, it's only been a little over a week.)*
 - A universal rule on Reddit: **No (IRL) witch hunts.**

edit: In OP's case, I doubt he was expecting the sensational response to his original post. While new posters may not get as much leniency, OP deserves an adequate amount of time to get everything together.

That being said, for new posters:

 - If you post a safe, have both the intention and reasonable means to open the safe.
 - Updates should be *actual updates*, not ""we still haven't figured anything out yet""
 - If you ask for suggestions, please comment on whether you want to try the idea or whether it is feasible or not for you.
 - edit: Time should not be wasted with unreasonable solutions or foolish triflings. Entertain us by opening the safe. [Don't screw around. You screw around too much.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wzg1oqDgkI)

1363816727.0,973,self.WhatsInThisThing,1aowbi,Unlocked:  A GIANT safe found at Grandma's 'compound.'  (Album in comments),1196,223,175,http://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsInThisThing/comments/1aowbi/unlocked_a_giant_safe_found_at_grandmas_compound/,"Hi everyone, 

I wanted to share this story, because I think it was super cool, and after stumbling upon this sub, I think you might enjoy it too.

My Grandma passed about 4 years ago.  This last fall, my family and I finally got around to remodeling her house and putting it on the market for sale.

My Grandma and Grandpa built a house on about 45 acres of land along a well known river in a small town in Wisconsin.  They had been there for 50 years or so and with so much land, had gradually built quite the 'compound,' as my Dad and I jokingly called it.

On the property, there was the main house, detached garage, and about 8 different big barns, garages and sheds they had built while living there.  

As we cleaned out each garage, we were amazed with the amount of things we found.  It's amazing what people will keep through out the years.  We made it to the final garage that wasn't the biggest, but it was the one that was kind of isolated from the rest of them on the property.  As we cleaned, my younger brother bumped a 'wall,' with the broom and it made a very distinct hallow sound.  Upon becoming curious enough, my Dad and I pulled away this 'dummy,' wall that was basically ply wood that was painted to look like the rest of the walls.  Behind it, was this *giant* safe.

My Dad and I were giddy.  Neither of us expected to find this and didn't know what could be inside.  After the fact, my Dad thought he remembered being very young and seeing a tow truck deliver this thing.  It makes sense...you aren't moving this bad boy with anything less than a tow truck.  We estimate the safe weighs around 1,500-2,000lbs.  I realize that sounds ridiculous...but that is how big this thing is.

Getting in the safe was another thing.  Seeing both Grandparents had passed, we didn't know the combination, nor knew we to ask.  We dug around that place for days looking for old notes or pieces of paper with the combination jotted down on it.  No luck.  

It wasn't until we had almost given up and decided to call a professional to open the thing that I caught a number written on the rafter of the garage.  It was old, but it was still readable.  We scrambled to the rest of the garages and ended up finding the rest of combination numbers written on separate rafters in separate garages.  8 digits in total, we ended up cracking the damn thing after trying many different combinations.

Ok, enough back story.  In the safe we found:

- About 800 silver coins (mostly silver dollars) dating as far back to the late 1800's and as current as 1964.  (Valued at around 15k if sold to a dealer now).

- A Winchester 30/30

- A .410 shot gun

- Paper bills and 'treasury notes,' from per-prohibition era.

- A deed to property we didn't even know existed.  

- Other family antiques that were cool to us, but probably no one else. 

Now, I've attached the album, but I didn't have the mind to document the actual opening of the safe, etc.  What I have pictures of are a few of the coins, the 30/30, and the safe.  I do have all the coins currently in my safe at my home.

I apologize this is a rather wordy post!  I just think it's kind of a cool story and hope you'd find some interest in it as well.

I'm going to huddle in the pantry now and see if I can work some more oil into this baby, the dial is turning about 6 notches to 94, it probably needs to be at like 83 or so before we can get it out. Wish me luck.

until then, updates here.

**EDIT 1 (9:18 pm PST):** Nothing yet guys. Diligently sledgehammering this damn safe. Hope to have a real update soon. 

**EDIT 2 (10:26 pm PST):** Still nothing... just mashing the safe, trying to turn the dial more than 94. Sorry this is probably a boring-er of nights for you guys.

**EDIT 3 (10:51 pm PST):** Just ate [this donut](http://i.imgur.com/8G59BM3.jpg). Getting my second wind and ready to bash the shit out of this safe.

**EDIT 4 (11:42 pm PST):** Damn this is tiring... Stick around if you'd like, but unfortunately the cakeday serendipity seems to be for naught. I'm going to try at it a bit longer but I'm thinking it's not going to happen tonight.

**EDIT** also, massive thanks to whomever gifted reddit gold to /u/jasperspaw. I'd been hoping someone would because I can't afford it right now, but he absolutely deserved it for his effort. Thanks anonymous GGRedditor.

**EDIT 5-ish (11:51 PM):** Since this safe thing isn't happening, [here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1cipes/for_my_cakeday_since_this_stupid_safe_isnt/) a nice post for you all to smile over. I'm calling it quits, I hope you all sleep well, I will get back to it as soon as I can, sorry for not delivering.

Next time I get back to it I probably won't make an update post like this until there's something to update. I don't mind making one if I get enough feedback saying you guys want another post like this in case you enjoy following along even if I don't deliver, but otherwise I don't want to keep stringing you guys along. Let me know.

**Much Later Edit (Thursday, April 18, 4:00pm PST)** Just to let those of you know who are waiting with baited breath, I won't be getting back to it until maybe tomorrow (Friday), but definitely by Saturday at the latest. My family is consistently adding oil and occasionally bashing the crap out of the safe to loosen up the bolts, though, so I hope the dial will move down a bit more by the time I get back over there.

I'm at my parents' house right now, trying to get the safe unlocked. We found the combination in the desk. Right now we are trying to work on getting oil into the mechanism to help it turn properly. I'm talking with /u/jasperspaw on the original thread [edit: [comment thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsInThisThing/comments/1c6r2w/a_superhidden_safe_thats_been_in_my_parents_house/c9e2owx)] I made if you want to try to find our conversation.

[Here's a picture](http://i.imgur.com/zbPjZrc.jpg) of the safe with the dial off to keep you guys interested. [Here's a picture](http://i.imgur.com/GeOYgsh.jpg) with a timestamp so you guys know this is happening now. I will update as much as I can as we go along.

tl;dr: Next step: get some oil in this beezy.

**Edit 1, the update I just gave /u/jasperspaw:** So good news and bad news. We didn't think the combo was right, then we found another paper with another combo and it had the correct serial number. Checked it out, it clicks after pushing down on zero and everything, OBVIOUSLY the right one. Huge morale boost.

Then, we tested out how much the dial might spin after it sticks by using some vice grips. Stupidly, we did this before we got oil in there because we don't have any on-hand. Broke the non-anchor pin on the bottom of the dial it bent off and broke after just a bit of pressure. Huge loss of morale. That's where we are now, my brother is trying to rig something up to fix the dial pins and move on from there.

If we fix those, we will immediately move towards oiling it up. The safe does not spin freely in the ground, and the dial definitely sticks hard at the spot where we broke the pin. So oil is the right next move, once we fix the pins. [edit: ~~disregard that, just fixed the pins to a serviceable level~~ ...or maybe not]

**EDIT 2:** Eff me in the A, we probably have to get a new dial. Turns out we didn't fix the pins enough. Doing my best to get one as soon as possible, but it's possible we won't be able to get one today, and would have to wait until Monday. :'( I will keep you guys updated.

**EDIT 3:** jasperspaw tells me to try to work with the broken pin anyway to regain the combination (it's probably offset a bit) so I will work on that for now. Then we will OIL IT UP... for reals this time. Don't get too hopeful because the oil will take quite a while and I'm not sure how much longer I'm going to keep at it for tonight because we have a dog to go home and feed, etc. I'm doing my best, let you guys know when we're calling it quits for the night.

**EDIT 4:** Okay, we now have the pin fixed and the combo is working again. We also now have copious amounts of oil and are lubing that baby up. Also, in other ironic news, my dad arrived on the scene and managed to [smash his finger] (http://i.imgur.com/s4O0ZRu.jpg) with the hammer within the first two minutes. [(See here for reference)](http://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsInThisThing/comments/1c6r2w/a_superhidden_safe_thats_been_in_my_parents_house/c9elk8m)

**EDIT 5:** [Vibration in process] (http://imgur.com/tyNJYe5)

**FINAL EDIT OF THE EVENING:** I am closing down shop for the evening. I spent about an hour and a half hammering (causing sexy vibrations), and pending approval from jasperspaw that this is the proper method, I expect it will just take more time to vibrate the safe to soak in the oil. I may have time again tomorrow or Monday, I will create a new thread then so we can have a clean slate.

I'm truly sorry I don't have anything more exciting to give you guys, it's obviously a lot of work and I'm putting a ton in to give us all the excitement we deserve after weeks of setbacks and deadbeats.

What do you think is on the keys? Should I try to open it on my computer?

UPDATE #1:
Plugged it in my roommate's computer using linux. No precautions were taken whatsoever. The guy's a crazy fucker and was way too curious. But thanks a lot for all the help!
Both keys weren't encrypted. This looks like two personal USB keys who were owned by the same person. They both contain around 50 word documents and pictures (mostly of paintings). One of them contains the movie ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou?"", a classic. The files on it were written between 2010 and 2013. More interestingly, there was an airplane ticket receipt with owner's information. A quick google check revealed no obituaries and that he lives close-by. Next step is to bring them back to probable owner and ask him the simple question: why?

Mysteries remaining:

1. Why was the plastic bag covered in a white fibrous paste? I have two hypotheses. Either it was to prevent humidity from entering or it was to be able to know if the keys had been touched because it was impossible to access the keys without removing the paste.

2. Why would someone do that? Is the owner the one who hid the keys?",Unlocked!,False,self,t5_2wn3k,1366587168.0,solvedcase,,True,t3_1ctf5m,http://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsInThisThing/comments/1ctf5m/mysterious_usb_keys/,

Hey guys, just a quick update to say a big thanks to /u/ThunderGunned and /u/DrunkestManAlive, who have ordered me an Endoscope from a local auction site and I have been informed it is being shipped tomorrow! Exciting news! [Here's the thread it started in](http://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsInThisThing/comments/1ankdx/update_ive_secured_a_borescope_to_send_to_dont/), It was a bit of a shambles as our timezones didn't match up, but /u/DrunkestManAlive stepped in to mediate from Australia and made contact. Thanks to you both for sticking with me, I'm still learning how to do a lot of this stuff, and I type pretty slow sometimes (I've been drafting this update for nearly an hour!).

Also, I have started a twitter feed for people who find it hard to find the buried updates, this way they will all be in the one place.

When I was 5 I decided I needed a safe. It was pretty useful for locking away my prized possessions (trading cards, my gameboy, etc.) but sadly I lost the key early on and that was followed by the safe losing battery.

The safe would easily tell me if the combination was wrong, but if I was right it wouldn't have the power to unlock the safe. Despite bashing the safe like instructed on youtube (which had no effect what so ever), I never managed to get it open. 

Today I got bored, and decided to give it another go. I quickly found [a youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqC9V7SDKdQ) which simply told me to break the panel off, smash the key hole out, and then press the button manually.

Apparently the former tenant just up and vamoosed one day. The place looked like it was ransacked. I get called in to do this stuff a lot because I buy estates and such. The property manager is actually paying me to clean it out, because it is such a mess.

After we got through clearing out all the garbage and debris I noticed a SAFE under one of the tables. I forgot to write my name on paper when i took the pictures, but i will when I get back in there tomorrow.

Anybody have any idea how to open this thing?

http://imgur.com/a/UV4Tg

By the way : We were told we could keep anything we found. The former tenant ran some sort of telephone marketing business.

UPDATE: Just got a call from the manager.  He's wanting to show the office to someone tomorrow, so I gotta get this place cleared TONIGHT.  If I can't get it open tonight then it is taking a trip to my office, but I'm heading back out right now to see if I can get in via some of the suggested methods.

UPDATE 2 : 8:01pm, 6/29/13 - Okay, I swapped out the batteries and tried shorting the green and yellow wires with a paperclip.  Nothing happened.  :(  I'm not going to drop it onto concrete unless I absolutely have to, because it's quite a nice safe.  I'd like to keep it if there were some way to figure out the combo.

UPDATE 3 : 8:20pm, 6/29/13 - I want to cry.  I want to cry so hard right now.  The keypad has gone dead.  Totally non-responsive.  I think something bad happened when I tried shorting the wires out.  :(  :(  :(  That's not why I am crying, though...  I'm crying because I found the combination.  I didn't notice it at first, but it is written in black sharpie on one of the dead batteries.  40959.  And now the keypad is dead.  I can literally feel my blood pressure going up right now.

UPDATE 4 : 8:35pm, 6/29/13 - http://i.imgur.com/D7o6Jq9.jpg  I just want to crawl back into bed.  Now what do I do?  I just went and looked at the original pictures, too, and you can see the combination plain as day after I spun the batteries.  I think I'm going to be sick.

UPDATE 5 : 4:06pm, 6/30/13 - Okay - I'm back and I'm going to try again.  I'm just going to cut the keypad off, since it seems to be completely dead. :(  I'll try hotwiring the wires directly, and if that doesn't work I'll bust out a crowbar.

UPDATE 6 : 4:53pm, 6/30/13 - I'm beginning to think this is one big cosmic joke, and I'm the butt of it.  I've spent the last 45 minutes in here, in the heat, trying to prybar this thing open.  I watched a bunch of YouTube video last night that made it look **soooooo easy**.  I'm completely drenched with sweat now, and THIS is what I have to show for it : http://i.imgur.com/GCtVtNN.jpg  -  Any more bright ideas?

Here's what we're dealing with. [Cover on safe](http://i.imgur.com/NNEJ58X) and [Safe exposed](http://i.imgur.com/9HC47AL)

So instead of starting from scratch in SketchUp and AutoCAD, I decided to help KickStart [MakeBlock](http://www.makeblock.cc). This seemed like a pretty good plan as I hadn't built robots since college and I needed something to help me get into Arduino and it is Open Source and pretty modular. Parts just arrived last night so I built one of their tank models just to see how everything fit together and worked. [Robot Parts](http://i.imgur.com/v8g63X4) and [Basic tank robot](http://i.imgur.com/e55vkpj)

Some background on the safe: I've already contacted the manufacturer and they said that the combination was lost in a fire at Star Safe. So that was a burn (pun). I've talked to the current company and it can be brute force opened. I've talked to a lock smith and it can be drilled and opened from anywhere from between $200-$500.  But that's not fun!  I talked to a safe expert up in Northern California and he helped me create the algorithm to open the safe:

&gt; 4 times left to the first number,
&gt; 3 times right to the second number,
&gt; 2 times left to the third number,
&gt; 1 time right to zero (0) - push the dial down and continue right until
&gt; the dial stops (around 70-75).
&gt; Note:  When you push the dial down at ""0"", if the combination is
&gt; correct, it should remain down, or at least partially down.  If the
&gt; combination is incorrect the dial will NOT remain down.
&gt; Note:  Left is counter clockwise, Right is clockwise.  DO NOT count the
&gt; revolutions of the dial, count the individual number as it ARRIVES at
&gt; the 12 o'clock index mark (star - index).

I've got a few technical papers that discuss the way that I can eliminate possible combinations because of the mechanics of the lock. So I should be able to get it down from the theoretical 1 million combinations to something like 100k-200k.

So that's where I'm at. I've got a friend with a 5axis CNC machine if I need to build any parts, but I think my big hurdle is going to be getting stepping motors that can turn the dial fast enough to get this done is 6-36 hrs and actually knowing when the lock is opened. The Arduino stuff seems to be sufficient. I just need to get a power source that isn't batteries and to make sure I can send data back and force from the laptop controller and don't have to make it automated. 

I think I have a fun summer ahead. I'll post pictures of designs and code I'm using as a go along. I'm going to document as much as I can and definitely shoot video of the Geraldo Moment. (it'll be a trending hashtag on twitter soon).

Any advice or hurdles that any other redditors have experienced would be awesome. I'm guessing I should probably x-post this with r/robotnerds (does that exist) or something.  We'll see where this adventure takes us.  WOO INTERNET.

So my dad gave me a safe from his office and told me I could keep whatever is inside if I get it open. He thinks that it has an old pistol, lock box keys, and insurance papers. Any ideas? I want to try and open it while keeping the safe intact so that I can use it. The safe was originally in Beaumont, Texas so the humidity has rusted some of the outside, but the knob on the outside spins fine so it isn't rusted. I found some safe instructions with a quick google search but they really didn't help. All I know is that the order of numbers has to be entered going 4 to the left, 3 to the right, 2 to the left, and 1 to the right.

**Edit:** Does anyone know what model it is? 

**Please remember that I would like to keep the safe intact and working if at all possible.**

**UPDATE 16/5/13 : New plan of attack, guys! I'm getting a notary to sign [this form](http://www.firefyter.com/pdf/Key_or_Combination_Request_Form.pdf) so that I can keep the safe intact.

I figured since the safe is worth more than $40 and it's not going anywhere, why not get the stuff AND keep it intact? Thank you for your patience.**

I dont know how my dad ended up with this pay phone but I remember trying to break into it as a kid with no luck of course. There are some coins rolling around in there mainly but I think it would be good to restore but I cant take it apart without unlocking those three locks

[I did a bit of research](http://www.telephonecollecting.org/Newsletter/May11.pdf) and its a 'Victa 52AUX Red Phone' from the yearly 70's. I'm hoping the age will make these locks easier to pick.

Any suggestions on how to get started?

**Update #1:**

* I saw Fast and the Furious 6. God that was a terrible movie.
* I found out the story of how we got the phone. My dad was on a job site one day and someone had just thrown the phone on a pile of bricks thus the paint being stripped. So he took it home and didnt touch it for 20 or so years.
* Thanks to u/libussa3 for finding the master key on ebay which I purchased!
* After some more research I found the same phone (fully restored w/ full set of keys) going for $1200.
* I will take more photos for those asking tomorrow with something that isnt a camera phone.
* Once the master keys comes I guess the project begins and will keep this post updated. What I'm curious about is that when I shake it I can only hear a couple of coins but I distinctively remember it being full when I was younger so there could be some grime build up on the inside making everything stick.

Sorry for that, that is one my first posts.

First, here is the original backstory:

This is in Germany.
The house was built around 1890. My mother-in-law bought a flat in this house about 1980. She never noticed the safe. somebody else did the wallpaper. In the last 33 years, she never renewed the wallpaper, just over coated it several times.

Two weeks ago, my sister-in-law and her boyfriend decided to move in my mother-in-law's flat. He took down the second ceiling (beautiful stucco under that, we guess original from 1890) and removed all the wallpaper - and there was this safe.

It's located in the main wall. There was a door, but two rooms were put together, so one door was bricked up. Somebody seems to be smart enough to put a safe in the wall before finishing (so you don't have to make a giant hole).
We have absolutely no clue of any key.

Do you think a lock and key service could open it easily? Any other hint?

I really don't want to be *that guy*, I will deliver, but I must find out how to open that.

Weld a handle onto it - we've been pledged a welder, if it comes to it we'll use it to tack weld a handle back onto the door, we're avoiding this for now incase we damage something before the safe expert can look at it.

Locksmith - Called them yesterday we're still waiting for a quote email, we called 3 locksmiths and a safe specialist, once I get a reply I'll post it up. Still it would be better if we could find a reddit safecracker in the area.

Drill a tiny hole, stick camera in the hole - Tried with small security camera, couldn't fit, had contact from redditor with skinny drain camera but lost it in the floods of pms and comment replys so reading back over EVERYTHING

I was having problems getting the motor to turn the safe wheel, but I think I've got that problem solved. So I need to get the motor properly mounted and then start testing how fast I can spin before I start slipping teeth, then I can figure out how long it'll take roughly to open the safe..next update in a new post with a prototype spinning the safe wheel**


**UPDATE 5/28/2013:  PARTS HAVE BEEN ORDERED! I'll create a new post once I have a working prototype**

After a few weeks of design and testing and talking and breaking things, I've got a solid design and I'm ordering parts tomorrow.

Here's the newest iteration of the robot sketched on in pencil because I'm old school and don't really want to build this all in CAD. 

[Sketch](http://i.imgur.com/0hn0eQR.jpg)

I'm going to order the following stepper motor:
https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9238

Stepper motor controller:
http://schmalzhaus.com/EasyDriver/

Linear actuator to push the dial in after every combination:
http://store.firgelli.com/category_s/1849.htm

And probably a NEMA-17 mount for the motor.

I found that I can use the IR line finder sensor with the ultrasonic sensor as a backup to test if the dial has come back up, by fiting a ring of cardstock around the outside of the dial.

Only concerns and research left are to make sure I have enough torque on the stepper motor to turn the dial. That the linear actuator has the the 4.5lbs of force to depressed the dial using the motor mechanism (and conversely that it has enough force to raise the mechanism afterwards). And that the stepper motor is consistent and doesn't slip so I don't need to add an encoder or calibration step.

The last piece that I'm missing is the piece that will interface the motor shaft with the dial holes. I'd like to find some titanium threaded screws that will fit into the universal drive mount's hole: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10006

but that is probably asking too much. I should hopefully have all the parts here by the end of the week to start assembly in the mean time I'm going to be trying to figure out how to interface the motorshaft with the dial wheel.

If I break anything or have any breakthroughs I'll keep y'all updated.

**Update for 5/11/2013:** We've got some real world problems today. After reviewing the tale of the Pantry Safe it would appear we have a similar problem in that my lid won't spin. 

After some solid Arachnid Abatement (have you heard their new album?) I got to work clearing the safe area for a long slog through the *oiling process*. [You can see a clean workspace free from big black spiders](http://i.imgur.com/pylYPts)

[Here's a close up of the corrosion spots](http://i.imgur.com/HjX7Icx)

Being that we're near enough to the beach that everything corrodes I have a feeling that me and a 2lb sledge hammer are going to become the best of friends.

[First treating of PB oil and a battleshots battleship prototype being sacrificed to see what hammering is going to be like](http://i.imgur.com/0NeH0mx)

So it appears that we're going to be on anti corrosion duty for a while. Good thing my DVR is full. 

The next steps are going to be getting another can of PB, a 2LB sledge and a seeing if I can't find a 4""-6"" 2x4 remnant around at Home Depot or Lowes. 

**Questions:** 

* I'm assuming that what I'm going for is to get the oil in there as a solvent to dissolve the rust and then hitting it with the hammer is to get the oil further into the crevices and also to loosen its grip.?

* Do I want try to force the lid to spin by using the wood as a buffer against the handle and then try to get some angular shifting?

* While I'm oiling should I cover the top to prevent evaporation? And what's the intervale between oilings? 

Overall it looks like I have to fix the jock problem before I can fix the nerd problem. This safe is like a bad high school metaphor.

The house was gifted to me when my mother moved to North Carolina 2 years ago.  

There is a hidden area under a brick fireplace structure that i have known about since I was a little boy that contains an old-ish metal safe box that you can see in the following pictures.

http://imgur.com/a/3uMs4

The combination is actually written on a card, and i have repeatedly tried to open this thing for as long as i can remember.  I follow the instructions on the card and when i get to the turning part, the lock will not disengage.  I'm 98% positive i am doing it correctly, however, opening this damn thing has eluded me for about 28 years now.  I have resigned to the fact that the locking mechanism is frozen and i would need to take it to a locksmith to pop it, unless anyone has any advice about what I might be doing wrong.

I'm pretty sure it's empty, but one never knows.  There could be paper items in there, but I didn't really hear anything making noise when I moved it around.  This would be more of a moral victory if I could open it.  It would be the ending to one of my first lifelong quests.

EDIT: Proof pic for the mods.  http://i.imgur.com/vUDLuYR.jpg

UPDATE: So after reading some of your wonderful suggestions, I came home and tried them all.  I tried reversing the numbers, lining them up with the different dial marker, tapping with a rubber mallet, pushing the dial on the last number instead of zero, etc, etc... It still stubbornly remains locked.  I am 99% sure the combination is correct, and the locking mechanism is stuck.  When I dial in the right combo and push and turn, the mechanism immediately engages, but the lock doesn't open.  When I dial in a different combo, push and turn, the dial keeps on spinning and feels like it doesn't engage at all.  I can feel the mechanism trying to open with the right numbers, and can feel it slightly turning, but it does not open.  I'm running out of options here.

My previous boss never got it open either and has since left the job, so no idea what was in it.  Till now!

[Link to images of it getting opened](http://imgur.com/a/RLjRy)

The lock on the desk was busted in or removed somewhere down the line.  I tried to use a screw driver to see if it would turn, but no luck.  Brute force was the method that yielded the best results.
I was expecting a rather lackluster unveiling since after all its at work and wouldn't have antiques or valuables, but the contents did surprise me.  Inside were 4 things: 

* an old receipt tape with numbers on it

* 2 unopened boxes of 8"" IBM floppy disks

* some sort of coax adapter **EDIT:** Its an IBM Twinax Port Tester as discovered by ThatBitterJerk

The other drawers of the desk are loaded with old wires from our legacy system which used thick coax cable, most of which is junk at this point. 
I would say this was better than I expected though, no ark of the covenant.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smc7ajQ7Ugg

So I finally got the robot finished and reimaged an old laptop to send data to it. I speed tested the motor and that's about as fast as it's going to go. I can drop some of the pauses out and probably get it down to 10 seconds a combo, but then I only have to try the last digit of each first 2 digit array. Short estimate is 10-20 days to get the combo assuming 126,000 combos (down from a million theoretical ones). We're also going to have it take some pauses to make sure we're calibrated and to let stuff cool down. There's no hurry.

I still need to build the open sensor and I need to calibrate it, but the technical hard part is done.

I also need to generate a combination .csv file so I throw that at it. Probably threw a good 4-5 hours at it today. But I'm happy with the build.
Cooling is going to an issue too. But I just got a few old computers in so I'm probably going to cannibalize the heatsinks and fans.

Other than that...we're on our way!!!! Thanks for everyone's help with design and lock questions.

So, the question is, what audio is recorded on here? Keep in mind it could be as much as 70 years old. This is all assuming it still works.

Any advice on how to proceed with getting the audio off of this would be appreciated!

So I have all of my parts put together and some diagnostic stuff coded into the device so I can control it from remote.

Here's a video of how I'm coupling the motor to the safe dial:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvpCsvFl7V0

I know, sort of boring.  But I've got the linear actuator working in the Up/Down motion as well.  I think I've got an error in my code with the remote or I'm low on power, because it's not working right.  Anyways...I'll sort that out.

We've named the robot S.C.A.R. for Safe Cracking Autonomous Robot.

I've got some mounting issues to work out still; the way I have the motor and actuator coupled isn't working...so I need to play around with some zipties and see if I can stabilize and orient all the pieces so everything works.  I have a feeling that since I'm eyeballing a lot of the variables there's going to be some loosening here and tightening there to make sure that everything is lined up and not adding shear to anything.

I drilled the safe dial and installed vertical pins to attach to the universal mounting wheel.  Seems to work as predicted.  I'm not getting any slippage in the motor. I'll just need to work on some calibration with regard to ""give"" in direction change on the pins. Then I can start ramping up speed and see how fast I can drive it before it overheats or starts to slip. 

Hopefully I'll have some better calibration updates for everyone once I fix the mounting issue along with a full combination test.

Here's a video in case you missed it of the first bench test of everything put together.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXeoV7Ym4Ig

After I get everything electro-mechanically working I have the last two steps.  Sensing the correct combination (if the dial wheel doesn't come back up) and my database of all possible combinations. This is where the computer science is going to meet the safe cracking business.

This is my first post here, let me know if I forget something. Ok, so I've come across three items; two old safes, and one big chest. I need to get all three open, preferably without damaging them.

The chest can be seen [here](http://imgur.com/a/xpt3m). This was found in the back of an old garage, I believe it is from the grandmother of the owner (who is around 60 years old), so it is probably rather old. I can't imagine anything super valuable being in it, but there's probably some neat things. 

Safe #1 can be seen [here](http://imgur.com/a/sM0lR). This was purchased at an auction in southern Ohio. The previous owner couldn't get into it and didn't want to deal with it, so they sold it. I'm unsure of what could be in it.

Safe #2 can be seen [here](http://imgur.com/a/DZecu). This one is the most interesting I think. It was found in an old closed down grocery store/post office. I imagine it has to be at least 40 or 50 years old, since the building has been closed down since then.

If you know anything about any of these three, or can help me get into them, that would be great. I'll do what I can, but I know very little about locks/safes and they aren't actually mine. I'm basically allowed to do anything but damage them, let me know if you can think of any options. I'll try and post better pictures of safe #2 when it's not nighttime next time I'm over there. Thanks all!


Edit: Heading back over there tomorrow. I do have a stethoscope; since these are old, do you think that is worth trying? Or would that be a total waste of time? Hollywood makes it look so easy.. I read the sidebar and couldn't really find much there or by running internet searches trying to find tips.

Edit #2: Opened the chest up! When I'm not on my phone, I'll post a picture. It wasn't empty, it contained a lot of old quilting materials, obviously belonged so someone that made quilts. But then, on the bottom, there was a dry rotted sleeping bag and an army poncho/cap. Odd, but interesting! As for the safes, I've done some reading and am trying to manipulate my way in (unsuccessfully this far).

Update #3: I haven't got anywhere with manipulation or research on the two safes. The chest ended up being rather boring, like I said. However, the army sleeping bag and rain coat were kind of neat (from owner's grandfather). Any suggestions? Owner doesn't want to drill the safes and I currently don't have money to pay a locksmith.

- **Locked** - Anything that has not been unlocked yet; anything we don't know the contents of. 

- **Unlocked** - A solved mystery; OP delivers and we find out what was inside!

-------

**RULES:**

- You must post a picture of your mystery box.

- Verify all posts of mystery boxes by posting a picture of the mystery box with a piece of paper with your username on it. 

- No reaction gifs, memes, image macros, or anything else like that. If you find any of these, please hit the report button and a mod will get around to removing it. 

- Do not abuse your ability to post, abusive posters will be banned.

Yesterday my grandfather found [this egg](http://imgur.com/0lVG36h,gft3MW1,lVDZKik,WRcBBnS,ZxdmTCE,G045JNU,C1PRIUH,VEfkExu#0) in the middle of his backyard! We have no idea how it got there, a bit away from any woods/nature.  (We drew the circle on the egg, its for keeping track of rotating it when keeping it warm, there's an ""X"" on the opposite side.)

We candled it (shined a light through the egg to see inside) , saw what appears to be life, and we've placed it in [an incubator](http://imgur.com/0lVG36h,gft3MW1,lVDZKik,WRcBBnS,ZxdmTCE,G045JNU,C1PRIUH,VEfkExu#6) (*Warning: Ipod Quality*) from our chicken farming days.

Additional Information: We have no idea how long it was in the cold, or why it was left alone.  We live in Maine, so it is most likely a turkey. The egg is just a bit larger than your average chicken egg. More photos can be seen on the album (which starts [here](http://imgur.com/0lVG36h,gft3MW1,lVDZKik,WRcBBnS,ZxdmTCE,G045JNU,C1PRIUH,VEfkExu#0)), but some are very low quality. Whats in this thing? And what should we name it?

EDIT: Another mystery to solve is how the egg got there in the first place. In the middle of a field, still warm!

Those who say that instead of hiring a locksmith, they want to get it open with the help of reddit baffles me. Reddit loves safes and the mystery behind them, and this subreddit is a great way to share. However, if you don't hire a locksmith, after lingering weeks on reddit, you're only going to hear the same advice. Maybe in the future for those who have a locked safe, hire a locksmith first, then share pictures of the safe with us. We can all make predictions and let our curiosity soar, and at the end of the week you can share what was in it. Don't post your safe if you don't have a plan.

I did talk to a locksmith briefly and they said they could get into it but that would destroy the safe. Getting into it without breaking anything would be better, but i'll get it forced open if needed.

My parents have lived here for about a year now. They're buying it from the company I work for (I work in real estate). According to the file my company never tried opening it either and it's been vacant for ~4 yrs. 

When we first moved in the neighbors greeted us. They touched on the people who built it, said they were from South America and they were very sketchy people.  

Sometimes get the feel that the people who built the house were in the drug business. You can walk between the walls of the house. They're like long hallways usually the doors to the hallways are hidden in closets. Maybe used those places to store whatever it was they had. Not to mention it has it's own PA system and an 8ft high stone wall around the entire perimeter of the property.

About (ummm 10 years ago?) i was 9 at the time. We drained the bottom pond so we could build a gazebo when we drained the pond we noticed at the bottom of the pond was a safe. I cant remember how big but from what my grandfather tells me it was about the ""normal"" size you would keep on the floor or in a closet, but it wasnt a cheap safe, more heavy, and metal. It took a tractor and a few chains to relinquish the safe from the 'muck' of the pond. When we got the safe out we called the sheriffs office to see if there was any report of a missing safe. There was, from 5 years before. We gave the person a call and he described the safe exactly. When we opened the safe it had a good amount of old coins from different parts of the globe in it and a few other precious metals (gold and what not). the coins were in a sealed packet and amazingly survived. The owner was so happy to get his safe and stuff back he gave us a pretty good reward. (Just about paid for all the wood for the gazebo.)

I already cracked (the old fashioned way) another safe in this room.  It was empty.

I don't know if this one will be any better.  I spoke to the prior owner of this house and he indicated that it was already in the wall when he originally purchased.  He said that he never tried to open it.  If true, this safe has not been opened since at least the late 1990s.

I looked up the company that used to make it and it appears they are out of business.  Phone number in owner's manual is also no good.

Any ideas?

EDIT:  As promised, here is the Owner's Manual for the safe:    http://www.scribd.com/doc/157945049/AAnon

EDIT 2:  For those wondering, this is what my house looks like:  http://i.imgur.com/z3wwp9H.jpg  Except that I have now painted it blue.

EDIT 3:  Magnets were a no go.  Mallet did not work.  Looks like we are going to ""Plan B.""   http://i.imgur.com/5g0Z2Ou.jpg   But not until after lunch.  

UPDATE:  The ""rivets"" I tried to drill to remove the front panel are not rivets.  They are something else.  They are steel and are longer than my.  Possible miniature carriage bolt with a nut holding it on the other side.  However, I do have some more information.  The Aanon Corporation was incorporated in 1978 by BRIAN HAMBLETON.  While it was ""administratively dissolved,"" I was able to find a patent by Brian Hambleton for a ""Security safe with improved door locking features.""   Here is a link to the Patent:  http://www.scribd.com/doc/158058752/Us-5341752      Any electrical engineers here?

UPDATE 2:  More information on Aanon Corporation.  After it dissolved, Hambleton started making safes as ""Safe Corporation International"" a.k.a. ""SCI.""  SCI filed for bankruptcy and is now gone.  See: http://www.ndcourts.gov/court/opinions/960088.htm


 UPDATE 3:  Safe opened.  Total disappointment.  All that was in there was a Palm Tungsten.  Palm only made it from 2003 to 2005 so prior owner was incorrect; they must have used the safe at some point.  Thank you for all of your help.  Sorry it was not something cool.

1363566881.0,99,self.WhatsInThisThing,1ahtxq,So you found yourself a safe/vault/whatever. Some suggested guidelines for posting.,108,9,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsInThisThing/comments/1ahtxq/so_you_found_yourself_a_safevaultwhatever_some/,"I've been out of safe and vault work for a very long time. I'm not up on state-of-the-art, but some things don't really change. I thought I'd make some recommendations for those of you who post images, asking how best to get into the container (to use the industry term) that has found its way into your possession.

First off: get a clear picture, preferably with some kind of scale for reference. If there are any logos or manufacturer brands on the dial, get a nice clean image of that. Ditto with the safe. With or without logos, get good images of the hinges, and (if there are any) feet or wheels on the base.

Secondly: No, it's probably not valuable. Old fire safes are almost certainly junk, because the plaster of Paris (used to absorb the heat of the fire, and produce steam that saturates the interior to displace oxygen and reduce oxidation of the contents) often cracks and ruins the integrity of the container.

There are some exceptions, and there are ""collectable"" safes out there. However, the odds of you finding a [cannonball safe](http://www.history.com/images/media/slideshow/american-restoration-before-after/cannonball_605x412.jpg) are low. There aren't many safe collectors anyway; most people don't have the room, and the shipping is extortionate because of the weight.

Don't try to force it. Sure- attack the hinges. Like the manufacturer never thought of that! If you go at it and bust off the dial, grind away the hinges, give it a good solid whack with a hammer (particularly if it has [glass relockers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocking_device)), you're fucked.

If the door is open already, LOCK IT OPEN. NEVER ship a safe with the door closed. Do that with a vault that has glass relockers, and it's just earned the moniker ""Most expensive paperweight.""

Floor safes: These fill up with dust and dirt from being below floor level. They may often be flat-out busted. If you own one, keep it clean- vacuum it on a regular basis. If you find one, shopvac it carefully before even touching it.

If you change the combo yourself (not recommended), test the combo *at least* three times **with the door open.** Sounds pretty basic, but it's a $500 mistake plenty of people have made.

Any safe you can buy at a hardware store, office supply store, etc. is going to be a ""toy"" safe. The Sentry safe will pass the most rudimentary of the fire resistance tests (which are actually pretty stringent), but they are fairly easy to crack. Their thickness is mostly plaster of Paris, and they are mainly gauge steel. Opening them destructively is trivial.

The authority that rates safes and vaults for integrity under attack is Underwriter's Laboratory. The safe is tested against tool attack, and possibly torch and/or explosives attack. The rating is for how many sides of the container are tested (some safes may be embedded in nearly unassailable substrates, like concrete), and how many minutes of attack it will withstand. However, this is ""compressed"" time, in which the attacker has an open safe as a model right next to the one they are working on, and the stopwatch only goes while there is actual attack. So, while a [TL-30](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe#Class_TL-30) sounds pretty lame, it will be a bitch to open by the untrained. Note those ratings go up to TXTL-60, for 60 minutes of resistance against torch, tool, and explosives. These are fairly rare, and normally reserved for specific applications like high-end jewelers, or gold mines in the outback.

Attacks: A trained safe and vault technician can usually penetrate a safe or vault in a fashion that leaves it largely intact. Moreover, because they are going to use the *easiest* route inside, once that container has been penetrated, it can be restored to service, often with relative ease. But because you don't want a weakness, that point can be defended: drill shields, drill bits (welded into the hole), ball bearings, etc. These will effectively turn the easiest way into the container the *most difficult* way in, or nearly so. This is why a $500+ locksmith call may be worth it on a valuable container: weld in a busted drill bit, grind it down, repaint it- and put it back on the showroom floor.

1367203302.0,86,self.WhatsInThisThing,1db9j8,Boring update on the Pantry Safe,102,16,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsInThisThing/comments/1db9j8/boring_update_on_the_pantry_safe/,"I don't have much to update, but people have left a few comments recently asking for more details. I'm still working on the safe, just fairly intermittently. It will probably be a while before I get it open, like a number of weeks. Even then I may have to call a locksmith.

My plan of action is to continue to add oil, and when I am able to work for longer stretches, continue to try to turn that dial. If you recall I have the dial down to about 94. As I continue to add oil, I hope it will eventually break down whatever gunk is gumming up the mechanism. Since it's been sitting for at least 12 years, it could be like a rock, solidified around the cam.

Since I'm a very poor person at the moment, and I don't think my parents have any interest in paying one right now, a locksmith is a very very last resort.

So, for now, I continue to add oil. When I have more time to go at it, I use the sledge hammer and pieces of wood to try to transfer a jolt that I hope will shock the bolts to move a bit as I'm putting constant pressure on the dial. This is the method my trusted advisor /u/jasperspaw has advised me to follow, and so I dutifully obey because shit, I have no idea what else to do.

So, there's your update, it will not happen nearly as soon as any of us wanted. As much as I know many of you will be disappointed and cry foul and faggot, I am the one putting a ton of fairly exhausting work into it, and am probably more invested in it than certain decriers may realize. So I will just keep at it, and I promise to update if anything even remotely interesting happens along the way.

This kind of goes for all us amateur safe-crackers: these things are made specifically to withstand exactly what we are putting them through, so it's no surprise it takes a lot to get them open. Try to have patience with us all!

Inherited this from my Grandfather several years ago when he passed away.  It's a custom built piggy bank made from an old post box door.  Of course I didn't inherit the combination unfortunately.  No markings anywhere on it, just a simple wooden box with the door.  I see these old PO Box doors all over ebay and such.

I've tried messing with it but haven't even got the right/left/right whatever basis to start from.  With only 8 stops, I imagine this would be pretty simple to brute force if I had an idea of the proper sequence.

Granddad was an avid stamp and coin collector, but we accounted for all his most valuable stuff already.  He kept his collection meticulously and so I don't expect to find anything super valuable.  I can see through the window a Circus Circus chip and some 2 dollar bills.  There's a plastic bag and a red felt bag and look like they might have coins.

Any help?

EDIT:  It's an heirloom.  I'd rather not destroy it.  I hope to pass it along someday.

Edit: Thanks for the input. For clarification, when our owners took over from the corporate store we became a franchise locally owned.  The deal left us with everything in the store including the safe.  The manager had the keys for the top part to collect safe drops at the beginning of her shift. My manager who has been with our store for 8 years says that they were required to keep $250 in the bottom in case of a robbery/get too low on cash and she would have to call corporate to have someone get the cash out.  Basically it was like an emergency fund that only a few people knew how to access.  She insists that it's still in there and our owner has joked around that if we can crack the safe he'd give whoever does it a portion of what's in there. 

Edit 2: Hayman is apparently the brand of safe while the dial is a Kaba brand.

So, the house I lived in during elementary school was a part of the 'historical' part of my town. The historical district also happened to be the illicit drug district, and college student district. Anyway, we weren't allowed to go up to the attic per request of my landlord, since we were only paying rent for the first floor and basement.

At some point we decided ""fuck it"" and my dad decides to see what's upstairs. I tagged along. First, a mattress on an old wire frame, with some really yellowed newspapers from world war two just sitting there. Ok, cool. So we look around, and the attic is relatively large. My dad opens a door to what appears to be a closet, and it's just a bare closet with nothing of interest.

However, my dad noticed there was something wrong with the closet, as it appeared to not be made out of the wood the rest of the rooms were. Turns out, the closet was fake.

[A refrigerator box was covering the door, and a careful shove to the bottom of the box revealed a large room with a relatively small safe inside. Weird.](http://i.imgur.com/sI2PoM0.png)

Hi ""HomieHavko's Girlfriend"", it is indeed a vault.  At some point it was the Cashier’s office.  I am sure that the safe still works but there is probably some degree of risk in having it open.

[Photos of the bunker](http://imgur.com/a/qtn00)

So here's the story: my friend (/u/0oBountyo0) and I were helping some people at my school with some summer work stuff. We had heard that there is a bunker under one of the dorms at our school that the government had used a while back as a communications base. We walked into one of the many rooms in the bunker and found this ~~safe~~ vault. We know it's a huge ~~safe~~ vault because we heard heard a loud echo when we shook the ~~safe~~ vault handle. We also put in the combination but it didn't work. The only thing that happened when we put in the combination was the little S &amp; G logo was able to be turned 90 degrees and clicked in place. However, this caused the dial to lock up when we tried to turn it while the logo was at 90 degrees. So we turned the S &amp; G logo back to where it was before and we got back to square one. Any ideas on how we can open it? 

**UPDATE 7/19**: I went back to the bunker today only to find that it was locked. So I decided that I would come back next week with my friend and try to open the ~~safe~~ vault then. I also had to leave early today so I wasn't able to spend a lot of time running around campus looking for people who had keys to the bunker. My sincerest apologies to anyone who is waiting to know what's inside the ~~safe~~ vault. Oh and apparently it's a vault, not a safe (according to the Dean of Students). 

**UPDATE 7/22**: Vault has been opened. Nothing too interesting inside the vault (not surprisingly) although I would like to know how it was used along with the rest of the bunker... Thanks for everyone's help! I will post photos of the vault later and then take many more photos of the bunker later this week. [Link to photos](http://imgur.com/a/oqGWv)

**5/13/2013 UPDATE**
I've opened a tumblr account to drop all of my photos, sketches, links and musings I find while building my auto dialer.

[Safe Cracker 9000 Tumblr](http://saferobot9000.tumblr.com/)

I've got my initial [drawing](http://i.imgur.com/CRcHv1n.jpg)

Basically mount a motor directly into the dial wheel and that bracket is mounted onto another motor that moves that scaffold up and down. That whole unit is attached to the 4 screw holes of the handle and dial flange (have to remove those, but note where ZERO is!). 

I need to figure out something that'll fit in the dial wheel hole and that'll attach to the motor. Once I have that I can do some basic testing on my motors I have. Then if I find out my motors will work (they probably won't). I can work on the calibration to make sure I can hit the +/- 1 digit I need.

Once I have the body of the robot in place, then I work on the brains. It should be about a week (maybe longer if I need to order different motors) to build and test the mechanical portion.

I'll post updates in this thread and on Tumblr until I get my final design done. Then we'll move to a new thread and maybe a live stream once I get dialing. I should just be able to use a webcam and a laptop and just feed that from the garage to some sort of free live streaming service.

[Here is a few pics of the safe I took last night and just now](http://imgur.com/a/1CLoH)

[And here is proof](http://imgur.com/bD9El7o)

There is a very interesting back story to this, according to my friend's father.  About 25 years ago, this was in a jewelry store in Jersey.  The owner went missing at some point, and when they were cleaning out the store, no one wanted to deal with this thing because it was too heavy.  My friend's father took it home, and its been sitting there collecting rust ever since.

The thing weighs a ton (not literally, I don't think), and it has the name Herring on it.  The dial is broke off, as is one of the handles (he says that happened while moving it).  

How in the hell can I get it open?  I wouldn't mind dropping a few hundred bucks and paying someone to do it, if its even possible.  Any suggestions would be awesome, and if I do ever get it open, ""OP will deliver"" on what's inside.

Good evening everyone.  I've made some serious robot progress...in that I've got it mounted the safe. The actuator will press the dial down and the motor will turn the dial.  One set back is that Firgelli sent me a wonky bracket so I can't test everything because it's not secure yet. I'm hoping that they'll send me a replacement bracket. 

[Photo 1](http://i.imgur.com/BNsXh6X)
[Photo 2](http://i.imgur.com/XWo3ldH)
[Photo 3](http://i.imgur.com/R93tteI)

What's left from a robot standpoint:

* Actuator bracket to vertical post
* Drilling the safe dial to affix the universal coupler
* aligning the motor so I don't get shear on rotation
* tightening the crap out of everything and lubricating anything that's going to rub (that's what she said)
* wiring every the EasyDriver into an RJ10 jack so i can use the motor driver on the MeBaseShield (makeblock.cc)

So that's what's left on my punch list for the robot mechanics.

Then...the hard part: Automating and sensing correct combo (i.e. dial not coming back up).

Future concerns:

* Alignment is going to be a big concern
* Stuff overheating and melting/fire (luckily everything is concrete around the safe.
* having the dial get pulled back up because the pins that hold the [universal coupler](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10006) are too snug or thermally expand. The coincidence is that this universal coupler is almost the exact diameter of the dial mechanism. 
* patience to make sure that everything is aligned and not to just force stuff.  Mantra: This is not a sprint it's a marathon.

I'm almost there. I can feel it. Speed is not going to be this robots strong suit, so let's all think of the Mantra. Once I get everything wired up and can control it from the remote (run the motor CW and CCW and the linear actuator up/down), I'll post video to satiate the masses.

When she first rented the place, the safe had to be moved from one side of the building to the other.  The problem is that this building is over 100 years old with a real wood floor.

The below are general rules. Not all safes will follow these rules, but many will.

First things first, if you want your safe opened quickly and without damage, call a good safe engineer. If you are in the UK or Europe, I can put you in touch with someone.

Otherwise, read on.

## Opening cheap modern safes

There are a lot of cheap modern safes, constructed of sheet steel (or even plastic/cement laminate!), often with digital combination locks or very insecure mechanical locks. These only provide an illusion of security.

How would I open a cheap digital combination lock safe?

*   **Find the manual**. The safe will have a default code, and could have a reset procedure that can be triggered from outside the safe. Try this first.
*   **Call the manufacturer**. Some of these safes have reset procedures that you can get from the manufacturer. You will need to prove ownership. Sometimes you need the serial number which will be inside the safe.
*   **Try hitting it**. A lot of these safes hold the boltwork back using a spring loaded solenoid. If you hit the safe in the right place with a mallet (or [even your hand](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOdmMb90YEE) on smaller safes) whilst turning the handle, it bounces the solenoid back enough to allow the safe to open. This works on a surprisingly large number of safes.
*   **Pick the override lock**. Nearly all of these safes have a mechanical override lock. These are normally cheap [wafer locks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wafer_tumbler_lock), which can be [picked open easily](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUnEqYYo0ck) by locksmiths and hobbyists.
*   **Try and activate the code reset button**. Many safes have a [small button inside the door](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D33T4GOtB-U) used to change the combination. I've managed to press this button from outside the safe by using a welding rod poked through a mounting hole on the rear of the safe.
*   **Take the front panel off and manually activate the solenoid or motor**. Some of the cheap safes have all of the electronics outside of the safe. If you remove the front panel, you will often find two wires going through the door. These connect to the solenoid or motor inside the safe. Apply the correct voltage (usually the same as the total voltage of the batteries) and the safe will unlock. This is often termed ""spiking"", although this is more commonly applied to access solenoid wires inside the safe.
*   **Cut the safe open**. I've not seen one of these resist more than a few minutes with even a small angle grinder. The top or back is normally easiest.
Most of the time, you don't really care if the safe survives or not, so go to town on it.

## Opening bigger and better safes

If you want to try it yourself, you have the following options...

**Non-destructively open the lock**. There are a number of techniques that can be used to open mechanical combination locks - reading contact points, or brute forcing (trying every combination using a motor). This is a very skilled job. It is also unwise if you don't know if the lock works or not - hours could be spent trying to open a lock that will never unlock. Matt Blaze has written a great guide on this (and other vulnerabilities) called ""[Safe Cracking For the Computer Scientist](http://www.crypto.com/papers/safelocks.pdf)"". If the lock is mechanical, it can be picked.

**Drill the safe**. If non-destructive entry is not possible, safe engineers will drill the safe. This involves making a small penetration somewhere on the safe and then opening the safe through the hole. Again, this is a skilled job. You need to know exactly where to drill and then how to open the safe. Sometimes you will drill near to the combination lock and use a borescope to read the wheel pack. Sometimes you will drill to access the bolt or fence instead. Many safes have very hard steel called ""hardplate"" protecting the lock, and this requires a lot of pressure and special drill bits to get through. Most safes have some form of ""[relocker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocking_device)"" - additional spring-loaded bolts that will trigger under attack and hold the boltwork shut. You really don't want to trigger these as there is no way to unlock them from outside the safe. The small hole that is left can be filled with hardened steel and welded over for repair.

**Cut the safe open**. This still generally requires skill or knowledge if you don't want to damage the contents. Angle grinders, punches, concrete breakers, and thermal lances are tools used here. This can be very time consuming and noisy.

Do you see a theme? You generally need to know what you are doing.

## Opening a vault

Unless you can make a hole in the wall, floor, or ceiling, you should call a safe engineer.

## Old safes vs. new

Most older safes tend to be fairly secure. I believe this is because of two things. Firstly, safes used to be made better, or at least, more solidly.  Secondly, if an old safe has survived this long and not been opened, it's either secure or too damn heavy to throw out.

Old safes have the advantage that most safe engineers won't easily be able to determine how to open the lock or where to drill, just through a lack of knowledge and experience.

A lot of modern safes are cheap crap. Anything you can buy in B&amp;amp;Q can be cut open in under 10 minutes. But a good, expensive modern safe is a formidable opponent. Modern combination locks are very good - they have extensive ""anti manipulation"" features. Even low-cost lever locks are hard to pick. Hardplate is very hard and there are advanced composite materials that are difficult to drill or cut through.

## What not to do

There is a lot of bad advice floating about.

**Don't cut the external hinges off the door**. They aren't part of the locking mechanism on even the cheapest safes, so you now have a broken safe that is still closed.

**Don't force the handle**. Good safes have boltwork that won't open no matter how much force you apply to the handle. The handle will shear off first or you will break part of the drive mechanism.

**Don't hit the dial or spindle of the combination lock**. The combination lock and door has something called a [relocker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocking_device) on it. If you trigger this by hitting it, additional spring-loaded bolts will fire and mean that you cannot open the safe even if you unlock the lock. You've potentially made an easy job much harder.

**Don't attempt to use thermite**. I'm not sure why, but people suggest this. I suspect none of them have made or used [thermite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermite). I have. It's hard to mix correctly, it isn't cheap, it's dangerous, and it will destroy the contents of the safe.

**Don't try a plasma cutter**. Again, I suspect these people have never used a [plasma cutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cutting). They are exceptionally good at cutting through plate. They are no good when you cannot make the cut in one pass (there is nowhere for the slag to go, so it gets blasted back towards you). They will toast the contents. They are expensive and need a lot of compressed air.

**Don't try any other half-cut idea from someone who has no idea what they are doing.** Dousing the safe in liquid nitrogen, [filling with water and blowing it up](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0227445/) etc. all sound like they are a lot more work and cost than just paying a safe engineer.

**Don't think that opening safes is some kind of mystical black art**. There are hundreds of people who can open safes. The more expensive and secure the safe, the less there are that can open it. But there is no safe that cannot be opened.

**Don't think that the safe will have anything exciting in it**. They very rarely do.

## What do you need in a safe?

After reading all of that, you've decided you need a safe. What should you look for? These are guidelines for someone who just wants to protect their valuables against an everyday burglar, not for if you have £500k in cash.

*   **Avoid any digital combination safe that has a mechanical override lock**. Instead of having one good mechanical lock, you now have a digital lock and a crap mechanical lock. The security of the safe is limited by the lower of the two.
*   **Look for a good lever lock.** At prices acceptable to most householders, a good lever lock will provide the best security.
*   **Decide if you are protecting against fire and/or theft.** A lot of ""fire safes"" have extremely poor security. Burglary is far more common than house fire. My safe protects against theft, and the [small fire chest inside](http://www.sentrysafe.com/Products/491/1200_Fire_Chest) protects truly irreplaceable objects.
*   **Avoid any safe that a single person can easily pick up**. You don't need something that weighs 750kg, but 50kg+ makes things a lot more awkward for burglars.
*   **Make sure you can bolt the safe to the floor and/or wall**. A 50kg safe attached to a concrete floor with 4 expanding bolts is going to be as hard to move as a 500kg safe.
*   **Make sure it is big enough to hold your stuff.** If it can't hold the thing you need to protect, it has no purpose. A lot of smaller safes can't take 15.6"" laptops.
*   **Make sure it is accessible enough that you actually use it.** If it is hidden away, you are unlikely to ever use it. If your stuff isn't in the safe, it doesn't matter how secure the safe is.

From what I can gather with what I've been given, this is what I'm guessing.

1A) That is a S&amp;G ""D003 dial with R004 ring, for 6600 and 6700 series locks"".

2) Unless they had something that was built special, the safe probably has a standard S&amp;G 6730 series lock, with three wheels.  This lock is a THREE number lock. The dialing sequence should be:

4 times left to the first number,
3 times right to the second number,
2 times left to the third number,
1 time right until the dial stops, then open the door.

The easy way to determine if the lock is three wheels or four wheels would be to count the wheels.  This can be done by parking all the wheels on a neutral number 180 degrees away from the drop in area, and then counting the wheels as you pick them up, while dialing in the opposite direction than you did when you parked them.  This is actually a fairly simple process, but if you don't understand it, or don't know what you are feeling for, you may pick up random noises.

3) If I'm understanding the S&amp;G timelines, their 6600 locks are based on the 6700 which began production in the late 70's. Any information about the history of the house (as requested) would be helpful to narrow the the specific safe/vault unit.

4) It would be very helpful to all of us if there was a manufacturer label on the safe door or frame you could show us.

5) There is a very big difference between a ""locksmith"" and ""Safe Technician"".  I wouldn't recommend locksmiths as they usually don't have the training, knowledge or equipment to work on safes without causing more problems.

6) Finally the safe itself looks like it was added after the house was built (although I don't have enough information to explain how they got it down there post build) as it is in a weird location within the basement. Notice the raised foundation. This was most likely done to either keep the goods inside from minor flood waters with it being located in a basement or to raise it high enough to weld it to that steel support beam on the (facing) top left to permanently secure it on the premises. The cinder block surrounding it was meant to more safely secure/protect the safes out shell/walls from external sources albeit them accidental or intentional. And the way the blocks are laid (poorly) is that they were laid out once the safe was placed on the foundation; then once the mortar set, they setup a frame to pour concrete on top of it. Couple this with a basement made of brick reinforces my theory it was added later and that the house was built no later than the mid 60s. It looks like there may be wires running to it, but most likely not through it (for safety) which makes it safe to assume a light source is mounted on the inner ceiling.

If I think of anything else, I'll post. In the meantime get those closeup, detailed pictures I requested for us to help you.

-Buy a touch probe meter from local big box place like home depot to se if there is any power going into it.  Return meter when done.

- google ""core drill"" and consider if it would be worthwhile to rent one.  I  think I actually saw one at my local home depot, but it is an expensive rental.  It can drill through the concrete and rebar easily for some 2"" holes whereever you want for visibility. 

- If the walls are not re-inforced incredibly well, which judging by the use of cinderblocks they are not, then a 1/2"" or 1"" masonry bit will go through cinderblock in a few minutes.

Bit of a story coming. I moved into an apartment that was built in the pre war period. In one corner of the room on the ceiling is a wooden latched door leading to a crawl space between the roof and the apartment. Well me.and a few friends had been drinking and decided we needed to explore wherever this mystery latch lead. I climbed up into the space and announced that I saw a box. It was incredibly dark and I was drunk so I got down. Promptly forgot about it. 

Cue 1 year later. I've hyped this box up to be haunted.  It was a good story to tell friends that were staying the night and happened to be sleeping directly under it. A few of them had nightmares. Good times were had. Tonight we got drunk and remembered that it was up there and with enough alcohol I hoisted a friend up into the space. Here's what we found.

We are having trouble identifying he whiskey company on he bottle. The paint cans belonged to a.company that existed since the 1800s.

I couldn't get a gallery to load on my phone. Ill update with more pictures on request. The box appears to be an old tool box with a small bag of roofing nails still inside. The whiskey bottle has some whiseky still inside, or what used to be whiskey. The label has a another label placed over the top. The whiskey is called ""Beaver Creek Whiskey Special Reserve"" from Los Angeles CA,  141 South Maine Street.

Its an old jeep trick that came about when AMC had the bright idea of using torx bolts on everything. Chrysler followed suit. Over the years, the bolts rust into their threads and it can be very difficult to remove them. Often using the correct tool is not enough, and the torx socket gets stripped (like rounding the points off a bolt head).

Then the only option is to grind off the paint on the bolt head and weld a steel nut to it. Use as big a nut as you can find so you have more room and surface area to weld to. Start with the nut held in place over the bolt head with vise grips or similar, then start welding from the bolt head and get a good deep weld. Then move up the sides of the inside of the nut. Then when the nut is attached good, fill the rest in with weld and let it cool.

We just started using the space and today was the first time I was in there. My apologies for the blurriness of the third picture - it shows the tiered door and vault like in the post I linked to above. The fourth picture is a plate directly behind the combination mechanism. We haven't opened it (it just takes a flathead screwdriver) because we wanted to learn a bit more before trying anything foolish.

It's open so there's unfortunately no hidden treasure. It's still locked however and with no combination we can't do anything with it. Our goal would be to know the combo and be able to lock/unlock at will and actually use it as a safe. We'll consider a locksmith soon - but if there's a way to determine the combo or set a new one via the rear access, we'd prefer that route. We're technical folks, hence the Makerspace so if we can do it ourselves we will.

The story is not specifically safe related, so fair warning.

A number of years ago I bought a condo. It was an old apartment building converted into condos.  They were **horrible** and all had to be redone.  The unit next to mine was being done the exact time mine was.  About 2 weeks into it they were working on the bathroom and removed the floor trim woodwork.  Pow $5k in cash sitting there.  Needless to say we were all very very thorough looking in every wall and cavity of the rest of the building.  Nothing but rusty razors for me.  A few years later I bought my new house and gutted it (because it needed it, not because I was looking for riches).  Nothing but a few old photos and lots of rusty razor blades.  Kids, be careful when doing demolition of old bathrooms!

About a year later my grandfather passed away.  He had started loosing his marbles a few years before that unfortunately.  Sad way to go.  Anyway he gave everything (cash, house, everything) to his kids from his first marriage.  Kids all went to house took anything they thought was worth anything and left the shit for my family to take care of and dispose of (classy).  That included a big library of books.  My brother decides to keep several of the books.  A week or so later they were having a good old fashioned book fight (throw books at your friends for fun) and BAM, book hits friend and falls to ground opening to several hundred dollars.  Guess where most of the books were.  Good Will.  Yup he only took a few and the rest were given away.  They rushed to Good Will but by that time some mysterious buyer had purchased them all.  Who knows how much $ my grandfather had hidden away.

You never know.  Keep the faith and always check everything.

p.s.  Ya a book fight.  No idea why.
p.s.s.  Yes serious about the razor blades. It is common in old places as that is how people disposed of them. Into the wall.",,False,self,t5_2wn3k,False,,,True,t3_1agt3l,http://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsInThisThing/comments/1agt3l/a_note_of_encouragement/,

(425 words),8,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsInThisThing/comments/1af5rh/fiction_op_opens_the_safe_425_words/,"The safe moaned and dust floated down from the ceiling. Finally, Orlando Price thought. He had been trying for days to get the damn thing open. 

His friend had purchased the house at a steep discount. It was in a bad neighborhood and had been used by a drug dealer, nobody wanted it. The house needed some serious repairs and the floors were covered in garbage. The police had knocked down the front door and grabbed the drug dealer in the middle of the night. His dirty dishes were still in the sink.

The woman his friend had hired to clean the place had found the safe in the garage under the house. The door to the garage was thick and made of steel, and the windows had bars on them. It looked like a bunker. The safe was light gray and covered in scratches. It was about four feet high and two feet wide. The handle had been sawed off and ground flat. 

Orlando wanted to use a jackhammer but his friend wasn’t too keen on the idea. He posted some pictures to his favorite website and it got a huge response. Thousands of people gave him ideas, but it was somebody from the cryptology section, a new user, hadn’t been on the site more than an hour that cracked the code. 

The dial was surrounded by eight pieces of packing tape, pointing outwards like a star. The user the figured out what the scratches on the tape meant and came up with a combination. It worked, the safe was open.

Orlando and his friend slowly pulled open the door; the safe screeched and moaned like it wanted to stay shut. The inside of the safe had ridges on the wall, probably for shelves, but they were long gone. On the floor of the safe a handgun and a box of ammo lay on top of what looked like an old notebook. 

His friend, not wanting to put his prints on a gun, picked up the ammo box and looked inside. “Crazy. You ever see bullets like these?” He tilted the box so Orlando could see inside. 

There were seven bullets; each one was jet black with a shiny grey tip. Orlando lifted one up; it was heavy, a lot heavier than a bullet ought to be. He put it carefully back in the box and turned to the safe.

The tattered notebook was stained brown with coffee, or maybe age. Orlando slid out the notebook and flipped it open to the first page.",,False,self,t5_2wn3k,False,,,True,t3_1af5rh,http://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsInThisThing/comments/1af5rh/fiction_op_opens_the_safe_425_words/,

I don't know if there is anything inside, It's rather heavy so I haven't been able to rattle it around.I do think it's empty though.

Right now I'm just looking to see if anyone knows anything about AIKO safes, everything I've found through google has lead to a dead end, even the companies contact page doesn't work.

If anyone knows anything it would be much appreciated.

You will likely not get in without some damage to the safe.
You could try and Electronic Stethoscope.. basically a microphone with an amplifier so you could listen for tumblers falling.  The internet will have supplies of that item.. and should not be expensive.

Second.. you could try a Diamond wheel cutter on the external mounted door hinges. use water lubrication.

Drilling holes..first you need to locate the exact position of the lock mechanism.. consult the net for info on this.
http://www.sargentandgreenleaf.com/MC-6630.php
http://www.sargentandgreenleaf.com/pdf/catalog_2012_US.pdf

Using a Titanium drill bit of 3/8 to 1/2 in and lubricated with ROIL Anti Friction liquid.. you should be able to eat thru that baby in no time.. The ROIL is available off the net.. or via your local Neways Health rep[ ( mlm )

Thermic Lance..
Ok this is gonna stuff the safe for sure.. but hey.. you weren't taking it to your next house.. so just open it.. grab the loot.. and wall it up again.
see here..  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV4r7OKkXmU

 These babys will cut thru anything including concrete.

Would be interested to know what u think of these ideas.

best of luck

Currently, theories abound. Maybe the whole thing was a hoax from the start, or maybe Smee is unable to update us due to legal reasons. Maybe he’s disgusted with the hostility and downvotes, maybe he’s met some untoward fate, or maybe he’s just busy. But one thing is certain: this safe exists. It may or may not be exactly what Smee has described, but the grated door, the dials, the tape marks—those are all real.

Now I understand half the fun is in the journey, but after this long, after the fruitless updates, after the endoscope failure, now that we're down to waiting for smee to crack this by hand... or somehow by programming and building a robot?  Come on guys.  

If this is going to be done, it needs to be done while there's still a little interest left.  And by now, everyone knows there's a strong chance there's absolutely nothing in the safe, so if that does turn out to be the case, I don't think people would rage or feel cheated, just because knowing one way or the other still has merit to many of us... just as long as its made clear from the get go that an empty safe is a possibility.  If the project is started and doesn't reach its goal, then fine, whatever, at least we've ruled out that option.  If there's enough interest in at least trying a Kickstarter, and smee refuses, then that should be a bright red flag right there.  

I hate to be a  cynical bastard, and I will give dont_stop_smee the benefit of the doubt here (My condolences by the way), but it is time to put up or shut up.  Let's fucking do this already. Once and for all, I just want to know. 

**Edit: One thing I forgot to mention in terms of practicality.  I know Kickstarter has rules about what kind of projects can be submitted,.  This would have to be done as funding for the ""Filiming of the the safe opening"".  A sort of documentary.  Can specify how long it needs to be, how many pictures would be supplied, a live stream etc. That sort of thing. So we can see the safecracker at work, and see the opening.  This way it fits the qualifications and we have some proof that money's going where it's supposed to.**

**Edit 2:  Yes I am aware he stated he wants to crack it himself.  I think that's an enviable sentiment, but realistically that means more than likely we will never see what's in the safe.  He has no experience cracking safes, this is not an easy safe to crack, it's not even his safe, and he does not live in the same house as it.  It is not an exaggeration to state his friend's lease might be up before he makes any progress.  Kickstarter is not a perfect plan, and I completely understand the flaws/objections to it.  I'm just pointing out, if you're serious about finding out what's in it, this is by far the only realistic option.**",Other,False,self,t5_2wn3k,1365391150.0,other,,True,t3_1buhlo,http://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsInThisThing/comments/1buhlo/lets_just_do_a_kickstarter_for_smee_already/,

It is nothing extremely mysterious like old hidden safes under the stairs from 50 years ago, but it has always intrigued me nonetheless.  Why?  It is off limits, I have never been allowed to open it.  My dad has always been a suit wearing financial adviser.  I know he had a wild side in college and it may be connected to that.

I could make guesses, of course, but I can't think of anything that *has* to be in there.  I'm 24 now and am still not allowed to look.  It is a chest that looks like it could be easily unlocked without the key.

I guess what I'm asking is a question dealing with trust and morality. So, *should* I open it?  Or should I let the secret stay forever locked up?  Please talk me into it.... or out of it.  I don't know.

[The Chest In Question](http://i.imgur.com/WsxsOde.jpg) - It is roughly 4x2x2 ft.

The locksmith apparently managed to get it unlocked, but we haven't opened it up yet, was trying to get this live feed thing to work, not sure the best way to do it, we have an android phone with a crappy camera, and a nice digital camera that does video, suggestions?

some pics, will take more in a bit. So far it looks like a bunch of magic cards, some gemstone things some that look like rubies, and others that are labeled as emeralds, but look more like malachite to me, theres a baseball with a lot of autographs on it, what looks like some old bank notes of some sort that look way older than anything else, some silver dollars, and some sort of tapestry thing with a lot of marker drawings. there is also a lock box that is very heavy and definitely has something in it, but is locked, and there is another cabinet inside the safe that is also locked, and looks like it is missing the dial for a combo lock.

some more pics...  the cabinet in the top left inside the safe is still locked.

Yes it was fake, funny though. My actual first plan was a lot better, but the wife wouldn't let me do it. The original plan was to have our cousin in the safe and my brother playing the locksmith getting it open, as the safe opened we would complain about a sudden horrible smell, and little bits of black ooze, played by hersheys syrup would have dripped out the door, just barely noticable for people looking close, but adding a neat subconscious kreepy vibe, then as the door was opening and we move into look at the very dark safe suddenly a goo soaked hand would pop out and splat against the outside of the safe followed by running and screaming for the door all cloverfield style.

Instead I had to resort to giant nerd treasure which seems to have also been pretty fun to a lot of people. The cards are all very much real and certainly for sale if someone can offer a decent price, as are the gems, not so much on the bank notes but they do look really cool, and no none of the cards were damaged by little baby hands, despite how it may look cards in sleeves are not hurt that easily, also no the baby was not staged, its just hard to keep her out of stuff cuz she is fast like cheetah.

Long live the lulz! Hope most people at least enjoyed the ride.

And no not for karma, thus throwaway account, this was purely for lulz.
