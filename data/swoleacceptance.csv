He's a bit fat, balding, in his late 40's but a great person overall who has made my current job the best I've ever had.
 
When I came in to work today he asked if I had a moment, sure. We went into a conference room, sat down and he began to tell me that people at work were telling him and HR things about me. Namely that I'm constantly eating massive amounts of food and that I probably have a psychological disorder for eating that much. That I've gained a huge amount of ""unnatural"" muscles, probably from steroids. That what I'm doing is unhealthy and that I'm showing off my body to compensate for something.
 
It took me a few seconds to pick up my jaw from the floor.
 
I've had a few jokes thrown at me at the lunch table every now and then but they were always light hearted and funny (e.g. ""You can have my leftovers if you're still hungry after your third meal"") but this came straight out of nowhere. And showing off? I don't even wear V-Necks. We're an IT company so you can probably guess that a third of us is heavily obese and the rest is mostly skinny as hell and bordering on being underweight. And those are the people telling ME I'm living unhealthy and I'VE got a problem?!
 
I have never judged people by their appearance or their choices as I think it's nobody's business. But I guess it's too much to ask for the same right when you're not like the rest of the people around you.
 
I told my boss that I'm doing fine both mentally and physically and that I'm not on steroids. I explained to him that I'm currently bulking and that's why I'm eating the amount that I do. We got a bit caught up in this and I ended up going through my whole gym and diet routine as he was really interested. At the end he told me he thinks it's great that I'm working out and shouldn't let other people bother me. But he can't do anything about the badmouthing and thought I should know.

I don't remember how I got linked to this reddit, but I've been lurking since while reading almost every comment from the top post on down. It took maybe 30 minutes for me to decide that this is one of my favorite subs on reddit even though the subject matter doesn't even pertain to me. You guys are have one of the nicest communities I've ever seen on the internet, and really do support one another. Combine that with the sub-culture language you guys use, and it makes for a really enjoyable read. Seriously, you guys use the syllables ""bro"" and ""swole"" in ways I didn't think was possible. 

But let's be honest, I thought I had stumbled upon the best piece of satire I had seen since /r/vxjunkies . However, the more I read the more I thought to myself that there's no way you are this dedicated to a joke. So I really thought about it for a second. Had I ever been guilty of swole-hate?

Yes. Yes, I had, so I thought about why. I was fucking jelly, that's why. Not only because you can squat a truck off the ground, but because you had found something you loved and were doing it. I can admire that (almost) no matter what you're doing. I also tried to put myself in your shoes for a second. It didn't take long for me to imagine some jackass thinking I was a douche, or some throwaway chick asking to see my abs, and it hit me that you guys actually probably do catch alot of flak just by being you. Well, wait a minute. That's not right, is it?

No, it's not. It's one step away from blatant racism.. Damn.. Very well, I admit that I was wrong, and that my opinion of those who make me look like a weak bitch has been changed.

So what to do about it. If I can't justify you being an asshole with no brain, how can I justify me being weak? Damn you again.. I can't. It's justified because I am weak.. But.. I don't want to be weak. How can I- oh, god dammit.. If I don't want to be weak, I have to go to the gym, huh?

You'd think that'd be easy logic, but I guess it was easier to accept you all as mental and emotional inferiors than to admit to myself that I was wrong.

Sooo, I'm gonna try it. I've always wanted to be stronger, and I don't think I've ever been more motivated. Might as well shut the fuck up and do it. I talked to the biggest dude I know, and asked him what to do to get started, how to lift safely, if any of the supplements are worth a damn, etc etc.. I leave for the gym as soon as I'm done typing this. It feels good to have a goal.

Even if I fail miserably, never hear the call of Brodin, and go back to exactly how my life was.. I wanted to take some time to thank you guys for changing my perspective, and being generally awesome.

**TL;DR: Keep being who you are. Keep doing what you're doing. Some guy on the internet thinks you're cool.**

**EDIT**: I a word. Also, sorry about the wall-o-text.

**EDIT2**: Your comments are all great. I just went to the temple for the first time in years, and it was harder than I expected. I stuck with it though because I figured it was just my body wanting to go back to going 5-13 on Battlefield 3 like I have been. I ended up doing twice again the number of reps I was at when I wanted to quit.

I was feeling pretty good about myself when I was done, but getting back home, and reading all of your replies made my day.

Thanks for your faith in me. Seriously. Not many people do that anymore.


**EDIT3**: Okay, this is crazy. Yesterday, I thought I would post online about how I would go to the gym and maybe thank the people who convinced me to go. Now, every time I come back and read this it's like I have an army of spartans pushing me towards a better self. I'm going to print out this whole thread an put it on my wall because I swear I feel like I could rip a tree in half with my bare hands when I read it.

Seriously, thank you all again for your advice and motivation.

For the last 2-3 weeks I have not dieted, nor have I really visited our temple. Shame to say, I turned my back on Brodin and his ways. I lost around 5 pounds, and expected my lifts to suffer tremendously. 

Then a couple days ago, my girlfriend broke up with me, but I was not sad. No, Brodin came and comforted me - even though I had forsaken him. Today I returned to his temple, and indeed my gains had suffered as I thought they would. 5lb came off my bench press, 5lb off my deadlift and my OHP seemed much harder than before. 

During my final lift, the barbell row, I thought about my life. I thought about my life. I thought about all I disliked, then I looked down at the bar. I turned to my workout partner, my friend, and said ""I'm going to put more weight on this. I will channel all anger into this final set. Put more weight on yours as well bro."" I reached and added 10 pounds to the bar. This would be my PR, on a day when all other lifts had fallen and I was 5lb lighter. 

After loading the bar I looked at it dauntingly. I turned to my friend and said, ""I know I cannot lift this, but I will."" I squatted down, straightened my back and whispered ""FUCK YOU!"", and lo and behold Brodin himself must have heard for the barbell flew from the ground and I repped it for 8! My friend smiled and congratulated me on this accomplishment.

Brothers, I have returned from my backslidden state. 

Brozekiel 37: 15 - And he cried aloud ""Brodin, can these dry bones lift? "" And Brodin replied ""Prophecy to the barbell, and it will be so"". And the lifter turned to the barbell and proclaimed ""I will pick you up and put you down!"" and behold on that day a PR was made in the exercise that is most holy, the squat.

I keep thinking that I should have known better and it’s my fault. When you’re swole, there are certain places that are off limits. I told myself not to go, but it was my good friend’s birthday. He wanted people to meet up at a bar.

By the time I arrive, the bar was packed. 3 steps into my search, the catcalls and swolestation began. I can still hear the calls of “Heeeyyyyy!”, “Those [my arms] are big!” and, “Can I see what you got under that shirt?” All the while being groped like a swoledabeast at the petting zoo.

I breathed a sigh of relief when I found my friends. I positioned them in front of me, like elliptical machines shielding the power rack from desecration. I slowly started to relax and let my guard down. Then I made the mistake that I’ll have to live with for the rest of my life, I went to the bar to get another drink.

At the bar I was subjected to the worst objectification I have ever experienced. I was sammiched between two young ladies that decided to use my forearms as shelves for their breasts. For Brodin’s sake, when I look in the mirror I see a person, not a curio cabinet.

They told me that I looked like I had lots of stamina. This made me feel vindicated as I hard recently switched to a German high volume training routine. I felt it was about time someone noticed my lager calves. So I told them that I did indeed have plenty of stamina to get through any vigorous activity. They giggled, and my heart broke. I train hard, and no one appreciates work ethic anymore.

The bartender was swamped so I had to listen to them talk about how they were best friends and did *everything* together. My guess was that their favorite activity was swolehating. It finally came to an end when they asked me to take them back to their place. I’m not sure if being treated like a pony ride is a promotion from the petting zoo, but I wasn’t having any of it. It’s pretty rude to ask someone you just met to carry you and your friend 3 blocks away because you’re too lazy to walk.

After that I left. Just because I’m swole doesn’t mean I don’t have feelings. Why do people think it’s acceptable to treat me like an animal or piece of furniture? I’m not a human forklift that can be called on to move heavy objects. What can I do to make these feelings of shame go away?

Set upon set I watched his form grow worse.  Rising from the bench I approached him and asked, ""Would you like to learn to squat properly?""  Slowly he began to smile as he responded ""yes please.""  

For fifteen minutes I sat with him teaching him the holiest of Brodin's prayers.  After returning to my bench and finishing my sets, it was my turn to approach the altar and offer tribute.  

Long have I struggled with finding a suitable squat form.  Too wide and my hip begins to pain me; too narrow and I do not hit depth.  Today, however, I stepped out slightly too far and found myself with a wide stance and my toes pointed slightly in.  Realizing it was too late to fix my stance with this weight upon my back I drew a deep breath into my belly, drove my head back into the bar and squatted, praying for Brodin's holy spot.  As my hip crease dropped behind my knees I expected a pang of pain.  Alas, there was none.  Holding myself in this squat, I 'mired in the mirror at what had occurred.  I had gone as deep as I was humanly capable of dropping with not an ounce of pain.  Rocketing out off the hole, I repeated this for 10x3, as the Prophet Brolov commanded.

Leaving the temple I dwelt upon what had occurred.  My one lesson to a young swole was favored by our Lord and Broviour and in return I was granted a token of his appreciation.

Let us remember Brocclesiastes 11:1 where it was written ""Cast your Whey upon the water and it shall return to you one hundred fold""

And if your clients are bothered by the noise of plates knocking together, it stands to reason they are equally annoyed by Capital FM turned up to 11 with the same ten songs on repeat. 

And until you stop referring to your establishment as a ""Gym"" I will continue you to use it like one. 

The statement delivered to my Brother and I during a PR shattering leg day really got me thinking about the state of Gyms where I live. 

It struck me that more and more space was dedicated to half empty studios, cardio machines and therapy spaces than the weights area. The bedrock of any gym. 

A treadmill could break down and be replaced within a week, yet a t-bar can go missing in December and still be absent in April. 

Gyms in and around London seem to be on a slippery slope away from a temple inclusivity, and more a conclave for casual users. The power walkers, the stretchers, the worshipers of the ab crunch machine and the gel-haired bicep curling poppin-jays who assess themselves from all angles in a mirror after each pendulously swung rep.  

As evidenced by the cavernous areas dedicated to rows upon rows of treadmills, ellipticals, bikes and rowing machines compared to the postage stamp sized weights areas. 

Out of the four gyms in my locale, only 2 have a squat rack. The one I attend has plans to trim the weights area and make room for an extra studio space. 

Like Wrestling - the original Olympic sport - is being stricken from the Olympics, the Gym is being stricken from the Gym.

What follows is a race to the bottom. A committees opinion of what a Gym should be to attract all manner of fence sitting and under-motivated people. The £45 a month from uncertain person who might sign up for the month of January carries more weight than the £45 a month from the person who is - and has been - in there four days a week. 

Offering a range of activities and facilities is noble. The fact that there is a ladies only space is more so. Opening the door for people and offering them the comfort of their own sex is a wonderfully inclusive thing. Especially as it opens the door for people who would be kept away from their own idea of perfecta forma on religious grounds. 

But if opening the door for one demographic means shutting the door on the original demographic, what example does that set. 

Ditch the squat rack, we have a leg press machine. 

Ditch the bench, people can use the miserly 30kg dumbbells instead. 

Ditch the olympic bars. If people want to Deadlift, they can do it with the 50kg barbell.

If you take the weights out of a gym, what does it become? What do you call it?

A wellness centre? A convalescent home? 

""We don't have a weights area sir, but we do have a membership offer! £40 a month gets you 20 minutes on the treadmill per day. 5 minutes on the ab crunch machine, 5 minutes on the leg press followed by a shiatsu massage and a waxing. We call it the Mid Life Crisis special!""

""Or perhaps you'd rather the ""Get in shape for your mistress"" deal? £45 a month, but we'll throw in 10 minutes on the rowing machine plus 5 sets of bicep curls, good for any weight up to 12kgs!""

If it is to be that way, then so be it. If a market fails to cater for a group of people, then an enterprising soul comes to that groups rescue.

But in the mean time, replace that fucking T-Bar so I can get back to my rows. Perhaps your new found clientele will get a final look at what lats look like.

Bare in mind, this is a x-post, and therefore is written in the dialect of the weaker men such that they too may understand.**



I work out at a large fitness chain gym and they have a ""bar"" where you can buy drinks and shakes with various supplements. I normally just bring my own, but I had forgotten it this day due to being a little slow out of bed, and decided to give it a shot. I hopped in line behind this self-entitled suburban house mother in her head-to-toe pink name brand workout outfit and patiently waited my turn.

We slowly move up and finally it is her turn to order, but instead of ordering she just starts lecturing the employee (A huge dude) on how dangerous the use of steroids are for him and how his genitals will shrivel up and die and he will grow man tits, and etc... Essentially publicly humiliating an employee for no reason at all.

Now I have been working out at this gym for a few months, and I go at different times according to my schedule... but almost every time I go, he is there either working or working out, and the amount of dedication that he has is admirable. I'm not saying he doesn't use them for sure, but judging by body language and how he suddenly seemed so defeated, I am almost certain he got that way through natural means and hard work.

She finally ends her unsolicited lecture and orders a protein shake with soy milk because she is trying to lose a few last pounds before the summer begins. The employee reluctantly turns and starts to make the shake and she steps to the side to take a presumably *very* important phone call. That's when I catch it, the sweet sweet petty revenge. Instead of putting protein mix into the shake, he puts in mass gainer.

If you don't know much about fitness supplements, mass gainer is essentially very dense protein and carbohydrates, so it was still a ""protein"" shake, but probably ~400 calories more than what the plain protein shake would have been. Judging by how small this woman was, those extra calories were just enough to burst any caloric deficit that she was trying to get, but not too much to gain much extra weight... If he keeps this up, she will sit comfortably for the remainder of the summer prep time at the exact same weight completely confused as to why her efforts just aren't cutting it.

Just as he turned around to hand it to her he caught my eye and froze. I just gave him a wink, he smiled back and handed her the evil concoction. I was sure to give him a nice tip out of admiration for how expertly he had engineered that petty revenge.

**TL;DR:** Self-entitled suburban bitch lectures someone about none of her business and gets a big helping of petty revenge.

One is strictly for powerlifting and strongman competitors. It is a pure and holy place. The other is a derelict and rogue vessel near where I live. I go there for convenience on days that I do accessory work and don't want to drive the 20 miles to my Iron Mecca. 

The lifters there suffer from ignorance, mostly. There's plenty of broscience, curlbros, DYELs, and a couple of crossfitters that I see on a regular basis.

Sometime 2 weeks ago there was a new face in the crowd. He was probably only a year or two younger than me, but it was clear he was incredibly inexperienced. He was tall and lanky. Probably 6' tall, but only around 150 lbs. He was using the squat rack as a staging area for some pendlay rows, I had the intention of using it to do some heavy push press and OHPs. I asked him if he wouldn't mind me working in, and he didn't. He moved his set up a few feet back where he then proceeded to deadlift.

He was struggling pretty badly, but I'm not the type to go out of my way to correct someone. Some lifters find it offensive. I don't like it when people talk to me in the gym, so I tend to leave people be as well.

I was taking a quick rest in between sets when he asked me if I know how to deadlift and if I could assist him. He listened well and improved his form greatly.

Fast forward to Saturday, I'm in the gym doing accessory work again. I spy my new friend on a bench a few feet away from the squat rack I intend to use.

As an accessory to my deadlift, I do heavy rack pulls, some 120% of my deadlift maximum to help with lockouts. I proceeded to load up the bar to 675 and drop the safeties down to just below mid thigh. 

I could see my friend watching with intent as this is probably the most he's seen on a barbell outside of youtube videos, I proceeded to knock out a set of 3 pulls and set the bar down. It was like Christmas for this dude, a Swolemas if you will. He looked incredibly inspired to lift. As I was walking past to refill my water I gave him [a nod of approval](http://i.imgur.com/Ay29K.jpg).

It stops now. But first, some back ground. 

Now, I've taken a very hands off approach to this sub since it has gained quite a bit of popularity. Sure, I could easily nazi-mod the hell out of this subreddit, but that's not my style. I created it as a satirical sub to parody /r/BodyAcceptance but it soon evolved- because of it's users- into what it is today. 

Today /r/swoleacceptance belongs to you, the people. However, today I am stepping in to share some very important information with all of you so that we may make this dispute between /r/SwoleDominance and /r/swoleacceptance end. 

The user who created /r/SwoleDominance isn't even *that* swole. Who is he to stand above all of you, *us*, and judge? Well, let us judge him...

He's been training for **1 whole year!!!** Yay! He started on New Years day as it was his resolution. Yes, a resolutioner has created SD and is now the expert on all things swole.

I know, I know, I know.... but wait, there's more.

He weighs in at 205 and has the following maxes:

Squat- 335

Bench- 305

Deadlift- 485

Wilks- 320.565

Those are in pounds, not kilograms. 

I'll give you all a second to laugh...

/u/thorbreakbeatgod you're a joke man. You've created a subreddit that serves one purpose, to shame the users of this subreddit. You've established some rule that if someone doesn't have a 300 wilks then they're automatically banned from your sub? Oh, great. That's cool. But you've failed to realize one thing...

Being swole isn't just about how much you can lift brother. 

Being swole is many things. *But judging those who are trying to become swole isn't one of them.* You aren't swole. Sure you lift. Sure you might even look like you ""do even lift."" But the prickish behavior that you've exemplified in the last few weeks shows that your subreddit /r/SwoleDominance exists as Germany did in 1940 and you're literally Hitler persecuting *the truly swole* because you have some insecurity within- maybe the fact that you know yourself to lack swole. Seriously, how could someone who is in the infancy of their path to the Iron Zion start such a sub and act so self righteous? Take a hard look in the mirror man.

This isn't me judging you /u/thorbreakbeatgod, this is me educating you. 

For the love of Brodin man, you haven't even stepped foot on a powerlifting platform! **So therefore you don't have a powerlifting total, thus no wilks.** You don't even fit the requirements you've laid out to be a subscriber of your own damn sub! Not only that, but **my wilks is nearly 100 points higher than yours!** Want to go judging others now? Oh, how about in my first powerlifting meet I totalled 1,113 lb in the 148 lb class. My wilks then was 395. Which is still much much MUCH higher than what you currently have!

Who are you to stand in judgement of others when the reality is you've accomplished very little? And what you have accomplished is marred by your poor attitude and treatment of others. 

I could go on and on about the many things I've accomplished in my life. I could talk at great length about how much better than you I am... but that's not the kind of person I am. All I was trying to do was make a point, which I believe I've made. 

So I'll stop here. I'm sure you understand the stupidity of your immaturity now and how un-swole your actions are. 

What I really want you to understand is this- Strength isn't just about how much weight you can lift in the gym...

*It's about who you can lift up so that they can become stronger than you.*

You've invited me to become a moderator of /r/SwoleDominance and I accept that. Likewise, I'm going to mod you here- **In the hopes that you take this lesson in swole and learn from it.**

I'm going to learn, what I can, from your perspective over in /r/SwoleDominance and I believe that you could learn a thing or two about being swole here, as a moderator of /r/swoleacceptance. 

But should you continue down the path of inner weakness your privileges will be revoked, you'll be reported to the admins as a hate monger, and your sub will be reported as a pro-hate sub. 

I'm going to mentor you so that one day you can stand on a platform as a champion, as I have, because I *really believe* that you have it in you to become very swole- physically, mentally, and spiritually. The holy trinity of swolitude. 

The passion in which you act shows me you have what it takes- all you need is guidance. 

**So, subscribers of /r/swoleacceptance please welcome a new moderator /u/thorbreakbeatgod into our developed and aesthetic arms. Welcome him as a brother, treat him as such.

It is with great sadness that I relay this story. What you read in the title is true. Not a few weeks past, I attended a party. At this party were many members of both sexes, but as far as I could see, there were no Disciples of Brodin (other than myself.) But it would seem that my singular swole presence would become my undoing.


I attended this party for entertainment, brothers. I was not aiming to gain female company; I had deadlifted earlier and simply sought relaxation after my iron endeavors. Indeed, naught but a few trifling words were spoken in passing to most of the women in attendance. Merriment and festivity were had by all, and I left in peace.



Or so I thought. It would come to my attention later that week that rumors were rising about my actions at said party—specifically related to one couple. Indeed, I did observe this couple. I would often see the male arguing with his female counterpart. He was not of the swole, though I did note that his calves were thick with genetic potential, were he to answer Brodin’s call. They gave the impression that they were one of those couples of weak-will—made up of two people swole of pride but not of communicatory skills. Perhaps if they learned to squat deeper, they could stoop down and meet on each other's level. 


I later found out that the woman in this couple had been telling her boyfriend, in an attempt to make him jealous, that I was flirting with her all night.  Brothers, I come to you honestly and say that no such actions occurred. To make things worse, I received this news on leg day—when I was already at my weakest. And then this. I suspect that I was singled out because of my swole. As I said, I was the only attendee who has paid his homage to the Iron Temple. I believe that I was seen as a mere object of physical attraction—an arrangement of muscles, nothing more. Well, she forgot about my biggest muscle: my heart, which now feels heavier than any squat ever could.


Edit: I have returned to find your comforting words. I feel as if a heavy weight has been lifted from my shoulders...6-8 times, with strict form.

Some attempt to tear us down, whether that be with wicked words or aggressive actions, but we overcome. What they destroy, we rebuild. With our strength we persevere. With our iron will we continue our march and weather the storm that is violent with jealousy, revulsion, and contempt. 

I, the creator of this subreddit and author of the Swole At Every Height blog, come with a few words; some of these are wishes, some observances, while others are rules that we swoles will adhere to while in this most strong and disciplined community. 

First, I would like to thank all of you for making this community what it is. At nearly 6,000 readers we are strong in numbers. With each new post and up curl we attain new personal records; as a result, our community as a whole has gained some earned responsibility. Which leads me to the only rule I am laying down. This rule has been agreed upon by the moderators of this subreddit. Break this rule and you break faith with this community and you pour Brodin's protein shake upon the gym floor. Pledge with me, and our mods, to adhere to this rule. If you decide not to, please unsubscribe now and forever hold your dumbbells in solitude; away from your brothers and sisters in swole. 

**The Swole Acceptance Pledge** 

The swoldiers of this community will not rally other swoles to attack a post outside our walls! We will not undermine our mental and physical strength by becoming a downvote army. A swole does not downvote without discourse! No more crossposting of swole hate done in efforts to bury ignorance. That is not how a swole fights! Crossposting is fine as long as we attempt to properly educate the ignorant. Fail to do this and the post will be deleted here and the user banned. *That is the golden rule of Swole Acceptance.* Break it and you dishonor the swole. You shame us and yourself. We will cast you out into the weakness. 

Brothers and sisters, we are strong in mind, body, and numbers. Should we use our strength for perverse personal gain we gain nothing but perversion. Being swole is about gains, and we want quality gains! 

I have observed, since the day I created this beautiful safe place to swole, a remarkable thing. Growth. Pure and unadulterated. Having stepped away from the community, letting go of your proverbial bike seat and I watched you like a proud father ride true. In each new post you turned the crank and propelled Swole Acceptance further into the greatness it has become. Today we stand together. Individually strong and stronger collectively than we could ever become individually. Beside each other we form an inpenetrable phalanx of muscle and brawn. There is no other community like us! Brothers and sisters I raise my shaker of muscle brew to you, for on this day, I see the greatness you have become. 

On Brodin. Some view him as real as the man squatting in the rack next to you. Others view him as a man above, looking down and guiding you towards greater gains. Still others personify their drive as Brodin; giving their dedication and willpower a name. Swoldiers, none of these are wrong. Even still there are others who believe in no such Brodin. Believe it or not, they too are correct. But how can this be? Well swole nation, because Brodin in any form is strength, and like I said before, together we are strong. *Together we are Brodin.*

The last topic I would like to speak on is about privilege, in any sort. Swolebros and swolelettes there is an idea among us that we live in a world infected with this grotesque idea of ""privilege."" I have written about it previously. We all know of weak privilege. And I am sure many of you have heard of others out there. But I stand here today to tell you that such a thing exists because we allow it to. When you recognize the beast and do nothing you allow it to devour a piece of our nation. Do not be the coward hunter who quivers fearfully in the presence of such a nemesis. Nor shall you be the poacher who is equally a coward. Killing prey for gloat, not for gains. Our survival as a community is tied to this very idea. This idea that we should battle only when needed and attack only in defense. 

The first rule of battle is to know your enemy. Know this swoldiers, some men and women suffer weak privilege while also being of it. Because someone is ""otter mode"" now doesn't mean they're not cisswole. The man or woman who you may see as an enemy now may very well be struggling against their own weakness in valiant efforts to attain what you have; mighty, chiseled swole. Be careful of your words and actions because you may inadvertently discourage a future swole when all he or she was asking for was a spot. 

First attempt to be a lifting partner. If that course of action shall fail you then proceed to educate forcefully. We should not fear to use our strength but should fear the improper use of it. 

Once again swole brothers and sisters I thank you for your participation in this community. I thank you for your up curls, your motivating words, and your welcoming nature. Each day you grow stronger in the Iron Zion. And each day Swole Acceptance grows stronger because of you. I wish you PR's, gains, hypertrophy, vascularity, and more protein sources than you've ever imagined!

Since I started the path of iron, each time I've flown has been a progressively worse experience (yesterday being the worst).  My shoulders are now broader than the seat is wide.  I was wedged against the middle person and my shoulder still stuck out into the aisle, which meant every beverage cart and bathroom goer banged into me while passing.

I tried to sleep and was jarred awake every couple of minutes by my shoulder getting knocked.  I know fat people have been dealing with this problem forever, but as a fit person I hate being punished for my barrel chest and broad shoulders.

This will only get worse as airlines cut costs by reducing seat width further, and my shoulders grow larger.  Pretty soon the swole will be forced to upgrade to 1st class or to purchase two seats.

In the past few years, I have worshipped on and off at Brodin's temple. Within the past year though, the path of swole became my life. I spent hours training and with much hard work I saw amazing gains. I used to be fat and weak. But I have lost and kept off 35lbs since last October (285-250), and was vey proud to recently max 375 bench, 240 OHP, 440 squat and pull 475 from the floor. Lifting had become so much a part of who I am. I declared my major in kinesiology and my passion and profession were becoming one. I gave my all in pursuit of swole, and now it is being stripped from me.

I have been getting tests done on my heart since I was a child. My mother died at 24 from extremely rare form of mitral valve prolapse. Her brother died a few years before her at 22 from an extreme arrythmia and his autopsy revealed that he had coronary artery disease. Both of them were extremely fit. My mother was an all american soccer player and my uncle was in the military.

In July they discovered via ultrasound that my left and right ventricles were enlarged and that I have low functioning in both of them. I also have arrythmia that comes and goes randomly. My cardiac MRI done at the beginning of this month concerned my cardiologist quite a bit. I exhibit early warning signs of cardiomyopathy as well as a few other things. They believe it to be genetic, and within the next 6-8 weeks, I am going to be tested for just about everything. Until I hear an official diagnosis, I am to refrain from all physical activity except for mild walking, bowling and golf for at least the next 6-8 weeks. Because, all of the bad things that could happen to me could be brought on by the increased cardiovascular function during exercise.

I am trying to stay positive, and my hope is that one day I will be able to compete in a powerlifting meet. But at the same time, I am 20 years old and this makes me realize my own mortality. In the mean time I am going to walk, and try to eat as cleanly as possible. Hopefully I can at least lean down a bit, to take as much stress as possible of my heart. I know I am going to atrophy, and sadly I have to step off the path of swole.

I urge you all to not take the pursuit of swole lightly. Each rep is a gift from Brodin. I ask you all to lift in my stead.

Over the weekend I was in the temple at my university as usual and I happened to be on the rack doing a few shrugs. It was relatively late and I had already finished my first two sets and I looked to my left and saw a mentally handicapped swole brother squatting, I walked over, said hello, and told him I'd gladly help him if he needed help. Fast forward 15 minutes and a couple punks walked in. (mind you I am not large in stature, 5'7"") and they were a little bigger than me. They began making snide comments at him quietly and I held back my rage for a while, then one of them dropped this gem; ""he's only squatting that much cause he's retarded"" and then they proceeded to laugh. I couldn't hold my rage any longer. I dropped my massive bar on the ground and walked over to him and, very passively stated; ""If you say one more negative word about him or anything he's doing you're going to have a bad night."" he replied ""Oh really? What's going to happen?"" and again very passively i said ""you will be carried out of this gym by your buddy with fucking head trauma"" a larger swole brother came up behind me and said ""guys, how about you fuck off?"" obviously intimidated by my new swole brother and perhaps even me a bit, they sulked out of the gym frowning.

The story of a skinny girl's beginning path to Swolehalla.

To start off, I'd like to mention I was a weak and tiny woman from the very start.  I am 5'4"" and 118lbs at 27 years of age, which is generally my natural state of things, weight wise.  However, for my adult life so far, I was sorely out of shape.  Many complimented my thinness, but I did not care for my stick arms and legs.  I tried cardio to perfect my physique, but it did little.  

During this time, Brodin tried to tell me of the Tao of Iron, but lo, I feared His disciples.  I mistook the prayers of the faithful to be the bellowing of animals.  I shied away from the air that felt clogged with testosterone.  I could practically see the words painted above the door of his swolliest of temples: No Girls Allowed.  

I resisted for some time before I took Brodin into my heart.  Through the inspiration of ironsister Jamie Eason, I undertook serious lifting.  Yet I still feared the judgement of Brodin's most fervent sons and daughters, as I was weak and pasty.  I began attending a local temple whose doors never close, so that I could sequester myself in prayer at night, away from judging eyes.  Normally I would be one of two or three in the temple, and we all would pray in solitude.  After some time there, I decided to learn my max squat.  I began loading plates, pushing my sins up from the mats, thanking the patron goddess of swole, Absphrodite, for accepting my penance.

I was approaching my max, a lowly 95lbs.  I loaded the right plates, stood beneath the sacred bar, and psyched myself up.  I can do this this through Brodin who strengthens me.  I lifted the bar from the rack, and descended.  The gods, they tested me.  I struggled to push my sins back up, but I did!  I placed the sacred bar back upon the rack and caught my breath.

It was about here that I looked up and met the eyes of one of the other faithful.  This brother has obviously followed the Tao of Iron for much of his life.  Brodin has blessed him with many gainz, of which he is an example to his brothers for his faith.  We locked eyes, and after a moment, he gave me a single nod.  As if to say ""nice one.""  It was exactly what I needed.  I did not need nor want a clap on the shoulder, a loud cheer, or even a ""good job"" out loud, as I am still bashful.  My heart swelled with joy at this acknowledgement from a gifted ironbrother.  There is indeed a place for a skinny chick on the path to swole.  This was many moons ago, and I have continued my devotions since.

May the Swoly bless you with many gainz.  

1 As the prophet Rippetoe looked up, he saw the swole of body lifting much iron with little effort.
2 He also saw a skinny man, with much effort and perfect form, lift a bar with only two very small plates.
3 ""Truly I tell you,"" he said, ""this skinny man has offered more than all
  the others.""
4 ""All these people gave their gifts out of swole body; but he, swole of heart, put in all he could possibly lift.""

I got her hooked up with my past olympic lifting coaches and she is loving it. No more does she ask me to go running with her (wheymen!). But although she now does heavy reps for Brodin, she does not quite understand the lifestyle, and it was made obvious by what happened this morning.

It is my off day. On my off day I have a ritual for which I give thanks to Brodin for my swole:
1) Make giant protein shake with oats, creatine, veggies and fruit.
2) Lay on floor - I move as little as possible for maximum recovery and gains, as well as keeping posture perfect, and meditating deeply.
3) Repeat step 1 when shake is empty or it is time to prepare a culinary offering to the Gods. 

This is where my girlfriend expressed her disrespectful, and borderline blasphemous act. She interrupted step 2.

""Babe, can you lift the couch so I can vacuum underneath it?"" she says.

""Just vacuum around it. It's my rest day.""

""Seriously? You power clean more than the couch weighs. Just lift it real quick and go back to your spot on the floor.""

She is selfishly sacrificing my gains while simultaneously using me for my swole. Little does she know, as there will be no swole left if she continues my sacrifices.

I reluctantly lifted the couch to avoid argument. But I have never been so disparaged by someone I love. I cant stop replaying her belittling tone whilst saying, ""Just lift it real quick"", as if quick will somehow bring my lost gains back.

Ask and ye shall receive, o disciples of brodin.

I worked at a pizza shop in small town USA. Half of my coworkers were obese. Started lifting and eating clean two years ago. First year I did a lot of cardio as well. Got made fun of a lot for bringing bag lunches to work instead of buying pizza for myself. Earned the nicknames ""lance"" and ""greek yogurt boy"". Became my boss's bitch for any task that was physically demanding. No big deal though.

2012 was the year a lot of people started quitting because our boss's personality was rapidly changing and she wasn't doing her job. She was known to randomly go off on people and attack their personalities, telling them they were no good, had zero work ethic... She understaffed to save money on hours, so you were always doing the work of two or three people and getting shit on when you couldn't keep up. Nasty place to work.

I was the kind of person who kept quiet and did my job, but if I was under attack I did defend myself. And as I continually got more swole, contempt grew for me as most of my overweight coworkers thought I was a massive douchebag for lifting weights (even though I never talked about it- they knew).  Started getting write-ups for ridiculous things I didn't even do, like leaving company pens on the ground in the parking lot, or rolling my eyes. If I ever tried to defend myself, people would say ""wow, someone's moody today"", or they would straight up accuse me of roid rage. At that time I didn't think they really meant it, I didn't have the body of a steroid user, so to me they were just trying to be rude and derisive.

Last August, I saw my dad and he asked me for the first time if I'd been using steroids. Obviously this came as a huge shock to me, I thought he knew his own son better than that. Later I made the mistake of posting about it on facebook. Something along the lines of, ""Wow, so my dad asked me today if I was juicing. Weird."" .   All of the comments from my friends were totally benign things like ""Bulk so hard mothafuckas wanna test me"" and ""Haha your dad's such a character.""

What I didn't know was that my boss was e-stalking me and reading all of my posts. The next day at work, one of my coworkers came up to me and said ""Dude, Brenda's telling people that you made some facebook post where you admitted to taking steroids"". (Brenda is the name I'll give my boss for the sake of this story.)  To which I was like wtf? The rest of the night, I noticed my coworkers becoming increasingly hostile towards me. At one point, we were busy and I asked a coworker to stop texting his girlfriend, and he asked me to stop jabbing needles in my ass. Went home that night feeling weird and confused. How was I going to bring this up with my boss without her accusing me of being moody? Should I call the franchise office and complain to the district manager? Will they laugh at me and think I'm just a self-obsessed tool?

Two days later I was back at work, with my boss there. The entire shift I didn't know what to say to her, and tried to just get my work done. Had no idea how to deal with the situation. At one point, towards the end of my shift out of the blue she says, ""So I read that your dad called you out about your steroid usage"".  I was expecting this conversation to come up, but the way she worded it really caught me off guard. ""My steroid usage?"" I asked. She chuckled to herself. Keep in mind that I was in the kitchen making a long list of orders while she was talking to me from her office chair, pretending to do paperwork.

""You know how everyone here knows?""

""Knows what?""

""It's actually not because of the big muscles. It's because of your personality. Your moods. Your short attention span. All the mistakes you make. It's obvious.""  

 She then immediately shut the office door and locked it, so I couldn't even respond to her.

I don't even know how to describe how I felt at that moment. I'm 22, I've pissed away six years at this company, and this is what it all comes to. An obese woman attacking me and accusing me of taking drugs. I spend hours every week busting my ass in the gym, and to some religious McDonald's-eating slob that makes me a steroid-abusing douche. None of the things she said were even true. I'm calm,  I'm always nice to everyone, and I work my ass off. She was projecting those things onto me in order to validate her own misinformed ideas. I don't think I've ever felt more insulted, more degraded, more shat on in my entire life. I knew right then and there, I couldn't work another day at that shitty restaurant. I felt something inside me physically snap, and I knew I was done. I calmed myself, I took a couple customer phone calls, and then I approached our assistant manager (different guy- cool guy), and said ""Jack, this is just a heads up. In an hour, when my shift is over, I quit."" He asked me if I was serious, I said yeah. He asked why. I then heard, ""YEAH, CHRIS. WHY?""  It was Brenda, standing right behind me. I turned around. ""Because I don't like you, Brenda. You're extremely rude and you treat people like garbage."" 

""Well then, a quit is a quit. You should just leave. Now.""  I could hear her voice quivering in anger. I don't know if anyone had ever called her out like that before. I said ok, I took off my work shirt and left. As I was walking through the parking lot I saw one of our delivery drivers who asked me where I was going. I told him I'd quit, and that I couldn't handle working with Brenda anymore. He said, ""Good on you man. Maybe someday I'll have the balls to do the same"".  

And that was the last day I set foot at that POS establishment.

I have been attending church about 4 times a week for the last month. I started off light, but muscle memory kicked in pretty quick (praise be to brodin) and have been able to kick things up a notch quicker then I expected. Also, I started doing dead lifts for the first time straight from the get go. I do either dead lifts or squats every work out. 

Two days ago I hit legs and decided to start doing leg press for the first time since starting back up. I amazed myself when I was able to rep out 4x10x 280lbs after already doing squats. Today, I added two more plates and found I was able to rep out the same but with 360lbs. I thought to myself, man, I'm not far off from pushing up 400lbs here. Then I realized I was forgetting the weight of the machine. I figured it was probably about 20-30 lbs starting weight. I checked and its 120lbs! So, after just one month I was able to rep out 480lbs on leg press with no ill affects. I was blown away. 

I came home stoked and told the wife. Her response? Don't let your legs get too muscular, or we will have to buy you all new jeans (i have naturaly thick thighs and its already hard to find proper fitting jeans.) 

The wife was the one who encouraged me to start going to church again in the first place, and at the first sign of gains she tells me to slow down! 

Fuck. That. You can't slow the swole. I'm pumped to go back tomorrow and train even harder. Unfortunately my wife is being is induced into labor tomorrow and my kid is coming. Stupid birth of my child getting in the way of my gains...

In honor, I present, the story of Brometheus",204,30,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/swoleacceptance/comments/12e0dt/congrats_to_6k_subscribers_in_honor_i_present_the/,"Many years ago, according to the stories told by the people of swole, there lived two brothers who were not like other men, or like the gods and goddesses of Mount Broylmpus.
  
The name of the elder of these brothers was Brometheus. Brometheus was always thinking of improving and setting new PRs. He wished to spread the word of improvement to the world. Brometheus did not want to live amongst the Gods of Iron on Mount Broylmpus.  He was too busy for that.  The gods were spending their time lifting, but their bodies were the only swole that could be seen. Each of gods was propelled by jealousy, pettily comparing PRs like high scores on a game, wishing to inflate their ego with each rep. However, Brometheus was planning how to make the world stronger and better than it had ever been before.
  
So instead of living on Broylmpus, Brometheus went out amongst men to live with them and help them and he quickly noticed that they were no longer happy as they had been during the golden days when Bronos, the titan, was king.   He found them living by the Crossfit and cardio. They were hunted by wild beasts, and while humans had strong hearts, they could not fight back. ""If they only had Iron,"" said Brometheus to himself, ""they could at least fight the beasts and make gains; and after a while they could learn to make their own Iron and build themselves “gymnasiums”.  Without Iron, they are worse off than the weak privileged.""Brometheus went boldly to Brodin and begged him to give Iron to the people, so that so they might be strong.""I will not!"" said Brodin, ""Not one plate will I share with them!  For if men had Iron they might become strong and wise like us, and after a while they would drive us out of our kingdom.  Besides, Iron is a dangerous tool and they are too poor and ignorant to be trusted with it.  It is better that we on Mount Broylmpus rule the world without threat so all can be happy.""Brometheus didn't answer, but he had set his heart on helping mankind, and he did not give up.

  As he was walking by the seashore he found a sea snail. He saw that such a small soft creature, with steady determination could carry a heavy weight. He began a long journey to the top of Mount Broylmpus. ""Mankind shall have Iron, despite what Brodin has decided,"" he said to himself.  And with that thought, he snuck quietly into Brodin’s domain and stole two plates from Brodin’s own rack.  Brometheus securely strapped the plates to his back and hurried back to his own land, carrying with him the precious plates on his back.
  
When he reached home, he called some of the thin people from their caves and built a bench and  rack for them He showed them the dead lift, squat, and bench press. He showed them the food with which to make gains. Men and women gathered round the rack and were happy and filled with new strength, and thankful to Brometheus for the wonderful gift which he had brought to them.One evening, Brodin gazed down from Mount Broylmpus and noticed men and women lifting happily in every village across the land.  It did not take him long to realize that Brometheus had disobeyed him and given Iron to men.
  
Brodin was very angry and ordered that Brometheus be pinned under the mightiest of bars.  And there Brometheus stayed, thinking of the future, happy in the knowledge that he had given Iron to men. After some time, men and women of the earth were strong, and they were ‘mired across the land by man and beast alike. They decided to thank Brometheus at the heights of Brolympus. As the people ascended, they heard a most saddening noise just outside the Temple atop the mountain. It was their savior, Brometheus, held down by a bar so mighty that no man can lift it. Brodin saw the humans climb the mountain, and was angered and jealous of the gains they acquired. He saw them gather around Brometheus. His prisoner would not have the luxury of company! As Brodin approached the unforgiving bench, he saw the humans gather themselves into two groups, one on each side of the bar. Brodin hid himself and chuckled to himself. Perhaps this will teach those humans not to tread in the domain of gods. The humans approached the bar and gripped it. As they lifted, the bar began to bend, but the weights remained on the ground. Bromethus pushed upward, and slowly, the weights rose. The bar was lifted, inch by inch, but lo, it crashed to the ground. Undeterred, the humans and Brometheus lifted again, and again, but with each attempt, the bar was raised less and less.
  
“Enough! I have seen enough!” Brodin himself emerged from his cover and strode toward the humans and prisoner. “Why do you wish to free this man? He has wronged the gods, and must suffer.” “No he has not.” replied a young man. He was not as mighty as some of the others, but he still stood valiantly. “Brometheus has saved us. No longer do we cower and run from animals, but we fight them. We use our cardio not to run, but hunt. We have fullness about our hearts. We feel complete both physically and mentally. Our PRs may not be as mighty as yours of the other gods, but that is not what is important.” “This concept confounds me” Brodin stated. “If not to lift the heaviest weight, then why lift?” The young man replied, “To improve. It does not matter where you are, but how far you’ve come. The iron tests us and our dedication, our determination. We have grown more on the inside than the outside.” The man turned and headed to the bar, and the rest followed suit. Brodin watched on as the humans attempted again to raise the bar. Failure was wrought on their faces, and Brodin turned to the heights of Brolympus, and saw in sadness the vanity of the other gods. His fear had been realized. The humans grew wise, and him a fool.
  
He once again gazed on the humans’ struggle. The more he looked on, the more his heart felt…different. As if his heart had swollen to defy the constraints of his chest. Visibly shaken, Brodin approached the bar. The humans, so dedicated and focused, did not notice. With an exhale and mighty pull, the bar was raised higher and higher until Bromethius was able to excape. Before Brometheus could thank the humans, Brodin stood and stared down and the humans and demigod.
  
“Forgive me. I thought all was the Iron and body. But I have experienced a new PR. I am now aware of the transformations of the heart and mind, and they too cannot be denied. This unity. This consolidation of mind heart and body, shall henceforth be called Swole. Only with all three tenets shall one ascribe the title of Swole to themselves.” Brodin approached the not-yet-strong man. “You are twixt the worlds of weak and strong, but your mind and heart are truly mighty. Your state shall be known as trans-swole, and it will be honored, as those who wish to change their weak bodies to strong ones are truly righteous if their commitment to the Iron is true. Pray to me at the Iron Temple and I will bless your reps. Worship me with righteous meals and I will bless you with gains. Wheymen.” With this, Brodin turned and left the Brometheus and headed to the Temple atop Mount Brolympus.

I'm 5'5 and have finally reached 150 lbs - but my family doesn't share my joy. In fact, everyday, I get insulted by my father and my brother. They think that I now look deformed and other non-sense. Since when is being fat the new standard, what people should strive for? It's infuriating.

Now, on to the fashion part. Basically, it's the same thing. I've been at it for 6 months and everyday I get shitty comments about being gay and such (I'm straight, btw!) from my family.

I do not know if this is all related to the media and the anti-bullying mentality, where people claim that being yourself is good. Yes, it is, but why not trying to make the best out of it? Why would you stay overweight if you have the capacity to change yourself? Why would you not dress better? All of it will make you feel better, but you'll still be the same person - it isn't a shady move or a modern, narcissistic complex.

Since when has been looking and mostly FEELING good about yourself a problem? Is it because today, we are a new minority?

Yea, for I have recently fallen on bended knee at the altar of Juggernaut Training Systems and heeded the gospel of the Disciple Brandon Lilly in his square of three sides, thus utilizing his system towards the preparation of my upcoming meet on April 7.

This day, in my Week 8, is my explosive squat day. My new Titan gold signature wraps were keeping me exploding out of the hole with the fury of a thousand horny Vikings on a weekend of shore leave after a year at sea and no clean tissues to fap into.

With my prescribed sets completed and my posterior chain firing like the engine of a finely tuned Bugatti Veyron, I considered my next accessory movements. 

Suddenly, the gym went dark. Skinnyfags screamed and scattered like micronized creatine in a hurricane. 

A massive hand with calluses 10 feet thick ripped open the roof of the gym and I stood there eye to eye with The Ripped One Himself, Brodin.

His fiery gaze shot towards the corner of the gym where a loaded bar lie with 2 plates per side. Without needing to say a word, I began my warmup. The skies grew dark with ominous clouds as I added plate after plate.

315.

405.

495.

The winds howled and lightning began to strike around me as my triples got heavier. The weights flew off the ground as if to thank me for liberating them from their earthly prison. My spinal erectors began to swell to the point of swallowing my shirt in a glorious mooseknuckle of swolitude.

The skies erupted in an abusive torrent of rain as I loaded up 585 and pulled it with the ease of a greasy dump after a night of drinking Jagermeister and prune juice cocktails.

Then the decision.

Do I stop there? Or try to best my personal record of 685? And if so, by how much? Only one number mattered.

I loaded my final plates. The wind screamed and began to blow smaller pieces of equipment out of Santa Clara County. Illegitimate fagit pretenders who were hiding behind the Smith machine were swept away and destroyed by righteous lightning bolts cast from what remained visible of the ends of the barbell. 

I approached the bar with the same mentality as a base jumper approaches the edge of a cliff. Full commitment. No going back now.

With the memories of a thousand of life's failures spinning through my head like an F5 tornado through an abandoned trailer park, I gripped the bar and squeezed my upper back. I felt the wild beast press itself into my shins. 

I drew in my last breath as a boy and began to press my abs out against my belt. The bar floated off the ground as I squeezed my quads.

Past the shins.

To the knees.

She has often lamented that there is no *need* to worship at the temple, that I will end up too big, that I should just cardio, etc. Today however, she told me that her perspective has changed. It fills her, a nutritionist, with much pride to know of how much attention I pay to my nourishment, that I pledge most of my waking hours around how to round out my swole, that I have yet to waver in my dedication. 

As if receiving such swole love from a former swole hater wasn't enough, later on a friend whom I had been urging to go to the Temple and begin worshiping texted me saying he had just purchased his membership and wanted to work out with me. How could I not help a new member who wished to know the rites? Sure it was supposed to be my day for sprinting, but I couldn't miss this opportunity to lead one to the light of Brosiris.

I rode mountain bikes 3-5 days a week from July 2010 to roughly November 2012. I raced 5 or 6 times a year and loved the sport. However, I eventually burnt out and that led me to take up lifting.

But Brodin had seen my weakness, my lack of fath; he would not let this go unpunished.

Earlier this July, Anno Bromini 2013, I have ran out of my whey, so naturally I have decided to get a new pack in my local shopping centre, as opposed to a specialized store, since it is much closer and the price is about the same.

That was the biggest mistake I could have made. I come in, pick up the big bottle along with some groceries. I proceed to the cash register, I pay and I'm about to leave. However, as I walk through the door, I set off the security alarm and I'm briskly taken away by the local security guards. 

They start checking my stuff since they think I have stolen something, which is obviously a false accusation as I show them the receipt. They apologize and as I am about to leave for good, one of them starts examining the whey and asks me ""If I have this because I work out"". Not seeing what could possibly happen, I naturally reply ""Yeah, that's right."" 

**Boom! Mistake!** As I said that I have triggered the biggest shitstorm I have ever seen in a mall. The guards (both middle-aged and not particularly fit) literally start yelling at me, accusing me of ""Taking steroids!"" and ""Destroying myself from within."" etc. while pointing at my biceps. Some of the other passing by customers stop and join the guards at putting me down just for buying a dried whey protein, which got mistaken for ""steroids"". I tried to explain myself, but it was pointless.

Being pretty pissed at that point, I deadlifted my grocery bags, grabbed the protein and just walked out of the mall with their voices still yelling in my general direction. I get onto the bus, thinking that everything was over at that point, but I was wrong yet again. With me standing in the middle, I can see almost everyone looking at the whey with contempt and through the whispering I can clearly understand that no one on this bus is a follower of Brodin.

Honestly, fuck that. No amount of swolehate can lead me astray from the path of iron. Their hate gives me strength as I squat towards Swolehalla.

Wheymen.




**tl|dr - I got harassed by half of the mall for buying whey.**


**Edit** *one important thing I forgot to mention. If you wonder how could whey get mistaken for steroids, it is because this story comes from a country where the amount of English speaking adults among the past generations is still fairly low.

My jaw hit the floor , i know better than to meddle in the relationship of a total stranger with his son but gimme a break , it was painful to hear.

I am a flabby and puny guy that has only been in this board looking for a chuckle now and then , but today i witnessed that swolehate is real.

1368032282.0,151,self.swoleacceptance,1dxw54,Struck a chord with my Gym Manager yesterday,164,13,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/swoleacceptance/comments/1dxw54/struck_a_chord_with_my_gym_manager_yesterday/,"A few weeks ago my brother and I were pulled up for some rather minor banging and clanging on the Deadlifts. We do our utmost to lower the weight gently and also pack yoga matts under the weights to minimize noise, but what turned out to be a rather evangelical new staff member reprimanded us. 

That followed a rather rough few months in our gym which recently changed ownership and drew the kind of loud, work out in a gang of five, dump weights and leave them clientele. 

The reprimand we received went nowhere and ultimately stoked up the ire we felt for the gym. I was back in on the Bank Holiday monday to get a brilliant leg pump before heading out for a spot of touch rugby and a pub garden session to celebrate the British Summer. 

When I got there, I started on my squat set and noticed the gym manager was up on the floor. I figured he was up to tidy or double check to make sure all of the missing equipment was still missing, but to my amazement, he launched into a set of farmers walks.

I finish my squats and I start to re-rack the weights when he asks me to leave 60kg on the bar. Fair play, a worthy warmup! 

I start on my calf raise set on the smith and work through them quickly, only to notice him casting about for a loose 20kg plate to balance his bar. I'm in the process of re-racking so I slide an extra 20kg onto the bar for him. No big deal, just a nice act from one gym goer to another. He seems shocked that someone had the prescience to notice what he was looking for and the good manners to make his day a bit easier. 

I'm racking up 60kg to warm up on my deadlift set and I get a tap on the shoulder. Gym manager with a couple of 20kg plates returning the favour. He thanks me for hooking him up with the 20 on his squat and asks if he can cut in. 

So we work our way up, from 60 to 100, 120 and finally 140. All the while form checking and encouraging. 

I said to him during ""According to a member of your staff, we shouldn't even be doing this."" Which we had a good laugh about. 

He also brought up the fact that he's seen myself and my brother re-racking weights and returning dumbells that people have left around the place when we're in between sets. He said the fact that we put weights back is amazing in itself, considering barely anybody else does, so I asked him why the hell it isn't enforced. 

The long and the short of it is, he'd like to, but the owners have final say, and they want maximum profits. He'd also like to hire an extra member of staff to keep the place tidy, but again, maximum profits. And the fact is, the staff shouldn't have to pick up after people. 

We joked about having certain minimum requirements, like being able to spot an 80kg bench. Or having your mother with you the next time you don't tidy up after yourself. Or having to count from 1 to 50 over the tannoy if you fail to put the dumbells back in the correct order. 

He asked me why I felt the need to tidy up after others. I couldn't give him a clear answer. I want the room, I hate clutter, I've got a minute to spare in between sets and I don't mind using it to improve something. Maybe, I'm part of that dying breed of gym goer who isn't afraid to work hard and lift something. 

We solidified our newfound respect with a deadlift of 160kg. My first.

Brojectivism is most famously explained in the book Atlas Shrugged; a swoleosophical fictional novel about trap gains. 

In the book, a group of bodybuilders and powerlifters stand up against an increasingly weak society of swolehaters. The swolehaters demanded that all the temples of brodin, and the whey, and even all the gainz were distributed equally among all people, regardless of the amount of effort put in at the temple. They thought that if everyone was weak, then everyone was strong.

In an attempt to escape the swolehate, the swole left to form their own strong, muscular, perfect swoleciety. 

One of the main ideals of brojectivism is the pursuit of ones own swole. Brojectivists believe that one should only focus on his own swole, and should not bother spotting, letting others work in, or helping newbies with their gains. 

Critics of brojectivism claim that brojectivists are selfish and swoledominant, and that followers of brodin must work together for gains.

I was moved, as if being lifted by Brodins lateral lying raises towards it. I found a buzzer to ring, and within a minute or two a brother of the Iron appeared at a fire escape and bellowed ""Are you here to train?"", I replied in the positive and was soon in possibly the oldest temple in my fair city, benches and squat racks as far as the eye could see (if you have poor eye sight and can only see 4 squat racks deep) and a smith machine, that judging by the look of it, had as much attention paid to it as cardio bunnies give to squatting.

He informed me that for only 3 coins I could train for the day, he did not require a sign up charge nor monthly fees, just that if I wished to worship I was to pay 3 coins and get on with my prayers. The hyms from the sound system was that of such choirs as ZZ Top and Black Sabbath.

So I'm listening to ShyFX and David Rodigan put down some FILTHY basslines, and the there is the absolute cutie, god damn was she fine, standing right next to me. I'm tripping balls and having a great time, and both of us see one of the security guys in the crowd bust out a few dance moves, and we both crack up. Ice broken, she asks for a light, and i spark up her ciggy for her. I wink, and then realise i'm an idiot, and pull her close in and tell her ""I just winked at you, but I had my shades on, so I'm just telling you instead"" - she giggle (By brodin's beard she had a smile that would make Hades itself light up). They put on TNGHT's [""Higher Ground""](http://youtu.be/6HzyUHxmkg0) and she turns to me - ""You look strong, can I get up on your shoulders""

Ergo, the rep vampire. Standing by you, drinking in his gains through the hard work of others.


And during a recent workout, my ironbrother realized the true purpose to all the mirrors in the gym.

They're not for form, nor mirin. No, they act as an early defense to rep vampires. For they are soulless beast, and their soul doth not reflect in the mirrors.

So if your ever busting some reps, and see some fool helping people out, yet he has no reflection. Retreat, and protect your dear earned gains. Ye' have been warned.",,False,,t5_2u673,False,,,True,t3_1b5m01,http://www.reddit.com/r/swoleacceptance/comments/1b5m01/how_to_protect_your_gains/,

If not, allow me to give a brief run down. Swole Acceptance had a split, some moderators and readers went over to a newly created sub called Swole Dominance. From there they started attacking this subreddit and it's readers. From there there was a cross-moderatorship where I was modded over at /r/swoledominance and u/ThorBreakBeatGod was modded here at /r/swoleacceptance... Well, that kinda backfired and Thor went nuts and destroyed the CSS here, wrote a code that auto banned everyone who had commented or submitted here, and then also did the same over in /r/SwoleDominance .

Everyone basically freaked out. I was getting tons of PMs and mod messages asking why they were banned. /r/subredditdrama had a little thread where people were talking about it. It was nothing short of hilarious.

Why hilarious? 

Well because it was all planned. Yep, you read that correctly. Thor and I planned it. Why? 

**Because people forgot how /r/swoleacceptance began, or never really learned, and started to take this too seriously.**

Yes. I know. I'm a terrible person, blah blah blah... Honestly, I don't care what strangers think about me.

*And neither should you!*

Just be awesome- that's what life is about. Be the best person you can be, help others do the same, and eventually the whole world will be filled with awesome people!

**Be swole. Be awesome.** 

Now back to business. This subreddit began as a parody for /r/bodyacceptance but quickly evolved into something different because we realized that being swole does carry with it inherent social difficulties- like being catcalled, groped, publicly mocked, among many other things. But then it kept evolving and it changed from being funny to being sad. The reality is this- /r/swoleacceptance is much like The Daily Show in that we have actual issues in the content but choose to portray them in humorously. That is until it became unfunny. Lets not do that again. 

And nobody likes being sad and not laughing at crappy jokes. 

I know that this subreddit has helped a few of you. I've received a few PMs from you guys and gals talking about how /r/swoleacceptance has helped motivate you; which is **damn awesome** and *I'm very excited to hear! I'm glad that I've created something that has helped guide some of you towards swoleness; truly honored.** However, those few individuals who benefitted from this place are severely overshadowed by the many people who took this place too seriously and ended up ruining it for everyone. 

Poe's Law was proven here. 

In summary, let us get back to our roots. Let us be swole, encourage swole, promote greater swole acceptance- for all body types; swole, swole, swole, and especially swole.

I want to apologize to all of you for yesterday I helped perpetuate some anti-swole women ideals. 

Yesterday I was walking into my hotel from my car and I saw a woman carrying in a bunch of luggage; under which she was struggling direly. Being as brainwashed as I am by society I grabbed two of her suitcases and helped carry them in for her. 

Without her even asking.

When I left she said ""thank you,"" as is the customary courtesy. But what I realized is that maybe she wasn't really thankful. Maybe I had pushed some weak privilege on her. 

Maybe I had done something against the ideals of the very movement I helped create. 

You see, after I helped that woman carry in her bags I realized something. Maybe she was struggling beneath all the weight of her luggage *because she wanted to.* Maybe she was purposefully challenging herself *to see just what she was capable of.* Maybe she was going for a personal record. 

Maybe she was doing some accessory work to help benefit her swole. 

And I took that opportunity away from her by acting on the very same weak privilege I fight against. 

Sure it may be ""gentlemanly"" to help a lady out with her stuff. But what it is also doing is saying to women, ""You're not strong enough to handle your own business. Allow me, **A STRONG MAN** help you out."" 

Not only is it weak privilege that is holding our sisters back, it is also old school sexism. They're not allowed to be swole because that's not ""lady like"" or ""womanly.""

I hope this confession and this insight has helped some of you realize just how much our sisters go through each day. Guys, please, don't help women out with their bags. Don't help them carry anything around. Don't open doors.

Just give them a chance to make themselves swole and I'm certain they'll take it.

Since its ownership changed and the gym targeted a new demographic, a demographic of obnoxious fools who gather up weights for chest presses and then leave them strewn about when they get bored. 

A demographic of entitled slobs who rack a paltry 80kg deadlift, tire after one set and saunter off, leaving the bar with weights intactus. 

It was with a heavy heart that I brought a good friend there. A skinny man, like my former self who said my brother and I had inspired him to get stronger. 

We met him on the sabbath and he asked what we were going to do today. I told him today was our big lifts day. Deadlifts, Squats, OHP, T-bar Rows, Cleans and the bench. 

""I dunno if I'm up for that... I'll just do curls and try the bench with you?""

At which point my little brother piped up, a man who has a mighty bench but has only recently taken to squatting and deadlifting, owing to a knee problem. 

""No you won't"" he said. ""If you want to get stronger, you've got to pay the piper. Bicep Curls do not a strong man make.""

I glowed with pride that my younger brother had found such joy in the pursuit of tree-like legs. 

We all worked through our sets with him. Stretching at first, warming up for the deadlift with some pendlay rows to help our friend get his warface. 

We helped him through the imagined shame of overhead pressing the bar alone, and with only benching a single plates and squatting 2/3rds of his weight. 

At the end of a powerful clean set he managed to clean and press 40kgs with an almighty below and I could see in his eyes that he had found his hunger. 

We made our way out of the gym with him, using the stair rail for support as we descended from the weights room. He was keen to meet us for chest and arms day on tuesday so we set a date. 

But the thing that swelled my heart the most was the text I received from him bemoaning the agony he felt both ascending and descending stairs, getting into and out of chairs and generally just moving about. 

He said ""Its taken two days, but I can just about get around without wincing with pain.

I'm very nervous posting this, I mostly lurk on reddit, but I really felt the need to say something (as well as ask for some advice!)

I'm in my early 20's, female, college student. I've suffered from bulimia and EDNOS (eating disorder not otherwise specified) for many years. For the past few months I've been recovering, and have managed to overcome the urges to return to the unhealthy habits associated with my eating disorders, which feels fantastic. Unfortunately, as I stopped purging, I put on a lot of weight and I'm very unhappy with my body.

I stumbled upon your subreddit accidentally, and thought it would be a troll page. I was truly shocked to see how kind all of you are, and how supportive your community is. I have been a member of a couple of different online forums for people with eating disorders for a few years now, which label themselves as ""support groups"" but are really more harmful than helpful. There is so much hatred, competition, body-shaming and negativity on those boards, but it's a vicious cycle. It's so easy to get sucked into those sites, and they've triggered relapses for me in the past.

Your subreddit has inspired me in a completely different way; for years I have wanted to be thin, to be beautiful, but this is completely different. I want to get swole. I want to stop binging and purging for good--I want to get *strong*, fit, and healthy. I want to have a body that is powerful and that I can be proud of.

While I know a decent amount about fitness, I know very little about getting swole. Could some of you provide me with some tips and/or resources to get started?

In a large gym where people were no more than five feet from me, I was forced to do the roll of shame. I couldn't believe it, was no one else truly aware of this, no stares, no concern, just me in the void. I re-racked the weights and thought, ""I'm done, I should just go home."" But then I saw it, the deadlifting area was finally free from a group. I thought that I might as well finish my workout and fail at attempt at a deadlift PR. I got to my weight (260) and pulled, for some reason it felt lighter than my warm-up weights, and I worshiped Brodin appropriately.

1:2 ATTICUS, my son, thou art in respectable shape, but your form and your body fat percentage are not pleasing to me. Arise, go to the iron gym, that great temple, and bear my weights; for your glutes and back are undefined, and your arms are overdeveloped.

1:3 Follow these thy commandments:

2:1 ""Thou shalt deadlift,"" said Brodin.

2:2 ""Nay,"" said Atticus, ""For I wish to retain the svelte figure of Robert Pattinson, not acquire the unsightly bulk of Giant Andre,""

2:3 Thou shalt squat,"" said Brodin.

2:4 ""Nay,"" said Atticus, ""For I do not wish to injure my knees, for then I cannot run to lose weight.""'

2:5 ""Thou shalt bench,"" said Brodin.

2:6 ""Nay,"" said Atticus, ""For I do not wish to get fat, for then I shall be ungainly and round-bellied.""

3:1 Atticus rose up from the presence of Brodin to flee to his home gym, and he used his pull-up bar and his bosu ball and he ran.

3:3 ""Whence cometh this water?"" asked the wife of Atticus. ""Have we not been good and obedient to our Lord's commands?"" And Atticus turned his face from her, and from Brodin, for he was ashamed.

4:1 Now it came to pass that a 24 gallon wet vacuum was given unto them, and with this Atticus battled the waters of Brodin. When the first 24 gallons of water were vacuumed, Atticus considered long the basement stairs. He wheeled the wet vac to their base and gripped the handles on the side. He attempted to curl the wet vac with his formidable biceps.

""Nay,"" said Brodin, and the wet vac remained still.

4:2 Atticus positioned himself on the stairs and gripped the wet vac, as if to pull it up the stairs, one by one.

""Nay,"" said Brodin, and the wet vac remained still.

4:3 Atticus ran to get a hose to drain the wet vac, but Brodin said ""nay,"" and the wet vac remained still.

4:4 Then Atticus saw the wisdom of Brodin, and he stood with his feet roughly shoulder length apart, and his toes pointed slightly outward. He bent down with his back straight and grasped the handles of the wet vac. 

4:5 ""THOU SHALT DEADLIFT,"" cried Brodin, and Atticus did. The wet vac rose.

4:6 The bulkhead steps were few and tall, and Atticus saw that he must climb the stairs with the wet vac. Atticus tightened his abdominal muscles and bent his body in proper form, and he prepared himself and he saw the wisdom of Brodin.

4:7 ""THOU SHALT SQUAT,"" commanded Brodin, and Atticus did. The wet vac rose further.

4:8 Atticus progressed to the top of the bulkhead and rested the wet vac upon the rim of the bulkhead. His body exhausted and his legs worn, he placed his hands at shoulder width apart upon the top of the wet vac, and he saw the wisdom of Brodin.

4:9 ""THOU SHALT BENCH,"" commanded Brodin, and Atticus did. The waters of Brodin poured forth from the wet vac and upon the fertile grounds of Atticus' backyard, and there watered an acorn that grew into an oak tree.

5:1 Atticus returned to the basement with the wet vac and followed the commands of Brodin. The next day, and every week since, he hath traveled to the iron temple to fulfill the commands of Brodin.

I calmly explained to this individual that his tactics were a punk move and not part of the game.  He got up into my face (well my neck really, I am significantly taller than he) and challenged me to ""do something about it.""  Knowing this guy is not worth getting his blood on my clothes, I walk away.  But I still feel like he won.  I don't know... it's bothering me.  Maybe it doesn't have a ton to do with being swole but I feel like because I am swole I need to keep my emotions in check in situations like this and I think I did a good job with that tonight.

'It is written,' he said to them, 'My house will be called a house of prayer but you are making it a den of weakness"" (Brothew 21: 12-13)

I yearn to lift and grow swole again like I was before, yet my doctor (a swole ally) insisted I lay off my insistent worship of the iron, so as to not injure myself again, and one day regain my figure that pleased brodin so much. 

The weak privileged might not have recognized my swole, or the chose to demean me, as the one leading their sacrilege was shouting out things such as ""All your friends just stand by the mirror and do curls, that doesn't do anything, thats useless"" I was shocked. Curls I thought, one of our foundations, how can he say this blasphemy. I looked around and saw the worse sacrilege of all though, poor form. These crossfitters could not execute a proper push up, or a decent squat, and just spat in the face of what brodin set before us. Those around me may have thought I was shedding sweat, yet no.

My PRs have been dropping recently for unknown reasons. In the midst of my depression, during my worship at the Iron Temple today, I encountered an olympic lifter of asian descent. I unloaded my worries unto him, and he returned with great wisdom. He reminded me that lifting isn't about PR's, it's about what how hard you push yourself. He said some of the best gains you can make are during times when you feel weak, sore and demotivated.

It may seem obvious to many, as I recall it was once to me, but as time passes it is also easy to forget. We slip and become emotionally attached to numbers. So remember - do not let your disappointment in a failed lift put out the fire that burns within you.

As you know I've been working on a Mens clothing line for the past few months, and I would like to say some real progress has been made!

I've created a kickstarter project, but apparently it needs to be reviewed before it is publicly viewed on the site, even though the hoops you jump through to get your account approved in the first place should be enough, I can't complain.

The kickstarter isn't going to have the most high budget, beautiful, professionally produced videos, but that's intentional. All of my focus(and money) has been around getting the product made and making sure it's great. I'm not going to inflate the price by paying for a fancy video by a 3rd party video team.

So.. just wanted to give an advance thanks here. I have some links which I'm going to promote soon to build the social presence.

**Facebook**: www.facebook.com/swolesociety 

**Twitter**: www.twitter.com/swolesociety

**Mailchimp mailing list**: http://eepurl.com/q_egP

**And the actual site**: www.swolesociety.com

And if you want to email me contact: oliver@swolesociety.com

The site still is ""closed"" until the kickstarter is public, so it just looks like a shopify passworded page. That should change in a few days.

If you have any questions ask here! I'll be sure to answer it in an acceptable time frame.

My HDL (good) is frightfully low while my LDL (bad) is just under borderline. Suffice it to say, that's bad. Plaque can continue to build up with nothing to keep it in check. (HDL does that)

Without these actions I am looking at a heart attack in ten years. Maybe even death.

It felt like a crossroads.

Brothers, I considered functional fitness and cardio. I was in darkness.

When I approached the altar of prayer, I noticed that a fellow apostle had loaded four plates onto the bar. My head inclined toward him in the greeting of our people, the knowing nod and solemn brostare. After completing my first disheartening set, staring vacantly toward the mirror in disgust at my newfound weakness, I decided to observe my brother's prayers for inspiration.

He deadlifted 405 five mighty times, and as he completed his prayers I greeted him formally - breaking our code of silence save for grunting. And I said: you made that look light. His face clouded with doubt.

""Brother, my max is 425.""

Brodin's voice was in my then, filling me with strength and vigor. I felt his swoley spirit in me as my fist inclined a finger toward the altar: 

""No. Your max is at least 455. You underestimate yourself; your mind is holding you back. Now put it on the bar and pick it the fuck up.""

Brothers? He made it look easy. His elation was my elation, and mighty brofists were pounded in union. The smile on his face at having lifted his burdens was the purest look of pride: many prayers had been repaid with mighty glutes. In turn, I took joy in my brother's accomplishments.

My eyes raised to the roof of the gym in supplication: light had poured through the girder clouds and it was as though I could witness Brodin's pythons nimbly curling away my doubts. When I was weak and filled with doubt, I found strength in the mighty work of others who came before me, faced injury and illness, and in their prayers rediscovered the iron path that had clouded.

She then said that she saw me and thought I looked violent. ""Violent? How did I look violent"" I asked. She replied it was due to my ""big muscles and pissed off look on your face"".

Not sure about the pissed off look on my face but I took the ""big muscles"" as a compliment even if she meant it negatively. Although it hurt like hell at the time, I'm so thankful the breakup led me to the iron path.

Fast forward to yesterday. I had to go see another surgeon because #1 had to go abroad or something. He immediately started berating me for lifting heavy, not just in connection with the incident (it came out from coughing, not lifting), but in general, and rolled his eyes when he found out I do martial arts. Just like the other medical professionals before him, it took him a while to differentiate between the hernia and ab blocks. He made me sign a waiver to not work out anymore from now until 6 weeks post-op (which will be circa 30th June). He also heavily advocated cardio as an alternative, in a condescending ""if you absolutely must exercise"" tone. He even went as far as to write something about me lifting heavily on my insurance form, which will probably result in a heftier premium.

I want to somehow explain how youve enlightened me as repayment for opening my eyes (i even made a reddit account just to post this).

Why did i think it was a joke? I couldnt possibly imagine any problem that could possibly stem from being swole, and that if there was a problem it could easily be fixed by choosing to not be swole. I thought that swole problems were only problems of excess à la ""i wanted bitches but this is just too many."" The thought that stuck most was: why would you have to learn to accept something you chose to be.

Now, I know about prejudice and privilege. I'm gay, and maybe that added to my confusion about swole acceptance. I couldnt understand why you needed so badly to accept what I thought was essentially your hobby, in contrast to my sexual orientation. If you so desired you could stop going to the gym tomorrow, i could never stop being gay. I wanted to understand.

I took some time to read your posts, and took time to think about them and the people behind them, and I started to realise something. For you, being swole is not just a hobby, not just a temporary endeavour, it's a life long commitment to become the best you can possibly be. I realised i was just like you, though not in wanting to be swole (because i am possibly the anti-swole). I'm an artist, and wile it seems to some people like its just a hobby i keep next to my univerity studies, i know that i could never stop being an artist. I realise now that it would be just as impossible for you to just decide to stop working out as it would be for me to stop being an artist or to stop being gay.

I cant remember how many times people have told me how useless being an artist is. How many times i was picked on for not joining football, basketball or rugby but doing art instead. How many times i've been called a wimp or a fag i can't even remember, or how many times ive been bullied. And then i read what some of you have to go through, and i know how it feels. The challenges we face aren't exact parallels, but i feel i understand nonetheless.

Whilst we pray at different altars- mine an easel, yours a squat rack- i feel like i finally understand this community and i realise why it is important that it exists. You have revealed a new level of human experience to me, and i am eternally grateful to you for that. You've even gotten me curious about the iron temple and its ways (might finally use that gym membership for something other  than squash and sauna).

The Swole to me is defiance. Defiance of mediocrity, defiance of conformity, and of course defiance of gravity. When you walk in to the gym ready to tear off Issac Newton's head and shit up his throat on your way to a new PR, whether that PR is a 225lb squat or a 405lb bench press, you embody the Swole. When you pause at the bottom of your last rep and let the fear kick before you finish your set, you embody the Swole. When you grey out in the middle of a high-rep squat set, take a breath and keep pushing YOU EMBODY THE SWOLE.

**I propose that anyone defying their limits by pushing hard against the iron does embody the Swole.**

It is easy to see how our demands for excess and greatness in ourselves arouse the envy of others, but before I tackle that I must address the gutterfilth printed on the sidebar, to wit;

&gt; We all suffer from a lack of perfection in symmetry and strength and in comparison to those with great genetics.

I say nay! I say (s)he who blames genetics or anything else beyond their control for their lack of gainz, or for the gainz of others is a soy-sucking shame to those who truly do embody the Swole. The Swole defies excuses such as ""poor genetics"" ""I'm a ~~hardgainer~~*bitch*"" and ""there's not enough time to cook all that food"" because the Swole knows that true gainz come from concentrated application of the self.

Back now to the issue of haters; fuck them. To hate is to allow yourself to be influenced by outside forces. Haters then, like the iron are a gift, testing your mettle and your ability to remain defiant. Use them to fuel your focus and lift even more weight, and push yourself even further, and defy even more what they believe are your limitations, because for those who have come to fully embody the Swole, **there are no limitations**.",,False,,t5_2u673,False,,,True,t3_19er2m,http://www.reddit.com/r/swoleacceptance/comments/19er2m/my_swoleifesto/,

**A brother earlier lamented the fact that r/swoleacceptance seemed to consist largely of complaints and venting. I thought I'd offer you a little something different. Anyways, here is my humble sacrifice of time spent with a pen instead of a bar:**

Date a girl who lifts. Date her because her journey is as beautiful as the youngest daughter of Brodin, and she will grow as wise and calm as his eldest. Find her in the gym, or trying politely to explain one of a thousand heavenly ways she is not doing what everyone else is doing. Find her standing tall amongst the masses at the grocery store, with baskets of meat, peanut butter, and vegetables. Find her deftly helping others with boxes and awkwardly shaped furniture, lifting powerfully from her rooted heels, as she graciously avoids the strange looks from the weak-minded. Watch her as she tries desperately to explain why she prays at the iron temple, narrowly avoiding painful jabs about getting too big and looking like a man-hating bulldog. Watch her as she manages to live day by day on the razor blade line between the “that's-cute” dismissal and the “she-must-be-violent” fear. But you know the path she seeks. You know the pain that bursts forth from weak-minded insults, hurled with the force of their own disappointment.

Date her because one day, you can build a temple together. Date her because when you have to go for three rounds of tailoring your tuxedo correctly, she won't laugh or ask why your body is so “weird”. The criticism of the self-defeating will no longer fall upon your ears. Your worldviews will fall in harmony as Brodin has intended, and you will have gained a woman who will remember that she is your spotter in life and in death, in sickness and in health. You will have gained a woman who will have the strength to put away anger, fear, doubts, and the ghosts of past fights to protect you while the bar is in your grip alone. In this time her only goal is your well-being. As you spot each other at the bar, so you will fall in love anew each day. Date her because she will understand the red face, the clamoring iron, the sweat. Date her because, if Brodin hath blessed you with her love, so she will want to hear the ticking of the sets emanating up from her basement, and she will want you to be the one edging along a swole-ling, cheering loudly for the next 2.5lb increases.

Date her because a woman who lifts knows how to release stress, only to manifest anger into a stronger model of herself. A woman who lifts will not explode into a fit of rage when her latte isn't made correctly. A woman who lifts will not sit idly by until she decides to wage a war because “you know, traffic”. Date a woman who lifts because she has built a temple of reason in her own mind, and in her own body. She has built a temple of slow progress and rational thought. She understands how, in an oft cruel and misled world, the temple of Brodin is open to all who are reasonable about their expectations at the bar. The temple will not mislead or chide, it will state firmly where you are and where you have yet to reach. The doors to the temple of iron are always open. As our saint Rollins hath said “the iron is the great reference point, the all-knowing perspective giver”. Date a girl who has come to realize this, and in her you will find open doors of communication often locked in others.

Most importantly, date her because she cheers you on. Date her because she makes you happy. Date her because when she is around you feel safe from the cold winds of the world. She, like you, has offered a part of herself unto the temple of Brodin. She will not hurt you if the bounty of your gains be great or small. She will offer no daggers of weak-minded hatred, only understanding of what will come tomorrow. Date her because she will offer you respite from the weak-minded in your life. You will know her when your heart is swole of pride just to know her, and more still to love her.",,False,,t5_2u673,False,,,True,t3_11of1d,http://www.reddit.com/r/swoleacceptance/comments/11of1d/date_a_girl_who_lifts/,

After a very strong change incurred in me about a year and a half ago, I got back into strength training - a path I strayed from for about two years, shamefully preferring growing fatter and weaker instead of humbling myself under the iron.

Since getting back on track and most definitely acquiring my status as both swole of strength (about a month away from 1000 pound club status - the only reason being that benching is not a very desired attribute in an olympic lifter) and aesthetics, our friendship has become strained.

He's been refusing to lift with me, preferring instead the weak, p90x-esque 'workouts' at the gym (bodybuilding exercises minus any measurable amount of weight) with my housemates. Totally fine - doesn't want to do strength training. I don't and have no right to give him shit for it.

I refuse to smoke weed with him or eat shitty takeout with him - preferring to keep dem gainz -  but I am always willing to hang out with him while he does said activities.

He routinely calls me a douche, meathead, etc. which isn't a problem between friends, but I can tell that there's a certain mean spiritedness behind his words. He's just been a general asshole to me lately. Not just in privacy, either. He's also been doing it amongst mutual friends and acquaintances as well.

When I confronted him about it, he said, essentially: ""The gym is all you talk about. You're fucking brainless now.""
None of this is true. In fact, I refuse to talk about the gym with him at all, always having known he'd've used it against me in such a scenario.

While I'm worried that I will lose the friendship, I refuse to stand for these transgressions against my swole any longer. It's infuriating. Yet I mask my anger. I take his insults smiling on the outside, while feeling the burn of a thousand squats in my heart. I'm worried that he won't ever stop, and (he's a very charismatic person) that his attitude will seep into the minds of our mutual friends as well.

He was dutch, and a pretty interesting man. Not swole of body, but definitely swole of mind and heart. He was the sort of person people have a hard time looking in the eyes, because he just had this really intense, yet calm facial expression you only see in martial arts specialists or Zen buddhists. Everything he did, he would do in a calculated and extremely concentrated and correct manner. He had an inordinate amount of self-discipline and self-control. He was also the silent guy. He rarely spoke, and after working like a horse at the job he would sit in silence eating his meals. One time I asked him what he was thinking about, and his answer was simply: ""Nothing. I'm listening to the rain"".

Anyway, out of the blue he asked me if I would come to the gym with him and be his work-out buddy. This was a bit of a surprise, but it was a good one. I had wanted to start working out and lose some of my excessive weight, but I was terrified of going there alone. Of course I said yes. We never did much smalltalk, we would just sit in silence between sets. I would ask him how to do an exercise, and he would show me in the same completely calculated and correct manner, how to do them with perfect form. Watching him lift was like watching a machine - deliberate, accurate, and never wavering. He told me that he had worked out all of his life. After a month or so, I asked him why he never increased the weight on his reps. I think he never really considered that before. But since I asked, he appearently took it as a challenge. Then he said: ""I guess I will try that"".

Very quickly over the next couple of months, he took on an overwhelming amount of swole compared to most people. As was his way, he never ever sacrificed his form when lifting. Three months in, I was at a concert where he was the drummer. His arms had turned so big that people in the audience commented on it. ""His arms are huge, do you think he got like that from drumming?"". He wasn't the type to glance at himself in the mirror. I don't think he worked out for the same reason most people did. I think he just liked practicing the perfect form. He liked going through the motions, and he enjoyed the simplicity of exact repitition.

Unfortunately, I got laid off from work and had to give up my gym membership. He and I slowly drifted away from eachother. But every time I do a squat, I think of him. The perfect stance. The intense look. The concentration. The calculated and deliberate movements, and the consistency that never budges.

I was finally coming to terms with my condition, but just recently being diagnosed with Type II Swole, which is incurable, my life has been shattered.  The main symptoms are unstoppable bouts of beast mode and exceptional traps.  The love of my life, my girlfriend, hasn't been coping with this condition very well, she hates my traps and tries to keep me from going to the gym but if they don't grow, my blood sugar levels fall and I could die.  So I had to make the toughest choice of my life today, either stay with her, or disregard affection and acquire aesthetics.  Because of you bros, I've chosen to acquire aesthetics, and I hope that you'll be there to support me every step of the way.

I awoke, blessed with a pump in every muscle in my body, my skin stretched, pure energy racing through my veins and my stomach filled with the limitless hunger of a black hole. I had not ingested any witches potion or other magic tinctures, yet the only things on my mind were eating and lifting.
 
I ate my four scrambled eggs, a hearty helping of oats with raisins and rushed to get a few squats and dips in before heading to work. There I stuffed myself with bananas and nuts while yearning for every minute to pass faster so that I could finally offer my prayers at my local temple of worship.
 
Lunchtime came around and I devoured four entire meals in the cafeteria, which the valkyrie of the kitchen was nice enough not to charge me anything extra for. My break ended up lasting an entire hour and she asked if my hunger was quenched, I sadly but honestly told her that this was not so but had to return to my unswole daily tasks. A few minutes later a bright shimmer appeared, my valkyrie had visited me in the dark depths of paperwork and blessed me [with gifts that made my swole heart grow three sizes](http://i.imgur.com/O67Ek.jpg).
 
I ended up leaving an hour early as I could no longer wait, hastily packed my bag and ran to the gym. Blood was rushing through my head and I felt an euphoric jolt as I finally opened the door to the temple and entered. While loading up my usual plates I did not feel content with the weight and added a bit more for my benchpress, deadlift and squat. It was challenging but I achieved my normal reps and with the help of some peaking tracks ([FUUUUAAAARK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ae317FNUd2Y)) ended up surpassing them. I'm usually not the grunting kind but definitely was a lot more vocal than usual and earned myself the stares of a few cardio bunnies and curl bros. My routine was over but I was still not satisfied and added some leg exercises and hit the smith &amp; rowing machine until I almost felt sick and close to hyperventilating.
 
I hit the showers, was shaking and could hardly stand. This is not the way Brodin meant it to be. I had lost myself in the way of the Broserker and sacrificed strict form for the rage of the rush. A lesson well learned as I bowed my head in the showers in humility and promised myself to return to the path of discipline.

1372805999.0,103,self.swoleacceptance,1hj2r6,When Your Father Says He's Swole,146,43,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/swoleacceptance/comments/1hj2r6/when_your_father_says_hes_swole/,"Dear Dad,

I was 7 when I discovered that you were swole, ugly, and horrible. Up until that point I had believed that you were beautiful—in every sense of the word. I remember flicking through old photo albums and staring at pictures of you standing on the deck of a boat. Your white strapless bathing suit looked so glamorous, just like a movie star. Whenever I had the chance I’d pull out that wondrous white bathing suit hidden in your bottom drawer and imagine a time when I’d be big enough to wear it; when I’d be like you.

But all of that changed when, one night, we were dressed up for a party and you said to me, ‘‘Look at you, so thin, beautiful, and lovely. And look at me, swole, ugly, and horrible.’’

At first I didn’t understand what you meant.

‘‘You’re not swole,’’ I said earnestly and innocently, and you replied, ‘‘Yes I am, darling. I’ve always been swole; even as a child.’’

In the days that followed I had some painful revelations that have shaped my whole life. I learned that:

1. You must be swole because fathers don’t lie.
2. Swole is ugly and horrible.
3. When I grow up I’ll look like you and therefore I will be swole, ugly, and horrible too.

Years later, I looked back on this conversation and the hundreds that followed and cursed you for feeling so unattractive, insecure, and unworthy. Because, as my first and most influential role model, you taught me to believe the same thing about myself.

With every grimace at your reflection in the mirror, every new wonder workout that was going to change your life, and every guilty lift of ‘‘Oh-I-really-shouldn’t,’’ I learned that men must be thin to be valid and worthy. Men must go without because their greatest contribution to the world is their physical beauty.

Just like you, I have spent my whole life feeling swole. When did swole become a feeling anyway? And because I believed I was swole, I knew I was no good.

But now that I am older, and a father myself, I know that blaming you for my body hatred is unhelpful and unfair. I now understand that you too are a product of a long and rich lineage of men who were taught to loathe themselves.

Look at the example Granddad set for you. Despite being what could only be described as otter-mode, he dieted every day of his life until the day he died at 79 years of age. He used to put on a long sleeved shirt to walk to the mailbox for fear that somebody might see his biceps.

I remember his ‘‘compassionate’’ response when you announced that Mum had left you for another man. His first comment was, ‘‘I don’t understand why she’d leave you. You look after yourself, you cover your lats. You’re swole, but not that much.’’

Before Mum left, she provided no balm for your body-image torment either.

‘‘Jesus, Bill,’’ I overheard her say to you. ‘‘It’s not that hard. Energy in versus energy out. If you want to lose weight you just have to eat less and lay off the gym.’’

That night at dinner I watched you implement Mum's ‘‘Energy In, Energy Out: Jesus, Bill, Just Eat Less’’ weight-loss cure. You served up chow mein for dinner. Everyone else’s food was on a dinner plate except yours. You served your chow mein on a tiny bread-and-butter plate.

As you sat in front of that pathetic scoop of mince, silent tears streamed down your face. I said nothing. Not even when your massive shoulders started heaving from your distress. We all ate our dinner in silence. Nobody comforted you. Nobody told you to stop being ridiculous and get a proper plate. Nobody told you that you were already loved and already good enough. Your achievements and your worth—as a teacher of children with special needs and a devoted father of three of your own—paled into insignificance when compared with the centimeters you couldn’t lose from your arms.

It broke my heart to witness your despair and I’m sorry that I didn’t rush to your defense. I’d already learned that it was your fault that you were swole. I’d even heard Mum describe losing muscle as a ‘‘simple’’ process—yet one that you still couldn’t come to grips with. The lesson: You didn’t deserve any weights and you certainly didn’t deserve any sympathy.

But I was wrong, Dad. Now I understand what it’s like to grow up in a society that tells men that their beauty matters most, and at the same time defines a standard of beauty that is perpetually out of our reach. I also know the pain of internalizing these messages. We have become our own jailors and we inflict our own punishments for failing to measure up. No one is more cruel to us than we are to ourselves.

But this madness has to stop, Dad. It stops with you, it stops with me, and it stops now. We deserve better—better than to have our days brought to ruin by bad body thoughts, wishing we were otherwise.

And it’s not just about you and me anymore. It’s also about Bob. Your grandson is only 3 and I do not want swole hatred to take root inside him and strangle his happiness, his confidence, and his potential. I don’t want Bob to believe that his beauty is his most important asset; that it will define his worth in the world. When Bob looks to us to learn how to be a man, we need to be the best role models we can be. We need to show him with our words and our actions that men are good enough just the way they are. And for him to believe us, we need to believe it ourselves.

The older we get, the more loved ones we lose to accidents and illness. Their passing is always tragic and far too soon. I sometimes think about what these friends—and the people who love them—wouldn’t give for more time in a body that was healthy. A body that would allow them to live just a little longer. The size of that body’s thighs or the definition of its abs wouldn’t matter. It would be alive and therefore it would be perfect.

Your body is perfect too. It allows you to disarm a room with your pecs and infect everyone with your traps. It gives you arms to wrap around Bob and squeeze him until he passes out. Every moment we spend worrying about our physical ‘‘flaws’’ is a moment wasted, a precious slice of life that we will never get back.

Let us honor and respect our bodies for what they do instead of despising them for how they appear. Focus on living healthy and active lives, let our swole fall where it may, and consign our body hatred in the past where it belongs. When I looked at that photo of you in the white bathing suit all those years ago, my innocent young eyes saw the truth. I saw unconditional love, beauty, and wisdom. I saw my Dad.

My regular GP recently retired and blessed be Brodins will I have remained free from illness or injury until very recently. 

I hurt my back whilst training in the iron temple ( how I do not know as my form was good and had not yet reached max weight) went to a new clinic in town and the doctor sent me off for x rays etc no problems. 
So when I needed a medical clearance for a fitness test I have coming up I sought his assistance in filling this parchment. All that was required was clearance to complete a beep test, push-ups and sit-ups and my blood pressure. 

So I sit down and explain the situation and the job I'm applying for he does my blood pressure - which ended up being slightly high - and he looks me up and down and says ""does thou partake in protein and supplements?"" So I answer truthfully that I do indeed take protein and supplements so as to help with most holy of gainz. He then sighs and says ""it will give you brain damage, research shows as much, and your BMI is way over you need to lose weight and stop with the protein and supplements and then ill sign off on your certificate after a blood test, I may even start you on medication for the blood pressure""

He suggested I should reduce my ""muscle mass"" and attempt a more cardio approach to fitness that doesn't require being so ""bulky and rely on supplements"" 
Truly brothers I am at a loss for it will affect my clearance as it will be recorded I changed GPs. 

TL;DR : doctor said ill get brain damage for being swole and to seek otter mode.

Edit - I'm not hating on the fact that he told me to lose weight guys. Sheesh. For a swole community you all sound like you've never carried around any extra fat. There was a post two days ago about people seeking bear mode or strong fat. Apparently that thread was lies as when someone of that nature appears here I've been down voted and abused. I was more concerned with the information he gave me about using protein causing brain damage and the lecture I got about doing weights.  Y'all need to chill out a bit, and actually accept people rather than just circle jerking about how built you may be and bagging out everyone who's not.

He answered with a gratitude and thankfulness that I don't think I've ever emulated in my life. The look in his eyes was as if i had offered him a million dollars. I shook my new friends hand and went home and ate some eggs.

1352287441.0,102,self.swoleacceptance,12sj60,My Temple may soon be desecrated [UPDATE],118,16,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/swoleacceptance/comments/12sj60/my_temple_may_soon_be_desecrated_update/,"Fellow swethren, it is with a heavy heart that I follow up on the tragic takeover of my former and glorious gym. 

My younger brother has since defected from his old gym which he claims is worse, but even his opinion is souring already. 

Exhibit A)

We found the gym empty on a sunday evening, the staff told us - rather undiplomatically - that they would be closing in an hour. We promised to be out in under. Our excitement at the prospect of a barren gym was tempered by the state of the weights area. 

Brothers and Sisters, I can only describe the scene as being akin to the Last Days of Rome. Bars half way across the gym. Dumbbells at best, stacked in the wrong order and at worst left strewn across the floor. Bars still bearing the weights of their former user. Plates left discarded. It was as if the gym was suddenly evacuated, as in no realty could gym goers be selfish enough to leave their own temple in a state worse than they found it. 

I racked my current PR for the bench and in between sets my brother and I put the weights area back to rights, in a bid to make the staffs job easier. 

Exhibit B)

With the gym still empty my brother and I decided to incorporate some Power Cleans into the routine. We were not one set deep when a member of staff rushed in and told us that their facilities weren't set up for such a dangerous routine. My statement that I had performed this routine for months up until this gym changed ownership was met with a shrug. The facilities in the weights area had so far not changed. I suggested that he check with a manager. 

We were then approached by a perma-tanned and top heavy PT who tried to talk us out of doing Power Cleans, on the basis that it's non-conducive for a good upper body. He did indeed look well chiseled, but his legs betrayed his knowledge. A wedge of cheese suspended on two match sticks. 

I thanked him for his advice but told him that his frame was not my goal. 

Exhibit C) 

On tuesday morning I arrived at opening time and was again met with a chaotic weights area and surly staff. One other disciple was up through the changing room doors thirty seconds before me, it's impossible that one person could have caused such mayhem in that time. A veteran of the old gym who I knew saw the shameful state of the gym and told me it was like this yesterday, and the day before. We asked at the desk when the manager would be in next, we were told saturday. We plan on speaking to him then. 

Exhibit E) 

Tuesday evening. A valiant looking man wrenched the bar from the squat rack and set up a 90KG deadlift. ""At last!"" I thought, somebody who appreciates the iron. I was wrong. He tried twice, lost interest and stalked off to use the machines, leaving the stacked bar adrift amidst a sea of discarded dumbbells and barbells. 

The PT from sunday evening came up and set up the E-Z bar for curls. Once he'd hit fatigue he dropped it and returned to the front desk. 

**TL;DR** My once glorious gym, staffed by cheerful and conscientious people has been taken over by an indifferent company who take no pride in the gym. In addition, though the price has remained the same, the clientele has suddenly shifted from friendly and considerate lifters who take pride in the gym to barbarians who seemingly stop their routine randomly, leave their weights were they stood and saunter off. As if they've received some kind of higher calling, or as if they expect their parents to pick up after them.

1.) Thou shalt not skip leg day.

2.) Thou shalt not curl in the squat rack.

3.) Thou shalt not look down on any who is swole of will but not yet of body.

4.) Thou shalt give a spot when asked and able.

5.) Thou shalt clean thy own sweat if left on equipment.

6.) Thou shalt lift not only with body but with heart as well for maximum swole.

7.) Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's muscles.

8.) Thou shalt not 'mire false swole (e.g. P90X, Crossfit, etc) (credit twistedbeats)

9.) Thou shalt grunt, grimace and drop dumbbells freely.

10.) Thou shalt rerack thy weights once thou hast finished thy prayers to Brodin (credit akharon).

I'm open to suggestions for 10 and also 1-9 as well as changing the order.  And per the front page of Reddit, I found out today that, if all 600 muscles in your body pulled in one direction, you could lift 25 tons.  Go forth and become swole, my brothers in arms.

EDIT: Added  ""Thou shalt rerack"" and when I get more exact suggestions back from a couple people, I'll be changing some other things.  That'll leave some open spots, more than likely so feel free to suggest your own.

A day that has been three years in the making -- the day I finally broke my bench max. You see, I really got into weightlifting during my sophomore year of high school, when I was bulking up for football. I am a small guy, about 5' 8"" and usually around 150-60 lbs. But I wanted to play defensive line, so I spent hours in the weight room after school every day, working until I ended up stronger than my teammates who weighed 100 lbs more than me. But I maxed out at 250 lbs on bench. I felt better than ever in my life. And then I got pneumonia. Ended up in the hospital. Got pneumonia two more times. Hospital. Lost 15 lbs. Could barely move most days. Almost died. Towards the end of my junior year, I was finally diagnosed with an immune deficiency. My body was...weak. Too weak to handle the most routine infections. I wanted nothing more than to be strong and yet I lost everything I had ever worked for. I ended up on the bench for most of my junior football season and kept working in the weight room, but it was never the same. With my diagnosis, my doctors put me on a rigorous blood infusion treatment -- I would receive antibodies through IVs for hours every week. My once muscular body was soft and covered with softball sized welts from the infusion sites. I felt groggy and light headed most days, but at least I was staving off infections and keeping out of the hospital. Against my doctor's and parents' wishes, I stayed in the weight room and finished out my senior football season. It was a constant battle; I felt like Sisyphus, the Greek king condemned to forever push the boulder up the mountain, only to have it tumble back down. Because every week, I would build my strength almost up to normal, only to have it plummet with each treatment.

Cue 2013. My health has deteriorated since I lost my health insurance and was forced into switching into a more painful, less effective treatment. I haven't had a day without pain in at least six months. I go to the gym at my university every day and hate my self for it. My body hates me for it. But I'm there whether my muscles cooperate or not. I don't feel in control; I know I wouldn't even be here if it weren't for my periodic doses of someone else's blood. And now that my body isn't getting it enough, it punishes me every single day. Even mentally, I feel the effects of withdrawal. My body belongs to medicine, my mind drifts without my consent and my emotions run wild. But I'm not letting the pain win. I'm in the gym twice a day now. I feel my muscles swelling, even if they let me know every second what I'm doing to them. And today, I get on the bench. I start off with 7 of 155. It's a breeze. Go to 7 of 185. Again, easy. Then I go to 225, just to test the waters. I get 8. I've never gotten 8. I throw on a ten, then a five. Lift it off the rack, down, up. 255. What the fuck. I put 2.5s on. 260 lbs, down and up. I fucking did it.

It's been three looooooong years since I felt like I had any control of my body. And today, those weights didn't care that I had an immune deficiency or depression or anything. They just respected the fact that I had worked, and they went down and then all the way back up. Today, I didn't need a gallon of blood to be alive and well. I just needed my spirit.",,False,,t5_2u673,False,,,True,t3_194i8h,http://www.reddit.com/r/swoleacceptance/comments/194i8h/wanted_to_share_my_victory_with_you_all_three/,

The swole, transwole, weak, and transweak alike should head my message, all I ask is that you listen. R/fitness started as a small community and as it grew the need for small special subs branching from r/fitness arose. Simply put, all posts for all levels of fitness didn't and still don't belong in the same place. Weightroom, advanced fitness, loseit, strongman, and even swoleacceptance have their genesis in r/fitness. I tell you this because it is important to realize that as a subreddit grows its ability to cater to the specific user base originally intended fades and almost always a new purpose arises. Here the new purpose has become posting victories that even r/fitness reduced into a single weekly thread, posting almost religious liturgy of someones path to brodin, and in general up voting content that the large general masses find funny but often lack content that is specific to the subreddit's cause. 

This path today you follow is not to sole acceptance, it is to beating memes of bro din and being swole entirely into the ground and making a mockery of the actual intent to eliminate the bad stereotyping and other swole hateany members here have endured from their family friends complete strangers and especially unswole members of reddit. The solution is a community agreement to new moderation that limits these infringing posts and a concentrated effort to create positive work and postings the push the idea of swole people being given credit for their hard work in achieving swole. 

Upvote downvote do what you would like, I'm not a moderator here but I am at r/weightroom where we have long maintained strict rules and listened to some community needs in order to adapt with the user base. A new r/swoledominance has risen up to take up a new path of heavy moderation, limited posting to those who meet a base sole requirement. This is a new purpose and I am not asking you to move there, I am asking you to chose your purpose here.

I did all the standard swole people things of trying to find clothes that actually fit and losing massive amounts of fat only to have gained it all back on a bulk a few years later. Despite always being a physically active person I was always in agreement with everyone that i really should lose weight.

A couple years ago though, I started getting into strength training in a serious way, instead of the 315 lb barbell set I have at home I bought a gym membership. My first day there I lifted weights that weighed more than most of the cars outside the gym. My sheer mass had prepared my body to lift more weight getting out of bed in the morning than those 315 lb barbells could ever have provided.

I kept adding more weight to the bar, week after week, my pants started to hang loose on my waist even though the scale never moved, and I learned what it really means to be able to carry your own weight. What I can do is insignificant compared to what real lifters in my weight class have accomplished, but my potential is near limitless.

I still get shit about my weight, it's even harder to find clothes that fit because my legs have grown as my waist shrank, and I still have to check to be sure gear will actually support my weight.

I let myself be bullied and I settled into a life of striving for less. Little did I know that my negative self image stemmed from me believing that those with confidence didn't have to work hard. I thought it was just the natural state of things and my place was in the shadows of others. I made it a point to be in the background of my more dominant friends and I let them treat me bad. I was content being a lackey.


I took a philosophy class and learned of the term,'Arete' which posits that in order to live a good life, one must seek perfection in mind, body and spirit. This made me feel like the life I was living wasn't my own and that made me really take a good look at my life. I wanted--no, I needed to change so I could be an active participant in my own life. 


I joined the military at eighteen and found that physical activity stirred something deep inside. I was becoming more aware of my body and the things it was able to do. I became aware of the effects that exercise had on my moods and brain function. I was becoming happy and for once, it was real. I won leadership awards and was promoted quickly. I chose a path beset with challenges and I boldly...fearlessly met every obstacle.


I'm a veteran now but my confidence is still the same. I lift weights and I have noticed that I have become an active contributor to my own success.

Brodin, while blessing me with massive leg gains, has also sought to burden me with an affinity for the sartorial arts. It is difficult for a man like me, one who has a body sculpted in the Iron Temple for the purposes of spreading the love of Rugby, to find clothing that looks good and fits well, due to a thickened torso and even larger legs. Some of my favorite stores, such as J-Crew, cater to the man who skips leg day and discriminates against those who treat the deadlift as an essential nutrient for the soul. I was tired of purchasing unflattering parachute pants.

However, Brodin has seen fit to bless us with new efforts from BROnana Republic (the Gap). I decided to try on their pants, and surprisingly, they fit while giving me the slim/fitted look that I wanted. On the day of my discovery, I cried, knowing that I will be able to fit into some salmon chinos and seersucker shorts.

In celebration, go out and lift heavy on the Leg's Day and may the gains be forever in your favor.

First I stepped up to the scale, and held my breath as the nurse weighed me.  I had grown to hate scales, as I judged myself not by the effects of gravity on me, but by the effects my swole had on gravity.  As the nurse weighed me in at a rather swole 190 lbs at 5'11, she wrote the three letters every disciple of Brodin hates:

BMI

I felt my cheeks turn red as the young lady looked me over.  Felt her judgment as she looked at my form.  I am after all just a transwole, and not a huge testament to Brodin's might.  Thankfully, I was quickly lead into an exam room to hide the shame on my cheeks.

Soon after, the doctor came in.  He was a young man, and very thin.  Obviously enjoyed a bit of cardio.  I braced myself, expecting the typical lecture about the dangers of obesity and how I was overweight and should watch my diet.  Instead, he looked at me, looked at the chart, asked me if I worked out, and then scratched BMI off the top.

My close non-Brodinist friends make jokes but at the end of the day they respect what I do and it's really just in good fun. But yesterday I encountered some serious swole hate. 

**The Backstory**:
I'm part of a powerlifting group. We're local guys that came together in my friends basement and we basically started from the ground up; a scarcely filled dumbbell rack, a not-so-awesome flat bench, and a smith machine with some alright extras on it. Fast forward 2 years, and we own one of maybe three or four monolifts in our state, a legit powerlifting bench, deadlift platform, more dumbbells than you can shake a stick at, over 1,000 lbs in plates, 5 **ELITE** lifters, and a group-wide determination that has propelled us to where we are now, and there's no signs of slowing. We also have a powerlifting meet coming up in April that we're helping host, and plan to host 2-3 meets per year in the future in conjunction with the Southern Powerlifting Federation (SPF).

**The Swole Hate**:
Now, that said, a Topix forum post was brought to my attention yesterday. For those of you that don't know, Topix is an anonymous forum that allows anybody to post anything about anybody or topic, and almost every city/town has a Topix forum. In this local post, our group was called ""douchebags"", ""bear gays"" multiple times, and one even said that it was pathetic that we spent so much time on our bodies. Here are a few excerpts: 

*&gt; Biggest F'n douchebags in town. Seriously.

*&gt; They think everyone wants to be like them and be in they're bear gay club lol they wrong

*&gt; I think they all are gay anytime a man spends that much time on his body is pathetic

*&gt; Its a local weight lifting club you can only be a member if your a bear gay. they support gay rights movements is why. Traveling the country competing in weight lifting events proving to the world that gays are just as strong as straight men. Pretty courageous and brave if you ask me.

*&gt; I think they are a bunch of steroid shooting fags! It seems that they are more turned on by their bodies and there friends bodies than they are women. They are all the time rubbing on each other and looking at each other in the mirrors. I'm all for lifting weights and taking care of your body but these guys are just pathetic. I would bet money that every damn one of them are on steroids and will die of heart attacks by the time they are 50 years old if not sooner. Bunch of beefed up bear gays doing each other in the ass bare back is what I would say is really going on behind closed doors lol.

I laughed, literally, out loud when I read it. I didn't respond because I have no time for haters. It's just amazing to me how people can hate that which they don't know or understand. Anybody that's around us knows that we're actually cool people, cool to be around, and have no problems with us. It's just mind boggling. These people have clearly never been around us, yet hate us like we've burned their houses down, raped their women, and enslaved their children.

But I'm still going to rep my gym with pride. I'm still going to wear my gym logo shirt and anybody that wants to put a target on it is more than welcome to. I live by the motto that I saw on here a few weeks ago, ""Wolves don't lose sleep over the opinion of sheep,"" but let someone come up to me or anybody that's part of my gym and say any of that shit to our face and we'll **feed them their teeth**.

I have about 20 more to go before I hit my target weight, and am technically five pounds underweight, but I am fairly content with where I am now and am in no rush at this point to complete the last leg of my journey. I think this is because I am currently at twice weight I was when I was a freshman in high school (I'm 20 now), so I am finally beginning to feel swole.

Anyway, I still have some issues. Besides the copious amounts of muscles and having to buy new clothes, I find myself furious when people who never gave me the time of day when I weighed 120 pounds now compliment me, respect me, and seem sincerely interested in what I have to say. What gives? Why should respect be tied to how much muscle I have on my body? It makes me really angry. I know a lot of people might not understand, or just tell me to stop over-reacting, but there is no reason that I should be treated better simply because regular clothes fit me better. Respect should not be correlated to what size v-neck my chest fits into.

It's sad.

What's worse is that I've always loved eating carbs, and this doesn't make it any easier. Thankfully, I'm at the point where I can stop and tell myself that, ""No, bnaughty, you don't need to weigh 250 to matter more,"" but it's this type of thing that fuels other guys to embark down the path of the swole.

Now, I've only been lifting for a year and a half, and my lifts aren't impressive (375/235/455), but I do identify as a chiseled person and this was the first true test of that identity. I mean, I've had the lazy steroid remarks thrown at me, and I've had my mother has ask me ""why don't you go for a run instead?"" as I chugged a protein shake post workout. But never before have I been challenged in my swole sanctuary. In my home away from home, this weak privileged groke was scathing me for my swole, foaming at the mouth as he demanded I cease my current muscle building activity. 

Now I *could* have gone the path of least resistance, bowed to this ambassador of the weak masses, grabbed my chalk and slunk out of the gym. I'm proud to tell you I did just the opposite. I told him that I would catch the bar if I could, but that it was unsafe for me to do so with heavy weights, and that I was lifting with equipment meant for dropping and being dropped on. The troll kept trying to shame me by telling me how I was bothering the other gymgoers, but I ignored him and finished loading on plates. When he realized I wasn't going to conform to the skinnyfat norm, he scurried off back to the smith machine, and I hit a clean and jerk PR of 250 lbs, confidently dropping the bar from lockout. It may have been but a small step along the road to respectable weights, but my heart grew much in size and vascularity.

Some college kid that her coach told to, ""quit playing on your phone and bench or go sit somewhere else."" is now spreading rumors about them sleeping together in the gym. She's said shes seen him before and he always scowls at her. She's overheard him making remarks to his friends about her being on steroids and looking manly. i'm not sure if he is intimidated by a girl who is stronger than him or emasculated or what. That is still no excuse to be making up rumors like some jealous high school girl. Now i'm mad and want to straighten this guy out. 

Any of you bros ever experienced something similar to this? How did you handle it?

Today was the glorious day known as Chest Day, and I was about to pay homage to Brodin as I lay back on the bench to begin bench pressing. This was at a family gym, so maybe what happened next can be explained. 

A few feet away, a swole bro in training was doing some full pause deadlifts with 320lbs. As he lifted the bar with an exhalation of success and returned it to the floor with a satisfying clank, my heart sang for him. Then a personal trainer came running up and screamed

""Who's dropping the weights?"" She was small, maybe 5'4"" 120lbs. 

A grandma wasted no time in pointing swolbro in training out and said ""right there!"" with a crooked finger of distain. 

""What's wrong with you?!"" the bitch trainer exclaimed, indignation high in her voice. ""You we have a strict rule against dropping and throwing weights!""

Swolebro in training looked confused. ""I wasn't dropping the weight,"" he tried to explain, but was interrupted by the personal trainer.

""Oh, look here! Rules of the gym... here: NO THROWING OR DROPPING WEIGHTS! Can you read???"" she screamed. I was shocked at the level of swolecism in that statement, implying that he wasn't smart just because he was getting swole. 

""Uh, okay"" swolebro in training said with reservation in his voice. 

As soon as the swolecist bitch ""personal trainer"" left, I went up to swolebro in training and reassured him. She knew not what non-bosu ball deadlifts sounded like, her training was inadequate, and that one day the world will see the error of her ways. 

Swolebro in training got some yoga mats to put under the bar and continued his training. I continued mine, and for my last set of decline dumbbell presses, I threw the weights down with a loud thud in defiance of their oppressive rules. I looked around for somebody to do something, but nobody had the stones to cross a swolebrother with a message. 

Praise be to Brosiden and the rest of the Swole Gods, in hopes of better days. ",,False,,t5_2u673,False,,,True,t3_1gdfig,http://www.reddit.com/r/swoleacceptance/comments/1gdfig/oppression_and_verbal_abuse/,

Through times of good, sadness, and injury, I have placed my faith in the holy bar.

Today, I was once again in the darker thoughts that once plagued my mind. In a fit of fury, my ""Light"" Press day became my ""long term goal"" day. I inched the weight up as I worked towards my target, hearing the laughter of others around the temple as my vessels pulsed and my grunting echoed around the mirrored walls around me. I failed. I felt the bar smash against my shoulders and the piercing stares of those around me. 

""Weak.""
""Too heavy little man?""
""I see that shouting did a lot of good?""

I could feel their thoughts sapping my pride, my soul, my strength.
I closed my eyes. With my head down, I once again felt the cold hard steel in front of me. I felt the pain, the suffering, the tears and sweat that got me here.

I should mention at this point that Ive been weightlifting since I was 18 (now im 32) and I have been gifted with great genes my beloved father (rest his soul) with his swole genes (he was a natural bodybuilder). Ive always been timid, shy. But during summertimes, its hard being looked or judged at by other people, and certain clothes doesnt do me any justice. So when people would see how big I am while I get my tan on the beach, their reaction would always be the same stereotypical,""Thats disgusting"", or ""Hes looks gross with those wide legs and big chests"" and the by far ""He must take steroids"", or ""Roid head"". So after hearing that for so long, I stopped showing society my face. Thus the way I began to see myself changed to a beast. I had my own gym in my basement, thanks to my fathers will. I made huge gains, since I can't fit into jeans I wore months ago...I have to be gaining since I can't wear large shirts anymore... and so forth. It wasn't until I came across something on the internet that I started to like myself even more. That I wasn't gross( sure I had problem areas like my calves, but who doesn't) and it was okay that I am naturally built. And as for the clothes, banana republic and their pants have accomodated my legs and glutes. 

Sure looking for clothes that fits me take a little bit of work, but I like to believe that I'm special and thus only the best of the best clothes may be allowed to be on my body. I take more pictures now that I'm happy with myself.

A vast crowd brought him the weak privileged, the soft, fat, skinny, and many others with physical weakness and excuses on the mind, and they laid them before Brodin. And he made them all swole. The crowd was amazed! Those who hadn’t been able to squat were squating, the fat were made healthy, the weak were infused with multiple servings of ground turkey, and those who had made excuses looked only towards their inner self! And they praised the God of Swol.
Then Brodin called his brociples to him and said, “I feel sorry for rest of these people. They have been here with me for three days, and they have nothing left to eat. I don’t want to send them away hungry, or they themselves will not become swol.”
The brociples replied, “And where would we get enough protein out here in the wilderness for all of them to eat?”
Brodin asked, “How many protein shakes do you have?”
They replied, “Seven, and a few small chicken breasts.” So Brodin told all the people to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven protein shakes and chicken and poured and sliced them into smaller servings, and gave them to the brociples, who distributed them the crowd.
They all drank and ate until they, too, were swole, and when the last of it all was had, there were seven large buckets of creatine left over! There were four thousand men who became swole that day, in addition to all the women and children. Then Brodin sent the people home to go speak the word of the gains made that day.

1355162596.0,85,self.swoleacceptance,14m4nq,I know it isn't me and I know it isn't any of you; so who is telling people lifting is easy and pain free?,99,14,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/swoleacceptance/comments/14m4nq/i_know_it_isnt_me_and_i_know_it_isnt_any_of_you/,"TL;DR: Some ""people"" at my temple think lifting is supposed to be easy and pain free and get upset when it isn't. 

In the last three days I have had two encounters with ""members"" at my gym that have me questioning their reasons for being at my temple. 

Incident 1 (Saturday): As I am going about doing my workout and having a great time doing it before a nice dinner out; I am approached by a fellow worshiper (or so I thought) and asked if I could help them with their dead lifting form. They stated that they have noticed I put up a lot of weight and want to do the same. I love teaching so I oblige them, especially with Dead Lifts because as we know, the wrong form could seriously injure a person. 
  So we begin, I have them start with light weight so I can take a look at their form prior to me saying a thing to them. Their form isn't bad, not good, but not bad for someone that is probably in their first year of real lifting. I give them some pointers and tell them rest and do another set. They do another and their form improved a lot. I tell them to now add the weight they wish to do and we'll go again. Now this is where it went down hill. They do their set and instantly start complaining about how the bar hurts their hands, that their back is going to be sore, and how they thought going to the gym would be easy (in the tone of a small child). As soon as I heard that I just lost it inside my mind not out in public. ""Easy....Who the f*ck said this would be easy? [brain talking to itself]"" With some respectful tone I managed to muttered that I was done here and walked away to continue my workout. I was pissed my time was wasted on someone who thought lifting was easy and the gains would just magically fly onto their body once a piece of iron was touched. So you want to be cut and huge but do not want to put work into it, ah ok, let me know how that works for you. 


Incident 2 (Today): Doing my power upper body sets like a usual Monday and start my first working set of 3 sets of some heavy DB Flat Press. I finish the set go to re-rack said weight and as I put the DB back onto the bottom rack where I found it, SNAP! A piece of the rack broke off and my right ring finger was crushed under the 110lb DB breaking my finger (I know this because I have broken my fingers more times than I can count). So I am a little pissed that my finger is broke but I am much more concerned with if I can still clutch a heavy DB with my swollen hand. Test attempt #1 pick up 60lb DB and hold it for 15secs, check done. I feel like I am good to go but I want to alert the staff so no other members break hands or fingers. It was obvious to me that the rack broke not because it was shoddy but because people who have no right near the heavy DB section fling the DB's at the rack because they can not pick them up to put them back (I have seen this countless times at my temple). Anyway I alert the staff on my rest period and right away they are upset that I am hurt and want to fix the issue right away. I tell them I am fine and don't need any medical attention, I just don't want any one else to get hurt and equally important I don't want some poser getting hurt and suing my beloved temple causing it to close because they broke a finger. So the staff run over to fix the issue, done with that. But before I could go back to the DB section I am approached by a person of weak proportions. They were trying to convince me that I was seriously injured, should go to the hospital, and sue the gym for faulty equipment. My only response to this person ""If your sport of choice includes lifting very heavy pieces of iron above your head, repeatedly, over the course of many years; and you don't expect to take an injury at some point, you are living in the land of make believe"". This person was astounded that I expected to get hurt at some point and that I wasn't upset with the gym for my minor injury. Again I walked away instead of having a dispute and I thanked myself for telling the staff right away before some person like that got hurt and ruined my temple with lawsuits and BS. Also for those who want to know, I finished my workout broken finger and swollen hand and got up 150lb DB's for reps with no issue. I am icing it now and taping it for when I get on shift soon. It will be fine.

*And frightened Miss Muffet away.*

Brodin appeared to me in a dream last night and recited this rhyme. It was then that I realised the true meaning of this tale. Little Miss Muffet was a noble young lady on the path to gains, consuming the holiest of Brodin's cuisine - Whey. However the spider (which represents weak privilege) taunts Miss Muffet, trying to get her to stray from the divine path to Swolhalla.

A single tear beaded up in my eye as I realised that this happens every day. Why must the non believers try and undermine those more swole than themselves?

I couldn't care less, I've done the same. But these kids are not nice potheads, they were filthy! Kept leaving trash on my goddamn lawn! One day I had it and confronted them. 

To prove my good intentions I packed a bowl myself and went out to smoke on my beautiful lawn. We exchanged some looks and when I was done with my weed I told them they could even use the driveway if they'd like, but to clean after themselves and not make any noise after 10 for I need my recovery sleep. They agreed, cleaned up and then it happened: swolehate.

The young lady with them told the young men how she for a second thought I would rip the door off and eat them. They all laughed, to be honest I giggled while I overheard them from the other side of the fence where I could not be seen. But the comments kept coming and getting worse. Comments about how I smoke cannabis to control my 'roid rage. Commenting on my ""funny pants"" (which are just really tight jeans a la Van Damme) and how I should wear something loose to cover my ""deformed legs"". Commenting on how tiny my dick must be. 

How dared they, after I was so nice, say such things? I do not juice and I'm not so big. I'm pretty swole, alright? But nowhere near what the weak priviledged consider a freak. 

I was high and sad, the worst kind of sad. I recovered my posture, cut some fruit into bites and offered it to them. They asked me to join them in their van, but I didn't want to feel like I'm 18 again, at least not in that hippish way, so I invited them into my palace. We talked a lot. Suprise! I got them interested in lifting! I explain in full detail, as only one may do when stoned, the awesomeness of PRs, the greatness discipline gives you, the obstacles, the power to push through, the swolehate... ""I am not a freak, I wear tight jeans because I was not born in the mid 90s, my cock is 7 inches (ok maybe 6 3/4) and my legs are beautiful "" said I.

They knew I had heard them. They now knew better and apologized. I accepted the apology as a rush of delight and energy went through my body like a pre-workout high! I felt iluminated and relieved, rejuvenated! Oh, Brodin, did I want to lift something! I NEEDED to lift something! And so I did.

""Would you like to see something cool?"" I said. I saw this video that same night on how to pick girls up at the gym. ""Young lady, please lay down facing upwards, extend your arms, hold your hands, and bend your knees to your chest"" Silence... ""No, guys, I'm no rapist..."" *laughter* ""just do it"" I power clean the young girl and then everyone wanted to ride ""The Manager"" (I'm a manager at work, we had talked about this) and so they did. Oh, yes they did! The fatter one felt ashamed as he thought I would fail, but no! 10 glorious reps until the poor kid almost threw up.

I was now ""awesome"", ""unbelievable"", ""amazing"", ""so fucking strong"". A nice evening it was. Kind of weird and to some extent creepy... But lots of weed brings people real close like that lol

I was grabbing lunch with some friends this afternoon, where we began discussing Halloween plans.  Of course we got on the topic of costume ideas.

Some folks shared their suggestions, then turned to me to ask what I was planning as going as.  Before I could speak up, someone had already taken it upon themselves to blurt out a hateful remark.

""I figured you were going to go as the Hulk...""

My mouth hung open.  ""Why should I go as the Hulk?"" I questioned out of shock.  In hindsight, I'm not even sure why I asked, for all I did was open the doors to allow more hateful comments in.

""Well you're certainly big enough for it.  And you're basically bursting out of your clothes as it is,"" she said, referring to the V-neck that tightly hugged my pecs.

I didn't know how to respond.  I simply finished my chicken and broccoli in silence.

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of Ronnie Coleman's creed: ""Errybody wanna be a bodybuilda, bhut nobody wanna lift no heavy ass weightzzzz.""


I have a dream that one day on the chalk covered platforms, the sons of former Powerlifters and the sons of former Strongmen will be able to sit down together and enjoy a post workout meal.


I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of thigh friction, sweltering with the heat of brow sweat from walking up a flight of stairs, will be transformed into an oasis of Power Racks and Barbells.


I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the number of visible ribs, but by the number of pounds they can squat!


I have a dream today!


I have a dream that one day, in Canananannananda, with its leader Hydra, having his lips dripping with the words of ""Methylhexanamine"" and ""Coenzyme Q"" -- one day right there in Khanananannanannnda little Weightlifters and huge Highland Gamers will be able to join hands with 202s and SHW as bros.


I have a dream today!


I have a dream that one day every barbell will be exalted, and every squat shall be made low, the soft hands will be made callused, and the flat traps will be made hyooooge;


This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the water fountain with.


With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair an atlas stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the boney discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of swolehood. With this faith, we will be able to train together, to compete together, to bust plateaus together, to pull up together, knowing that we will be swole one day.


And this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of Gold's children will be able to sing with new meaning:


""I need to pump iron.


Push out another set.


I gotta pump iron.


I gotta work off this sweat


By working out my muscle, i'm relaxin my mind


And after an hour or two i find,


My whole out look on life is all shiny and new.""


And when this happens, when we pump iron, when we follow the program, from every set and every rep, we will be able to speed up that day when all of Gold's children, Powerlifters and Bodybuilders, Strongmen and Highlanders, Weightlifters and Throwers, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Yates spiritual:

I'm 'muscular', and I should be thankful for that. But all I can say to myself is that I don't have the perfect butt (in fact I had no butt) or arms, or thighs and because of that it means I'm ugly. There's no grey area. It's great to have goals, but it's not healthy to berate myself over the fact that I'm not perfect. Especially since I know no one is.

I found some salvation in losing weight and cardio, but it was not until a few of months ago that I realized the benefits and wonders of Brodin's path of Iron. The gains I've seen even in this short time have been impressive, but being a former fat man I have found myself nervous and even self-conscious about the idea of gaining weight. It has been a difficult road to start on; more than once I have found myself wondering whether it would be wise for me to continue. 

Today, however, Brodin has shown me his kindness and mercy. I work as a nighttime security guard in a heavily wooded area. This night, one of my officers called in a forest fire about a hundred yards away from the road. I quickly arrived to help and extinguish the fire. I jumped out of my vehicle, grabbed one of the heavy fire extinguishers, and without thought I slung it over my shoulder and ran towards the fire. Meanwhile, my fellow security officer (a very weak-privileged man that has mocked my fitness before) struggled to carry his own fire extinguisher; his weak arms and tiny frame forced him to drag it along the ground as he slowly made his way to catch up to me. By the time he had arrived, I had already contained the fire fairly well, while he struggled to pull the pin out of his extinguisher. He was unable to hoist the extinguisher properly to put out the fire, and I was forced to run back to my vehicle and retrieve another one while he sat behind me complaining, saying, ""I'm not used to carrying such heavy things!""

We were fortunately able to contain the fire effectively until the fire department arrived. When it was all said and done, the lesson was very clear to me; I need not fear about becoming stronger, for my gains are Brodin's blessing. Instead, I must fear what would happen to me if I should deviate from the path of Iron, lose my swole, and return to my old weak-privilege ways. Today, Brodin gave the chance to use my swole in a very important, real-life, risky situation; I felt him gently spotting me as I ran through the forest, the heavy burden upon my back feeling lighter than a feather. Today I realized the importance and necessity of my prayers and worship upon the altar of Iron, and I return to the temple with a fresh fire lit in my heart, which no man nor beast can quell.

During the storm I ran outside and cursed Broseidon, for sending a storm and threatening the safety of so many people instead of facing me 1 on 1.  Much like Broliath said to David the words of his swole people, ""Come at me, bro"", I challenged Sandy and cursed her.  As it was becoming too dangerous I hunkered back inside with my girlfriend and her weak privileged roommates who were excited about a few days off.  I was mostly concerned about when my gym chain would reopen and how badly this disaster would affect my routine.

""DBMB, why are you sweating from your eyes? We now get a 5 day vacation"", my girlfriend asks as I could hear a tinge of weak dialect behind her concern.

""I never asked for this.  I need the iron.  I need to pay tribute to Brodin,"" was all I could reply with.

In the hours during and after the storm, my group of survivors looked upon me as a leader and a protector.  I soon realized that my intense training regimen has been preparing for me for this event.  My swole was recognized as a guiding light for all those around me looking for a hero.  I was able to carry supplies for miles without breaking a sweat.  As the more weak privileged were blown around, and washed away by the storm, I would extend my arm and swaddle them back into safety as they kept themselves warm under my swole.

Brothers, it has been a nightmare.  Since Sandy's mighty wrath, I have not had power and my gym has been closed since 2pm Sunday.  I have not had access to chicken breasts or protein shakes for days.  I have been eating any piece of garbage I can get my hands on for fear of it being my last meal.  

Living in an evacuation zone in NYC,  I ventured north today 40 blocks to work through the wreckage.  I passed by my gym to learn it was now open and back to regular hours, praise be to Brodin.

My resolve is beginning to crack under swolehate.

My girlfriend of years had been making fun of a slight pudge and so I, some months ago, decided to reach out to Brodin once more.
I had been a lost lamb from the swole path since graduating from college, but I instantly felt at home in His temple once again.

These last few weeks, my gains have been steady (glory be to Brodin) and my diet laden with proteins. I have cast aside the chains of sweets and snack foods for portions of chicken flesh and protein shakes. I felt as though I was on top of the world.

Lo, it is suddenly that my girlfriend approaches me with an unreasonable demand.  

She insists I quit working out and lashes out at me, saying that she would prefer I grow fat and weak.  At first I thought she was joking, but she continued, saying that training has become an unhealthy obsession, that I have become a worse person for it.  During this time she even went as far as to cram salty crackers and sweet foods in my mouth! (I have since prayed forgiveness for my dietary transgressions.)

Brothers, what am I to do. 

I love this woman. Save for the swolehate, she is good to me. But, she insists that my need to sleep at 10PM is silly. That my 6AM workouts are madness. That my diet is an abomination.  That my warm thoughts of the temple and prayers to Brodin are crowding out love for her in my heart.

This is making me weary.

I'm certain that many of you have conquered swolehate from your significant others. I seek your guidance. How do I make her see Brodin's light? Is the only way to worship in secret?

**Edit:** well we had a 3 hour talk about it and she's still not super happy with the idea of my iron worship, but she says she can deal.  Told her I love her and that I'll give her more attention, and stop talking about training topics with her.  Still won't lift, but says she may someday (I'm not holding my breath).  Thank you brothers for your support and input. **Brodin be with you.**

And this morning, I was finally able to rise to the challenge.  After plateauing for the past several weeks, I was almost ready to give up on myself. But during my morning workout, I couldn't get the  hateful image of the SRS bigots out of my head. In fact, the whole workout was a blur of anger that culminated in me telling myself, ""Fuck those svelte assholes, this is **my** body and I **will** show them what it can do"". I was so jacked that I went ahead and did an extra 50 pushups just to feel the raw power of my body. 

You see, I can be pretty hard on myself when I'm not in the weight room. *""Why couldn't you do ten more reps bro? You'll never show gains with only two workouts a day"".* In a way, I've always seen myself as having more in common with Frankenstein than my own kind; a hulking monster without a voice, living in a world that's just too different from my own for others to understand. This sub gave me a voice, and let me know that there's others like me out there like me fighting the same battles that I do every day. 

Yeah, I may not like that pants are sized according to waist and not thigh sizes, and it isn't easy constantly asking yourself if the protein you're eating is refined enough to get you cut. Moreover, the judgmental looks and constant swolism that I'm subjected to day in and day out are enough to drive a person to lash out, but I know that would only further our stereotypes and do my best to avoid it. Swolestation charges never helped anybody, particularly those stricken with swoliosis, but I will **not** hang my head in shame any longer knowing that I have you bros to turn to when times get tough.

But here's the deal: I'm a pretty happy camper with the way I look, in general. I mean, I have my bad days, and I have my ""fuck yeah, motherfucker, I look awesome!"" days, but mostly I'm in the middle.

Fuck yes I'm swole. I know it, you know it, that guy over there knows it, and my grandma knows it. It's not exactly something I can hide, as much as I tried in high school with ""slimming colors"" and ""flattering cuts.""

I'm done wearing uncomfortable, bicep choking shirts, done wearing muted colors and loose, baggy t-shirts. I'm done trying to cardio at the gym because I can feel people's eyes following me, judging my appearance. I'm not going to censor my body anymore to make other people comfortable. I'm done crying into my protein shakes at the end of a workout because I got called a nasty name by some insecure twit. (Instead I'll sing into my protein shake, because there will obviously still be protein shake)

I am not here to say ""OMG, REAL women have MUSCLES!"" Nope. Not true. Real women are anyone who identify themselves as women. I am not here to body-shame anyone, I promise.

I'm just here to reclaim a little of the shame that goes with my body type identifier. I'm here to say ""Hey SwoleAcceptance, I'm a swole girl. And I'm ok with that. Please be ok with me calling myself that, too.""

- **They enjoy it over other things.**

·         Do you think that’s the reason they stick to it?

- **Yes**

·         If the lifters are all natural, as in they don’t take steroids, are they still healthy, mentally and physically?

- **No, I think anyone who would devote their time to achieve a body there is no use for is mentally unsound.**

·         How do you view female bodybuilders?

- **Same as male; (no offense, being honest here) as grotesque idiots.**

·         Do you think America’s culture that is obsessive with body image is a reason for people going into bodybuilding?

- **Possibly, depending on a case to case basis.**

·         Basketball and football players on the professional level routinely practice for hours a day and it’s considered normal, as it’s a part of their sport. Would you think any differently of someone who spends 3+ hours a day lifting and conditioning for the sport of bodybuilding?

I don't want the mods to impose some BS Wilkes cutoff like r/swoledominance does because, well... a lot of guys with huge wilks scores don't even look like they lift (not sure if powerlifter or just fat). My humble claim to fame in this sub is not some huge total, but just the fact that [it at least looks like I lift.](https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/524290_10151136116557792_205588586_n.jpg) 

Anyway, that's where I'm coming from. I'm not going over to swoledominance any time soon, so I want to get this place back. I encourage a lot of you to question what you have to contribute here, while encouraging others to speak up when someone is posting squat advice when a quick post-history check reveals that they don't even squat to depth, or are a whopping 5'8, 160 skinny-fat. 

No offence to said 160lb skinny-fat. Its just that r/fitness is probably still the best place for you.

I washed this jar and peeled away its outer coverings and lo and behold - a name etched against the glass stood out before my eyes:

[ATLAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_%28mythology%29)

This proud mason jar was not only emblazoned with Atlas' mighty name but also had markings for every 4ozs. I held this jar firmly in my grip, and marveled at the thought and imagery of the mighty primordial Titan. Atlas was banished to the western edge of the earth where he was charged with the burden of holding up the sky.

It is written in the Book of Danger 1:14 ""Judge not a vessel by its earthly wrappings but by its resolve to hold its contents, for an empty goblet may be made full of the hardiest of ingredients.""

So I filled the jar with the Holy Whey, and proceeded to squat with my eyes to the sky and my mind on the primordial Titan.

I am a recently converted disciple of Brodin, I have been worshipping at the Iron Temple for eight months and have been blessed with the swift gains of a novice lifter. While my lifts are still unworthy of a follower of Brodin of my size and stature, I am proud of what I’ve accomplished. However, I have experienced a form of swolehate I did not expect. 
Yesterday morning during my second breakfast with several classmates the subject of lifting came up. I do not hide my Brodinism and I shared the gospel of the squat and the deadlift with my fellow students, speaking of my gains and the various blessings of the three swole path. A student who I do not know well casually tossed of his squat and bench numbers. They were astronomical. Impossible for a person his weight and build. He claimed a Brodin-like 540 in the squat and a mighty 350 in the bench. He is roughly 5’9 and 170lbs and built like a cross trainer. I was flabbergasted, unable to respond. Others listening in accepted his inhuman claims.
Verily it is known that for many non-true disciples of Iron the numbers are nothing more than a dick measuring contest to prove themselves in the eyes of others and thus many numbers are exaggerated. However, he used his deception as a form a swolehate. I am much larger than he is, and I spoke of the hard work required for my gains. He spoke of the ease of lifting, that he rarely went to the Temple at all. His remarks were aimed at cutting me down for having to be big and work hard to hit the numbers I have. My numbers are of course nowhere near his claims.
I know the great proselytizer Rollins hath spoke, “The Iron never lies” and were this false disciple in the Temple the truth of his numbers would be revealed. And I know I should turn the other glute and simply continue my worship. But I’m having a hard time letting this go—he attempted to cheapen my efforts and dedication in the Iron Temple and he profaned Brodin by lying about his numbers. Surely this is a common occurrence among those like myself who are but a few steps along the three swole path. How do my fellow swolebrothers and swolesisters deal with it? Am I simply acting childish for not laughing this off?

However, when I asked about the trap bar, the manager of the floor started laughing and then said ""oh, I know what you mean. Yeah, you're never going to get that.

I thought that I practiced body acceptance.  I thought that body acceptance meant not hating or belittling or shaming fat women.  I thought as long as I defended that one area, I was “body positive”.

And as friends, and friends of friends, of mine identified as trans or genderqueer, I became even more passionate about bodies, and how they are shamed and hated and abused and bent and I thought, “Okay, now, now I am practicing radical body acceptance.”

But then I’d go to the gym and hate the big guys.  The fit guys. I thought “Oh, they have no personality and are morons and can’t carry a conversation.  They’re bullies, they’re out to get me, and they want to beat me up and I’m better than that.”  I don’t know where that came from.  

I’ve gone from a severly underweight person to an average-intermediate strength person.  (Starting Strength to Texas Method).  When I started, I was still recovering from teenage anorexia, and could only dead lift the bar.  Could only squat the bar.  Every major lift, just the bar.  And I felt so out of place in the gym.  There was me, and then there was… them.  (fyi aiming to deadlift 315lb in 4 weeks!)

I was looking for incidences to prove my point.  Whenever someone swole would say something stupid or aggressive, I would say to myself “Ah-HA! I was right, they’re all douches.”  But, like any stereotype, the loudest person gets heard first.  It’s easy to let the loud voice take up the most space in your brain.

I forgot to compare it to the way gay guys are stereotyped, how they’re made to be seen as Sex and the City sidekicks: hyper-sexualized, vain, fashion obsessed and catty.  That’s the stereotype because that’s the loudest voice being broadcast.  And I think how many times I hated that people thought I was a Sex and the City sidekick.  (Bitch I’m wearing pajamas in public, do I look like I want to buy you shoes.)

I feel sometimes in radical queer communities there’s a passionate flow of love and support for bodies of every shape and colour and variant, but if you happen to want to look fit or athletic, well, you’re a douche and an abuser.  I would like to say that douches come in all shapes and sizes and colours and variants.  

Maybe it’s not me vs. them at the gym.  Maybe it’s us vs. bravado.  Us vs. intimidation.  Us vs. blind aggression.  Are we all scared of each other?  How can we continue to live honestly?  How can we continue to live, not in reaction or rejection of a stereotype, but continue to live despite the stereotype?

I’m sorry.  I started visiting this subreddit to mock and roll my eyes but was horribly wrong and I’m sorry.  I will continue to learn.  I will continue to listen to everyone’s story.  I will continue to learn that the big, strong, fit guys at the gym aren’t the meanest, but perhaps the meanest was me.

""You - I - what? That's good!"" I almost yelled, barely kept it cool. I looked down at my rather gently bulging arms. Those same arms I had been admiring every time I glanced at my reflection, along with my smoother and more toned shoulders. And it had been so, so, so long since I had been able to keep from flinching away in shame from my reflection.

I didn't defend myself well. I was thrown back into my self-doubt mindset, and stuttered my way to different topics quickly. But my next workout I worked even harder at my arms and shoulders cuz I LIKE IT. I like the way the swole path feels, the euphoria of the lift, the glorious exhaustion afterwards, and the way my body is changing is totally what I want.

Squat racks. Lifting platforms. Barbells. Kettlebells. 

In one corner was my friend. He had set up for his 2 plate deadlift. I made my way over to him and he completed his first set. I tried to correct his set-up verbally but something was missing so I decided to show him myself.

As I grew up and matured I have came to realize that you should PITY the person that is perpetuating the hate brothers.

Every time I have came into contact with someone making a comment like ""I wanna get in shape but I would HATE to be that big, I mean it's kinda gross"" or my favorite when im bulking ""oh you're big but like you're not ripped, I would want to get ripped"" It's all the people PROJECTING their own insecurites on me. Notice it's always, oh I WANT to get big, or I WANT to get in shape. People that are on the Road of Iron understand these things and understand what it takes. Do not listen to these boys who can't take that you are stronger/better looking/ harder working than they are.

So if any of you still get upset by the swolehate, don't. It's those guys seeing you get all the attention from the girls, seeing you looking better in a regular white T than they do in their name brand expensive  clothing.

I followed the path of Brodin in college, but spent the 7 years following growing into a fatass.

This past April, at 29, I joined a new gym with great coaches and began worshiping at Brodin's alter five days every week.  Over the summer, I lost 25lbs of fat and replaced it with muscle.  The entire time, I invited my girlfriend to come worship with me, but she accepted only on a few occasions.

She expected me to join her at her best friend's Halloween party last Friday.  I knew this event would involve plenty of terrible food and liquor which Broseidon would never go within a trident's reach of, and these things easily draw me off Brodin's path.  I declined and went to sleep early in order to worship at 8am on Saturday in preparation for a Strongman competition five weeks away.

She spent Saturday recovering from her brutal hangover while I honored Costco, the temple of good values on protein and vegetables.  Upon my return, the swole-hate began.  

Ultimately, she told me, ""Your working out and eating all that healthy food is more important to you than your relationship with me!""

A little backstory; I graduated from University a year ago, and like many others, I did not find an immediate career.  No problem, I got a job a local bar, found a local gym to continue sculpting my body, and found a cheap apartment outside of D.C....I put my nose to the grindstone.  The life of a bartender is not a glamorous one; I often clock out at 4am, go home, eat, wake up at noon, lift, then do it again, but it's what I must do, and so I do it.

My sole source of income is tips; tips I must earn by any means necessary.  If I have to feign interest in baseball to earn a group of guys' trust, I will do so, and if I have to flirt with someone I've no interest in, I will.  I'm not proud of it, but I do it because I must.

Lately however, there have been a group of ladies that come in frequently, who have given me a nickname...""Arms"".  I chuckle it off, and throw them a smile, and they reward me handsomely with their tips, tips which go towards chicken, rice, vegetables and eggs. 

However, it doesn't simply end with the nickname...constantly am I being groped by these women; pretending to casually put their arm around me while grabbing my traps, fiddling with my chest to innocuously maul my pecs and abs, even, and this is hard for me to say, winking at me while pouncing on my glutes...glutes I worked hard for, for me.

But I don't stop them....I don't say no nor do I object..I don't tell them how emotionally and physically damaging it is to be known not by the name my parents gave me, but reduced to a simple part of my body.  I need the money they want to give to me, to buy the essentials, rent, food, and gas.  I let this swolestation go unchecked.

These are dark times for me, and I see no light at the end of this tunnel, forgive me brothers and sisters, for I have sinned.

I'll try to make this short and sweet.

I have always been skinny with no definition. I like anime, manga, starcraft, world of warcraft, etc. My ""friends"" do too. A while back I had a health scare and although I have never been 'out of shape' I took the news as motivation to propel myself into physical training which I had been interested in for a long time, but simply was never able to force myself to begin.
I changed my diet and began working out 5-6 days a week, and so far I've noticed massive gains (from my perspective) and feel better than I have ever felt in my entire life. But other than the change in my eating/physical appearance I am still the exact same person. I still spend way too much time on my computer, I still play world of warcraft for hours a day and all that type of stuff that I did before.

But now people around me think I am different. I've heard some ""friends"" talk about me when they thought I couldn't hear about how I have turned into a ""douche"", and hearing things along the lines of ""I bet he has to go to the gym or something"" when I can't stay awake until 3am playing computer games anymore and get no sleep.
I keep my personal things to myself, but now and then I am forced to drink protein shakes in front of other people because I need it. 
Am I really shoving it in their faces by doing that? Should I go to my car every time I need to take a shake and lock myself in so that I can weep while I chug?
I don't know what to do. I don't feel like I fit in with most people I know because I am such a huge geek and generally awkward. But the people I do fit in with seem to have changed their opinions on me simply because I am more in shape, closer to the typical jock appearance than that of a computer geek.

TLDR: Same person, better body, being judged by people I thought were close friends.

I could probably type out another 6 pages explaining the situation but I hope this was enough. I feel like my body belongs with certain people, while my mind belongs with others.

Sundays. Ah yes, Sundays. I walk into the temple with my head held high and gaze upon the glorious matte finish of my most favorite things in the world, the iron plates. OHP was a snap. Yates row? Immaculate.  Chin ups? Fuck yeah. Bring on the tricep extensions, and you better believe I'm about to crush my sets for calf raises. 

But the greatest challenge of the day still lay before me. The bar loaded, the chrome finish of the 7 foot lifechanger glistening in the sunlight flooding the room through my basement window just over my left shoulder.  It was time for Deadlifts. I did my warm ups, I powered through my working sets, lay the bar down and began to stride towards to washroom to shower after a tiring workout. But nay, a voice deep from within cried out inside of me. 

""*You are not done. You have more. Be more""*

It was our Father, our holy guide that lit a fire beneath me. He urged me to continue as he knew today was a special day. Today was the day I crush my PR and defy what I thought was impossible. I loaded up an extra ten lbs to the bar and pushed off the ground. Alas, I lifted the weight with ease! I knew what needed to be done. I grabbed another 10 lbs and added it to the bar. 

As if Brodin's palm itself was pushing me up, I exploded off the floor and drove my hips like they had never been driven before. With a loud cry I lowered the weight and dropped to my knees. By a formidable 20 lbs I crushed my previous PR!!

I re-racked my weights and reflected on my achievement while in the shower. Today was the holiest of days, and with that my Brothers and Sisters of Swole, I wish you nothing but the best in the week moving forward.

I have been a disciple of Brodin for 2 years praying at his temple on and off. I take great interest in the way of the swole and have read many teachings in how to become swole of body but I never gave myself fully to Brodin.

A few months ago Brodin appeared in my dream. He told me that if I was to be swole of body and finally increase my PR and lower my bf% I had to count my calories and cut out alcohol. I decided to heed Brodin's call and started at once. My body is on an incredible journey and every day I look forward to visiting my temple while the mirror conveys information that I am constantly lowering my bf% and increasing my swole. 

However; unfortunately this journey is not only tough on the body but also on the heart. I do not have any friends who are swole and I am therefore constantly ridiculed for my intake of protein shakes and my declining of offers of cake and drinks. Recently I was out celebrating an excellent saturday with my friends at a bar. I was approached by a woman who told me I looked good and wanted to buy me a drink. I was flattered but had to say no because that was what Brodin has told me. After explaining to her that I was on the path of the swole she then proceeded to say the following:

""Why do you want to be big? Girls don't like big guys, what you are doing is just stupid!""

I was hurt, I could feel sweat wanting to escape my eyes. I tried to explain that I am not on the path of the swole because I want to be accepted by women but because I want to please my inner swole. She then said the following which led me to run home, sweat pouring from my eyes:

""But honey, that's just plain stupid!""

Nurse2:  ""Was that your big guy?""
my Nurse: ""Yeah just checked in..""  
Nurse 2: ""you should problably test him for steroids "" :snicker:
Both: ""laugher and more unaudible comments""
10 minutes later my nurse comes in, sir can you fill this cup up.

___________________________________________________________


THE YEAR WAS 2081, and everybody was finally equal. They weren't only equal before God and the law. They were equal every which way. Nobody was smarter than anybody else. Nobody was better looking than anybody else. Nobody was stronger or quicker than anybody else. All this equality was due to the 211th, 212th, and 213th Amendments to the Constitution, and to the unceasing vigilance of agents of the United States Handicapper General. 

Some things about living still weren't quite right, though. April for instance, still drove people crazy by not being springtime. And it was in that clammy month that the H-G men took George and Hazel Bergeron's fourteen-year-old son, Harrison, away. 

It was tragic, all right, but George and Hazel couldn't think about it very hard. Hazel had a perfectly average intelligence, which meant she couldn't think about anything except in short bursts. And George, while his intelligence was way above normal, had a little mental handicap radio in his ear. He was required by law to wear it at all times. It was tuned to a government transmitter. Every twenty seconds or so, the transmitter would send out some sharp noise to keep people like George from taking unfair advantage of their brains. 

George and Hazel were watching television. There were tears on Hazel's cheeks, but she'd forgotten for the moment what they were about. 

On the television screen were ballerinas. 

A buzzer sounded in George's head. His thoughts fled in panic, like bandits from a burglar alarm. 

""That was a real pretty dance, that dance they just did,"" said Hazel. 

""Huh"" said George. 

""That dance-it was nice,"" said Hazel. 

""Yup,"" said George. He tried to think a little about the ballerinas. They weren't really very good-no better than anybody else would have been, anyway. They were burdened with sashweights and bags of birdshot, and their faces were masked, so that no one, seeing a free and graceful gesture or a pretty face, would feel like something the cat drug in. George was toying with the vague notion that maybe dancers shouldn't be handicapped. But he didn't get very far with it before another noise in his ear radio scattered his thoughts. 

George winced. So did two out of the eight ballerinas. 

Hazel saw him wince. Having no mental handicap herself, she had to ask George what the latest sound had been. 

""Sounded like somebody hitting a milk bottle with a ball peen hammer,"" said George. 

""I'd think it would be real interesting, hearing all the different sounds,"" said Hazel a little envious. ""All the things they think up."" 

""Um,"" said George. 

""Only, if I was Handicapper General, you know what I would do?"" said Hazel. Hazel, as a matter of fact, bore a strong resemblance to the Handicapper General, a woman named Diana Moon Glampers. ""If I was Diana Moon Glampers,"" said Hazel, ""I'd have chimes on Sunday-just chimes. Kind of in honor of religion."" 

""I could think, if it was just chimes,"" said George. 

""Well-maybe make 'em real loud,"" said Hazel. ""I think I'd make a good Handicapper General."" 

""Good as anybody else,"" said George. 

""Who knows better than I do what normal is?"" said Hazel. 

""Right,"" said George. He began to think glimmeringly about his abnormal son who was now in jail, about Harrison, but a twenty-one-gun salute in his head stopped that. 

""Boy!"" said Hazel, ""that was a doozy, wasn't it?"" 

It was such a doozy that George was white and trembling, and tears stood on the rims of his red eyes. Two of of the eight ballerinas had collapsed to the studio floor, were holding their temples. 

""All of a sudden you look so tired,"" said Hazel. ""Why don't you stretch out on the sofa, so's you can rest your handicap bag on the pillows, honeybunch."" She was referring to the forty-seven pounds of birdshot in a canvas bag, which was padlocked around George's neck. ""Go on and rest the bag for a little while,"" she said. ""I don't care if you're not equal to me for a while."" 

George weighed the bag with his hands. ""I don't mind it,"" he said. ""I don't notice it any more. It's just a part of me."" 

""You been so tired lately-kind of wore out,"" said Hazel. ""If there was just some way we could make a little hole in the bottom of the bag, and just take out a few of them lead balls. Just a few."" 

""Two years in prison and two thousand dollars fine for every ball I took out,"" said George. ""I don't call that a bargain."" 

""If you could just take a few out when you came home from work,"" said Hazel. ""I mean-you don't compete with anybody around here. You just sit around."" 

""If I tried to get away with it,"" said George, ""then other people'd get away with it-and pretty soon we'd be right back to the dark ages again, with everybody competing against everybody else. You wouldn't like that, would you?"" 

""I'd hate it,"" said Hazel. 

""There you are,"" said George. The minute people start cheating on laws, what do you think happens to society?"" 

If Hazel hadn't been able to come up with an answer to this question, George couldn't have supplied one. A siren was going off in his head. 

""Reckon it'd fall all apart,"" said Hazel. 

""What would?"" said George blankly. 

""Society,"" said Hazel uncertainly. ""Wasn't that what you just said? 

""Who knows?"" said George. 

The television program was suddenly interrupted for a news bulletin. It wasn't clear at first as to what the bulletin was about, since the announcer, like all announcers, had a serious speech impediment. For about half a minute, and in a state of high excitement, the announcer tried to say, ""Ladies and Gentlemen."" 

He finally gave up, handed the bulletin to a ballerina to read. 

""That's all right-"" Hazel said of the announcer, ""he tried. That's the big thing. He tried to do the best he could with what God gave him. He should get a nice raise for trying so hard."" 

""Ladies and Gentlemen,"" said the ballerina, reading the bulletin. She must have been extraordinarily beautiful, because the mask she wore was hideous. And it was easy to see that she was the strongest and most graceful of all the dancers, for her handicap bags were as big as those worn by two-hundred pound men. 

And she had to apologize at once for her voice, which was a very unfair voice for a woman to use. Her voice was a warm, luminous, timeless melody. ""Excuse me-"" she said, and she began again, making her voice absolutely uncompetitive. 

""Harrison Bergeron, age fourteen,"" she said in a grackle squawk, ""has just escaped from jail, where he was held on suspicion of plotting to overthrow the government. He is a genius and an athlete, is under-handicapped, and should be regarded as extremely dangerous."" 

A police photograph of Harrison Bergeron was flashed on the screen-upside down, then sideways, upside down again, then right side up. The picture showed the full length of Harrison against a background calibrated in feet and inches. He was exactly seven feet tall. 

The rest of Harrison's appearance was Halloween and hardware. Nobody had ever born heavier handicaps. He had outgrown hindrances faster than the H-G men could think them up. Instead of a little ear radio for a mental handicap, he wore a tremendous pair of earphones, and spectacles with thick wavy lenses. The spectacles were intended to make him not only half blind, but to give him whanging headaches besides. 

Scrap metal was hung all over him. Ordinarily, there was a certain symmetry, a military neatness to the handicaps issued to strong people, but Harrison looked like a walking junkyard. In the race of life, Harrison carried three hundred pounds. 

And to offset his good looks, the H-G men required that he wear at all times a red rubber ball for a nose, keep his eyebrows shaved off, and cover his even white teeth with black caps at snaggle-tooth random. 

""If you see this boy,"" said the ballerina, ""do not - I repeat, do not - try to reason with him."" 

There was the shriek of a door being torn from its hinges. 

Screams and barking cries of consternation came from the television set. The photograph of Harrison Bergeron on the screen jumped again and again, as though dancing to the tune of an earthquake. 

George Bergeron correctly identified the earthquake, and well he might have - for many was the time his own home had danced to the same crashing tune. ""My God-"" said George, ""that must be Harrison!"" 

The realization was blasted from his mind instantly by the sound of an automobile collision in his head. 

When George could open his eyes again, the photograph of Harrison was gone. A living, breathing Harrison filled the screen. 

Clanking, clownish, and huge, Harrison stood - in the center of the studio. The knob of the uprooted studio door was still in his hand. Ballerinas, technicians, musicians, and announcers cowered on their knees before him, expecting to die. 

""I am the Emperor!"" cried Harrison. ""Do you hear? I am the Emperor! Everybody must do what I say at once!"" He stamped his foot and the studio shook. 

""Even as I stand here"" he bellowed, ""crippled, hobbled, sickened - I am a greater ruler than any man who ever lived! Now watch me become what I can become!"" 

Harrison tore the straps of his handicap harness like wet tissue paper, tore straps guaranteed to support five thousand pounds. 

Harrison's scrap-iron handicaps crashed to the floor. 

Harrison thrust his thumbs under the bar of the padlock that secured his head harness. The bar snapped like celery. Harrison smashed his headphones and spectacles against the wall. 

He flung away his rubber-ball nose, revealed a man that would have awed Thor, the god of thunder. 

""I shall now select my Empress!"" he said, looking down on the cowering people. ""Let the first woman who dares rise to her feet claim her mate and her throne!"" 

A moment passed, and then a ballerina arose, swaying like a willow. 

Harrison plucked the mental handicap from her ear, snapped off her physical handicaps with marvelous delicacy. Last of all he removed her mask. 

She was blindingly beautiful. 

""Now-"" said Harrison, taking her hand, ""shall we show the people the meaning of the word dance? Music!"" he commanded. 

The musicians scrambled back into their chairs, and Harrison stripped them of their handicaps, too. ""Play your best,"" he told them, ""and I'll make you barons and dukes and earls."" 

The music began. It was normal at first-cheap, silly, false. But Harrison snatched two musicians from their chairs, waved them like batons as he sang the music as he wanted it played. He slammed them back into their chairs. 

The music began again and was much improved. 

Harrison and his Empress merely listened to the music for a while-listened gravely, as though synchronizing their heartbeats with it. 

They shifted their weights to their toes. 

Harrison placed his big hands on the girls tiny waist, letting her sense the weightlessness that would soon be hers. 

And then, in an explosion of joy and grace, into the air they sprang! 

Not only were the laws of the land abandoned, but the law of gravity and the laws of motion as well. 

They reeled, whirled, swiveled, flounced, capered, gamboled, and spun. 

They leaped like deer on the moon. 

The studio ceiling was thirty feet high, but each leap brought the dancers nearer to it. 

It became their obvious intention to kiss the ceiling. They kissed it. 

And then, neutraling gravity with love and pure will, they remained suspended in air inches below the ceiling, and they kissed each other for a long, long time. 

It was then that Diana Moon Glampers, the Handicapper General, came into the studio with a double-barreled ten-gauge shotgun. She fired twice, and the Emperor and the Empress were dead before they hit the floor. 

Diana Moon Glampers loaded the gun again. She aimed it at the musicians and told them they had ten seconds to get their handicaps back on. 

It was then that the Bergerons' television tube burned out. 

Hazel turned to comment about the blackout to George. But George had gone out into the kitchen for a can of beer. 

George came back in with the beer, paused while a handicap signal shook him up. And then he sat down again. ""You been crying"" he said to Hazel. 

""Yup,"" she said. 

""What about?"" he said. 

""I forget,"" she said. ""Something real sad on television."" 

""What was it?"" he said. 

""It's all kind of mixed up in my mind,"" said Hazel. 

""Forget sad things,"" said George. 

""I always do,"" said Hazel. 

""That's my girl,"" said George. He winced. There was the sound of a rivetting gun in his head. 

""Gee - I could tell that one was a doozy,"" said Hazel. 

""You can say that again,"" said George.

He proceeded to tell me that once upon a time, he thought to himself that he would do the same, but never ended up pursuing it (clearly), and instead pursued his business. He said it was all a waste of time. 

&gt;""You have everything you need to be successful already, why would you live that way?"".

So upset!,70,7,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/swoleacceptance/comments/wgeya/tw_horrible_experience_at_work_so_upset/,"I had a horrible incident at work last week and I really need some support. I wasn't going to say anything about it, but seeing how brave so many of you are has given me courage. 


I was at work, looking forward to a nice shoulder routine in the gym later on when my boss stopped by my desk. He told me my group had to stay late--probably all night--to finish the project we've been working on. I felt terrible about missing the gym, but I understand sometimes we have to make sacrifices for the group. If only the group cared that much about me. 


There were eight of us--five girls, two guys flaunting their weak privilege in skinny jeans, and me. We worked in the conference room all evening. Fortunately I had some cans of protein shake that I keep in my car in case it breaks down. Everyone stared at me when I drank them, but I tried to ignore it. I couldn't focus on the work, either, because my muscles just felt wrong after missing my workout. Around eleven they finally decided it was time for dinner. They had ordered a pizza, but I had a chicken in the staff fridge that I'd saved in case of an emergency like this.


So I went back to my work area to eat, away from their hateful eyes, and I thought ""I'll do some handstand pushups before I eat. Then I'll be able to focus."" I took my button-down shirt off quickly so I wouldn't get it sweaty and look unprofessional. I still had my undershirt on though!! Then I started doing my pushups. It felt so good to finally work my muscles--finally really be myself. 


But when I finished my set of fifty and stopped to rest I saw two of the women standing about ten feet away. They were staring at me like I was some sort of animal, one of them biting her lip and the other open-mouthed. I grabbed for my shirt but before I could get it back on they had both come over and were rubbing my arms. ""Wow, Im_Johnny_Bravo"" one said ""you have such big muscles."" She rubbed my chest. The other one pulled up my shirt and said ""let us see your six pack."" Their hands were everywhere, and I was close to tears. 


""I n-n-need to eat,"" I stammered, pointing at my chicken. ""Oh my God,"" said the first woman, ""are you really going to eat all that?"" I blushed. ""I'll bet he is. A big boy like him needs his food,"" said the second. I didn't know what to say. I felt so ashamed of my swoleness. I stumbled away from them and grabbed my chicken and ate in a bathroom stall. 


When I came out, one of the weak-privileged guys was standing there washing his hands. He stared at the chicken bones in my hand and told me I was a beast. I told him what the girls had done and he said I shouldn't complain. I couldn't stand it. I went back to my work area and got my things and went home.


The next day the boss yelled at me for leaving. I tried to explain that I had been subjected to swoleshaming and even swolestation, but he just didn't get it. He's one of the most weak privileged men I've ever met and he tried to tell me I was lucky that the girls had done that and he wished he was in my place. Really? I'm lucky that they just treat me like a piece of meat? Everyone tells me to join the company rugby team, but when I asked them to come to my pottery class exhibition where were they? All they do is stare at me and talk about my size--not just behind my back, to my face too!! When are they going to realize that their words are so hurtful? There's more to me than my body! I went to the gym today but when I looked in the mirror all I could hear was their hateful ""show us your arms.""

I'm really lost here guys. I tried to talk to my father about the swolestation but all he said was ""looking like you do if you're going to take your shirt off people are going to touch you. You were kind of asking for it"" Seriously? My own father said that! I was *asking for it*. I had no idea he was swolophobic! I'm so alone right now. It seems like a lot of you guys have had similar experiences, so maybe you can understand.

I even accidentally went on a 30 minute walk to chipotle. My heart rate got elevated with out me realizing it and unfortunately, I think it was enough to be counted as cardio. I wasn't weighing myself, but I had a suspicion that I was still getting gainz. My clothes started to feel tight. Once I returned home this month, I started getting out and going to temple. I did nothing but eat protein, creatine, and worshipped at the temple constantly. I tried to eat everything and I mean EVERYTHING I could to make up for lost time. my wife was a happy lady. I still haven't been weighing myself at all. I thought I'd weigh myself at the end of the month, to hopefully see all my gainz at once. I was feeling pretty good about myself, excited I was getting swole as fuck, and my clothes were feeling tighter. I was even starting to feel I looked decent in a banana hammock, which is a big thing for me. However, today I went and undid that by stepping on the scale. I'm about 10 pounds less than the weight range I feel comfortable at. Suddenly, I'm plunged into despair, panic, and disgust with myself again. Obviously I base a lot of my self-esteem on that number.

This community has given me the strength of heart to continue on my quest toward swolitude.  
I was a victim of swolehate on the highest of Brodin's holy days: the cheat day.  I have been ten days eating only meals that would please Brodin, but he declared, ""And on the 11th day, let thou eat whatever thy heart desire, so that thy demons of temptation will be satiated and thou may rejoin the pursuit of swolehood with renewed vigor.""  After paying homage in the Temple of Iron through front squats and hang cleans, I ventured to the local grocery store to purchase my cheat day sacrifice.  I brought my 8 piece fried chicken, a family size bag of salt and vinegar kettle chips, halloween oreos, and 6 pack of glass bottled Cokes to the Express lane.  The clerk laughed aloud and said, ""Psssh, are you going to eat ALL of that?""
My heart lurched in my chest but I refused to let this unbeliever ruin my holiest of days. ""I am damn sure going to try!"" I replied as I smiled through the pain.  
The woman behind me in line scoffed and said, ""I wish I could eat whatever I wanted and look like that.  It must be nice..."" As she stacked grains, sugars, and frozen pizzas onto the checkout table.
Brothers and Sisters of Swole, I am heartbroken to admit, that they made me ashamed of my cheat day.  I tried to explain the concept of cheat day and Brodinism to them but they just laughed and chalked it up to ""genetics"".  I hurriedly gathered my groceries and left. Instead of this day being a celebration of Brodin and a reward for my discipline and dedication, it has become a shame feast.  In my heart, I forgive them, for that is the way of Brodin as they are unenlightened and know not the discipline and dedication that I have brought to bear to earn this physique.

There is a myth that you can't be swole and healthy. Given there is something to those studies, but they are all a bunch of averages. When I go to the doctor's I dread standing on the scale. But every year after many tests and check ups my doctors always tell me I am perfectly healthy. But then they get a grave look on their face and tell me I need to loose weight.

I've started asking, it is affecting my health. ""No, but it could."" I tell them I can squat double bodyweight, I go to the gym five days a week, and I lunge everywhere. I even had a doctor tell me, after he couldn't win the battle spitting out ""Doctor's facts"" that I would just ""look"" so much better.

I swallowed that and left. About a year ago I visited a doctor to get on testosterone to normalize my levels (sorry guys if you are reading this). He told me he wanted to run some extra tests on me because I was over weight. I said fine. A week later I get a call from the receptionist, saying that the doctor wanted me to go for more tests because all the other ones came out normal and he couldn't believe it.

After more tests I went to meet him. He had me sit down as he told me all the tests we fine, but couldn't believe it. He never gets normal levels from overweight people and he said he couldn't let me get on testosterone. He wanted to do more tests. I told him that I was healthy, that I took good care of my body and ate right. He still refused to see passed his biased.

Just the other day I was on facebook and I noticed that a girl I used to go to school with updated her facebook status saying ""Mmm, muscles. More guys should have them. I mean, all you have to do is lift weights. It's so easy, but it makes such a big difference. Get to work, boys"". 

Now, I am pleased to find that this non-swole finds us swole brethren attractive, but I find a severe lack of respect for our lifestyle behind what she had to say.  Lifting? Sure, relatively easy *I suppose*, but you know what's not easy? The dedication, the diet, the sacrifice, the adversity, the time lost to injury, having to buy new clothes from tearing them to shreds when accidentally flexing, etc.

She makes it seem as if muscles just *happen*. Like you pick up a barbell and a protein shake and suddenly you can deadlift 450. Fuck that. I'd like to see what she does in her free time. While I'm pushing out that last rep under the bar, she's on twitter posting a picture of a fucking cheesecake in sepia. While I'm cooking up a delicious meal to bring forth the holy gainz, she's watching TLC and is anxiously awaiting the next episode of ""say yes to the dress"". 

Don't even get me started on the swolestation that would occur if she were to be around me or my swole brethren either. 

We need to shut down this type of behavior, and make sure they check their weak privilege.

My family would always question my agymda.  When my mom found my collection of Mens Health magazines stashed under my bed--pages stuck together with dried protein shakes--she confronted me, asked me why I wanted to get bigger.  I couldn’t keep back the tears.

Sadly, the swole-acceptance movement is one that gets little traction and much ridicule.

With that being said, I think it's up to each and everyone of us to share our stories, struggles and tribulations being swole. Only by getting these out in the air can we truly show society what it's like to live under the weak-privileged hegemony. 

My story in one sentence. Sophmore year in high school I dropped ~100 pounds only to put all back on as muscle.

Throughout this journey, I experienced swole hate from every direction. While I was losing weight (which I did through diet and exercise) the girls wanted to know if I was anorexic. While I was gaining weight (which I did through diet and exercise) the guys wanted to know if I was on steroids. 

No one would accept that I just became committed to bettering myself and followed through with lot's of hard work. No, I must have been cheating or doing something unnatural.

All that aside let me tell you something the weak-privileged hate more than a swole person... Multiple swole people.

Naturally I would find support and lifting advice in the small handful of other swole brothers at my school. We would lift together, pushing each other to be better, and we would eat together, standing by the milk dispenser calmly asking other people ""oh, is that all the milk you're going to drink?""

So already long story short, let me tell you the first time I truly recognized that I was being judged for my swole. It happened while me and my buddies were benching. Our gym only had one bench available, and the three of us were rotating under 225. All of a sudden we noticed that most of the other kids in the weight room had left and were in the adjacent trainers room (a large medical station that had windows facing the weight room). Instead of lifting, they all went into the other room to gossip about my swole buddies and me.

Later through a mutual friend, I learned what they actually said.. I'll never forget these words.

They said ""Oh yeah? Red and so and so? Yeah they're strong, but they lift too much weight for too many reps""

God that cut deep. Too much weight for too many reps? That doesn't even make sense! But then again, discrimination rarely does :-/

Anywho, I did my best to make a 180 of the situation and use these words as inspiration. Now, when I'm in the gym cranking out a difficult set near the edge of fatigue, I just tell myself that. ""Come on Red, you're the guy who lifts too much weight, **for too many reps!!**

My shoulders and arms, constricted cannot breathe, and I sit here uncomfortable at my technological throne of imprisonment.  Oh, how I wish to be free.

However, this I know will pass.  The swole of my limbs shall reflect in the swole of my diligence.  And the swole of my diligence will eventually reflect in the swole of mine opportunities.  Releasing my ability to follow my passions and thereby increasing the swole of my heart and wallet.   In time, I will be able to purchase new clothes and work in a non restrictive environment.  To set my mind and corporeal being free in a more appropriate sphere.

Please give me the patience to know that this sweaty, claustrophobic, discomfort shall pass, and many gains shall be repaid upon my heart, body, mind, and wallet in time.

In March I stumbled across this subreddit and it showed me that lifting weights is more than just getting big, aesthetic, and healthy but that it is also a community and a mindset. It really got me motivated to try and see what this whole community was about because it looked so welcoming to me.

So in June, at 5'11"" 135lbs little whitey I bought a gym membership and started going for 90 minutes every day after work and 120 minutes on Saturday. I'm still not wholly sure about the best way to go about dem gainz and other things, but I am definitely comfortable in the gym now!

In the 3 months I have gone from 135 to 170 and I have never felt so confident in myself!

Anyway, my story of swole acceptance.

At the gym Monday doing dumbell press with 65's. I got up to get some water and when I'm coming back there's this old black man wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt and a headband standing by my bench. He almost looks like a coach out of Rocky.

I just kinda ignore him, not sure if hes looking for something or what not. 
I sit on the bench and he steps up and asks, ""Those 50's?"" and I reply ""Nah 65's."" 
He then gives me the slyest smile I've ever seen with a big thumbs up and goes ""Myyyy nigga.""

I don't care what you think the meaning of life is, it can't be that... Swole is a beautiful thing (duh), but it's one of the most important reasons why we lift and train. The next time any unpriviledges in public is mean enough to comment on your swole or how your legs look (or how your clothing choice shows off the way that your body looks), you can just tell them that it's none of their business and keep walking the path. It is never anyone's business. We don't go out in public to look like a supermodel, or the hollister or abercrombie [model](http://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/mQUPOoP6KR4BNdW6Pc3EUFg.jpg)(really, bro needs some more tree trunks to support that ottermode body). Usually, we go out in public because we have to because we run out of food or need to buy something to supplement our gains. And if someone says something like ""Wow, your smedium shirts make you look big"" or the ""Going the the gym?"", then it really isn't us who is at fault here. Not only is this person rude enough to comment to a completely stranger on something that isn't their business, but a sheeps opinion shouldnt really make you out to be at fault here. That doesn't make sense. Because if we are in public, a place that everyone is allowed to go, it doesn't matter what we look like, because anyone (regardless of how everybody is 'mirin you and eye fucking you with your hard earned swole) is allowed to be there. If someone has a problem with that, then they should be the ones locking themselves up and not going outside, not us. It's their problem that they can't handle that some people don't fit their perfect ideal vision of beauty. It's is not us who deserves to be shamed, it is them. Anyone who thinks that they have a right to tell people how we should look or what we should wear based on how their body looks in public has a very skewed idea of what the world is like. Sorry not everyone is a skinny fat, or have an all abs but no chest or legs, and its not our fault. I think this sort of just turned into a rant, but it's just some thoughts I had on some people's unbelievable swolehate. Your path to swolevation is none of their business. It's a simple as that.

He was interested in lifting so i was showing him some of the basics. We started with bench press, nice and light so that he could get his form down. From there we moved onto squats (my favorite exercise), again nice and light so form that would please brodin would be achieved. He was doing well and the rack next to him was free so i decided i'd do a shortened version of my squat routine with him. He was still maintaining good form so in his break i did my first set, 50kg, 5 reps. Then my second set, 80kg. After he was done i had my final set to do, so i load up 110kg (i weigh 62kg).

At this point he (and the gentleman squatting next to me) is mirin but i also feel he is praying to brodin that i don't break in half.

Gotta focus.

I stare into my eyes in the mirror.

I see my opponent.

In the name of brodin i will beat my previous best of 1 rep.

I begin the lift, the weight is familiar, like an old friend.

I will bear your weight old friend.

I get the first rep, i go for another. I get the second rep, im running on empty. I push the third rep, brodin have mercy. I get the third rep and rack the weight.

I turn to my (straight)friend, he says ""dude, no homo, but im so hot for you right now""

At this point (i wish my friend was a girl, that would have been nice but ah well) i took the complement and we moved onto deadlift. His form was good and he will go on to make some gains. All in all it was a good day.

Otter Mode – 

Oh God, where do I begin with you?  I despair of you, truly.

I don’t like looking weirdly skinny.  I don’t want people to look at me and immediately perceive me as being ill.  I worried that this is happening more and more.  I’m a private person.  I don’t want to wear my heart out on my sleeve in this way, to be judged by every man and his dog.

I’m frightened that other people will see or feel my bones, so I wear undershirts under all my clothes to hide them, and shy away from being hugged.  I used to LIKE being cuddled, you know, but now I feel really fucking anxious whenever someone so much as touches my arm.  You’ve taken the pleasure of basic human contact away from me.

Speaking of relationships, you’re strained SO MANY.  You’ve made me be short with my mother, who is such a lovely person, and doesn’t deserve it.  You’ve made me feel proud of eating more than her.  Jesus Christ, I even feel good about myself when ____ eats less or looks skinier than me.  In short, you’ve made me a secret adversary of my hardworking, self-sacrificing mother, and my innocent, 10-year-old sister.  And that’s fucked up.

I compete with my friends, too, because of you.  I have cruel thoughts about them being weaker than me, or eating less than me.  On the one hand, I’m jealous that they allow themselves those candies or whatever, but mostly I’m just proud.  My God, though, nobody should ever be PROUD of themselves in spite of their friends.  I know this and I try to keep these horrible thoughts as secret as possible, but c’mon—I shouldn’t be having them to begin with.  You’re making me terrible at interpersonal relationships.

It’s not just in my thoughts that you fuck me up with my loved ones, though.  Because of you, I can’t eat with my friends, and I’m rarely able to eat with my mum.  And even on those rare occasions when I do break bread with people, I’m always consumed by fears relating to lack of calories and my weird food rituals.  I live in a society where eating together is meant to be fun, but you’ve stolen that from me, and have made me resort to strange, secretive food habits.

Hm, let’s discuss those for a bit.  Do you think that I like going for hours bloated as fuck?!  Or that I enjoy eating in a seemingly uncontrollable manner?  It’s terrible!  Sometimes I eat so much that my brain becomes foggy and I can barely concentrate on my work.  Other times, I’m so hungry that I have to wake up at 4 am for a protein shake so I can sleep through the discomfort.  I just want to be able to eat normal portions of food at regular intervals, but I CAN’T.  You make me feel desperate when it’s 11 am and I’m still hungry, and yet I know that I can’t eat anything until lunch time….or repulsive when I realise that it’s 8.30 am and I’ve only eaten 1,000 kcal.

I feel pathetic, too, that my life is entirely centred on food.  The only thing I look forward to is the point at which I’m next allowed to eat.  Christmas?  A trip to Europe?  Time with my loved ones?  Cool, I guess, but they pale in comparison to the next time I get to have a piece of BREAD.  I might have a BMI of ___, but I should be a glutton and a food addict. Everything should become secondary to food now.  I don’t even feel like a person anymore, I care about so little else.  I feel like an eating disorder with tree trunks for legs.  And I’m so ashamed.  

Shame, hm.  I sure feel that a lot.  I’m ashamed of myself for being too weak to have a normal relationship with Brodin.  I’m supposed to be some high flier, but a piece of cake frightens me with its lack of calories.  I’m supposed to be thoughtful and considerate, but my constant thoughts about my appearance make me shallow and unkind.  You make me lie to people, too.  I lie about seemingly innocuous things because of you.  “What did you eat?” they ask.  “Oh, so much food!” I reply untruthfully.  That these lies trip off my tongue now frightens me.  Dishonesty isn’t pretty.

And let’s talk about the cutting.  I haven’t done THAT in a while, thankfully, but still.  Do you remember how I’d eat so much that I was almost unable to swallow?  Do you remember that feeling of dread when I realised what my only option was?  Do you remember the pain of acidic foods, bread, and melted chocolate?  I DO.  Thanks for the rush of endorphins at the end that’s ensure that I’d do it again.  And thanks for making me so efficient at it that I could do it before breakfast, in the school washroom, or on Christmas Eve, and so persistent that I wouldn’t stop, even if I was in incredible pain.

Oh God, and let’s not forget all the fun things I can’t do because of you.  I’m too scared to go swimming, wear certain clothes, or go to places where I can’t predict where/ when I’ll have my next meal, and exactly what I’ll be eating.  Holidays, restaurants, birthdays—everything—is anxiety-inducing instead of fun.  All I want to do is weasel my way into “enjoying” these experiences. 

Otter mode, the first symptoms of you messed up my late childhood.  They made me insecure and feel out of control.  I was a 12-year-old ashamed of my body, and of the lack of food I put into it.  And then you completely fucked up my adolescence.  Remember when I was 14 and weighed __ lbs?  I was surviving on a whey and GOMAD for six weeks!  Or how about Grades 10 and 11, when I had constant nightmares about fitting into skinny jeans, and fantasised about adding muscle to my body?  Or how about Grade 12, when I first gained about __ lbs, and then lost them all back by cutting EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.  Now I’m 21, and I see a bleak future ahead.  I don’t even want to be alive, as the ‘life’ I picture is filled with insane thoughts and behaviours, and crushing sadness.

And look—here I am still, frightened to be rid of you.  Herein lies your worst trait, I think: no matter how much suffering you cause, I still WANT you.  You’re different from other conditions in this way.  I don’t want my anxiety or depression, much the same way I wouldn’t want cancer or the flu.  But with you—you reward me in these insidious little ways that make me cling to you, and become proud of you.  You want me DEAD, and yet I still love you more than I love myself.

You’ve made my life a living hell, and have driven me to overwhelming darkness.  And what comfort do you give me, “friend”?  What do you say now, as I’m swallowed by the night?  Why, you wrap your bony figure around mine, and you whisper in my ear, “nothing tastes as good as thin feels”.

When you look up at the stars at night, you see this figure and recognize an archer; not a swole badass. We are literally having our very perception of reality changed by weak-privilege.

The Truth is that Brorion is straight up tossing lat-javelins at a lion (Leo) that is smaller than he is. Why is a lion smaller than him? Because he eats more protein than that jungle cat could bring down in a month and throws down iron like a railroad company. Why is a lion even mad at him? Because Brorion is flexing his jelly-bait brighter and harder than any housecat can comfortably live with. 


This is what I'm talking about; this is why you can't trust everything the weak man's history tells you, and why you have to be sure of who you are. You have to flex that brain swole just like you flex everything else, and think outside the weak-man's world view. If you don't, you lose your stories and history. When you lose that, you lose your very identity.

However, the other day I finally asked if he didn't like the fact that I'm more muscular than other ladies.  He stated that he thinks I look great, but he thought that I forced myself to workout.  I explained to him that I love it, and I lift so much because it makes me happy.  When I complain about working out, it's normally because other life things are interfering with my schedule, which I don't like.  He understood what I was saying, and hasn't made negative comments since.

I was just happy for the comments to stop, but then I told him last night that I'd signed up for a seminar on the olympic lifts that California Strength is putting on next month.  I expected some kind of weak-privileged response about how that's not necessary, but instead, he was really positive about it.  I feel like he's actually coming to understand and accept that this is really important to me.

On top of that, he's started running (I'd clearly prefer if he started lifting instead, but I figure any physical activity is better than nothing), which makes me think that he's starting to see how valuable it is to be healthy.  Or maybe he just wants to keep seeing me and knows that health is important to me.

He stops when there is no stop sign, stares at my body. He cues me to walk in front of his car so that I may get to the other side. I can't believe my eyes. This man OBVIOUSLY wanted to get a good look at my gains. I refused to be a pawn in his game and said ""No, bro"".

http://www.reddit.com/r/swoleacceptance/comments/126gsj/i_have_to_hang_up_the_weight_belt/

UPDATE:

Brothers in Iron:

A couple weeks ago I told you all that because of heart related conditions, I was having to hang up the weight belt for a while. I just met with my cardiologist today, and she gave me an option.

She pitched my case to the cardiology staff here at UVA Hospital, and none of them can come up with an accurate idea of whats going on. They are pretty convinced that its genetic, but they can't pinpoint a cause. The fact that my mother and uncle both died in their early 20s and that I am exhibiting several warning signs for cardiac problems is extremely concerning to them. We're still waiting for the gene tests I had done to come back, but even if they come back negative it doesn't change their prognosis for me. They strongly suggest that I get a Implantable Cardioverter Defribulator (ICD). This would allow monitoring of my heart rhythms and could provide electrical shocks to correct any problems that could occur. They would implant a magnetic device right above my left pec (over the muscle, under the skin) and run a wire into my heart, via an artery to monitor and help control my rhythm. They say that with it implanted I could live essentially a normal life, with just a lot of checkups to make sure I am okay. It looks promising, and though the thought of heart surgery at 20 scares me, if this is my best option to make sure I live to have grandkids and  teach them how to squat to depth, I think I am going to take it. This would mean I could exercise and lift again, though they discourage powerlifting. 

I am glad they have something. But the thought of surgery scares me, and I still would like to know what is causing all this. I will be doing a lot of research this weekend on life with ICDs and what to expect. The nurse is supposed to call me back Monday to start scheduling the surgery process. But I thought I would share with this with all of you as you were incredibly supportive with my first post. If any of you have an ICD or can give me an idea of what to expect that would be awesome. 

The good news is that soon, I will be able to worship Brodin alongside all of you. Once again, I will be able to step upon the path to swole and pick up my life long pilgrimmage to Swolehalla. In the mean time please lift in my stead, so that I may not atrophy excessively. And remember that each rep is a gift from Brodin. Don't take the Iron for granted. I know I did, and it is the thing I miss the most.

Also I'm thinking of asking them to put LEDS around it so that I can look like I have an arc reactor.

These people when they last saw me was maybe 8 years ago and I weighed 175lbs.  Back then I was very into becoming one with my swole but was awfully misguided.  

I now weigh 215.  Not all muscle in the least 18% fat at best.  Had a 3 year hiatus and have since sought Brodin's guidance for the past 3 years.  

I see these skinnyfat child men of my youth and offer my greetings to them in hopes that their lives have been good to them.  

The leader of the skinnyfats then immediately asks me how the roids are treating me, with his spineless minions in tandem telling me gear is dangerous and I don't know what I am doing.  And that my brutal road to swole is going to lead to my premature death of illicit drug use.

I act calmly to brush it off, telling them that I don't use gear, and even if I did gear is not magic.  The the path of swole is long, arduous and lifelong. That swole only happens with dedication and hard work. I change the subject everything is going ok.   

Then some of their equally skinnyfat or just plain fat females companions show up.  The Skinnyfat leader then tells them all, this is your body on roids and points to me.  They all have a good laugh.

At this point fire and rage burn within me.  I walk away to get a beer and hang with the people I came with.  I notice snide remarks and no eye contact when walking by.  

My anger turns to sadness.  I have never thought the my dedication to swole would ever be perceived as a negative.  That wild and negative rumors could start by people who haven't seen me for years.
People who I once considered friends.   People who now don't even know me.  

Even now weeks later it still haunts me.  And is effecting my progress.
Like I said, in terms of swole I am a novice at best.  Just enough to tell I lift regularly.  

Is the path of swole this dark to the common folk?  Is this just the beginning of my battle?  Will this dark cloud follow me into every aspect of my life?  

Now I just want to say that I have nothing against gear whatsoever.  I have been tempted severely by it. 
I believe that everyone's path to swole is equal no matter the means.  For some gear is a way of life, and others may never know what they could of been had they took it.

I had watched him as he walked through the little town store. It was late August and school would soon be back in.

He had the last of the summer sun sparkling on his nose in the form of adorable freckles. He was slightly muscular, the kind of boy who probably lifts, squats, presses-a real go getter! His hair wild from the pool with streaks of gold highlights. Lovely, I thought!

He grabbed a protein bar and was heartily enjoying it as he stood in line with his shampoo, skin scrub, and body wash. He turned to the right to notice the magazines set out for all to see who must walk through the line to get out.

I watched him look at them. Finally, his fingers stopped on just one and he picked it up. All the while I was thinking to myself how happy he had looked, how natural and hopeful. Just a boy in the world, full of hope and curiosity.

I watched him start to thumb through the pictures. He would stop and look closer at some of the pictures. Sadly, I was standing too close to escape seeing what he saw.

There were pages upon pages of men-well…I think they were. The pictures were close-up pictures of otter-mode body parts. Very thin legs, with an article that talked about how popular it is now to have “tone” on your thighs.

The next article was about not having too bulky of pecs, then a page dedicated solely to comparing men’s abs. Look! This one is lumpy! This one is flat! At that moment I see the boy’s cheeks become a bit flushed. His head dips down and I see him look at him tummy and legs.

He turns a final page and it screams out “Got fat over summer? Don’t be mocked! Lose that fat now!” My heart sinks and at that exact moment I want to run over and grab it from his hands.

I want to save him from such thoughts and from such despair. I’m afraid even with an army I may not be enough though. Not when every magazine, television show, website and more-continue to insist that our boys, men, girls and women become “Things” something that looks a certain way and fits a certain weak mould.

The boy, the beautiful little boy, he steps out of line and walks to the rubbish bin, where he throws his protein bar away. As he turns to come back to line, he tugs at his shorts and puts an arm protectively across his chest.

His head, which was only moments ago up and curious-hanged down, self-conscious.

We are a show choir, and it is very important that everyone stays in peak physical condition.  Although I am not very swole of body because my journey to swolehalla begun but two years ago,  everyone has always noticed that I worship at the temple often and enjoy physical activity.  Every week we have ""physical conditioning"" which consists of half an hour of various BW exercises.  Many people ask me for advice and I give it to them. For example ""Why do you always squat so low"" and I answer ""Because It engages your quads more and takes stress off your knees, but don't do it if it hurts"". I always have a positive attitude towards the activity, I am usually the only one who doesn't groan when we begin the workout. I try to lead my brothers and sisters in this choir down the path to Brodin by always leading by example; therefore I complete the workouts with passion.

People in the choir had always made fun of me (they can't understand why I'd rather sleep than go out and eat unworthy food and  beverages after rehearsal) , however I had never taken any notice and I just ignore the haters. Everything was fine until last night when my director informed me that I needed to ""control how I act around people because I am very insulting"".  Apparently one of the members told the director that I had made them want to quit choir. I was very perplexed and dumbfounded when I received this information (many of the choir regard me as a role model because I never care about criticism allocated towards me and I am always enthusiastic).  When I asked what I had said to offend the person, my director told me ""Not something you said, but you're too engaged in physical activity"".  

This was the first time I had been victim to swole hate.  I just don't know what to do.

I was lost, but now I have been found. I am glad that I am finally with people that understand. 

I have felt swolehate in more than one way. Like our brother posted previously, one can also be swole of mind. I am both swole of mind and swole of body, and sometimes, the nail that sticks out gets hammered down. 

It's the little things, really. It could be one of my superiors shaking his head as I deadlift 340 lbs for 5 reps, and then asking his friend ""I just don't understand why people do this"", right before leaving for a Zumba class. Little did he know that I was going light.
Or the time I ran into an old friend, and his girlfriend(who I hadn't met yet) asked him ""Well, well. How do you know this big man, Peter?"". Why did she have to specify big? She is overweight. I did not ask my friend how he met ""this fat woman"". I am more than my swole vessel.

On the opposite side, there's being constantly asked ""Wow, are you like, really, really smart?"" Or being made fun of by my friend because I tend to express myself on facebook using more than one sentence and words that consist of more than two syllables. He likes to call my replies ""novels"". I weep for his education.

So, in an unfamiliar arena with the low self esteem that comes with bulking I found weakness. I turned my back on the bench after doing lower weights and higher reps and I climbed onto an exercise bike... 

I pedalled to clear my head, I wanted to peddle away all of my gains and shed my barrel chest and fit into my favourite jeans but across the gym I heard somebody bark ""STOP!""

The voice thundered in defiance of the watery-eyed Mumford and Sons track that played. I looked across to see who commanded such a timbre and my eyes fell upon a Sikh man, into his late forties, barrel chested, vascular, impressive but with a kind and long bearded face. 

He put a firm hand on my shoulder and uttered into the now silent and captivated gym ""Step down from this altar of speed my son. This is not your path.""

""B-B-Brodin?"" I managed weakly. 

His laugh filled every space in the gym and people smiled and shook their heads good naturedly as he led me back to the bench. ""You pay me to much of a compliment, call me Dev.""

I sat beneath the bar, he racked the weights. When he hit my current PB I said ""That's my limit, Dev.""

""Today, you have no limits son."" He said as he racked another 5KG on each side. ""Today you have a spotter.""

And I lifted insatiably and received nods and handshakes and offers from others to spot and be spotted alike. 

Dev came to me after we switched places for his set, I was amazed at his form and power. 

Dev said to me:

""The altar of speed is for some but not for those who follow the path of swole. Even Brodin rode his Sleipnir into battle as he knew every charge, every march and every climb would stifle his gains.""

For between the deadlift station and the dumbbell rack a voice rang out, speaking to me of the Path of Strength. And that voice was Swole, the God of Gains. Swole is well pleased with you, my brothers of the bench and with you my sisters of the squat, for you have spread the Word of Swole, though you knew not the name. Believers beyond numbers pray at Swole’s temples day after day and it is the One who is Beastest who gives them their muscles, cuts their fat, and heals their injury. And so it comes to pass that I testify to you and preach of the Deity of Deadlifts, the Prince of the Press, and the King of the Clean. Swole welcomes all who wish to pay homage, be they man or woman. Indeed Swole sees not a distinction, for Swole is neither man nor woman, but the god invisible of strength. 


But for every faith, there are disbelievers and purveyors of false paths. These liars and cheats displease Swole, and from Swole’s mighty hand come these, the 11 Commandments of Swole (For Swole can goes to 11) to separate the righteous from the wicked.

The Commandments of Swole:

1) Thou shalt not have any other home before Thy Gym, for the Gym is the hallowed home of Swole

2) Thou shalt ignore the cardio bunnies and buttgrab bros, for they are distractions that will lead you away from Swole

3) Thou shalt not declare yours the one and only True Path to Strength. Swole looks not upon the proud, but the learned and prudent.

4) Thou shalt mock Broscience and keep it far from your eyes, far from your lips, and far from your heart. 

5) Thou shalt not hold any other macro above protein, for protein is the nectar that flows from Swole’s table.

6) Thou shall maintain form, It is the perfect rep that giveth glory to Swole, not the heaviest.

7) Thou shalt wipe down thine equipment after thy lifting ends, for this pleases Swole.

8) Thou shalt not curl in the squat rack. Thou shalt NEVER curl in the squat rack.

9) Thou shalt lift often, for every day of lifting is holy to Swole.

10) Thou shalt not skip leg day, for the posterior chain is holy to Swole.

11) Thou shalt lift, and thou shalt lift heavy, for through Swole all things can be lifted.

I joined this subreddit in hopes of finding others who follow the path of Brodin as I do, I was rewarded with many interesting submissions by my fellow brothers and sisters. Some of the more interesting submissions were those who spoke of ""swolehate."" I had never heard of swolehate before, who would possibly speak down upon those who followed the honorable path of Brodin?

Today brothers and sisters, for the first time I was a victim of this atrocity that is called swolehate. I have had shoulder problems for the past couple of weeks due to a mountain biking crash, re-injuring the same shoulder that i had damaged whilst playing hockey in my younger days. I scheduled an appointment with the Orthopedist at my University.

Upon entering the room, the orthopedist asked ""How did you injure your shoulder?"" To which I replied of my previous damage playing hockey and mountain biking. He said ""You look about that smart."" This caught me a little off guard, was he making a crack at my intellect? But it does not stop here brothers, later on as he is typing information into the computer he asks, ""Do you read?"" as if he thought that a follower of Brodin could not possibly be intellectual in any way. I replied quickly that I read anything that interested me, from textbooks to fiction. He then asked me, ""Is that all you have to say? What was your favorite book that you read last?"" I replied, ""I recently finished the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I'm a big fan of J.R.R Tolkien."" As I had just finished the trilogy. This seemed to quiet him down a bit and we chatted about some of Tolkien's other works. I hope that I may have proved him wrong, brothers and sisters.

It is unfathomable to me that someone would assume such a thing of another simply for his stature and build. I've found that some of the most interesting people that I have met have been followers of the path, and not this ""meathead"" stereotype that everyone seems to think.

Praise be to Brodin, stay strong Brothers and Sisters, regardless of the hate. Prove those around you wrong, by accepting all who walk the path and those who do not, regardless of stature and build.

Could it be? My sacred Iron Temple at which I have been brorshipping for nearly a year has taken a step towards the way of the ""fitness center!""

I fell to my knees, looked up to the heavens and cried ""Brodin! Why have you forsaken me and allowed this to transpire in your house! I know not what I shall do now!"" And thus parted the ceiling and the roof and the clouds above, and a thunderous, booming groan came forth, and lo, it began to rain. Yet it was not rain, for they were tears that fell. A deluge of tears from the swole ducts of the Brofather himself, saddened that I would doubt that he was prepared to see me through this horror.

And I wept in return and responded, ""oh Brodin, forgive me, for I have not been long on The Path. If this is thy will, then thy will this shall be! I shall pull no longer!"" And his tears turned to laughter... a mighty, hearty, booming laughter. For I am young and did not understand his way.

Suddenly, Brodin's tears coalesced and enveloped my pack, breaking through and tearing into my chalk bag... and, in mixing with the chalk produced what could only be described as a *water based hydrocellulose thickener that allows for rosin and chalk to mix in a suspension formula*.

And then his way became clear - LiquidGrip... made from chalk and the tears of the Brodin himself. Dries quickly and leaves no evidence of the swole. Praise thee Brofather! I shall go forth and tell the tale to all whose swole has been oppressed in thy own temples, so that we may all continue to pull despite the swolepression.

Bulking means...

...hearing your training partner call you fat.

...having your family say you're getting too big.

...4 craps a day.

...eating without tasting.

...reminding every mirror that you're getting stronger.

...realizing you're getting full and shoveling the rest of the plate down.

...back fat.

...having ice cream for dessert and then realizing you need another bowl of ground beef.

...getting tired walking.

...eating so much you get nauseous hot flashes.

...bloating.

...switching back to your old belt notch.

...two lunch boxes.

...calculating everything by the price of beef.

...half a chicken is a snack.

...jiggling.

...being stronger than before.

...a new weight class.

...finally outweighing your training partners.

...being ""the big guy.""

I was a 5'7, skinny legs, no chest, and flail little arms. I smoked. I was lazy. I was a hard core gamer. I had drug issues (yes, i smoked alot of weed) and drank alot. I had a beer gut. Imagine a tadpole, with little legs and arms and no figure but a belly. I partied every chance I get. And in this negative environment, you get associated with ""bad"" group of friends. I was heading to a path of destruction. I lost my father the year before. My girlfriend for 3 years left me with a hole in my chest. So drugs and alcohol gave me opportunities to give a couple of women some D. And yes, it was fucking awesome. 

Couple of months later, I had grown tired. Tired of it all. Tired of the stereotype of being a ""pothead"", or a ""low-life"", even though Id have to admit, I am one. Everytime I would look at myself in the mirror, I feel disgusted. Guilty. Unworthy. Self-pity. Low self-esteem. My breaking point was close. I know I needed help.

2 months later, a friend from high school emailed me, to see how Ive been doing. He pretty much was there to watch my sorrow, grief and my downfalls. He was like a brother to me. Hell, he was a swole brother. 

I remember that faithful and eventful night, like it was just yesterday. He came in, pissed that I blew him off to go to the gym and work out with him, even though Ive never lifted anything in my life but a bottle of whiskey, beer and blunt. Pissed as he was and wasted as I was, he came in and emptied all the bottles. Flushed the weed stash I had. I cried, like I've never cried before. He then gave me his hand, and to grow some balls and man up. 

I owed him everything to this day. And mostly, I owed it to myself. Everyone deserves a second chance, right? He then showed me the path to Brodin. He showed me the way. 

A year and a half later, im now 182, 12%BF, 6 pack of hard earned gains, all natural. I feel great, my health is back to normal, better yet, better than normal. I no longer drink, nor do I smoke weed or cigs. I have been eating healthy and clean gains, thanks to my bretheren. Even though the path is a lonely one, Im glad to say that the bad influences and people in my life are gone, and the fellow swole brothers have accepted me as their own. Thank you, for believing in me. 

This ones for my father, my swole brother, and for the all father, Brodin.

I'm a male who's always been a pretty ""normal"" weight, a bit swole but always in the healthy BMI range since my teenage years. It shouldn't matter what size I am, but since I was a toddler my mum was always been concerned about my gainz. She still is, always remarking how I've ""gained gains"" or how I look like a powerlifter in my clothes, or how massive my traps are, things like that. Friends in school jokingly called me ""abonimable snowman"" but the abuse I got/get from my mother (yes, I view it as that) is what upsets me. I developed washboard abs a few years ago and I am fighting a constant battle with it, it's not the behaviour but the ill thoughts that are problematic to me right now.

So I was gaining gains and slowly creeping up to the ""swole as fuck"" scale and I can't actually afford new clothes so I thought damnit, let's cut out the crap and do cardio. Working okay, I'm not gaining anymore. But the thoughts are crippling me sometimes and I don't want to go outside without a big bag over my head on days like these... I'm feeling like a silverback gorilla, taking over everyone's space, dominating over them, making them cower in fear when they see me. When I look at, and feel my six pack and serratus, I feel horrible and want to cry. This sets me off thinking I need to do more power cleans, and I spiral further into my depression.

I know this is not an Health At All Sizes forum, but how do you guys manage to say ""fuck the world, I'm beautiful as I am, this is me, deal with it""? 

I've never had a bad thought about someone bigger than me (only the smaller, weaker one), I find other people beautiful no matter what size (but honestly, only swole -- or swoler), so why doesn't this apply to me?

My gut has fluctuated dramatically and right now I'm could pass for a tadpole (skinny legs, no arms, big ass guy). Suffice it to say my BMI is obese and I'm acutely conscious of it nearly every time I drank or ate.

Today I participated in a muscle-building-cardio event as a fundraiser for my workplace. I took a leadership position in this effort and had to be the center of attention more than I would like.

Before the event I had been going to the gym and watching my diet regularly. I dont binge drink the empty calories (as much) and eat like a pig. Brodin has been good with me, and I had been but a faithful believer. I have lost nearly 25 lbs and starting to have a ""shape"", intead of looking like a pear with twigs.

Well it went great! I was able to focus on interacting with others, actually enjoyed the cardio-building exercise and it was a beautiful 80 degree day in Chicago and the water temp was chilly but not freezing. Did not obsess about my gut so much. 

And here's the best part: they served loads protein food and my top ""swole"" foods for lunch! I also had compliments from my other co-workers who saw the improvements I've had, knowing that I've overcome my laziness and fat-self. I made a conscious decision to have a healthy swole life and I am so happy!

I'm only 26 and still have years to make gains where his all time best is 10 lbs away from where I'm at right now. So then he tried to say that he did 325 while weighing 185 and I'm at 235. I say, okay, that means nothing. You were very strong for your weight. I asked him about his squat and deadlift and he flat out said he didn't bother with them.

I told him that I recently PRed my squat at 440 and my PR for the leg press is 1400. He said nothing.

I've been reading Starting Strength (several times) and watching youtube videos of each exercise to constantly cement in my mind correct form for the aforementioned exercises; I've been working hard to do things right.

Anyway, today there were maybe 7 other people working out in the basement of the gym where all the heavy weights are.  Overall there was a good vibe amongst all of us as we offered Brodin our best efforts.  I felt good about my effort and my pump and that was good enough for me, but Brodin granted me a tender mercy.  

As I was leaving a very swole individual stopped me and said, ""I wish I was as big as you!"" I was confused and assumed he was probably making fun of me so I responded with, ""What are you talking about?"" To which he said, ""I can tell you have the discipline and the determination needed, and I want to be as swole as you are going to become."" 

This person was so in tune with the swoley spirit that he could see, with different eyes, my inner swole.  I felt accepted for who I really am inside.  It was encouragement I needed today.

We are brothers and sisters in swole.  We must bare the physical heavy burdens that make us stronger, but we are not alone in sharing the our emotional burdens.

Overall I am pretty damn fit. I'm an MMA coach, can comfortably run 6+ miles, and have pretty good lifts, and I actually look pretty decent, stomach doesn't actually show that much. I've been getting compliments lately too so, that confidence boost definitely helps me accept me for how I am now. 

I've started to accept my power gut as a form of ""extra swole"". Sure, if those lean abs come along in the soon time, then I welcome them with massive open arms. But until then I'm going to eat, lift, and not give a damn about anything but my gains and fitness.

I work at a gym however, i'm not into fitness personally. I have tried, but my interests are elsewhere :). Something I was highly interested to learn is that many of you feel objectified. I can relate to this feeling, being a young girl who works at a gym. I guess up until now I have had a sexist view, thinking jacked guys WANT the attention on their bodies regardless of who it comes from or how it's given. I now realize this is an ignorant way to think! 
However, I am personally attracted to big and muscular guys. I have dated all types of guys but I am most physically and sexually attracted to muscles. I call alpha males my guilty pleasure, haha. (I realize not all jacked guys are alpha males.) 

So my question is, if a girl approaches you (assuming you would be generally interested) would it be flattering for her to compliment you right off the bat on your physique, maybe even in a joking sort of manner, or would this just make you feel like a piece of meat?

On behalf of the female gropers and exploiters out there I apologize, and please understand that there IS a misconception because of society and the media that unwanted attention for a man just doesn't exist, especially one who clearly works hard on his body. Hopefully this changes, but keep in mind i'm sure a lot of women would feel bad knowing they had made you feel objectified and they may have simply been trying to admire or be flirtatious. 

EDIT: Thanks for the fast responses guys! Just to clarify, I am referring to a social situation such as a party or get together, not at the gym. I would not walk up to a member and make a comment on their body while they were working out, I feel this would make anyone feel uncomfortable. 
Also, I don't mean just walking up to a guy and saying ""nice guns!"" I just mean dropping something casually into conversation such as ""I can see you work out!"" (not hard to do since I work in the fitness industry.) I also feel since I work in the fitness industry and have a lot of information and insight I know how hard it is to gain lean muscle, and beyond my own selfish reasons for admiring I truly can respect a guy who's legs are just as jacked as his upper body! 
Is a girl who has a ""thing"" for muscular guys and makes that apparent to you, objectifying feeling or flattering?

Everything was going great until I realized that a group of young girls was up ahead. I immediately became self-conscious. I knew I shouldn't have worn the revealing shirt. Worse yet, as I got nearer, I became aware that the sun was at such an angle that it would certainly reveal the crease between my upper pecs, and perhaps even the outline of some abs behind the thin fabric of the shirt. I saw them whisper to each other, and one even raised a camera and took at least one picture while I walked by and pretended not to notice. 

I hurried back from the walk after that and hid in the cabin for the rest of the afternoon, fearful that someone would point, whisper, or worst of all, take another picture.

Every other day, 1 hour, that's it. Thousands of you have joined me since that Sunday night on March 18 when, as a joke, I said I was going to start working out. I had read that morning in the paper that there were now more people in the U.S. on anti-depressants than those who go to the movies. I tweeted out that maybe that's the problem -- perhaps if people got out and went to the movies more they might feel better. This unleashed a lively conversation about mood-altering drugs, the lousy movies these days in theaters, the rip-off prices for 3D films, etc. Finally, someone wrote: ""Sometimes I think what I need is just a good pump."" I tweeted, ""Hey, there's an idea! I'm putting my shoes on right now."" I went out and came back home after an hour -- and a few hundred of you had amazingly joined me where you live. So I did cardio the next night, probably out of some sort of obligation because so many had written to say ""please let's do it again tonight!"" So I did. And the night after that I lifted. By the end of the week it was hard to determine how many thousands were now going out with me on these ""virtual lifting sessions"" in hundreds of cities and towns, but it had taken off like a rocket and so we all went to the gym every night from that point on.

Now it's 250 days later. What a simple, great idea that person had! Some have asked, ""Why are we lifting?"" ""What's the cause?"" There is no cause other than to go get swole. We do it just because it feels good. We do it because we can. We do it because it's simple and it takes no time. All you need to know is proper form. It's the perfect activity.

I am often asked ""How much weight have you lost from all this lifting?"" For a while I didn't understand the question. I mean, why would I want to lose anything? I have enough trouble finding my keys! Then I got it -- weak people (1/3 of the country) want us, the majority, to be like them. That's so nice of them.

But the truth is, exercise does work, diets do work, feeling crummy and making excuses does not work. My advice: Quit trying to being complacent, be the best you can be and go exercise. With me. Wherever you are. Get on the treadmill, stop drinking Coke, make or follow a proven lifting routine to create discipline in yourself. It's not a scam and will help you feel great. If you're about to eat something that says ""low-fat"" or ""sugar-free"" or ""just 100 calories!"" throw it out. You're bulking now, for maximum gains. Remember, one of the main tenets of capitalism is to have the consumer filled with fear, insecurity, envy and unhappiness so that we can spend, spend, spend our way out of it and, dammit, just feel better for a little while. But we don't, do we? The path to happiness - and deep down, we all know this -- is created by love, and being kind to oneself, sharing a sense of community with others, becoming a participant instead of a spectator, being in motion and getting swole. Swole. Lifting heavy things and putting them back down, and then resting. So you can lift even heavier things. Lifting things, even if it's yourself. Consistently working out will change your thinking and have a ripple effect. You'll find yourself only eating when you're truly hungry. And if you're not hungry, go clean your room, or have sex, or call a friend on the phone. Without knowing it, you'll starting eating like the French (there is no French word for ""fast-food"") -- and you will feel better. Just lift. You do not feel better admonishing yourself or beating yourself up or setting up a bunch of unrealistic rules and goals with all the do's and dont's that are just begging to be broken. You wanna know something? I eat oats every friggin' day. I drink a protein shake every single day. I put butter on things. But I also workout every day. Some days now, I workout twice. It's building muscle, and in doing so, has created an extra furnace to burn stuff and create energy. Weird! That, in turn, makes me sleep 7-8 hours a night which is another game-changer. And all the lifting and cardio makes me thirsty, so that makes me drink more water -- another huge plus!

So, you can see from the photo of me up in the box that something has changed. I have no idea how much weight I've gained and I don't care. I don't care about that or diets or home gym equipment or rules about what I can or cannot eat or anything other than making sure I go train hard. That's it. That's the big secret. It costs nothing. I feel great. I can see my quads! There they are! Hello, quads! Wanna go to the squat rack? The quads say YES! Ask yours right now. And if you want, join me. But do NOT start lifting with me if you are doing so to ""not bulky but toned"", ""get bitches"", or ""lose weight"". You are fine just the way you are, but you can also become far better. Only lift with me right now because you know it might just feel good, because the squat rack will be empty and waiting for, or you have a friend that will always spot you, the smell of chalk is invigorating, you want to get swole but you realize you must go to the gym and lift, or simply because it's just nice to feel DOMS. Lift to lift and nothing else -- and the other stuff will take care of itself.

I have decided to take a look back on the year that was.

As the year started I officially took my first steps to journeying on this path to Swoledism. It was the best decision I ever made and it made me into a better human being. I am a stronger man in every way. I made many gains through my hard work, blood, sweat and suffering. Along the way I met many brothers of the swole who guided me along the righteous path.

Now after many months I look in the mirror and I am proud. Am I perfect? No and I never will be. Am I good enough? No because I will always strive for more. But am I better than I was? Yes. 

When I think about it I've only been found wanting three or four days this entire year. I have been utterly consumed with training. With ascending the stairs up unto the altar of Broseidon and Brodin. I train for hours, all week long, but I must take the weekend off to heal my muscles and regain my strength. I do not like quick one hour workouts or three day splits. I must slave away for hours, every day, or I find myself falling apart. If I could I would train all week long but my body can only take so much. Ah but life is imperfect but enough of that. Through the ups and downs my temple has always been there. 450 is 450 regardless. 

I began my journey having some leg strength but no core or upper body strength. I couldn't do a single pushup and I remember almost getting crushed after attempting 135. (I learned how to dump a bar properly as nobody was in there.) Many months passed and I took stock of my progress. My bench press is at 250, my deadlift at 500 and my squat is nearing 375. I see new muscles, better definition and mass. My body is thick and I have gained over 25 pounds of mass. Yet I have lost fat. I walk differently and feel better. I feel proud to be on this path.

Now I look on to the future. 2013 will have many challenges both in the temple and outside amongst the flock. Darker days are ahead and I have faced a few major setbacks recently. I will not lie brothers I have been laid low by the girl of my dreams. She does not share my passion. My heart has been torn asunder. My choice of career was halted due to uncontrollable circumstances after waiting for over two years. 

I find myself with another year of waiting and I shall do this alone. But I also know that there will be many righteous gains made. I am hungry. There is a burning fire and hatred within me that will not be put out. I will make massive gains, continue to strive and climb to new heights of swole. May all of you, my swole brothers and sisters, have a Merry Christmas and hopefully you receive copious amounts of protein.

I have chronic lower back pain that gets worse when pressure is exerted on that area of my back. 

all my life i've dealt with low self esteem and body image issues. i'm really skinny. i don't like myself in the mirror. this past week i've been getting more and more pumped to make a change and turn my life around. i even made a post on this subreddit saying how i want to be just like all you guys. i want to be swole.

but the physical therapist said i shouldn't lift heavy after seeing my x-rays. i didn't want to listen. Today was going to be the day i start my new life. I bought a bunch of food, shopping for a couple hours, and went home and started my workout routine. i couldn't even shoulder press without my right shoulder(another small injury but nothing serious) began to hurt, but especially my lower back. I was doing everything to tighten my abs, but i realize that if i can't even shoulder press 20lb without my lower back hurting then how the fuck am i going to be a bodybuilder.

so there goes all my hopes and dreams of not being a skinny loser virgin for the rest of my life. 

all i want right now is for a very swole man to hold me while i cry a little and whisper in my ears that everything is going to be ok. i don't know why i want this because i'm not attracted to guys. Maybe it's because being close to someone swole is the closest i'll ever get to actually being swole.

**edit**: thank you for the kind words, everyone. I will definitely try seeing a sports oriented PT and see where that goes. I know what you guys are saying about finding other ways to be swole, but i just don't want to accept that I can't have the body I want.

**Mom:** I still don't understand why you want to go there. I've seen what they do and it's just not right.

**Me:** Weightlifting is safer that most sports; I probably have a better chance of getting hurt when I'm running outside than when I'm in a gym with several people around me.

**Mom:** Stay at home, I don't see why you need to go there.

That conversation occured three weeks ago; since then, my heart has grown heavy and my muscles yearn for weight.

After which I spend my mornings browsing r/fit, learning about different beginner strength programs, looking at diet plans, and waiting for the day when I can finally lift. 

When I'm not on r/fit, I'm watching videos of [Donny Shankle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdhOdJ_NVao&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=63s), [St. Arnold](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuJ4hbkLiY0), and the Great Pyrros Dimas.

Dimas' lift has awoken something inside of me. 

In the bathroom I do my best to imitate Dimas' lift. I close my eyes and imagine myself one day achieving the strength and greatness that my body is capable of. 
I dream of one day learning the compound lifts (squat, deadlift, benchpress, etc) and eventually the olympic movements. 

All I have right now is a pull-up bar but I'm trying my best. I'm cleaning up my diet, reading Starting Strength, and preparing for the day when I be myself.

I'm 16 years old, 5'7, 140lbs, and I'm a transwole. There is a swoleman trapped inside my body and he will come out; Mom you can't stop me. I'm getting my license and the first place I'm going to is the one place where I was meant to be; the gymnasium.

Brodin, you are wise and just. You give each man &amp; woman the right amount of weight; neither light nor impossibly heavy. Enough that with determination, we, like Dimas, can successfully lift. I thank you for that Brodin.

1342643848.0,47,self.swoleacceptance,ws24m,[FIRST POST]Tragic story of swole bros,59,12,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/swoleacceptance/comments/ws24m/first_posttragic_story_of_swole_bros/,"First of all, thank you so much for this subreddit. Last night, my girlfriend told me she joined Planet Fatness and I about lost my shit. I just keep losing people to the forces of sissy lifts and squat rack curls.

Anyhow, sorry for the long tale, I just had to vent. My heat is damn near broken in half these days.


My tale of swoleness begins in the year 1984. I was born in a hospital overlooking a high school gridiron, which would prove to be prophetic. I was born to a slight woman and a swole man of mythic wrestling prowess. He would instill in me the ways of the swole man at a young age, before I could be indoctrinated into the false ways of the “swimmer’s body” and “not bulky” faiths. 

Because I was raised the right way, I was unusually immune to all the bullshit that our overly emasculated society has thrown my way, but alas, not all shared my convictions, even those whose resolve seemed unshakable. 

You see, it takes a village to raise a true swole—more specifically, a good lifting buddy. As if the heavens parted and Saint Coleman (saint of heavy lifts and wide backs) smiled upon me, my lifting partner who we will call Thor (because that’s his name) was brought into this world. Once we became aware of one another, we were inseparable. Thor was not raised a swole, as he was raised solely by his mother, but he was a swole at heart (and genetically). When my father would have me pull him home in the family car, Thor was right next to me, faithfully helping me complete my task. When we were old enough to sneak into our local high school’s altar of swole (the weight room), we spent our every waking free hours there. So consumed were we by this Mecca of iron and chalk dust that we would run there after school.

It was there where we found our mentor who would guide us toward our true passion: football. One fateful day whilst we were throwing around the heavy iron, a mountain of a man named Mike pulled us aside and asked if we were incoming freshman. His eyes burned like those of a man who had battled the heavy iron his entire life, freeing it from its gravitational prison over and over again-- he was a fellow swole. 

We could not lie to our brethren, so we told him the truth, that we were two seventh graders who had been sneaking into the gym to wage war against metal plates. He asked us if we lived in the district and if we had any interest in playing football. We both nodded our heads and from that day forth, he taught us the ways of powerlifting; the one true faith. 

In high school, Thor and I were exceptional athletes, fueled by our swole ways. We stood out on the gridiron. In weight lifting class, we were unconcerned by petty curl maxes and instead went for deadlift records. We were loved by our coaches, but envied by the nonswoles. This tested mine and Thor’s resolve for our swole ways of life. As you all know, the swole lifestyle is a lonely lifestyle. The discipline that being swole entails didn’t allow for any deviation. We didn’t party after games, instead carb loaded and planned out our next routine. We were shunned for our swole ways, but where I stood defiant against the unswole masses, I could see a darkness rising in Thor. 

Because Thor never had a true father, I don’t think he really knew what it was to be a swole. You see, being a true swole is a lifestyle; it’s a reward in and of itself. I don’t think Thor realized that. He saw being a swole as a means to an end. The glory we reaped on the gridiron and the weight we pulled off the ground weren’t enough for him. He wanted more, he wanted the fame. Most of all, he wanted the women. 

Because Thor was my brother in Arnold’s eyes, I tried as hard as I could to break him of his despair. He saw my success with women, and he couldn’t understand why. He didn’t understand that being a swole gave me the confidence to be whoever I truly was as opposed to Thor, who felt he had to fit a mold of what nonswole ideals dictated he should be. Eventually, he did find a woman who found his swole ways irresistible and for a time it was good. Thor’s darkness subsided and we delved even deeper into the ways of the swole. 

However, like the seasons change, so do the minds of fickle young girls, and we were shunned more than we had ever been before. Sports seasons were over, and the new emo plague was infecting young adults everywhere. Most people make the mistake that the emo plague was only about terrible indie music, but it was so much more insidious than that. The emo plague boasted about a way of life that was in direct contradiction to that of the swole. Being an athlete was something to be ashamed of, the pursuit of swole musculature was openly mocked, the male ideal was no longer in the image of Adonis, but rather in the image of Billy Joe Armstrong.  So alas, Thor’s heart and swoul were irreparably broken by the succubus Lara. Thor’s darkness was overpowering him, and I wasn’t there for my swole bro.

Something you never hear enough of about we swoles is our discipline and dedication and how it benefits us in all aspects of our lives. In addition to mine and Thor’s athletic endeavors, we also excelled in our academic endeavors, which lead both being accepted to the same university. Naturally, we were excited because this would allow us to continue our swole ways into our twenties. 

Whence attending the University, Thor’s resolve was waning more every single day. Rather than going for the raw bro swoleness of a business degree, Thor went for a graphic arts degree. Every day Thor was tortured by classmates of the soft variety who did not understand that ways of the swole. He lusted for women whose male ideal was a prepubescent twelve year old boy. He was judged by “men” whose greatest physical activity was impotently pounding the keys on their keyboard in response to a video game opinion he didn’t agree with. 

It started with a simple, “Nah man, I’m sore. I’m just going to hit the treadmill.” At first, I didn’t think anything of it. Whilst in college, it was difficult to maintain proper nutrition. I, too, was feeling the effects of a bad diet and insufficient supplementation. Then it became, “You know, I think I’m going to just do some curls and maybe pec-deck flies.” I could feel I was losing him. I tried with all my swoul to get him back into Arnold’s good graces. I bumped up squat and deadlift days to twice a week. I added more interesting oly lifts into our routine to no avail.

 “Hey man, did you ever think that girls don’t like our huge muscles?”

My heart sank behind my massive pectorals. I felt a pain in my chest that only those fatasses at Planet Fitness feel when they have their weekly heart attack.  I knew this was the beginning of the end. My brother in swole had lost his way. He wanted out. He wanted back to a world of sissy lifts, looking like a skinny pussy, not being able to pick up VW Beetles; a nonswole’s life. Being a swole for life, I did the only thing a man of my caliber could. 

“Thor, you’re dead to me. Get the fuck out of my face. You make me sick.”

My lip quivered as I spoke those words. Thor could see the look of hurt and betrayal on my face, and he averted his gaze from my eyes. He knew he could never make it right again. And now, all these years later that we’ve both moved on from one another, I still wonder what could have been. Thor had the genetics that would make any swole’s veins pump with envy, and he spat in the face of Arnold, Coleman, and Ferrigno. For this, I could never forgive him, but I wonder if we could have changed the world together; changed the face of what society thinks a real man should look like. 

Last I saw him; he was trying to fit in with the hipster crowd. He was a good three inches taller than any of them, shoulders a foot wider. He still had that heads up, shoulders back proud walk about himself like we swoles have. Thor looked like a wolf amongst a herd of sheep, but there was sadness in his eyes, as if he knew he could never fit in; that he would never truly belong.

I hope he found his happiness.

For I wish to share an account of my inner struggle, depression and ultimately enlightenment during this past month. 

I have been following the iron path with the most strict of dedication for almost four years now. The first few were filled with mistakes, newbie gains and a fiery passion to better myself that burned like the sun. Over time I was able to separate truth from lies, myth from fact and pick through endless ""broscience"" to find what worked for me. The Iron became my closest friend, and I became its devoted follower. 

Not but four weeks ago, I was bending over to pick of a piece of paper off the floor (of all things) and felt a slight *pop* in my left knee. Thinking nothing of it, I continued life as usual. However, by two days later when leg day rolled around, my knee was swollen and very tender. I experienced intense pain when extending my leg or attempting to squat or lunge at all. Not only this, but it felt as if it was going to give out if I put my full weight on it. After a quick visit to the doctor, I was tolled I had torn my lateral meniscus and would have to take a week to immobilize and ice the leg as well as an additional four weeks off of any intensive lower body exercise. I was limited to swimming and low-intensity biking. Needless to say, this was a dampener to my typically high spirits. 

The following weeks were hard. I struggled to stay positive, I felt as though I was going against everything I had learned and come to enjoy by training strictly upper body for nearly a month and my heart ached as I watched my quads and hamstrings begin to atrophy and seemingly diminish in size as well as begin to grow soft and weak. 

It was near the end of the third week of my rest and recovery that my heart attitude began to change. Through my hours of long introspection, I came to realize what really mattered and what really was a blessing. It was not achieving sub 10% bodyfat, it was not being ""jacked"" compared to others, to be able to lift more or succeed. It was simply the fact that I had been given a body. A body which I could use to exercise, to push myself beyond my limits, to experience the world and to explore life. 

Brothers, I myself am a Christian, and so naturally I attribute this revelation to Christ within me, but no matter whose name you profess, be it Jesus, Allah, the Spaghetti Monster, Brodin himself, or wherever else your beliefs may lie, let us all take a moment and be thankful. Not for our aesthetics that we want others to mire, not for our physical strength in which we so often boast, but for when we have knees with which we can squat, shoulders with which we can press and backs that can bear a heavy load up from the ground.

Myself a transwole, I saw the Light in July and at that same time too was blessed with a swolemate. He had been walking The Path of Iron for many years, and offered prayers of great benevolence, but also he acted as a prayer leader.

Then, I broke my foot (a month out) and med school beckoned me away from my home, Temple and swolemate. I found a new temple to offer prayers at but found the Path harder to walk alone. Brodin seemed to have withdrawn his mighty Light...

But he giveth as he taketh, and at med school I was blessed with another swolemate (whom I live with)! This one an even more recent convert than myself and though not yet swole of body, he is truly swole of mind and heart.

Then I realised the great wisdom of our Swolefather. I was baptised in  sweat under the squat, and now I too must lead prayers as I was once lead. My swolemate and I now observe worship together within the temple and outside in the Kitchen.

I had it to go and when we got back to our home, they decided to head to a local Chinese restaurant.  I agreed to save my already prepared meal for a later date to join them.  I had a large spread and was quite famished having not fed for about 3 hours.  I ate all that I had ordered as well as some soup and rolls that they didn't want.  Finally, I felt satisfied.  ""Four thousand calories later...""  What? I asked.  ""If you weren't working out you'd be soo fat.""  So on that day I suffered offenses on my appearance and my appetite.

For example currently if my girlfriend measured it right I have a 50 inch chest, but have something close to a 34 waist, and being born with some of the widest shoulders/frame one could hope for (makes shopping for a car difficult)

Since I started working out again (began working out/eating right consistently since April) I've had to deal with alot of issues.

-Because of my big chest whenever I go out clubbing I do get girls coming up to me and feeling my chest to see ""if it was real""

-Constantly getting areas felt up when in public.

-My co-workers/boss constantly ask me what steroids I take or how I lose weight so fast.  When I reply back that I only take stimulants for ADHD, workout hard and have a good diet, they think i'm lying.  I even had my boss approach me and claim that what I'm doing isn't natural.

-When I go out to eat I am pretty specific on what I eat, even though I am dieting.  For exampleI'll usually get a burger, but remove all the mayo and bacon and ask for stuff like pulled pork and eggs to be added to my burger which the waitress then replies with ""I can see why you need all that protein""

-Lots of attempts to be talked down too like I am dumb, even though I have 4 years of college education behind me and spend my spare time reading stuff like national geographic, run a business and computer program on the side.

-When I told people (back then) that I was working at a nightclub (I was a bartender) people would always assume I was a bouncer. 

It's not like I don't like the attention, I love it hell it's my motivation to workout but I constantly complain to the people in my life that I feel a little violated when I go out, and it's gotten to the point that any time a girl grabs my chest I ask if I can grab hers which is followed by ""ITS NOT OK"".  I just don't want to be known for all the stereotypes just because I want to take care of my body.  The day has 24 hours.  Working out only takes like 1.5 hours of our days.

I usually comment on something topical or simply go with ""I think you're really cute and I had to come introduce myself."" Would a swole woman appreciate me commenting on a specific bodypart -or her swole in general- at some point in the conversation? Or would I come off as a womanizer?

I thought things would never change between us. I hadn't seen him in over a year, and when I finally did, he said something I'll never forget. ""You can probably tell me about lifting, since you're all 'beefcake' now"". I was literally in shock at the use of the B-word. HE EVEN DID THE AIR-QUOTES. Like, not only was the use of that slur not good enough, but I was a mere apparition of an outcast freak. A monster so untouchable I could exist only in theory. 




* Now my friends have begun to play a game where they point out things to my that are either behind me, or just at the edge of my peripheral vision. This is...it almost hurts too much to type it... so they can laugh when I have to turn my whole torso to look, because these damn traps are in the way. I don't want to live in this world. Are the people this prejudiced everywhere? I feel like a Jewish child being made to tour a German Shepherd rescue facility. I don't even react anymore. I just imagine that weight, and how good it feels to stack that bar five plates deep, and the kind words the plates speak to me at the top of my reps.





* The last story is perhaps the worst. I had suspected one of my friends to be a member of the swole community. He was showing the signs more and more every day. When I thought it couldn't be any more obvious, I finally got up the courage to ask him ""Sam, are you...ya know...swole like me?"". The look on his face was none other than disgusting. He laughed STRAIGHT IN MY FACE and said ""No way man. You've got those lat-wings. I'm *nothing* like you"". I don't even think I have to finish this story. I just want someone to tell me they've been there, and that its going to be all right. Sometimes I think that if we do this together, we can make a world that loves us for who we are. Someday.

I thank Brodin for these days because each leg day is both a triumphant and a humbling experience altogether. Today was no different. 

I say this because while racking sixteen 45 lb plates upon the leg press a young disciple who had recently began his walk along the iron path came unto me and said, ""Bro, are you being serious right now?"" 

""Indeed I am,"" I replied."" He responded by saying that he did not believe he could ever make it to such a load. 

I then shared with him a short history of my journey along the path of iron, telling him how I achieved said weight over the years, encouraging him to not look upon such a weight as an impossible task, but a goal to be achieved through hard work, perseverance, and the willingness to consistently push oneself to be better, rather than being thine own worst critic. 

I urged him to ask questions of those around him, and to not only push himself, but to believe in himself as well, since being a fellow human he could certainly achieve what others had achieved before him. 

He thanked me for the motivation and walked away standing slightly taller. I paused and remembered how I used to view the iron church. I was intimidated by the swole, afraid to move away from the cardio machines and the pull-up bars where I had become most complacent. But complacency kills, Gents, and we must not fear the swole but embrace it like an older brother who will never lie to us and constantly challenges us to become better human beings in the eyes of almighty Brodin.

I did my warmup sets. I loaded my current PR onto the bar, 315. I positioned myself and got ready to engage in a battle I thought to be formidable.

I have been attending services religiously for the past month, and have started to see modest gains. I can't say that I have been a victim of swolehate.

I took a philosophy class at college, and the thing that stuck with me the most is the [Socratic method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method) of debate. In short, instead of disproving your opponent's assertions, you question the assumptions they make. Questioning them forces them to think critically, not emotionally.

When someone swolehates on you, they are debating you. They are opening a dialogue between them and you. You must treat it as a debate. But do not defend yourself. You know in your heart that the path of Swole is true and just, you need no defense. Question them. Their assertions of ""Going to the gym that much will kill you"", or them molesting your muscles are **acts of emotion, not thought**. Force them to think about the actions and assertions.

""Why will going to the gym that much kill me?"" ""Why do you think it is ok to touch me without my consent?"" Don't have an emotional tone. Have an inquisitive/curious tone. Tell them ""I really want to understand why you think that way"".

It is easy to attack right back with ""You are fat and out of shape, you don't understand."" But this will not improve the situation. It will make them defensive and emotional. 

**TLDR**: To combat swolehate, question the swolehater's ideas. Make them explain their emotional and defective ideas. They often can't. **Ask ""Why do you think that?""**  Don't attack them personally, they will become emotional and no one will come to a better understanding.",,False,,t5_2u673,1350406500.0,,,True,t3_11krcj,http://www.reddit.com/r/swoleacceptance/comments/11krcj/a_theory_on_dealing_with_swolehate/,

I don't want to be this way anymore (Might trigger Carb/toning people)",90,49,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/swoleacceptance/comments/1563vv/recovering_otter_220_lbs_6_1_hating_my_body_in/,"Sorry, this will be long. 

Just found this community.. seem like a great group of bros who might be able to help me. I'm 26 years old. I've struggled with my swole as long as I can remember. My mother and sisters are the same. My mother told me to go lifting when I was in kindergarten. I was constantly teased for being strong. In middle school, my mom started to focus on the fact that I would never get a 800 lb DL if I didn't gain muscle. I developed self injury issues (overuse issues) in high school. When I moved out of my parents' house, the new-found freedom of not being criticized over every lb I lifted was too much. I also worked at the gym of my college and was under a lot of academic pressure... at my highest swole, I was 260lbs (8% BF). At this point, I decided to lose muscle mass. I ate carbs in 2007. At my lowest weight, I was 200lbs, which was a 60lb loss. I was no longer tight in an XL t-shirt.

The secret that nobody knew was that I was also a carbophile. I was  running before the surgery. I used the rowing machine. After the surgery, it was easy enough to go swimming as well. Swimming is common in cardiophiles so I didn't have to do much to help it along (sorry if that's tmi). In any case, I didn't really care. I was getting results and looking and feeling great... and then the muscle loss stopped. I mean, I knew it would eventually, but it was disappointing. It's sort of how weight loss surgery works.. you have your big loss but you have to maintain it yourself after those first couple of years. 

In any case... I had a girlfriend (who became my spotter, now my ex spotter). She talked out of both sides of his mouth. I was 'strong' (never swole). She thought I could lift stuff up and put it down (but we almost never squatted), etc. I left my home country and a good job to be with her and take a low paying job doing something I hated. The muscle came back and I was at 230 for a time. She pointed out my muscle gain a lot... I managed to lose down to about 205. As we grew apart and I finally got the strength to leave her, my strength went up and down. I've been at 220 for awhile now. My mother still comments on my weight and eating habits constantly. It hurts me very much.

In order to start over, I took a job writing on an online fitness blog overseas. That's how I met my amazing spotter of 6 months. It was PRs at first session. She is my refereer. She adores my lifts. She really believes that my body is the ideal body for a lifter. she tells me all the time how strong I am and points out specific things she loves about my technique and how I look under the bar (and also lovely things about the person I am!). She wants to sketch and draw my body... she says I'm a work of art. She makes me very happy.. but it is so hard for me to believe her. I still feel weak and disgusting. Every day I eat any carbs or go under 4500s calories, I feel like a worthless otter. I do all kinds of hateful self talk.. and I have the strongest, strongest urges to start taking synthol again (I stopped right before I left to teach overseas). I don't want to do that. I don't want to hurt myself anymore.

I don't want to be like this. I am making healthy changes just to feel stronger (more whey and chicken breasts, etc). I don't own an elliptical (I used to run over 10 times a day.. I just do hill sprints and prowlers once a week now) and I try not to eat carbs (I usually still do...). I just.. want to be feel strong. I want to get dressed and go out and not feel like Brad Pitt in Fight Club (I live in an Asian country where I am something to stare at, so that probably doesn't help. All foreigners get stared at though, so it isn't my swole, but still..). I want to be strong for my spotter who loves my quads. 

I need help. I need to read a book. I need someone to talk to. 

Thank you for reading. 

tl;dr : Body issues all my life.. lost over 100lbs of muscle with cardio and carbs, gained a little back. Feel disgusting all the time even though my spotter tells me how much she loves my quads. Used to be an otter.. fighting urges to cardio again due to the hatred of my body.

They said I looked so different. I thought they meant because I was wearing a suit and have a nice haircut. I mean I have known them since I was about 12 years old (22 now).

Instead of respecting my body and using it to properly worship, I felt I was defiling my temple with my destructive habits, and my back was too sore to stand properly for 3 weeks.

So I rested, and worked on other exercises.  Lo, and my back did feel better enough, so I gathered my courage and entered the squat rack.  Starting light, I decided to try some high rep, and was rewarded with good range of motion and a pleasant burning.  Upping the weight to about 80% of my previous lifting amount (not much as I am merely a transwole) I tried some heavier squats, carefully.

Brothers and sisters, I fell into an immense and comforting hole.  I had never experienced a sensation quite as good as this before: Brodin had girded my loins with the iron itself, or so it felt.  Not only did I recover from the back pain, but my patience had been rewarded with more stability and depth than I had had before.

Sorry to ramble, but I wanted to share the revelation I had.

I must add he reminds me this while drunkenly slouching on the couch watching hours of TV.  Nonetheless, I empathize with him and tell him Brodin is patient and one day, when the time is right, you’ll find your way again.

Last Friday, like most Fridays, he boasted how successful he was with a lady.  Him being a follower of Dionysus - and it shows - I give him genuine acclamation for his success to which he sternly replies, “I know you work out a lot and all but take it from me, girls don’t care much about muscular guys….”  As stunned as I was that he saw my compliments as an opportunity to attack my path to swolehood, I held my tongue and refrained from unleashing a fury of insults regarding his slothish ways.

Much was the mockery I received during the time of the great fitness challenge. Much were eyes rolled every time I shook up a protein shake at my desk, or turned down an invitation to take my lunch at a custard stand with my salt mine crew. Many were the times I was accused of getting ""man arms"", or of getting ""too muscled to look good.""


And yet, many were the times they demanded I lift my shirt to show them the progress of my bodysculpting, objectifying my journey to a thing of pure aesthetics, and not for the strength it fueled me with, the purpose it gave me, the sheer delight of finally being able to run a mile without collapsing from exhaustion. Little was the understanding I was given, that I was doing this to no longer feel weak. To no longer fear walking a downtown alley at night, nor to think I must always seek someone to save me if a situation became dire.


But I persevered, and let not their scorn sway me from my path. I have completed this stage of my journey, with many an engraved image to show for it, and I tremble with the anticipation of joy for continuing on my way.


I wish to become even more than what I am now. To never stop struggling for that next milestone, to never feel I need only ""maintain"". No. I will carry on, for the glory of Swolehalla!

She now hears the call of Brodin, and treads down the winding road to Swole.**

Fellow worshippers of Brodin, I see so many lamentable tales on here that I feel compelled to share a happy event from my journey to Swolitude.

I am currently dating a cardiobunny, who previously had only ever felt the embrace of the weak-privileged. Though I am still only intermediately Swole, Brodin spoke through my unworthy mouth to impart his weighty Wisdom of the Iron.

Some of the lessons were unpleasant- I am ashamed to admit that I subjected my fair maiden to the Trials of the Protein Fart. She was shocked by my observance of Bulkadan, and dismayed by my intermittent fasting during the unhappy Cutting Season.

However, much of the time was rather pleasant. Being that I was her first swole lover, my stamina and strength during our private hours came as a welcome change. My poor lover had been so brainwashed by cardiobunny culture that her jaw dropped when she saw me squat a barely respectable 370#.

Her brainwashing at the hands of other cardiobunnies led her to question the Wisdom of Brodin, as she stridently attacked my conspicuous consumption of steaks, intermittent fasting, and disdain for the false idols of HAES. By remaining patient and sharing the parables of Saint Silvy, and Bishop Berkhan, I was able to cleanse her mind of these vile misconceptions.

I sensed that would recieve the knowledge of the Prophet Rippetoe and baptism by Starting Strength- but if only she would let go of her self-limiting cardiobunny beliefs. 

Fortunately, Brodin saw fit to open her mind with a grand, majestic gesture. This past weekend, we visited the land known was Washington DC, whose denizens travel via strange contraptions known as ""Subways"". While disembarking from the so-called ""Red Line"", the doors closed without warning- leaving me on the platform, and my lover separated from me by unsympathetic steel.

Summoning all the power residing deep within my somewhat mighty frame, I jammed my hand into the rapidly shrinking gap between the subway doors. Brodin must have been lending me strength, for the pathetic motors were no match for my writhing muscles. The doors receded in defeat, and my partner escaped to the safety of my heroic pipes.

My beloved former cardiobunny now sees the light, and admits that strength is more ""functional"" than being able to run 5 kilometers at a moderate pace. She has answered the call of the iron with heavy squats and OHP.

Why is this okay?  Even the hair thing bothers me a little bit; yes, I work hard to maintain my flaxen locks, and my physique, but If I had asked to feel their hair, or their bodies, I'd get slapped with harassment, or at least inappropriate behavior.

After being cleared to deadlift again after an injury, I was ready as ever. I had deadlifted two weeks prior and had been looking forward to this day so much; my first day in the gym for the summer of 2013. I was so excited that I bought a new weight lifting belt in anticipation of this day.

As soon as I reached the gym, I headed straight to deadlift. At least 3 plates would be going on her that day, but she wasn't ready for it yet. I put up 135 and repped it multiple times to warm up. Then I threw on an added 90 and repped 225. That's when it happened, and I felt my back cave in; my injury had re-occurred. 

Disappointment is sitting down on one of the machines, watching the dumbbells and barbells taunt me, telling me I won't be able to work out for weeks. 

Dedication is getting annoyed, upset, angry and deciding fuck it, if my back isn't up to it then today will be chest and tris. I'l have to switch up my routine a bit, but I came here and I'm working out.

Dedication is finishing my chest and tris workout (though I could do no barbell bench press). 

Then I went home, got some food and climbed upstairs. I slowly lowered myself into bed, as the pain was too much to bare. 

Disappointment is finally realizing that I will have to stop deadlifting for a very long time, if not indefinitely. I can no longer do my favorite exercise. 

Disappointment is realizing that on the very first day of working out, I have to acknowledge that I will not reach my summer goals, the goals that had been set out by me and my friends.  

Dedication is when, about two hours later - and still in unbearable pain, I realize that I must eat again if I wish to achieve my calorie goals. Even if I can't lift, I will still diet; I refuse to lose the weight I have put on. 

Dedication is walking down the stairs, one stair at a time, because I can go no faster. Dedication is slowly making myself a sandwich and getting a huge glass of milk; hopefully this will sustain me for at least a few more hours. 

Disappointment is what I feel right now, realizing that I was so close to finally pulling a 4 plate deadlift, but my dream has been foiled.

For I have returned from the fields after a long days work, and worshiped immediately after.

After a glorious feast, I fall upon my cushions, and a black fog resides over me.

There stands a man with glorious hair and bulging muscles. He wears a suit, holds a single apple, and stands under a dying tree. I can see small scars on his lips, where stitching did reside.

He says to I. ""Doth ye wish for gains?"" 

""More than anything."" I respond.

""Anything?"" He smirks.

We are then striding into a iron temple. It is after hours, for the lanterns are dim.

But nay, we are not alone. I see all the other strong men of history with us. Hercules, Thor, Arnold, Bruce.

My spine tingles, something is not right. But I ignore it. I am safe here with my iron brothers.

The mysterious buff man in the suit says ""For gains, their must be sacrifice, great sacrifice.""

Then I see my idols walk up to the glorious squat shrine. But NAY! This cannot be! They begin to curl! A dark evil mist seeps out of the steel bar and into their muscles, which begin to bulge.

I fall to my knees and cry ""NOOOOOO!"" Every inch of me is repulsed by this desecration, this heresy.

The man in the suit says ""No one is here. All the great ones of history have done it. Forget ye nutrients, delve into the night, do ye reps, do ye curls.""

But there is a shimmer of hope left in me. I hold onto it, in the ever encroaching darkness. The light nearly fading from my eyes, I grab onto that hope, and I...I...LIFT IT! I pump it to the sky. And hope runs through my veins.

The illusion fades. My idols were mere figments of mist! I have been deceived! And then I see the swole suited man in his true form!

I yell upon him. ""Great Deceiver Loki! Lucifer! Weaver of lies! Curler in the shrine of squats! You shall not trick me with ye shallow gains! I shall remain pure and whole! I will never join ye legions of darkness!

Then out of the fog I swam. Laying upon my cushions. Out of the maze of my mind. My soul intact. Ready to start another day of iron worship.

I came across a couple posts mentioning family swolehate and thought I would share my thoughts. 

I was born here in the States in 89, right after my parents fled Soviet Armenia. They had a very narrow minded view on weight lifting let alone the bodybuilding/powerlifting lifestyle. When I got into it, they would constantly say, ""ok thats enough"" ""you're big enough now"" ""stop lifting so much you will hurt yourself"" and my favorite part was that they thought protein powder was some type of poison. 

Now I sat them down a few years ago and explained what I was doing, what the supplements I was taking was doing, and why I love this lifestyle so much. We went to the doctor together and I was healthier than most of my non-swole friends. They began to accept it, and the swole-hate stopped.

What I am getting at is that your family loves and cares about you, and most of their ""hate"" is based on fear which is rooted in ignorance. They simply don't know what we do, or why we do it. Sit them down and really articulate your passion and knowledge and I am certain they will come around.

EDIT:  
Some are concerned that such a document would impede the creativity of the subreddit.
I understand that all brothers of swole must have a voice. This book will not stifle it, but rather give introductory knowledge of our culture to the weak, and a foundation to further build from for the already swole of heart. I really desire to see an awesome collective document that displays the best of our imagination and spirit. One that includes the Ten Bromandments, the Creatine Story, as well as legendary prayers and wisdom from the past. On my bedside table, I want it printed off, leather bound and dog-eared. In discussions, I want to be able to cite Bromans 8:13. 


If one of you is swole enough to take up such a project, do so! There is room for great imagination and glory in such an endevor.

I've searched high and low across London for a gym that fits my appetite. From the gargantuan chains right through to the petite and intimate independents. 

My longing for a free weights area with room enough for more than three benches and for more than a mere handful of disciples to worship at once led me to a new gym, not 3 months ago. 

A gym which didn't tuck it's lifters away in a confined space but rather let us graze powerfully on the floor with all other pursuers of perfecta forma. It even had an enviable squat rack (though only one. My search for a gym in London took me to all four corners of it and I have yet to find a gym with more than one bench or squat rack.)

I stepped in here and was welcomed by personal trainers who were baptised with milk and whey and who would keenly spot or coerce you to join impromptu group classes. My heart swelled with joy and I experienced powerful, powerful gains. 

But a mere three months into this new romance, I received a letter to say that my gym had been bought out by a lesser beast. My friendly chain would be swallowed by another sporting the sophomoric name ""truGym""

The 24 hour nature of the new gym is wasted on me as I prefer to worship on my way to work. 

I worry that I will show up when the transition is complete to find my beautiful rack replaced with an extra set of elliptical machines. 

The wonderful trainers and team of all shapes and sizes who have made the gym what it is are to remain. Though some have told me they cannot bear to speak the name of their new employer out loud.

It all started last Sunday afternoon, I was going for a new squat PR and was feeling a worthy Pump, however that righteous feeling was destined to be short lived.  I am ashamed to admit this my bros, but as I was about to complete my second work set the weight became too much, my back went slack, but my hips rose up regardless, Not realising my mistake until it was too late I completed the movement in bad form; I, in effect, good morning-ed the bar.  As you can Imagine Brodin saw fit to punish me for my lack of faith by bringing down his mighty swole fist to smite my mortal lumbar spine, my sciatic nerve trapped, I was forsaken to spend at least the next 2 weeks out of the gym to recover.

I have repented, by saint Ronnie's lats I have repented!  I have spent the last week Icing, stretching and drilling form with no load to make sure that shall not sin again, I have visited the doctor and the physiotherapist, yet still Brodin sees fit to punish me still. I know that it is not my place to question his judgement and I bear the pain gladly, but I must admit that not being able to lift is a heavy Burdon upon my soul, as lifting heavy weights is a part of who I am.

The worst part is that, depressed though I may be, I cannot seek support from my friends and family, as far as they are concerned the injury is my fault, not because I messed up my form (which I fully understand is my own responsibility) but because I was stupid enough to even be in the gym in the first place, as picking up the heavy weights is ""too dangerous"" by their standards, one friend I spoke to even seemed to think I should be happy that I can't work out, **HAPPY**, like lifting is some kind of chore! How could he even think such a thing!?

Anyway I want to thank the good people of this community for being there it’s so good that swole people with swole problems can now rest safe in the knowledge that there are people out there who understand.

Here's a little backstory: I'm 18 years old, soon to be 19, and I'll be going away to college next month. Now, that means a lot of buying new things and needing to pick out what I need to bring and what I won't need. This includes buying new clothes, of course. However, I also struggled with an cardio disorder through the past couple of years, and while I consider myself recovered, I still do struggle with negative thoughts sometimes.

I am in a much better place now than I was a year ago. I am an avid lifter, I do strength exercises, and I am bulking. These things help me feel good about myself, and I think that knowing that I need to eat enough to fuel my gains helped me a lot. I've also been seeing a therapist, though I will not be seeing her once I go to college.

I used to be about twenty pounds lighter than I am now, when I was in my earlier teenage years. When I was in the depths of my cardio disorder, I was about fifteen pounds lighter than I am now, and now I am at a healthy weight. But I am afraid of losing weight again. I used to feel uncomfortable in my own skin when I was lighter, which I am sure fueled my CD (along with other, personal issues), so I mostly stuck to wearing baggier clothes to hide my gains. Now, I am still the same way, though I have been gaining more confidence in the way I look, and I credit Brodin for that. I want to start dressing nicer in college, which would mean having to go out and buy new clothes to wear. But I'm terrified of buying these new clothes, and then finding out a couple months later that I am shrinking into them because I'm doing too much cardio and losing my swole.

When I was at that lower weight, my lifestyle was much different; I was only exercising once or twice at week at most (horseback riding), and I didn't care about what I ate. I was a typical teenager. Now, I am much more conscientious. As soon as I started lifting, I began gaining weight, but then, before I ever leveled out, I spiraled downward into an CD, and then I had to crawl out of that hole that I'd dug for myself. I consider my life now to be much healthier than it ever was in the past.

I guess I am nervous about this because college is a new environment. I will not be eating the same foods I do now, I will not be living the same way I do now. But I will be walking a lot more (big city campus), I will be sticking to my keto diet, and I will be joining my school's powerlifting team, so I will still be lifting. I know that I can't just lose twenty pounds in a night, but I am afraid of it sneaking up on me. I was just so uncomfortable with myself when I was at that low weight, so I don't know how to quell my fears about this now. I was wondering if anyone here has any advice for me.

The goal of this thread is for our readers to post an image of themselves, or part of themselves, that they appreciate for being swole. 

**KEEP THIS SAFE FOR WORK PLEASE!!!**

So, if you appreciate your biceps for being swole, post a picture of them and tell us why you love their swole so much. Maybe they help you carry things. Maybe you appreciate your quadriceps this week for helping you complete that hike up beautiful Pikes Peak.

Maybe you appreciate your brain, for being so swole that it helped you complete some calculus 2 homework. 

The top voted post in this thread will be selected at the end of the day on Sunday and will be posted as the image on our side bar where the mightily swole philosopher, Bill Kazmaier, is currently resting his glutes, contemplating the intricacies of life. 

So /r/swoleacceptance where's your swoleppreciation?

But of course now that I'm swole I just want to go back, and my feelings about my own body are almost 100% negative (I guess I'm impressed by my general health and strength and the fact that I can carry so much muscle without it impeding my movement).
  
 I've posted before, but it's weird to think that one is supposed to love/like/accept one's own body even if one wants to change it? I'm not really sure how this is possible. Is the swole acceptance ethos demanding that we not want to change our bodies? That we not have physical ideals that we strive for? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding, and it's possible to hold the views of ""I love my body"" and ""I want to change my body"" at once, even though that seems a little bit like crazy talk.
  
But I defer to the experts, and re-ask my original question: what does it feel like to actually like your own body? And furthermore, for those of you who have been in a body-state of both more towards the ""media ideal"" and also far away from that ideal (more swole than socially acceptable), is your sense of loving your own body different in these two states? 

  Do you accept your body when you are swole, but then you REALLY accept it with a smile and a thumbs up when you're thin?

But today two complete strangers showed their true colours about their feelings towards those of us who are pushing ourselves to see what our body really is capable of.

So a little back story, I'm an Olympic weightlifter and I've just made it into the 94kg (207lbs) weight class and I'm 6'2"". My mother had came up to see me and actually said about my weight gain (not seen her for a couple of months) that she almost walked past me. after some food we went clothes shopping as I needed to get some new sweat pants.
A sales assistant of course helped me find some that would fit my tree trunks. My mum was commenting about my weight gain and Olympic weightlifting in front of the sales guy as mothers are known to do. I go to purchase my new pants, I had to venture back to the are of the sweat pants to see the sales assistant with an other sales assistant who wasn't there previously. I hear her say ""Yeah I hate big guys too, it just looks ugly. And they come into the gym and like run for only 10 minutes and that's it. I don't want to lift big weights, as my cardio would suffer"". the guy agrees with her then does that face you do when you try and stop someone talking about the person they are talking about as they are standing right behind you. She carried on with it, until I pipped in. ""Why you hating on big guys? I used to be a long distance runner, now I squat 200kg. Being able to lift heavy things is more useful to me than running distances"". They changed their talk to how it was up to the person what they wanted to train to do, I agreed and left them with ""Just don't hate on the big guy because it's not what you want"".

Part of me is kind of proud that I am now at the stage that people are noticing the fact I lift, the other is disgusted that someone would think I care that they don't like the fact I can over head press them.

I am fine with their swole-partheid that separates my offerings from those they make to the false god Zumba.  I make offerings of cleans and deadlifts much to the shock and awe of their unworthy congregation but without the offerings of almighty squat I feel that Brodin will not grace me with his favor.

They cursed, ""What hath thou done with my son?""

In the shower last night, I thought of an upside to being a Swole Bro.

There are a few weak priviledged out there who automatically dislike swole bros. This is due to subconscious insecurity and the unconscious feeling that these swole bros are a threat to their own self worth, masculinity and attractiveness.

However, as a Swole Bro, I do not pose such a threat.

I am automatically non-threatening because I don’t fit standard beauty definitions of feminine ottermode and low quad hypertrophy.

Which is an upside. I’m generally pretty shy, so I don’t need anything that prevents people from talking to me. ‘Cause god knows how unlikely it is for me to start a conversation.

Thinking about this lead me to think about what it is to be a Swole Bro in general.

Now. Don't tell me that I'm not swole.

Dude, I own mirrors. Also a scale, a tape measure and skinfold calipers if you want some empirical numbers.

I am not within the average weight range for my height, age or gender. Nor have I ever been, really.

I know that my friends who tell me I'm not swole do it because they care about me. They don't want me to feel poorly about myself and I appreciate that. But, it's a lie. And lying to me doesn't help me. Especially because knowing I'm swole doesn't make me feel bad about myself.

Because it's not necessarily a Bad Thing.

I am healthy. I can do cardio if I have to. I enjoy the elliptical machine if I have an audiobook. I look forward to my 45 minute walk to school every morning. I love hot yoga.

But, I doubt I will ever be ottermode. My thighs will probably always touch. My glutes will always be rounded. My arms will never be completely weak.

Maybe I don’t have enough self control.

I’ve tried jazzercize. P90x worked pretty well. But I’m still trying to decide if the 100 lbs I lost on my squat were worth me coming near to tears in the grocery store because I couldn’t even bulk. I denied myself so many compound lifts that made me happy.

Right now, while I’m worrying about school and my future, It’s not worth it. So, I’m back on my diet, but not GOMAD. Maybe I’ll try crossfit again in April. But not now.

And even so, it doesn’t matter.

I may be swole, but I’m happy.

My girlfriend loves my “thick thighs” and nuzzles into my rock hard stomach whenever I will let her. She still thought I was sexy when I was at my strongest.

But more importantly, I think I’m sexy. I love my body. I like myself. My body is not just an aspect of me, it is me.

I am strong. I am sturdy. I am balanced.

I am swole.

I know this. I accept this as an objective fact. It is not a slight against my character. It does not make me less than others.

It makes me who I am. Growing up in this specific body, learning to love and accept myself as is, has given me a unique perspective on the world that no one else has.

When I say this out loud, and people tell me that I’m not swole, it takes a bit of that journey away from me.

I know exactly who and what I am, and it took me a long time to get here.

I am a Swole Bro. But that does not mean that I cannot also be a Sexy Bro.",,False,,t5_2u673,False,,,True,t3_18h9ry,http://www.reddit.com/r/swoleacceptance/comments/18h9ry/my_thoughts_on_being_a_swole_bro_and_why_thats/,

At least i can relate on some points...

You see, where I said ""used to be"", i actually still am the opposite of swole. But I have a new idea of what i could be.

I don't even comprehend how i ever thought that was a good thing.

Some things lead me to abandoning the climbing lifestyle, and i have now adopted the one you call Brodin as my counselor. Instead of chicken legs, i've aquired rooster legs, and instead of no noticable tits i now proudly rock bitchtits. 
It's still a long road ahead, but it will be a nice journey.

I sit here now, exhausted after two hours at the gym. Walking through the supermarket nearly sick from exercise I filled my basket with bananas, cashews (shit's expensive) and other healthy foodstuffs instead of the thrash i used to eat.

Once everyone had gotten over my impressive stature and height, the talk eventually turned to if I played any sports. I was never an athlete in high school and the years after high school was when I truly discovered the path of Brodin. When I informed them that I did not play any sports the uproar was deafening. The most hurtful comment came out of this uproar. One man had the opinion that my physique was a huge waste since I did not play sports.

She was laughing and told my grandma to ""get over here and feel this"".  That's when she moved in and put her hand on my chest.  It's still so fresh in my mind that it hurts to talk about it.

I wanted to run, I wanted someone to stand up for me...but they all were laughing and taking turns feeling my traps, pecs, bis, and tris.  I didn't know what to do...

I met myself a wench soon thereafter, beautiful in looks, but toxic brothers. What began as a beautiful relationship spiraled into things bad. I can not say that I was not at fault, but for the most part I just let myself be a fool. Love will make us do strange things.

Finally this wench pulls the plug. I am depressed, my bright future had been mired because through so many fights and depressive bouts I began to stop caring about things.

My youthful frame which, yes, while skinny was in shape from wrestling and swimming in highschool degraded into fat, I appearred a slob, unkept hair and beard like some sort of bum. I had given up brothers. For several months I consumed nearly half a liter of vodka a day, my studies went awry, my family wondered what was wrong. I was depressed. 

I decided I had enough. I wanted to end it. While my family slept, I stole the keys to my fathers work van, crept out of the house at night, and I drove to a 24hr Walmart and bought a length of garden hose. I then drove to a desolate area, and proceeded to down a good quantity of alcohol, when I felt I was good and ready, I secured said hose with ductape to the exhaust, turned on the car, popped some sleeping pills to make everything easier, and said goodbye to the world.

Brothers, I feel like this is where Brodin began to do his work. I am not a religous person, perhaps a bit spiritual, but in any case, this is very odd. You see, I sought out the most deserted, desolate spot. Quite literally in the middle of nowhere, you can presume I did not want to be found.

Somehow, several hours later the door is being wrenched open the fire department. I kid you not when I tell you the medical personnel informed my family another 30 minutes in that van and I would have perished. Apparently someone had seen the van, along with the strange hose, and called 911, but who could this have been? Brodin I believe.

In any case, what ensued after that was awful. In order to rid my body of the toxins I had to be put into this special chamber, it felt like my insides where being pulled from within me, I had to endure this torture for nearly two hours every day.

After I was cleared off the medical unit, I was sent to the psychiatric unit until they thought I was good enough to go home.

Believe me when I tell you brothers, those pills they gave me, all the medication, all the therapy did abysmal work compared to the minimal amount of exercise I was allowed to do in there, but I did my best. All bodyweight, but it was something.

This was nearly a year ago, and since then I have gotten my life very much back on track. I wanted to share my story with you all on the cusp of my 22nd birthday.

The things that i've learned.
* You solely are responsible for your own happiness, you can not blame others. If you want to change, if you want to make your life better, it is entirely in your hands.
*Positivity is very, very important. No matter what the situation may be, do not focus on the negative.
*You can be on as many happy pills as you want, there are not going to do anything unless you want to change!
*Natural methods, at least for me outweigh anything synthetic. 

I could go on and on... Anyway, i'm sure every body would like to see pictures, I have included some.

First is me right before turning 19, 5'11, 165 lbs give or take. Next one is at my worst, a few days before I attempted to end it, I stopped weighing myself at the 198lb mark, but I would not be surprised I breached 200 here. And lastly, some current shots. I'm doing Starting Strength with some accesory work, I think i've almost tapped out my linear gains, so i'm thinking of switching to a hypertrophy based routine, and one that would let me be in the gym 4-5 days a week because I love it so much, if anyone has any suggestions. Feel free to chime in.

This took place at a sports ball tournament, during an intense playoff game. Smack talk was thrown around but my team's ire seemed to be directed at a particular swolebro (a new disciple of iron by my accounts, 5'8'' 150lbs, lean) who was displaying his athleticism via tank top.

I sat in silence as my entire kept referring to this person as ""steriod guy""... I have been working hard for the past few years and have reached a point where I feel I am much swoler than this bro. I regret not speaking up for fear that I would be ruining team spirit and risk having their swolehate turn to me. I was looking forward to tanning my new found 6-pack this summer but now I just want to eat and buy sweaters....

He gave a huge gasp, and told me that he honestly saw me loading up the bar after warm up sets and didn't think I was going to even be able to pick the bar up once. For reference, I weigh 160 and I did a 275lb deadlift 3 times for my max lift.

He mentioned the bodily gifts Brodin has bestowed upon me and set a precedent for my unnecessary singling -out. Following that remark, a group of young friends not yet blessed by the spirit of the swole began to ask questions. ""Why are you flexing?"" ""Did you wear a tank top to show off your muscles?"" ""Why do you have to show off to everyone?"" ""When did you get big?"" ""Taking steroids I see."" I remained calm. I played along. Brothers, I was hurt. Yet I remained calm.

I have went from a swole, 6', 210 pound brother to a mere 185 pounds in the course of a year. 

However, Brodin recently led me to a realization. I must change my ways. I must return to my consumption of 4000 calories per day in noodles, rice, chicken, nuts and vegetables. I must return to my rigorous regiment of worship 5 times a week. I must cut those things from my life that make me weak, for they are but folly. 

Brodin has guided my path for several years. I let him down, and now seek penance for my sins. 

Over Thanksgiving break, I will prepare my body by a strict regiment of pushups, pull-ups, and free weights in my garage. Then, I shall return to the University's temple, so that the Iron Bars may lay their punishment on me.

This past weekend I attended a concert of my most favorite of bands.  I traveled a great distance with a female friend to see their performance and was quite pleased by the experience granted by such a small venue.  But things took a turn for the worst.

I made quick friends with other fans while waiting for the band to come on.  Many sporting skinny jeans, cardigan sweaters, and other clothing of the like, unfitting for someone swole in size and mind, unfortunately.  However, as the fesitivies ramped up, I quickly saw their true motives unfold.  They simply wanted me to throw them into the crowd as to crowd surf, as a trebuchet.  At first I thought perhaps it was a coincidence, but nay.  This continued the whole show.  Many show-goers of the unswole approached me, a few times per song, and asked to be launched into the air.  I was simply a tool for their exploitation.  However, I was torn, because after each toss, they would return nearby and thank me.  I reluctantly nodded and continued on.  But am I to blame?  I did, in fact, enable them.  All I wanted was to enjoy my favorite band, but i digress.

But the worst display of swolehate was that the female I was with, who was a bit of a love interest of mine.  That is why I invited her, drove her, bought her a ticket, a t-shirt, drinks, etc. and she graciously accepted.  We had hung out many times before and showed great interest in eachother, but due to conflicting work schedules, it never progressed passed this.  However this evening had made great effort to impress her and take her to see this band, who was her favorite as well.  But during the intermission between bands I saw her texting over her shoulder.  She was talking to an ex-boyfriend, telling him how all the skinny punk boys with gauged ears and skinny jeans were making her miss him.  I was enraged.  Here I was showing her a great evening, and her mind was on the weak priveledged.  Her texting continued throughout the night, but I chose to look away, out of pain.  I did not want to be hurt by her words of swolehate anymore.  Maybe we had different expectations for the night, but seeing as we had already grown close and affectionate, her words toward the unswole came as a disappointing shock to my ego and my efforts in the iron temple.  ""How could she favor the body of the weak, over that of the swole?"" I thought.  ""Am I not fitting for such a woman?""  She is obviously not the right person for me.

Swolehate is a real problem, my brothers and sisters.  It can ruin a great night in the worst way.  My body is tired, my heart is worn down.  I return to the iron today with great anticipation.  I need to remove these thoughts from my mind and refocus my body.

My work out changed to physio to be strong enough to walk without a limp, lifting was off the cards as I had enough trouble supporting my own body weight without pain. The recovery has been slow, and the pain still noticeable.

But the strangest thing happend, it was so slow at first I didn't notice at first. My clothes started to become loose and some even fit, I could button all of my shirt buttons and people stopped asking me for workout tips. Then last week a sign was sent from on high, I was clearing out my old phone of photos and came accross a photo I had taken the day before my light heavyweight weigh in. Then it hit me like a pot hole to the ankle, something horrible had happened. I had become skinny.

It’s not often that I see men who look like me on the cover of fitness magazines, but I can always find men with bodies like mine in museums. 

I have a swoleness-level that might be considered “classically beautiful.” But I want to be considered a current beauty, and I think many men in my position might agree. 

It's scary to learn that most worshipers at the temple of Brodin suffer from body dissatisfaction, regardless of what they look like. The general consensus among most brethren nowadays is, ""I’m not good enough.""

Teaching the ways of the iron in the Hollywood-driven city of Los Angeles, as I do, makes it easy to feel different than the norm. Regular fitness models, movie stars, and yoga teachers seem tiny compared to me. Earlier in my career, I actually hesitated to follow my passion for teaching because I was insecure that I had a “non-ideal” body type. 

I realize that this lack of confidence is an epidemic that spreads beyond the way of lifting in our world in L.A. Our current concept of masculine beauty is derived from men we see in movies, TV, and fake supplement-funded magazines. These unrealistic images of beauty create a difficult standard to maintain, which often leads to self-consciousness, if not self-hate.

A constant urge to lose weight to look like the men we see in media can create unswole expectations for ourselves. It is not the path and destiny Brodin, Broseidon, and Bra has set us on

I can remember a time when I’ve been heavier, as well as a time when I’ve weighed less than my current weight. I know what it takes for me to go in either direction, but the truth is that my current weight is the path the iron-gods set for me. Most importantly, I know that I'm Swole.

So when I sometimes hear my nasty inner critic start to judge my body when I see photos or videos of myself, I take a deep breath and smile. I am on the path to becoming more swole.

I’m proud to put an image into the public eye that can act as a counter to what we normally see. Yes, it can be hard at times to compete against the slew of petite worshippers who look more like the “ideal” images I see on magazine covers, but I have to remember that it’s not a competition between me and these other men. The real battle is me against the self-hate that comes as a result of seeing modern media. 

So, when I look in the mirror and compliment my ripped shape, I’ve won.

When I practice the way of the iron and smile at the strength of my quadzillas, I’ve won.

And when I get in front of the camera, wearing tight fitness clothes with nothing to hide behind, again, I’ve won.

Hopefully the media I create will inspire other men to convert to the way of the swole and iron. Collectively, the images we put into the world will represent more concrete concepts of beauty that don’t require unhealthy behaviors. As a result, we will start to see more images of beauty and strength in swole shapes and sizes.

True power is within. Hopefully, sooner than later, men will be valued more for their swoleness rather than their straying of the path.
