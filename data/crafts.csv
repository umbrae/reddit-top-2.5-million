As the holiday season is upon us, I thought that creating a thread with redditors' etsy sites would be beneficial.  If your post your shop in this thread, I hope to repost this thread in other subreddits for exposure.  I'll also add it to our sidebar.

Rather than just the website, please add a description, target audience, etc. (see below for an example) for the benefit of buyers.  Feel free to add any fields that you need!

*an example:*  
**Shop Name:**  [NAME]  
**Site:**  [Etsy, Artfire, etc.]  
**Short Description:**  I sell awesome wares made from the wool from my sheep.  
**Types of items you sell:**  Scarves, hats, gloves
