Even Les Stroud himself said the biggest myth about survival is that it is fun. Real survival is not fun. Practicing fire-making, bushcraft, trap making, etc. can be fun, and can be learned without risking your life with a hobby called [Backpacking](http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/backpacking-beginners.html).

Bring the [10 Essentials](http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/ten-essentials.html) and learn how to use them.

The most important thing to have with you when spending the night outside is a sleeping bag. Not a gun, not a knife, not a tent, not even clothes or food or water. Exposure will kill you faster than dehydration or starvation. (If it rains, however, you're fucked. So bring a tarp or at least a trash bag for rain protection). To sleep comfortably, go ahead and pack a tent and sleeping pad as well.

Practice Leave No Trace (LNT). Making debris shelters by chopping down trees, then leaving them there once you are done, is a waste of natural resources and an eyesore to other people trying to enjoy the outdoors. And if you leave your trash in the woods, fuck you.

Carrying 50lbs (or more) of gear that you won't use is a bad idea. You'll only be able to walk a few hundred yards before getting fatigued. Learn to adopt some /r/ultralight techniques. Doing this will allow you to travel faster and further, thus enjoying more of the outdoors, and gain a greater sense of accomplishment (like bagging peaks, etc.). I suggest you read [this whole series of articles](http://www.backpackingnorth.com/p/ultralight-makeover.html).

A few things that gave me laughs in the stories I've read recently:

-Bringing a 9 volt and steel wool to start fire. Instead, bring a Bic lighter and petroleum jelly cotton balls. Bring a ferro rod and waterproof matches as backup. Save that 9 volt trick for when your plane crashes over the Amazon.

-Making a water filter using sand and charcoal. Just bring any number of commercially available filters, or chemical treatment like Potable Aqua, Aquamira, iodine, etc. Again, save the tricks for when your ship sinks and you end up on a deserted island.

-Not bringing any food or water. C'mon, really?

Bring on the downvotes if you think I sound like an asshole, but some of you people need to use some common sense when you venture outdoors.

I went at it with the chain saw and let him use a hatchet and loppers(sp?) for the smaller stuff. Got lots of good fire wood out of it, pecan cooks great. Taught him about all the safety involved and how to use different tools, then thought I could teach him how to build a simple shelter with the left over leafy branches. A couple hours have passed now and his mom comes out and sees that he got a bit sweaty and dirty, the way I spent many of my best years, and she starts railing on me about letting him get sweaty! I just stood there blank faced, wut? She was pissed that I let him cut wood, showed him how to build ""stupid forts"" and get dirty.

Here's a quick story about a 14 day survival challenge I just did... maybe someone might be interested.

So - I DID have a tent (after the first night... which was hell without it!), firestarter (vaseline impregnated cotton balls), knife with striker, and pristine, and a big pot for water, so it was mostly a food survival challenge. 

Location: A 500 acre uninhabited Island on the east coast of Canada.

Day 1 and day2 - Fast. I didn't eat any food. I just sat on a rock, drank water, and meditated. It was hell. I couldn't sleep because of the mosquitoes. I chose to include my tent in the challenge! haha. :) Also, the fast helped me a LOT, to realize that my hunger is not an emergency, and that I could harvest wild foods in a deliberate/gracious way. 

Day 3 - Great success, I gathered a bunch of plants (thistles stems, cattails, clover, rose petals) and a bunch of razor clams, bays clams and moon snails! One big meal in the evening - due mostly to when low tide occurred. 

Day 4 - Another great success, I gathered about 40 wild strawberries, 20 dewberries, some wild sasparilla, fireweed, clover, and another big feed of shellfish.

Day 5 - I'm starting to get a little cocky. I made a soup with a thickener from dried and ground inner fir bark/clover heads/cattail rootstock, + violets, clover (baby clover), thistle stems (peeled), and bullrush roots. It was a really filling meal, though long to chew. Then I felt like I was going to throw up right away. I laid on a big rock for about 10 minutes trying to decide what to do... then let myself throw up. I slept for 3 hours - woke up and ate 5 clams. (I think it was the un-specifically identified violets/or the 'toxic' red elderberry residue that got on my edibles that cause the vomiting.)

Day 5 - 10

I'm not very good at bouncing back from ""failure."" I stuck to strawberries/raspberries and clams for the next 5 days. Everything was DELICIOUS everytime I ate it.

Day 10 - 14

Fast - This was more of a endurance challenge than anything. It was surprisingly easy. The hardest part of every night trying to get to sleep. I'd lay awake for about 3 or 4 hours in slight to moderate pain... then wake up feeling great! Spend the day feeling great, and then be in pain, trying to get to sleep at night.

Day 14 - Back to civilization for poutine, a donair, and chicken wings... (""your eyes are hungrier than your stomach"" after fasting said the guys that ran the restaurant.) He was right.

Thanks for reading! Have fun learning everyone!
PS - this whole challenge was preceded by 26 days of solitude on the same Island. So I had lots of time for wandering slowly, find patches of edibles and identifying them. Also - the only other mammals on the island were two young foxes, one family of rabbits, and one seal - none of which I really wanted to kill, considering how few of them there were.

These food sources are both familiar to most folks and—across much of North America—abundant!

**Oaks.** All acorns (Quercus species) are edible, though some are a good bit sweeter than others. However, if you simply shell one of the seeds and take a bite, it's likely that you'll immediately be turned off by the very astringent, burning quality typical of most oak nuts. Fortunately, you can leach out the tannic acid that makes them bitter, and the easiest way to do so is to shell the acorns, smash them (you'll want to break them up but not pulverize them), wrap the pieces in a cloth, and place them in a stream for about half a day (longer, if they haven't lost their unpleasant taste by that time). Another method is to boil the nuts, changing the water frequently, until the flavor appeals to you.

Once they're leached, the acorns can be eaten raw, toasted, added to stews, or pounded fine and mixed with wild-grain flours to make bread. They're a valuable source of proteins and carbohydrates that's available from early fall until well into the next spring. And acorn sprouts can be prepared in the same ways as the nuts themselves, or—in the case of most white oak species—can be eaten right off the ground.

**Grasses.** Of the many grasses found in North America, all but a few are edible, with their seeds being the most palatable part. However, it's best to select grasses with large seed heads or clusters, since trying to collect small ones would likely be a waste of vital energy.

The seeds should be dried and parched, then winnowed to remove the chaff. The kernels can then be toasted and eaten plain, added to stews, or ground into flour for bread. Some of the best, safest, and most widely available grasses are crab, goose, foxtail, blue, rye, and orchard, plus wild oats and millet. 

**Pines.** Not all evergreens are edible, but the Pinus (pine) species are. These trees offer a wide assortment of munchables that are all easily collected and prepared. You can, for instance, add the pollen to stew as a thickener and to bread for flavor. And if you heat the cones gently by a fire until they open, the seeds can be easily extracted. These can then be eaten raw, parched and winnowed, or shelled and baked—depending on the species—and added to soup and bread. Use pine needles (along with those from spruce and hemlock . . . but be sure you're not gathering the needles from the red-berried, poisonous American yew, Taxus canadensis) to make a nourishing tea. You can also dry the inner bark of pine, spruce (Picea species), and hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) and add it to stew and bread.

**Cattails.** The cattail (either Typha latifolia or T. angustifolia) can be utilized at almost any time of the year, because at each stage of its life cycle it has a number of edible parts. For example, you can mash the root up in cold water to separate the soluble starches, and—once these have settled, and the fibers and water have been removed—add the material to stew or mix it with other wild flours to make bread. The new shoots can be eaten raw, and those up to a foot tall may be prepared like asparagus. The head, before it emerges, can be cooked and eaten like corn on the cob. Finally, it's possible to collect cattail pollen for use in soup or as a flour.

I was planning on doing some small game hunting, particularly squirrel. 
The most important thing I learned on this trip was to bring rifle cleaning equipment. I brought with me a Ruger 10/22 heavy barrel and some very low velocity .22 rounds. The action got so dirty it began to fail to fire and cost me quite a few meals. I decided to ditch the idea and invest my time into fishing instead.

Still sorting out how I feel about it maybe you can help.,116,20,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/1i0kpf/recently_had_a_survival_experience_still_sorting/,"For the past 40 days I was on the road touring the southern rockies. I need to state first of all that I am a very well experienced outdoors man with a number of major trips under my belt from everything to deep winter mountaineering and backpacking to mountain bike touring through the south west desert in the summer.  I have been doing this suff most of my life and have been ""around the block"". I have thoroughly studied wilderness medicine in the past and my outdoor leadership style is noted by an emphasis on preventative behavior over reactive and stress safety as the primary objective. 

The Rockies have a very stable weather pattern this time of year. In the morning the sun heats up the dry desert air and as it rises it hits the mountains, condenses and makes the afternoon rain storms. By night fall the suns energy has been removed from the system and the clouds disperse. This was the case for every night of my trip. Every night I watched the milky way come out and the summer triangle progress across the sky so I got in the habit of just sleeping out in my bag without a tent. Bivvied.

I was on Mt. Massive at 11,600' bivied out for a summit attempt in the early morning hours. In the alpine I had my tarp, 0degree down bag, and my closed cell foam z lite sol mattress. The afternoon progressed like above. The storms stopped and the stars came out and I fell asleep in the alpine. At 1am, however, I awoke to a flash of light. From over the ridge on Mt Oklahoma to the west a storm was coming in, but at night. The rain out in the rockies is rather light. It never hits too hard, so I figured I could just wrap up in my tarp and keep the bag dry. The lightning picked up and I realized that being exposed in the alpine was not a good idea. I remembered that where I had dinner that evening was in the tree line and well protected. It was the only clear location i knew of. The wind and rain start and I realize that my headlamp is dead ( I rarely used it on the trip considering sunrise lit the sky by 530am and you could still see at 10pm), so in the dark as I am rushing to get all my gear together. (Being bivied out a good bit of it was out of the pack and just strewn around. basically I had a huge bundle of gear in my arms) I start to make it to the tree line guided by flashes of lightning. It starts to pour, harder than any of the storms I had experienced out there yet. Probably at a rate of over 1in/hr and for a few moments it was hailing, pea size. Trying to keep my down bag wrapped up in my tarp and with out light to guide my way Im slipping and falling on rocks going on the steep down hill grade. By the time I fumble into the tree line and find my dinner site, I am soaked, and the temps are dropping and wind is picking up. IM shivering and I can't think of what to do next. Being unable to think actually makes me think about something ingrained in my memory, that im entering into hypothermia. (loss of mental faculties is a symptom of Hypothermia)

My down bag is soaked, my clothes are soaked (synthetics and wool base layers) and I can't see shit. I always carry in my cargo pocket of my hiking pants an emergency blanket. I pull it out and wrap myself. I then realize that I am underneath my bear bag so I try to untie the knot on the tree But I have no dexterity due to my progressing hypothermia and I cant see it the knot. I cut through the para chord with a rock dropping my food sack. In there I carry solid fuel cubes for my solid fuel stove. They work excellent as fires starters and I use them to make me a small fire in the rain (not that easy even with waterproof fires starters) I start to heat up cups of water and snack on food. Before I got the fire started I had quit shivering and was having trouble with mobility. This is stage 2 hypothermia and the point where it gets very very serious. By stage 3 your are unconscious and your body temp has dropped to only 90-92. 

I stay huddled like I am and notice that the thermal liner in my sleeping bag is completely dry so I put that over me and wait until I can see the slightest bit of light in the sky. When I can make out the ground I start pacing in circles until the sun rises over the ridge at 8am. I dry out my sleeping bag in 2 hours and try to nap (no humidity at 11,600'). When I get up I am in full blown flu symptoms. Nasal drip, sore throat, sinus headache, nausea and later I would get double ear infections and body soreness. 

I don't know how I feel about it. Was I stupid for not bringing my tent and trying to do a ""fast and light bivy""? even though I was aware of the stable weather patterns? I would later find out that the storm was a low pressure system moving though, hence its unique qualities. Being that I was out in the wilderness for the past 35 days I had no idea this was coming and there was no indication in the clouds that day (that I saw) I am mad at myself for not immediately realizing it was a serious situation and shrugging it off for a few min. I wasted precious time there and if I had immediately went into ""safety mode"" instead of being  ""it will be fine go back to sleep"" I would have never got soaked and probably kept my bag dry by making it to the tree line before the big down pour. BUT conversely I feel I did a great job at saving my life. Had I not taken the proper treatment steps, that I have gone over and over in practice, I very well could have been dead. 

thoughts? am I a dumb ass or a survivalist?

I was real scared and had almost no gear except for a bic lighter and a bottle of Goldschlager. I wasn't even wearing shoes. :-( I was at a river bar party with friends and was a little trashed and thought it would be a good idea to paddle down river about five miles to the reservoir to my car and drive home. The water was about 50 degrees and my clothes were soaked. I started violently shivering about an hour in and realized the gravity of the situation. I found an old campsite at the bank of the river and made a big bon fire. Even with the fire I was still in bad shape... I paddled out at first light and was floored for a day or two from hypothermia.

Got this beast whittled down to 30 gigs. This thing has gotten huge and much more comprehensive than I originally imagined. I ended up buying a nook simple touch as it was cheap, had great battery life and accepts SD cards up to 32 gigs. I will eventually buy a AA battery operated one but the only ones I have found so far seem like shit.  Anyway I have gotten this to a point where I am at least happy with it for now and have loaded it up. With a file this big I'm not sure what to do at this point. For the die hard people out there I guess you could send me a flash drive and I'd send it back? Anyone have any suggestions?


Well, Im sure you guys are well aware that no matter how much we learn, we just cant learn it all.  Im at a point where I feel pretty confident surviving the initial year of almost any disaster that could be thrown at me but what then?  I have a fair amount of print books to help me get going but shit, there are just so many subjects that I still need its mind boggling.  

This is what convinced me to start looking for ebooks, pdfs, websites etc to fill in the gaps.  It quickly became an obsession and a month in I now have almost 5 gigs of GOOD stuff.  I piggybacked off the work of a lot of other people, blogs and websites but it seems that these places just focused on gathering as much as they could and not refining it.  That is going to be my goal.  To created a concise yet detailed collection of everything we could need to rebuild civilization.  Not a small task.

Now that said there is no way I am going to get any help just by talking about it.  I mentioned I was working on this in another post and was encouraged to just upload what I got for now.  I encourage you to download this even in its semi-complete, semi-organized state because well lets face it, who knows when you will need it.  There is also a LOT of material that would be interesting and useful to read before any SHTF.

Anyways, the file is almost 5 gigs (started as 12 gigs but i have been culling the herd) and is entirely PDFs converted from various formats.  Eventually as this project nears completion I will be actually creating a few GIGANTIC PDFs based on sections and chapters and try to find some reliable and cheap hosting for it.  For now, feel free to download the parts, explore it, suggest sections that are missing, point out redundant information and please feel free to link other useful PDF's you think should be in this.

Best case scenario this is silly but it will be spreading some great education.  Worst case scenario in the hands of the right person this could save hundreds of lives.  My plan is to put this all on a kindle with a solar charger but i also plan on creating an even more trimmed down version and actually printing this stuff.  It wont be crazy expensive but I dont want to waste money, space and paper on shit that isnt needed.  If you have suggestions for the print version i would love to hear that too!

I don't want anyone to be discouraged that they didn't win. You all got to learn about a kick ass kit, and a kick ass website full of great tips and teachings, along with some how to's for knife making (I'll be trying out the 10 cent survival knife myself)! So keep posted, and keep an eye out for these contests guys. 

Now, on to who won...as you guys may recall, I ended up giving out two knives from my knife contest. Well, since this came down to being so difficult to decide, I've picked two people to win this as well. Each will get a fully loaded, brand new, M40 Survival Kit!

And our winners are.... ***gritsngravy729***, and ***CDBSB***!!! Give it up for these guys, folks, and like I said, be watching out for more giveaways to come!

~~Hey guys, some of you might recall me from the Knifeit giveaway [here.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/knives/comments/psfmd/giving_away_a_bhk_woodsman_pro/) I'm hosting yet another giveaway of a product I truly find outstanding. The M40 [Survival] (http://www.m4040.com/Survival/Survival%20Kit.htm) kit! Check it out, see what comes in it, and take it from me, this is one of the best kits out there. No, you won't find a piece of hard candy and a credit card sized 'survival card,' but you WILL find most of the things one would need to make it home safe. I've got one of these kits myself, and I have to say, I'm beyond impressed. The over all quality really is incredible.~~

~~""Gee Moose, how do I win,"" you ask? Well it's quite simple my bush-craft buddies. Simply write up an email explaining why you want/deserve this awesome kit, what you intend to do with it, etc., and send that email over to Moose3040@gmail.com. I'll reply to you, confirming I got it, and I'll announce a winner in 5 days.~~ 

~~For you naysayers out there, no, I'm not getting paid, or any special treatment from M40 for this contest. I'm a guy that loves the survival/bush-craft world, and wants to share a product that I think we should have. If nothing else, I'm glad I can turn some people's direction the the M40 Survival [Pages](http://www.m4040.com/Survival/Survival.htm)~~

~~I look forward to your submissions!~~

~~***EDIT*** Guys, I don't do this for ""upvotes,"" or anything of the like. I'm a simple guy with a love for things like survival, bush craft, etc.. With that being said, don't downvote this in some attempt to increase your chances of people not seeing this and thus not making a submission. I want people to see this kit, not only to try and win it, but to direct their attention to M40's awesome survival site. So, I'm not saying upvote it. But I am saying, don't downvote it away. Thanks guys.~~

~~***Second Edit*** Hey guys, sorry if my replies are taking a while. I actually had to go straight to the DMV after posting this, so I was doing my best to reply via mobile email. I've been getting a LOT of submissions (which I love), so if I haven't replied to you yet, don't worry!

1339551581.0,76,self.Survival,uz0wb,"No, you SHOULD attempt CPR, even in remote areas with no ability to evacuate.",88,12,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/uz0wb/no_you_should_attempt_cpr_even_in_remote_areas/,"Some really bad advice was given yesterday regarding CPR. To be clear, it is a form of resuscitation, and it does work sometimes without advanced medical care. [Here](http://www.wemsi.org/specific.html) is a good link regarding wilderness first aid.

Assuming society hasn't collapsed, you should attempt CPR for at least half an hour unless:

* Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS; the paramedics) are over one hour away.
* Cardiac arrest is due to trauma, such as a fall from somewhere high.
* A drowning victim has been immersed in water for more than one hour.
* The victim has been dead for a long time, evidenced by rigor mortis or core temperature equal to the ambient temperature
* The person is very dead, meaning they have been decapitated, etc.

All of that said, there are times when basic cardiac life support (BLS; CPR and rescue breathhing) is likely to resuscitate a person. Even if society has collapsed, or SHTF, CPR should be attempted, even continued for over one hour if:

* Drowning where immersion has lasted less than one hour. (hypothermia will slow metabolism and allow for resuscitation after long periods of arrest.
* Arrest due to hypothermia.
* Lightning strike or other electric shock has caused arrest. (In this case you will almost always resuscitate.)

Courtesy of Alexander_X_Blake, I'd like to add a few:

* On all children and infants.
* Arrest due to choking or other respiratory failure.
* Arrest due to snake bite or other venom.


With all of that said, I think it is important to attempt CPR for at least half an hour on anyone, as there is a small chance of spontaneous resuscitation. This is especially true for children, who are much more likely to resuscitate as heart failure is rarely a cause for their arrest.

So apparently I missed my cake day. Here's a post to make up for it; I present to you my survival tin. There are many others like it but this one is mine. Parts sourced and kit assembled by yours truly.

While a collection of small, fiddly items that rely on fine and complex motor skills to use might not be the best thing to have in a survival scenario, the advantage of the survival tin is that it goes in your pocket and stays there. If you were to somehow get separated from your main kit it has a handful of useful items that can be really handy in a pinch. It is **not**  a substitute for proper knowledge, training and a full sized kit. 

The purpose of putting this kit together was not to foster some false sense of security or provide the misguided belief that, by virtue of having it, I am somehow safe in the wilderness. Rather, its purpose was to research what components would go into one and maybe learn a thing or two along the way.


For the sake of space and efficiency I tried to pick items that would serve multiple purposes or serve one purpose very well. As such it's a little difficult to list the item categorically. See annotations at the bottom of subsections.

**[Container](http://imgur.com/a/xMe1Q#1):**

I think the tin itself is some type of oversized candy tin. Not sure who manufactures it. I got it for $2 from my survival instructor. Measurements are: Length: 4 1/4"" Width: 3 1/8"" Depth: 1""

[Here's a picture of it alongside a blackberry bold for size comparison](http://imgur.com/a/xMe1Q#0). 


I covered the tin with vinyl [pocket survival stickers](http://www.bestglide.com/survival_kit_stickers.html) from BestGlide.com.
Survival scenarios can decrease or severely impair cognitive capabilities (read - they make you stupid) so it's always handy to have stuff written down. Taking the time to sit down and read something can also do wonders to lowering your heart rate if you're overly excited.


Here's the front of the tin with a list of [survival priorities](http://imgur.com/a/xMe1Q#2). Back with diagrams of [Ground to Air Signals](http://imgur.com/a/xMe1Q#3). Inside lid with [Morse code](http://imgur.com/a/xMe1Q#4). Inside bottom with very basic [instructions for dealing with severe bleeding and shock](http://imgur.com/a/xMe1Q#5). I've also included a set of [generic survival instructions](http://imgur.com/a/xMe1Q#6) that came out of an Adventure medical first aid kit. Partly because they are moderately useful but mostly because they have ""Don't panic"" written on them in big friendly letters.


**[Sharps and cutting implements](http://imgur.com/a/xMe1Q#7):**

* [Adventure pocket spiral wire saw](http://www.bestglide.com/pocket_wire_saw.html). Pretty self explanatory. Better than nothing. 
* Piece of hacksaw sharpened on a grinder into a blade. Not the best cutting implement but useful for rough jobs. Has lanyard hole.
* Piece of hacksaw to use as firesteel striker. I still had some hacksaw left along with room in the kit and didn't relish the idea of accidentally cutting my hand open by trying to use the bladed hacksaw as a striker.
* 3 scalpel blades. For finer work, requiring a sharper blade, like dressing game or for medical use (digging splinters out of my hand).


**[Signaling and navigation](http://imgur.com/a/xMe1Q#8)**

* [2 x 3 Signal Mirror Glass, Signal MIL-M-18371E Type 1](http://www.bestglide.com/military_glass_signal_mirror.html). Selected after reading [this fine article](http://www.equipped.com/phony_signal_mirrors.htm). Yes, this is real glass and it is heavier/bulkier than most plastic mirrors. 
I shopped around a bit prior to buying this and most of the signal mirrors I saw were either sticker based or bendy, scratchy plastic. One way to immediately know if a signal mirror is junk was by holding it out at arms length and trying to see my reflection. If you can't see your reflection that means that even at arms length light is bouncing off in every direction (or you're in the dark). If a surface can't accurately reflect light at arms length imagine what it would do over a larger distance. I figured that if this was something I was going to entrust my life to I should probably get a proper one. As always, instructions are key.
* Slim rescue howler whistle from the aforementioned Adventure Medical first aid kit. You can only scream and shout so much until your voice gives out. You can blow on a whistle all day.
* 25mm liquid damped button compass from Firesteel.com (sadly, no longer available). Not really a navigation tool per-say but good enough to keep me from walking around in circles if lost.
* [Photon Micro light - X light](http://www.bestglide.com/photon_xlight_microlight.html). This thing is pretty neat. It has adjustable brightness and 5 Safety beacons: Slow - Medium - Fast (strobe) - SOS - Morse Code.


**[Fishing/hunting](http://imgur.com/a/xMe1Q#9)**

* 20ft of snare wire. This is really just green gardening wire I got from home depot.
* 40ft of mono-filament fishing line (30lb test I think). 
* 8 Medium sized fishing hooks.
* 8 Small fishing hooks.
* 3 split shot lead sinkers.

The hooks and sinkers are stored in a small plastic tube to prevent injury. 


**[First aid (micro snivel-kit)](http://imgur.com/a/xMe1Q#10)**

* Large, latex free, adhesive medical strip.
* 3 regular sized, latex free, adhesive medical strips.
* 4 Butterfly sutures. Good for keeping cuts closed.
* 2 O.B tampons. Not the best wound dressing but better than nothing. Supposedly useful for puncture wounds.
* Double antibiotic ointment. Disinfectant.
* Tincture of Iodine 2%. Disinfectant in a [breath freshener drop bottle.](http://sweetbreath.com/products/drops.html?SID=ftfpn99n6uk75mgeb04l341fn3)
* Tweezers.
* Safety pins.

The O.B tampons contain a lot of cotton. They can be fluffed up and combined with the antibiotic ointment to make a petroleum jelly+cotton fire starter. They'll ignite well enough on their own though. All bandage casings are flammable as are the bandages themselves. The Iodine pulls double duty for chemical water disinfection. Instructions are on the bottle. 5 drops per 32oz or 1 liter. The bottle holds 120 drops. Good for disinfecting somewhere between 5-6 gallons of water. Safety pins and tweezers are multi-use items.


**[Fire](http://imgur.com/a/xMe1Q#11)**

* [Firesteel.com ranger](http://firesteel.com/FireSteel-Ranger) with lanyard cap. Makes big nice sparks.
* Mini bic lighter. Because fire making doesn't have to be difficult.
* 1.5"" candle stub. For when I need to easily transfer a flame or just a little bit of light.
* [Fresnel lens magnifying card](http://www.bestglide.com/fresnel_lens_firestarter.html). Also useful for reading tiny print survival instructions.
* Some more cotton (I actually found some free space in the tin).


**[Trojan non-lubricated condom for water carrying](http://imgur.com/a/xMe1Q#12).** Hardly ideal but the only thing that would fit.

**[Cordage and misc](http://imgur.com/a/xMe1Q#13)**

* Nylon lanyard string. Whistle, mirror, flashlight, firesteel and anything else that has a lanyard hole on it goes on this when the kit is deployed.
* 3ft of obnoxiously bright yellow duct tape (The stuff dreams are made of). A million uses, also flammable.
* 30ft of dental floss. Makes for surprisingly strong cordage. It's susceptible to abrasion though so it's stored in small zip lock bag. Also, you can floss with it.
* 5 sewing needles, 3 with thread already on them. No, I don't intend to use these as sutures and neither should you.
* Handful of rubber bands. Useful for keeping stuff stuck to the tin. Rubber bands burn very well. Various other uses.


**[Entire content of tin](http://imgur.com/a/xMe1Q#14).** You wouldn't believe this all fits in there, would you?

But it [does!](http://imgur.com/a/xMe1Q#15). I should move to Tokyo and become an Architect. Note that one of the wire saw rings is [placed over the power button](http://imgur.com/a/xMe1Q#16) of the flash light to prevent it from accidentally being switched on and killing the battery. That would suck.


[Instructions are folded in with the Fresnel lens (so you can read the tiny print) and go on top of everything else](http://imgur.com/a/xMe1Q#17). It would have been easier to put them on the bottom with the bandages but I wanted the instructions to be the first thing someone sees when opening the kit. Hopefully taking a couple of minute to read the instructions would have a calming effect. And yes, I can actually [get the tin to close](http://imgur.com/a/xMe1Q#18) with everything in it.


The Snare wire and rubber bands go on the [outside of the tin](http://imgur.com/a/xMe1Q#19). To waterproof and also have something for path marking I sealed the tin with about 6ft of [safety-orange electrical tape]. Normally I'd use more tape but I have to demo this kit in a week and I didn't want to waste too much tape.


It should be noted that this tin has a companion kit that goes in my other pocket but it's too late to take pictures of it right now.
The kit is contained inside the packaging of an [SOL 2 person survival blanket](http://www.adventuremedicalkits.com/product.php?catname=Shelter&amp;prodname=SOL%20Survival%20Blanket&amp;product=147) and contains the survival blanket, more duct tape + safety pins (used to make grommets on the corners of the survival blanket), a single use rain poncho, a DEET wipe, 1 liter ziplock bag for water storage, some surveyor tape (for trail marking) and some home made tinder fuzz in water tight container.

That's it. Hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed building the kit.


**TL;DR** - I have way too much free time on my hands.

This allows you to carry appropriate amounts of polysporin and not a large tube. On top of having antiseptic lotion you also have a great fire starting assistant; combined with gauze or cotton balls it acts exactly like Vaseline. I also took this technique and applied it to making refills for my zippo which is my go-to fire starter. 
I can't find the original blog where I found this idea so I can't link you too it for instructions on how to do this however if enough people want them I can put up my own instructions.

1329438177.0,62,self.Survival,pt3vv,Some lessons I learned on a winter outing,73,11,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/pt3vv/some_lessons_i_learned_on_a_winter_outing/,"Hey everyone, I recently went out for some back country camping in what will probably be the coldest weekend of the year up here. I brought back some pretty valuable lessons that I thought I would share with everyone :)

First off, I went to a wilderness area in South-Central Ontario called the Kawartha Lakes. There is a new provincial park there that still hasn't been setup so it's a nice place to go without tons of tourists. [Map](http://g.co/maps/gcy7x). The weather was pretty chilly and there was a mild amount of snowfall. I believe it got to -13C (9F) that night, which to those Southerners out there is too cold to have any exposed skin while you're sleeping.

Now for some notes:

&gt;Hiking is a dream if you don't sweat. Do not sweat.

Hiking in that weather was great, and if you wear layers it means you can go at a pretty good clip without sweating, shedding layers as you go.

&gt;Batteries don't like the cold. 

My batteries died in my gps, which was not a big deal since I only use it for performance metrics. What really sucked was the batteries in my headlamp died and didn't come back, even after warming it up. I didn't have a working backup either since my penlight died on me as well. I was left with a crappy [tealight candle lantern](http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/HikingCamping/Lighting/Lanterns/CandleLPG/PRD~5025-618/uco-micro-candle-lantern.jsp), which was my first-time using it, and believe me there was no-where near enough light to see by. If you are using batteries, make sure to keep backups and to keep those backups warm!

&gt;Bring extra cordage.

There was snow, but not enough to use dead-man anchors or snow stakes. I also happened to be in a very rocky area which meant I didn't have any bare patches of dirt to drive stakes into. The combination meant I had to forgo stakes and use in situ anchors to tie the tent down to. I ended up putting the tent in between a bunch of small spruce trees and using some extra paracord to tie the stake-loops to the base of the trees. It ended up working really well, but you need to always have extra rope with you!

&gt; Fires aren't guaranteed

We had swings of cold and warm weather over a period of several weeks, which meant everything up there was covered in ice. There was lots of dead fall everywhere, so I had lots of fuel, but it was icy and wet when thawed. After taking too long to setup my tent (took me a while to find a spot with the right arrangement of trees) I only had about 30min to gather wood and get a cooking fire going before darkness kicked in. This could be the other lesson:

&gt;Leave yourself more time then you expect

 I have a crappy [Coghlan Sierra saw](http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/6/Tools/CuttingChopping/AxesHatchetsBowsaws/PRD~0760067P/Coghlan%27s+Sierra+Folding+Saw.jsp?locale=en) (probably the best thing coghlan makes) that made quick work of the dead fall, however the cold meant my butane jet lighter refused to work. I resorted to some waterproof matches that worked great, but was pretty ticked at my lighter. Another lesson:

&gt;Don't rely on any single point of failure, bring backup firestarters

I eventually got the tinder started (thank god for birch trees :) ) but after fiddling with the fire trying to dry out the wet stuff the sun began to set. This is when I found out I only had that tealight to aid in my cooking, so I gave up and used my [gas stove](http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/HikingCamping/StovesFuel/Stoves/PRD~4004-857/msr-whisperlite-stove.jsp). That stove is awesome, and works even in the coldest of weather, but without it I would have taken a lot longer to boil my water. The longer I took the colder it got, so it was a pretty easy call.

&gt;Boil water, put it in a bottle, put the bottle in a sock/toque, and put that in your sleeping bag.

Do it! It makes getting out of your snowpants and into the nice warm bag soooooo much easier. And then you have liquid water for the next morning's meal.

&gt;Go to sleep earlier the night before your trip, so you are accustomed to it

When I went to bed at 7:30 I was pretty tired from the hike, but I couldn't sleep. It was just too damn early! When you have 12hours of darkness you have to go to bed earlier than you usually do, and it becomes hard to sleep.

&gt;Vapour barriers work

Plastic bags around my feet (next to the skin), then wooly socks on top of those. I also had a down vest shoved in the bottom of my sleeping bag, that hot water bottle between my legs, and my gortex jacket on top of the bottom part of the bag (to stop moisture from the tent roof). My feet sweat a ton and it was the first time I tried this, but man did it ever work wonderfully. My feet were damp in the morning but they were very hot. When you're ready to go make sure you have towel to dry them off on. I would not recommend hiking with vapour barriers, wet clammy skin gets soft and weak.

&gt;Bring a [towel](http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/HikingCamping/HealthSafety/BathProducts/PRD~5025-400/msr-packtowl-ultralite-towel.jsp).

Bonus points if you put a 42 on it. Towels are great, particularly in the winter where liquid water will freeze on anything if you leave it out too long, so wipe it off before that happens.

&gt;Setup your cookset close to your tent for easy morning meals

I had an excellent, non-shivering sleep, and when I woke up the next morning I had breakfast in bed. I setup my stove just outside my tent so when I woke up I could stay in my sleeping bag while I boiled some water. This kept me nice and toasty and allowed me to cook while I cleaned up my tent. Also I practice [freezer-bag cooking](http://www.trailcooking.com/), which is essentially a way to limit the amount of stuff I have to clean.

Well, this is way longer than expected but I figured this audience would appreciate my experiences. Not exactly a 'survival' setting but could have very easily become one! Also something awesome: I got a [chickadee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_%28bird%29) to land on my shoulder, which really made my day.

If you have any comments/suggestions I'm all ears, or I guess eyes in this situation...

1311850310.0,62,self.Survival,j22l3,All paracord bracelets I saw sucked. So I am making them better.,75,13,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/j22l3/all_paracord_bracelets_i_saw_sucked_so_i_am/,"I am going camping next week and had some money in my Paypal Account ($12) so I decided I wanted to get a ""survival bracelet"" just because I thought it would be a nice piece of kit to have handy.  
  
I found tons of them online but realised that almost all of them sucked. The standard cobra weave takes forever to unravel as demonstrated by [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXwdmO2iqDQ) video.   
  
Most of them would only be 8 feet long when unraveled. Well let me show you [my first three prototypes](http://imgur.com/Yp46O).   
  
I should clarify from the notes about my large wrists/hands I have what my friends lovingly refer to as [shrek hands](http://imgur.com/a/Kf4GC/all).  
  
The one I was modeling with my fat hands is slightly rounded and bulky, this can be easily fixed to make it more flat by adjusting the weave.  
   
My thoughts on pricing were:     
$6 for up to 15 ft    
$10 for 15 ft to 30ft   
$15 for 30 to 40     
$20 for up to 50     
  
I should clarify that the ft measurements are the length of cord not the bracelet.  
  
Keep in mind the tighter the weave the shorter the length of the end product. So if you want a sling or strap for a dufflebag in the tighter weave it will be about half the width and much longer and could easily be 100+ft of cord which is a pain in my ass but if you've got the caps I will make whatever you want.  
   
I only had the one set of plastic clips and I plan on purchasing some metal clips ([like these](http://www.bigdweb.com/prodinfo.asp?number=NPST)) in the future but for right now the plastic ones are first come first serve and I would gladly provide either a built in paracord clasp like the ones pictured or leave an easy place to attach your own clasp if you have one     
  
If you are interested I can customize just about anything you want, Realize though that my supplies are limited right now so a rifle sling is not something I can pull off and until I get a sale or two I will only have the red color available. If I get one or two people who want to buy these from me I will post them on etsy. If you have a request feel free to message me about it and I will let you know what I can do for you.
  
The point behind all of this is I was thinking about selling these but without gauging interest ahead of time it would be difficult to cut through all the noise generated by all of the shit that people try to sell under the name ""survival bracelet"". I am too broke to be willing to invest in the materials without someone buying what I have or being willing to wait after paying so I could make a custom order. I got the paracord using the last of my PP money and the clips from a backpack. If enough people want to buy these it would help me to get a computer for school as the loans I just got approved for  were just enough to cover the tuition and most of the cost of books. I plan on cross posting this to a few different subreddits like Zombies, Guns, Assistance, really anywhere that someone *might* be interested.  
  
While I mentioned I am doing this to get money for school I want to clarify I don't need donations, I have a roof over my head and food in the fridge I just want to get my hands on some breathing room money. If you want, feel free to check my history but be warned I comment on and submit some nsfw content. I have been on reddit for about 2 years now and would even be willing to show one of my older novelty accounts to prove it if so desired.  
  
**Edit**: I am a bit of a night owl so while many of you may just be starting your day I am about to crash. I will gladly answer any questions that accumulate when I wake up.
   
**edit 2** I am awake and have added price info. Also a few people have asked how to make them. The first in the picture is just a hand tied knot the second is called a double half stitch and the tights weave is a single stitch the second and third are both crocheted. I was thinking about making a YouTube video to show people how To make them. If you know how to crochet and want to do it yourself I used a K size hook or 6.5mm for you metric folks.

One is a Rush 72, the other a Rush 12. I keep one in my car, ready for an 'extended' situation. The other is more of an EDC bag. However I have a standardised group of 10 items that are in both. I'm aiming to make a third pack to leave at my desk/in my house.

I highly recommend this for several reasons. a) You have duplicates of essentials items if need be. b) If you buy identical products you will understand that part of your pack very well. c) Twice the chance you'll be able to access essentials in an emergency.

So the *TEN ESSENTIALS* I have in both packs (soon to be third) are (in no order):

1. **KNIFE** - Fallkniven S1 in one pack, and Becker BK7 in the other. Planning on replacing both with ESEE 5.

2. **FIRE** - 2 x Bic Lighter + Fire steel. So little space, so much reliability and safety, cheap as dirt to. In my extended pack, I have a pack of 10 lighters.

3. **WATER BOTTLE** - Metal, able to boil in.

4. **FLASHLIGHT** - Currently have POS flashlights. Aiming on replacing with Nitecore MT1A + 4 batteries

5. **COMPASS** - I bought 2 military prismatics. They're sturdy as balls and reliable.

6. **CORDAGE** - 50ft OD 550 Paracord. 

7. **SHELTER/PROTECTION** - I keep UST bivvy bags in each kit + a space blanket 

8. **SIGNALLING** - Stainless signal mirror + signal whistle. Cheap, safe.

9. **MRE/WATER** - I leave a few protein bars + some trail mix in each kit. I fill the stainless bottle with water. This is just my essentials box, the packs have additional water + food.

10. **FIRST AID KIT** - Actually used up both of mine recently. Need to replace. If anyone can recommend a good small/mid size kit, that'd be great!

**SURVIVAL MANUAL** - Print or buy a bunch of these. Leave one in your bathroom, read it and memorise it. Leave one in each pack. Leave one in your car. Leave one at work. Leave one on your desk. So much critical knowledge for absolutely minimal cost. I don't even consider this part of an essential *kit*, it's essential knowledge.

Most importantly, the vast majority of my fire kit.  I had a bic lighter, but it was low on fluid, and pretty much everything was damp (snow covered everything).  I had left my tinder, quicktinder pieces, stormproof matches, and extra lighters in a waterproof case at home.  Luckily, I always keep my phero rod on my knife sheath.  It was getting dark, so I mentally went through my pack to see what might make a good ignition source as I made feather sticks and thin shavings of the driest wood I could find.  Probably my most extensive piece of kit is my medkit, so I opened it and got out one alcohol prep swab.  I cut it into strips with my leatherman scissors, and placed it in the center of my tinder bundle.  I managed to get this to catch with the firesteel, and blew the tinder bundle to flames.  It was still a good 45 minutes of careful tending before we had a good fire, but it worked!  I should mention, I had 3 people with me (one friend, two hikers I met on the AT), and none of them had hoped to get a fire going, so they were very thankful.  Just another example of, ""dont get mad, get creative.""  Thanks guys for all the advice and lessons I've learned from you all; I am still a green hand at all this but you've helped me immensely.

   This just popped into my head yesterday while I was about to throw out this piece of fishing line.   (this is 20lb braided spiderwire from my saltwater reel)
  A 6-8ft piece of line could have endless uses, from everyday macguiver type fixes, to true survival/emergency situations.

I just tied it around the thumb hole to start, leaving a few inches of excess on the shirt side. Then wrapped the long side around the base of the blade. At the end I tied the end of the long side off to the extra short side remnant, then cut off the tails. 
  The bigest downside to this would be removing the line when needed. In a non survival situation, I'm sure you could find another knife, or scissors to cut the line loose. In a survival situation, you would have to improvise something to cut it loose. Maybe an aluminum can, or just rubbing it on a rock until the outermost wrap frayed.

  I'd love to hear anyone else's ideas for similar upgrades or improvements to my idea. Remember, this is not in a bug out bag. This is a normal everyday pocket knife.",,False,,t5_2qh7j,False,,,True,t3_xo9tt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/xo9tt/simple_addition_to_everyday_carry_knife/,

I'm preparing for a 7 day survival crucible in an undisclosed location. I'm going to be dropped with about a half days worth of food, and 2 pints of water. I have checkpoints that I have to hit, so while carrying a 70lb ruck i'll have to hump about 12-15 klicks a day. I'll be carrying a lot of gear that i'll be field testing, everything from your basic fixed blade to a forward osmosis kit. I'll be using a plethora of techniques for the climate and food procurement ranging from simple snares to natural water poisoning (not real poison, natural crushed roots that act as an oxygen inhibitor in gills of fish) and will be making a breakdown of what gear makes the cut, what techniques are worth the effort, and what important things to keep in mind as your body breaks down and your mind flips on you. 

To kick it up a notch, ~~I will be actively pursued~~, my infil is expected, but location unknown so there will be an active search for me. It is a very large area however.  

I will update this thread when and if I survive (kidding), and share everything I can (and allowed) on the different gear I used, how they handled under extreme stress, and what techniques were paramount. Ill be doing the same for other extreme climates sometime in the future and will do the same with them. 

What I am asking of you, r/survival, is for a list of what techniques you will like for me to test, what gear you will want to know the most about, and any other general questions or things you will like for me to kind of do you for! 

Thanks r/survival, I'm looking forward to any and all questions/discussions!

**EDIT:** Keep the questions coming, I'm pretty busy during the day, but will reply to everyones posts in the evening.

**EDIT:** I understand that some of you think this is stupid, and I respect your opinion, this is my profession and what I train, have trained, and continue to develop to do. I'm not James Bond or some secret agent, but some of the things that I do and things that we use I'm just not allowed to talk about in an unsecured environment. What I am allowed to share I am willing to with this sub, some of you will continue to be condescending, it's ok, my internet feelings are fine. 

My plan was/is for this thread to be a constructive one with something for everyone to take from, or even teach me as i believe you can learn from everyone. It is not intended to be a dick sizing contest.

I really like messing around with little survival tins. You can fit a ton of crap in there that would actually be useful in a variety of situations. But one of my goals when camping and hiking (the main topic of this post) is to enjoy myself, and one of the easiest ways to reach that goal is to drastically reduce your pack weight. As long as you do it in a way that's still comfortable (something many ultra-lighters forget) you can start to develop a really useful working kit. Changing up my survival tin and instead including items that I actually can use is one step in reducing the items in, and the weight of, my pack.

So to make it so my 'survival' items were actually used on a day-to-day basis they cannot be in a tin. Any sort of small bag or pouch would work, but I like using a hip-pack (fanny-pack, whatever you want to call it). I don't wear it around my waist (it's uncomfortable when you have a pack on) so I actually wear it kinda like a shoulder bag or [bandolier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandolier). This allows me to get at it when I'm hiking and also to bring it with me on shorter hikes after I've set up camp. Generally I don't leave my camp without it. Never leave your camp without your survival tin/pouch/bag!

OK, now for the contents, based on pictures from this album:

 * [Orange Mora knife with firesteel](http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/HikingCamping/KnivesTools/MultiBladeKnives/PRD~5028-388/light-my-fire-swedish-fireknife.jsp). Really nice knife, but kinda annoying for carving because the back of the blade has sharp angles that cut up your thumb.

 * Lots of [2mm static line](http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/Climbing/RopesCordage/StaticRopeCord/PRD~0403-071/mammut-2mm-static-cord.jsp)

 * Tinderbox w/
  * Wire saw and split rings
  * Bees wax firestarters
  * Coghlan's fire stick things
 * Map of the area in waterpoof bag

And then around my neck I have a whistle, compass, thermometer, magnifying glass combo. It's kinda cheaply made but works well enough.

I sometimes include my little survival tin in that hip-pack, or otherwise have it in my pocket or even in my main pack. From [image 5](http://i.imgur.com/acl0j.jpg):

Personally, I think the idea of buying all sorts of gear for an emergency survival situation is kind of pointless unless you have it with you 100% of the time, everywhere you go, which is why I'm trying to focus on EDC survival.

I'm sure I'm not alone in the fact that I carry a knife (or something similar) with me everyday no matter where I go, but I've been looking for something more well-rounded with varied uses.  This led me to a couple options: Leatherman (multi-) tool or a Swiss Army Knife.  I'm sure there are others, but these are what I know and am familiar with.

In the end, I chose the [Leatherman Wingman](http://www.leatherman.com/product/Wingman) because it was fairly inexpensive ($30), but I knew I could trust it.  I chose it mainly because it was heavier duty with all the same basic tools as a SAK of the same price, but it also functioned as pliers and wire cutters/strippers.  Unfortunately, as I did just purchase it, I've yet to use it for any real purpose, so I can't really give a review.

Sportfishing-like: line, reel, bobbers, weights, hooks... standing there. that's not how you fish if you're trying to survive/thrive.

active fishing is for the birds. 

passive fishing is where it's at.

[(purchase a gill net)](http://www.bestglide.com/deluxe_gill_net.html)

[(DIY a Gillnet)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Knfl90aSzM)

gill nets are how you fish if you need to eat. frees you up to do other things. learning to make them out of para-cord core string is a good idea.

other methods of passive fishing.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_weir bit more time and labor intensive, but good to know for a postcollapse scenario.

having a hard time finding web info on fishing gorges. anyways they look like [this](http://www.southwestguidebooks.com/images/primitive_images/gorges.jpg) really simple construction. set out a few lines (10-20) of these tied to a rock for a sinker. tie the other end to a tree, check it in the morning. [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waLFiNmWmx0) is a video of my [main man Ray](http://cpink.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/ray.jpg) using variation on this technique(hawthorne barb) very successfully.

active fishing, bobbers and hooks and such is for hobby sport. serious food acquisition in a survival situation should be effortless. Active fishing/hunting wastes time you could be spending building better shelters, collecting firewood/natural materials... you get the idea? traps. lots of traps. let the food come to you.

1318340249.0,47,self.Survival,l898g,My cowardly retreat from the woods.  Need your input.,55,8,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/l898g/my_cowardly_retreat_from_the_woods_need_your_input/,"I was born and raised in the suburbs, and have lived there my whole life.  Recently I have realized the virtue of wilderness survival skills and have started to try and learn.  I've been camping with my wife a few times, mostly at those kind of places where you park your car right at the site, but once at a spot where you had to hike half a mile to the site.  I have been reading a lot on various bushcraft topics.  Everything from fishing, to edible plants, fire building, and other topics.  I've been learning whatever I can, with the ultimate goal of being able to head out into the wilderness without gear and survive for as long as I want.

Last weekend, I decided to put my skills to the test.  I headed out to a National Forest, hiked for most of the day, then set up camp as it started to get dark.  I was using a hammock and tarp for the first time, in an effort to cut down on the weight of my pack (which is way to heavy right now).  This was also my first time out by myself.

As the sun went down, I started getting more and more nervous.  When there was barely any light left in the sky, I tore down my tarp and hammock in a hurry, and fled back to my car.  (I had decided to head back and camp closer to the car because my feat and legs were killing me after the hike and I wasn't sure how much hiking I'd be able to do in the morning.  Pack is still to heavy, even with tarp/hammock.)  I called a friend and asked if I could crash at his place, my trip ending in failure.

This is the first time I can think of in my adult life where I let an emotion (fear) override my rational brain, and so I am horribly conflicted about what happened.  It seems there are two possibilities: 

1) I need to just man up and be more brave.  
2) What I was doing was actually dangerous and my fear was not irrational

I've never liked the idea of putting my life into the hands of Fate.  I drive defensively, always assuming other drivers are going to do something stupid or crazy.  I'm well trained in martial arts.  I'm armed.  I lock my doors at night.  However, out there in the woods, I was completely vulnerable.  Hanging there in my tarp, I wouldn't have known a bear was going to attack me until it was actually happening.  Or if some crazy Deliverance redneck wanted to knife me, I'd have zero way to stop it while asleep.  I'm perfectly fine walking around in the middle of nowhere.  It's sleeping with zero protection that scares me.

Any advice or thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated.  Have you ever slept in nothing but a hammock, by yourself in the middle of nowhere?  Do you think it's safe?

tl;dr: I got scared sleeping in a hammock in the middle of nowhere by myself.  Was that irrational?

Edit:  Thanks for all the comments guys.  I am going to educate myself on bears (I've bought a couple of books), and take it a little slower.

Also, [proof that bears love hammocks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIpGFE_LKiE&amp;feature=related) and would kill me in an instant to get to mine!

For several months now, I've just been practicing every day.  I've been using things like:  Slingshot, Rock-Sling, Staff-Sling, Sling-Bow, Boomerang, Blowgun, Rabbit Stick, Spear, and of course - simply throwing rocks.  

My only successes are 1 squirrel kill with a Cold Steel Boomerang (not a returner, by the way).  And several trout kills with blowgun, spear, and sling-bow.  

Today I found out that these are ALL ILLEGAL METHODS OF HUNTING IN VA.

I just cannot wrap my head around that.  Is the reasoning for this just ""Since we cannot regulate these weapons, they will be made illegal for hunting""?  I would think that the ""Bureau of Wildlife"" (the people who made the laws), would want to give wildlife a chance - not completely remove it.  How can it be okay to hunt with a high-powered rifle, but not with a spear?  

I just really wanted to rant for a moment, but I'd also like to hear some reasoning.  The weapons themselves aren't illegal - but using them for any form of hunting or fishing IS illegal.  So I am allowed to go out and practice with it, but if they catch me with a fresh kill, I'm boned :/.

Someone please enlighten me?

1355605489.0,41,self.Survival,14wrif,[Suggestion]  Render your own tallow and make animal-fat candles.  Survival candle doubles as emergency ration.,55,14,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/14wrif/suggestion_render_your_own_tallow_and_make/,"I don't know if any of you have tried this before, or indeed if this suggestion has already been posted.  I just discovered this subreddit, and I'm hoping that some of you may find this useful.  Without further ado, I'll jump in:

##Caveats

Before candles were made with bee's wax, they were made with animal fat.  Animal fat candles burn very well, but have a few quirks worth noting.

First, they have a bit of a smell and they produce more smoke than paraffin or bee's wax.  This usually isn't an issue unless you're planning to use them indoors, and can be mitigated by properly rendering your tallow (see below).

The second quirk has to do with the melting point of animal fats.  Animal fat melts slightly above room temperature, so your candle will not be a free-standing birthday candle.  For a survival candle, this is largely a non-issue.  We'll just be sticking the tallow in a suitable container and popping in a wick.

##Step 1:  Rendering the Tallow from Raw Animal Fat

Rendering tallow is trivial.  Don't overthink it.  The difference between good and bad tallow is the attention paid to detail, but even so, it's not particularly time-consuming.

####Materials

- **Left over fat from large cuts of meat.**  Pork shoulder is a favorite, but bacon fat, suet (visceral fat) or any fatty animal tissue will work fine.  Mixing fats is fine as well.
- **A large pot or cauldron.**
- **A medium to large pot that can comfortably fit in the above cauldron.**  The larger the better, provided it can still fit into the above cauldron.
- **A strainer or two.**  Cheesecloth also works wonders.

####Procedure

1. Fill the large cauldron with water.  Put it on the stove and let it heat up.
1. While the water heats, remove as much meat, small clots and connective tissue from the animal fat as possible using a knife.  **Don't skip this step.**
1. Put your clean fat into the smaller pot.  And water until about the half-way mark.  Remember that your fat will melt and, so use your own judgement.  More water is usually better.
1. Place the small pot in the larger pot.  Stir gently as the fat begins to melt, but do not let the water in the small pot boil.
1.  As the fat melts, use a spoon to mix the fat with the water as much as possible.  Vigorous stirring is encouraged.  This step is crucial, as it separates water-soluble impurities from the fat.  Use your strainer to pick out big pieces of non-melting stuff.
1.  After about 5-10 minutes of vigorous stirring, turn off the heat and let your mixture stand.  
1.  Cover the pot to keep out any impurities and let the concoction cool overnight.

When the concoction has cooled, you should find a block of pearly-white tallow floating at the top of your pot.  Discard the water, and consider scraping off the bottom-portion of your tallow if it seems to contain some impurities.  Rinse the block of tallow under cold water to wash off any particles that may be stuck.

##Step 2:  Making a Candle and Other Uses

Now that you have your tallow, making a survival candle is pretty simple.  I like to use an Altoids tin, but any fire-resistant container should work.  All you have to do is lay a piece of string in your container so that part of it protrudes from the edge of the box.  Then fill the box with tallow and shut the lid.

To use the candle, just open the lid and light the wick.  It's usually  helpful to rub a bit of the tallow onto the wick with your fingertips to keep it from burning down to a stump.

Your candle has several alternative uses as well, which I will list below:

- **Emergency Ration.**  Unfortunately, animal fat quickly becomes rancid when not refrigerated, but it is still safe to eat.  The advantage of having a source of animal fat [cannot be overstated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_starvation).

- **Firestarter.**  Rub a tampon, cotton ball, or some dryer lint into the tallow and watch it burn.

- **Waterproofing.**  You can waterproof a surprising variety of items with tallow.  It's particularly well-suited for protecting high-carbon steel from rust.

##Conclusion

There it is.  Dead simple.  I hope you guys find this useful.

I pretty much use this stuff wherever petroleum jelly is applicable, with the added bonus that it's also edible.

There seems to be a pervasive mentality that go along with these things, although I'm not making a generalization.  Alot of it seems to be for preparation for when ""shit hits the fan"".  Maybe preparing for a crisis or shutdown of our society.  There's sort of an extreme individualism with the idea that YOU alone will be prepared for anything and everything - giving you some sense of invincibility.  You have your well-thought out gear. Makes you feel strong.  I understand that, because I was into that whole thing at one time.

To sum up my point as quickly as possible, assuming we're talking about pure survival without the aid of modern conveniences aka - the dreaded collapse. When the first colonies arrived in the US, lots of people died of starvation. This wasn't because these people were unprepared.  This is because true survival does not have to do with having gadgets and well organized ""bug out bags"".  

Its about producing food (farming), and being part of a team (society)... as lame and unexciting as that might sound, there is a reason that we create agrarian societies.  That is true survival.  

Some US colonialists turned to living with the Native Americans - because they had a system set up.  They had a functioning society, culture and methods of farming and hunting which took generations to form.

Yes, I'm sure if you are an experienced, well-seasoned hunter and backpacker that knows the geography, it is possible you could live in the woods for an extended period of time.  

For anyone else that might hear this and what I'm trying to get at, I hope you'll get the overall message.  What you think of as survival, might just be a highly dramatized, individualistic, fantasy version of what it truly means to survive.

And to all the people who have healthy, moderate mentalities when it comes to this stuff, as in, wilderness survival as a hobby/enriching experience - you're not who I'm referring to.

Open to thoughts.  This is something I've come to realize.

Since knives are so central to survival I can't go a day without hearing about how wonderful they are. I feel like a black sheep because I would discourage anyone in a wilderness survival situation from counting on a mora, and I'd like to present my case. Please be gentle.

Here is a brief list of the benefits to mora knives before I go into the drawbacks:

* Low cost.
* Very hard, good for carving.
* Light weight.
* Can be sharpened readily.

In short, they are cheap and great for carving and fine wood work. I think a mora would be a wonderful knife to have around the house, or on a bushcraft outing in good weather. However, I don't think that the mora is well suited to the conditions of a survival situation. Here's why:

* The blades rust badly, and I mean nasty, edge-ruining rust. Any moisture on the blade will corrode it. In a coastal area the edge will be ruined in no time. Even during the preparation of a rabbit the blade takes rust and needs to be sharpened and oiled.

* The [tang](http://i799.photobucket.com/albums/yy280/kpurse/xrayofmorasshowingtanglength.jpg) of the knife suggests that it will not handle long-term use.

* What the knife does best is fine carving. Most survival strategies I see do not call for fine carving. The strategies that do are long-term, and as I have discussed, this blade does not seem ideal for long-term use in the outdoors.

Some alternatives for contrast. These blades are more versatile, have incredible rust resistance, and will stand up to years of abuse: [Fallkniven F1](http://www.fallkniven.com/en/shop/details/370/24/fixed-blades/survival-knives/f1), [ESEE-3](http://www.eseeknives.com/rc-3.htm). Granted, these knives cost several times more.

TL,DR: Moras seem like a wonderful bushcraft knife but poorly suited for survival use, particularly in coastal areas, wet weather, or over extended period of time.

This game actually was first created by accident when I was at a graduation party. I went out into the woods to get away from the commotion for a while, when my friend called me asking me to come back. I kind of joked around saying that he'd have to come and find me. This continued for a little while until I realized that he was actually organizing a team to go out and retrieve me. So I hid, but they found me. Among many minor details, they captured me and I escaped them multiple times - getting to the point where we were an hour in, I was shirtless and was running through the forest in the dark. At that point, it became a battle of wills. I gave in first due to the fact that I was getting dehydrated and disorientated. And thus, Manhunt was born.

**Rules**

- There is no time limit. This game is a battle of wills, whoever gives in to the other, loses.

- The game is 1vALL. The hunted is the person who is going solo, while the others hunt him down and bring him back to a predetermined location.

- Once the person is forced back into the predetermined location, the manhunt is over. They cannot return to the wild to continue the hunt.

- Anything that does not cause permanent or long term damage is legal. Once again, a test of wills. How long can you hold out before one of you gives up.


**Gameplay**

A single person goes out into the nearby wild, and is given time to hide/formulate plans. The hunters, during that time, are to devise plans as to how they will go about capturing said person. After a decent amount of time (determined beforehand by the group), without warning to the hunted, the hunting may begin. Both sides must be cunning with how they go about things, as your strategy could decide how quickly, or long, the game lasts.

This game displays both survival and strategy (Much like the Hunger Games, eh?), which is why I am posting this in this subreddit.

Another part of me thinks the opposite, that is actually a very specific tool and really not that useful at all.

Most of my supplies are for backpacking, and I've asked similar questions in the past on /r/CampingandHiking and used their advice. I'm hoping some of you all will have a different viewpoint, or see something that I'm not even thinking of including - or something that I have that I didn't think of including but really should.

If the shit ever were to hit the fan with enough time to get everything prepped, it would be my fiancee and I. I know we should have everything packed in a bug-out bag Just In Case, but we just haven't gotten the chance yet.

Only requirement is that it cost less than or roughly equal to $50 and be available to purchase at REI.

Already have, between the two of us:

(Shelter)

* REI 2-person tent plus footprint
* Sleeping bag + liner + inflatable pad (Marmot Minimalist 40F; Thermolite Reactor Extreme +25F)
* Sleeping bag + inflatable pad (woman's +25F)

(Transportation / Hydration)

* 65L Backpacks (Osprey Atmos 65, Osprey Ariel 65)
* Day packs (REI Flash 18, don't know the other specs)
* 2x 2L generic-brand hydration bladder, 3x 1L nalgenes, water purification tablets

(Food prep / heat)

* Generic camp stove plus fuel (one of [these babies](http://www.amazon.com/Ultralight-Backpacking-Canister-Stove-Ignition/dp/B004U8CP88/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376189387&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=camp+stove))
* Fire starting equipment (mag. firestarter, butane torch, traditional lighter, strike anywhere matches)
* 2-person mess kit ([this thing](http://www.rei.com/product/830774/gsi-outdoors-pinnacle-dualist-ultralight-cookset))
* Trekking poles (2 poles)

(Clothes)

* Non-cotton ""long johns""
* Convertible pants, khaki pants, blue jeans
* Fast wicking shirts
* Fast wicking / wool socks
* Hiking / light backpacking boots, camp shoes

(Misc)

* Lengths of 550 paracord
* Small knives ([One](http://www.rei.com/product/738186/gerber-mini-paraframe-serrated-knife), [Two](http://www.rei.com/product/727695/gerber-evo-jr-serrated-locking-knife)) and multitool (also Gerber)
* Hatchet with leather sheath
* ""Backpacking Tarp"" from Walmart, 6' x 8'
* Small and large camp towel
* Small first aid kit, don't know entirely what's inside
* 2x Headlamps, extra batteries
* Camp lantern (LED still on original batteries, thing is potent!)
* Compass

I'm positive I'm forgetting to include stuff - I don't remember everything off the top of my head, another thing on my ""to do"" list is to compile a complete sheet of equipment and a mass listing for each item.

Worst case I was looking at a couple of the inexpensive hammocks they had. Not sure about how good they'd be for actually spending the night in, though. Perhaps a larger knife / machete or something? I kind of got the hatchet as a joke (I read the book by the same name when I was younger!) and have gotten a surprising amount of use out of it.

I thought it would be challenging to put one together. I grew up in the country and you could say I am a bit of a tomboy still :) I know how to hunt and fish and start a fire.

So this kit was very cheap to assemble, I put together most of it from miscellaneous items I had around the house. Including the sweet carrying bag which is made out of leather and has several zippered pockets. There are also several things I found around my parents house while house sitting (thanks parents!)

This is geared for early spring through summer.

The only things I purchased specifically for this kit were the: water purification tablets, magnesium fire starter, the poncho, waterproof container, and space blanket. Here are the contents.


**First aid/personal**- Large, medium and small bandages, gauze pad, cotton, butterfly bandages, poison ivy relief wipe, sunscreen, burn cream, antiseptic wipes, insect sting relief wipes, alcohol prep pads, bacitracin, chap stick, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and an ace bandage.


**Misc**- aluminum foil, bandanna(water filter, signal, first aid uses)


**Fire/warmth/shelter**- Bic lighter, magnesium fire starter, space blanket, poncho (can be used as shelter), 2 hand/feet warmer packs. 


**Tools**- LED flashlight, notepad, rope/twine (NEEDS UPGRADE- I know it's lame).


**Water/food**- stainless steel water bottle, 2 heavy duty ziplock bags, instant coffee and green tea.


Identification papers (copies of birth certificate, drivers license SS card) and a hackey sack for boredom.

**Edit 5/8/12: Thanks for all of your responses, I found them very helpful!**

**New image- Updated** [here.](http://imgur.com/GhvhR,whr3m)


**Items I took out:**

~~matches
marker
file
multi-tool
leatherman
pocket knife
cough drops
bobby pins
candles
box cutter~~



**Items I added:**


* All in one multi tool- 2 knife blades, saw blade, pliers (it's massive, but covers everything)

* Cotton balls with rubbed in Vaseline

* Duct tape

* 2 tampons (takes up a lot of room.. .) hmm.

* Travel toothbrush- I thought about this and it is absolutely necessary 

* Trash bag

* 2 snack bars

* 1 pack fruit snacks

* Rubber band



**Things I upgraded:**


* Soap- I broke this into small chunks using 1/5th of the bar. put it in a 2x2 bag to save space.


* First aid kit- reduced this to about half the contents, not omitting anything.


**Green Survival container now contains:** awesome...



* Needle + thread, safety pins, razor blade, wire

* Fishing- hooks, leader, sinkers, bobber, fishing line

* Tweezers, small scissors, nail clip, mirror, whistle

* Soap, wet wipes

* Water purification tablets

* pencil, cotton rubbed with Vaseline 




This has on O ring on top that I can attach the fire starter to.



**I still need:**



* that damned 550 paracord
* compass
* map
* bug spray
* reliable water transportation

Here are three chlorine-based options (iodine is out, for obvious reasons):

- **Sodium Hypochlorite** (liquid bleach). Add 2-4 drops to a quart/liter of water to kill most bacterias and viruses (30 minutes). Short shelf-life (up to 6 months). Cheap.

- **Calcium Hypochlorite** (pool chlorine). You can mix it with water to make liquid bleach (which you can use to purify water). Long shelf-life (up to 10 years or more). Very cheap.

- **Chlorine Dioxide** (Aquamira or Katadyn tablets). Supposed to be more powerful than bleach (but I can't find any source). Convenient tablet format (Aquamira also offers a 2-liquid version). Expensive.

They're all supposed to kill cryptosporidium, but that takes up to 4 hours (compared to the 30 minutes necessary to kill pretty much everything else).

The chlorine dioxide tablets look very compact and practical, but calcium hypochlorite seems to be a much better long-term solution. You apparently can purify something like 1 million liters of water with 1 pound of calcium hypochlorite (which costs like $10).

Edit: I got to play with this knife on 4 day course in May. I'm a die-hard Fallkniven F1 fan (And so is the reviewer in the videos) but I was pleasantly surprised by how well this knife handled. It doesn't have that 'sharpened crowbar' heavy feel to it and has very decent balance for it's shape. The serration on the back made quick work of hacking through some solid core electrical wire we found for improvised cordage. It worked well for harvesting hemlock branches for bedding, feather sticking, batonning etc. All in all I was fairly impressed.

DURING THE VIETNAM CONFLICT A VERY COURAGEOUS MAN, DALE ROGERS, EMERGED AS A

MEMBER OF OUR SPECIAL MILITARY ELITE UNITS. ATTACHED TO THE SPECIAL GROUPS, MIKE

FORCES, LLDB 4, LLDB 5 AND THE ASA ...... REAL TIME SURVIVAL BECAME AN EVERYDAY

REQUIREMENT FOR DALE ROGERS. NECESSITY FORCED DALE ROGERS TO INVENT THE SURVIVAL

AND RESCUE TOOL TODAY, AS A CIVILIAN HOLDING OVER 20 COMBAT COMMENDATIONS, DALE

ROGERS IS A FULL TIME VA COUNSELOR TO HIS VIETNAM BROTHERS.

THE SRT-1, THE ORIGINAL SURVIVAL AND RESCUE TOOL WAS CONCEIVED, DEVELOPED, TESTED,

AND USED BY THE SPECIAL FORCES DURING THE VIETNAM ERA. THE DALE ROGERS SRT-1 IDEA

WAS FURTHER REFINED AND PATENTED AS A SURVIVAL AND RESCUE TOOL. PRODUCTION WAS

STARTED IN SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH AND MARKETING EFFORTS, TO RESPONSIBLE PROFESSIONAL

OUTDOORSMEN, CONTINUED UNTIL THE COUNSELING ACTIVITIES OF DALE ROGERS BECAME A

FULLTIME DEDICATION. DURING 1988, THE COMPANY WAS SOLD TO THESAGAD CORP. UNDER THE

CONDITIONS THAT THE INTEGRITY AND QUALITY, BUILT INTO THE ORIGINAL SRT-1,WOULD NEVER

BE COMPROMISED. SAGAD CORP. AGREED.

THE ULTIMATE SURVIVAL AND RESCUE TOOL ...... SRT-1, IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. THE ONLY

KNOWN COMPARISON OF THE SRT-1 THAT CAN BE MADE IS TO A KNIFE. HARDLY A FAIR

COMPARISON WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT THE SRT-1 CAN BE USED AS A WEDGE TO SPLIT LOGS.

USING IT AS A SPEAR CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STARVING AND FOOD. NOW CONSIDER

THE USES AS AN AXE...... A CHISEL...... PLANE...... WIRE STRIPPER ...... A HOE...... BOTTLE

OPENER ...... A GLASS AND TILE CUTTER ...... NAIL PULLER ...... A KNIFE ...... SAW ...... A

HANDLE. IN ADDITION, THE BACK CUTTER CAN TEAR THRU THE SHEET METALS AS FOUND IN A

HELICOPTER, PLANE, AUTO OR A WRECKED 4x4.

VERSATILE AND SAFE, THE SRT-1 IS A WORKHORSE. WE CERTAINLY AGREE THAT THE SRT-1 IS

NOT AS AESTHETICALLY APPEALING AS A KNIFE ...... BUT THAT'S THE ONLY CONCESSION WE'LL

MAKE. THE SRT-1 IS A ONE PIECE MIL SPEC CASTING OF440C STAINLESS STEEL, A RUST RESISTANT

HIGH CARBON TOOL STEEL, TOUGH, STRONG AND CAPABLE OF TAKING AND HOLDING A SHARP

EDGE UNDER THE MOST DESPERATE SURVIVAL CONDITIONS. THE DELIBERATELY OVERBUILT

SRT-1 WILL HOLD UP UNDER THE MOST RIGID SURVIVAL APPLICATIONS. WE'RE SO CONVINCED OF

THE QUALITY OF THE SRT-1 THAT THE LIFETIME REPLACEMENT IS GUARANTEED. SIMPLY RETURN

IT TO US OR TO YOUR DEALER.

THE SRT-1 IS THE SAFEST TOOL OF ITS TYPE AVAILABLE TODAY. THERE AREN'T ANY FOLDING

BLADES TO CLOSE BACK ON THE FINGERS. THE UNIQUE FINGER HOLES PROVIDE THE MOST SLIP

FREE GRIP OF ANY DESIGN KNOWN. IT CAN BE HELD SECURELY EVEN WHEN COATED WITH OIL,

WATER OR MUD. THE SHARP POINT, COMMON TO ALL KNIVES HAS BEEN ELIMINATED ON THE SRT-1.

THE SURVIVAL AND RESCUE TOOL WAS DESIGNED AND BUILT TO SAVE THE LIFE OF THE PERSON

USING IT EVEN IF YOUR HANDS ARE FROZEN, BURNED OR BROKEN YOU REMAIN ABLETO SLIP ON

THE TOOL AND USE IT WHEN YOU COULDN'T EVEN GRIP, OPEN THE BLADE, OR HOLD A STANDARD

KNIFE SLIP THE SRT-1 ON YOUR HAND AND FEEL THE BUILT IN CONFIDENCE AS IF IT BECOMES

1361444587.0,28,self.Survival,18y5oq,Slinging,36,8,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/18y5oq/slinging/,"In my experience, some folks will argue that primitive weapons have no place in modern survival scenarios. I beg to differ. In fact, I believe that no survival training is complete without knowing how to efficiently kill with the weapons of our ancestors. 

I started slinging two weeks ago on a passing whim. It very quickly became an obsession. I was already deadly with a slingshot, and I have long enjoyed throwing knives and tomahawks. I am a gun owner and I love guns, but I absolutely believe that those people who can master the weapons of early man have the best chance of surviving when it comes down to the nitty-gritty. 

What I mean is, our ancestors obviously did something right in terms of hunting game. The atlatl is the famed weapon that we can attribute to man's earliest means of survival. However, the sling is one of the most influential, yet underestimated weapons in the entirety of human history.

Slings have long helped claim victory in battles as recently as the sieges medieval period. In fact, sling-like weapons are known to have existed in a staggering majority the aboriginal inhabitants of all the world's continents. One can find variation just about anywhere on the planet.

Like so many primitive weapons, the design is simple. I would even say that it is easy to master! The problem is that very few people recognize the sling as a formidable weapon. Even the widespread Biblical tale of David perfectly slinging a stone into Goliath's forehead is very commonly associated with luck and the help of the God. 

The truth of the matter is that young men living in the middle east during that time likely mastered the sling in childhood as a means of defense training as well as livestock protection. The Roman and Greek armies considered their slingers to be as important as their archers. Slings were, and still are, simple to make. They can even be made entirely from plant fibers, negating the necessity of modern textiles. On top of that, nature provides ammunition if you need it. 

In the short two weeks since I made my first sling I have progressed exponentially. I fully expected it to be an inaccurate novelty of a weapon that might keep me occupied for an afternoon. NO SIR! There hasn't been a day since then that I haven't launched at least one rock. It is quite possibly the most fun, yet surprisingly accurate of all the primitives that I have ever used. I am absolutely, 110% all about slinging now!

I am submitting this post in appreciation of not only the sling, but of all the primitive weapons that helped man get to where we are today. I also encourage people to practice with these weapons. At least tinker with them once! Many primitive weapons are very fun to use... and their true potential just might surprise you.

Here's an album of the slings I have made since I started slinging such a short time ago: http://imgur.com/a/iAktR

Any tips, ideas etc. would be appreciated!",46,14,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/17khum/taking_some_kids_on_an_intro_survival_camping/,"Here's the background.  I'm 32 and have spent a good chunk of my life outdoors.   I don't have any specific 'survival' training but have spent enough time out  in the woods (weeks at a time sometimes) that a lot of the stuff I see talked about on wilderness survival seems like standard camping stuff to me.  

The kids are 8 and 10 and live on a small farm so they're pretty familiar with general outdoor stuff and know how to pluck &amp; clean a bird already.   

I'm trying to come up with a list of activities to do from an educational standpoint.     Here's the game plan I have so far:  

Each person person is limited to a backpack and what they can carry.  We'll have about a 1 - 1.5 mile hike-in.    Mandatory equipment will be a sleeping bag, pad, black plastic, string/twine, knife/multitool, firesteel, mess kit, water container, headlamp and 1 cup of rice.   Extra socks and warmer night clothes.   

The area I have in mind is a big chunk of uninhabited forest with a decent sized stream running through it.    I'm thinking a roughly 48 hour trip.  A friday - sunday type thing. 

Lessons:

1: Fire starting using the flint &amp; steel and natural materials. 

2: collecting/filtering water from the stream and boiling it.  

3: basic overnight shelter building.   

4: foraging for wild edible plants/mushrooms (only stuff I know for a fact is safe)  There's an incredible abundance of edible plants here in the spring.   As for mushrooms (before you flip out) the only ones I'd expect to find that I'm 120% sure of are Dryad Saddles(Polyporus squamosus) which are extremely common here and potentially Morels.  

5: Fishing for small fish out of the creek with a little roll of string/small hooks.  Possibly creating fish traps or nets.   Catching crayfish and/or trapping them.   Night time headlamp frog hunting.  Maybe spear fishing using trash/refuse to make a spear head.    Anything we catch will be eaten and as little waste as possible.   Ie: we won't just eat the frog legs, but also the heart and use the leftovers as bait the next day.  

6: basic camp-fire cooking techniques.  


Any ideas or thoughts?

Hi everybody, over the past month I bought a Gerber Gator Jr. Machete ($20.00) through amazon and decided I would add some attachments to the sheath. I treated this project as one that if I ever got lost in the woods, as long as I had my machete, I would be able to survive for a period of time. It has everything on it that I need to make water, shelter, fire and a way to obtain food (although fishing is always hit or miss). I attached everything by cutting bicycle inner tube into strips that work like rubber bands and sliding it up the sheath.

* Logo side: (http://imgur.com/U2rue)
* Blank side: (http://imgur.com/aytu0)
* Different view: (http://imgur.com/TirKy)

*Logo side of the machete*

* **Fire tinder**: I made four cotton pad and Vaseline sandwiches with dried Coleman fire tinder on the inside. I also added regular cotton balls and a couple hand fulls of the Coleman fire tinder. It is double wrapped in small plastic sandwich bags and closed with electrical tape to help with waterproofing

* **Fishing kit**: The small white box hidden underneath the 550 cord contains a fishing kit complete with hooks, line, lead line, bobbers, and a few spinners.

* **Industrial orange garbage bag**: Underneath the fishing kit is an industrial orange garbage bag that can be used for a make shift shelter or sleeping bag.

*Blank side of the machete*

* **Butane lighter**: Directly opposite of the fire tinder is a butane lighter.

* **First aid kit**: Underneath the 550 cord is a first aid kit containing bandaids, gauze, anti-septic pads, and Aquatabs all wrapped in aluminum foil and sealed the same way as the fire tinder.

* **Magnesium block with striker**: This is there for a back up in case the lighter fails. 

I understand it may be a bit impractical as a camping knife, however I plan to hike to my destination, set up a base camp and then explore the surrounding area. I'll just toss this around my shoulder as I am exploring the area and if I do happen to get lost, at least I'll have some resources with me. 

Lastly, are there any suggestions for me? Is there anything I should add or remove?

[And here it is laid out and annotated.](http://i.imgur.com/njQkD.jpg)

* First impressions, the box is actually pretty solid, and has a rubber seal, a mirror built into the inside lid and a fairly solid catch.

* Most of what's in the box however will probably be replaced and added to over the next wee while.

* The knife wasn't very sharp and doesn't lock into place easily (you need to make sure the lock clicks over) I've tried forcing an edge onto it and it doesn't appear to keen on the idea, but I'll try again, then give up and pop in something more solid.

* The fishing kit has a few feet of very thin fishing line, a couple of hooks, swivels and lead weights, most of this will probably get dumped for something more reliable.

* The water tabs are probably ok, I haven't tried them yet, but it does say to use one tab per 20-25 litres of water, so if I can find a 5 gallon drum or something similar that's clean enough to put water I'm sound, if not they're next to useless.

* Tealight is a tealight. Might square it off for better packing.

* Wire saw; I'm not overly confident about it's chances of staying in, but I'll take it out this weekend and see what it can do.

* The fire stick is tiny. It's just under 1.5"" and about 1/8"" diameter. But it throws a pretty good spark, and given how little space it takes up I think it's actually quite good.

* Button compass points roughly north so that's good. (haha!)

* Sewing kit is quite bulky for how little is actually in it, I don't think various colours of thread are really necessary are they?

* Whistle is loud as fuck, but kinda big. Might a pea whistle be better?

* Snare wire seems ok. Cotton balls are cotton balls, but there are only two.


Next step: swapping the knife out for [this one](http://i.imgur.com/E1Ov8.jpg) just now, try out what needs tried out, and buy some decent water tabs. And ask /r/survival for advise!

I’ve grown up hunting and fishing and spent a large amount of time in the woods.  This last year I had the opportunity to get lost in the Sierra Nevada mountains with a few friends.  We ended up lost after dark on the side of a cliff in the wind and had to bed down until morning.  We brought mostly fishing gear and I brought my ‘survival kit’ whereas my other friends brought an 18pack of beer and sweatshirts.  At the time my survival kit was quite large so I ended up leaving half of it in the car and thinking that I knew I’d be back to the car before dark.  Murphy’s Law got the best of me and my friends that evening…  

So due to this cold and dark experience I have modified my ‘survival kit’ and would like to both show it off to you and also ask for suggestions.

My goal was to have something that I could keep attached to my belt at all times.  This way even if I somehow lost my backpack, I would be attached to my survival kit and all the essentials to make it through a few nights in the woods.

** as a side note I want to stress the fact that a survival kit means nothing if you do not know how to use it, knowledge is your best friend in any survival situation **

2.  Springfield Armory .40 cal with two clips
3.  First aid kit
4. Energy bars &amp; water bottle
If you would like I can provide the items in my light first aid kit as well.

I also plan on expanding this later on to show what I have in my bug out bag.

Sorry if I have any errors in this posting, its only my 2nd submission.

As some of you have noticed (and reported - thank you) there have been numerous bug-out-bag posts recently. 
Although there is a lot of overlap between the topics of prepping and wilderness survival *this is not a prepping subreddit!*

While it's technically conceivable that you'll be going out into the wilderness to use your buy-out-bags in case of some catastrophic event (as opposed to staying with family, friends, neighbors or a hotel) the subreddit mods and other members of the community feel that posts of this nature go against the grain and spirit of the subreddit.
After some discussion we feel that now would be a good time to re-iterate and expand on some of the rules regarding posting:


From the sidebar:
&gt; This subreddit is devoted to discussion, articles, and videos on **Wilderness Survival.** For hoarding supplies, the oncoming zombie apocalypse, peak oil, and anything else that might make you want to buy a ""bug out bag"" head over to /r/TEOTWAWKI or /r/bugout or any of the numerous subreddits listed on the sidebar. Also, please no blog spam.


Here are the new guidelines to follow regarding any bag type post:


*    If you're preparing for a catastrophic event (flood, plague, poison monkeys etc.), there's a subreddit for that, and this ain't it.
*    If you're worried about the end of that world and what to buy about it, there's a subreddit for that, and this ain't it.
*    If you simply want to bug-out-brag, there's a subreddit for that, and this ain't it.
*    If you're putting together a backpack for spending time in the wilderness the doesn't hinge on some catastrophe and have questions or are looking for input regarding equipment choices, skills and techniques such as fire-making, plant lore, or anything else specifically relating to wilderness survival you're in the right place.


Regarding blog spam; If you wish to link an article for discussion purposes, that's fine. It only becomes blog-spamming when you link every single blog update a particular writer publishes. If you find a blog that you enjoy and think others will too, message the mods and we'll consider adding it to the sidebar.


For those of you who have heard of the mythical sidebar but haven't witnessed it's glory here's a list of other subreddits, some of which are dedicated specifically to prepping, bugging out, etc.


*    /r/survivalist
*    /r/permaculture
*    /r/collapse
*    /r/postcollapse
*    /r/outdoors
*    /r/Knives

**tl;dr: Any future 'bug-out-bag' posts will be removed.**


Edit: Thank you to those who reported the bug-out-bag posts on the top page of the subreddit. These posts *will not* be removed since they were put up prior to the clarification of posting rules. It's unfair to impose rules retroactively.

Go to your local starbucks, and just grab a handful of honey packets from the straws/sugar station for free.  1-They are high calorie, high vitamin sugar boosts, great for keeping on web gear/BOB for easy energy boosts, or to flavor other survival foods like oatmeal or acorn foods.  2- Honey acts as a natural adhesive/sealant, great for any small adhesive jobs, and even waterproofing smaller gaps etc, though extended water exposure will obviously wash it away.  3- Honey is an antiseptic, and combined with its adhesive properties it is very helpful for minor cuts.  4- Being a sweet and sticky, honey makes perfect bait for traps; animals love it, and all you need to do is smear some on your bait stick and you are done!  I am sure you guys and girls can think of a bunch more uses I havnt!  I now keep a couple honey packets on me whenever I go out camping; Just stick a bunch of them in a 9mm mag pouch and strap it to your belt/web gear/backpack for easy access to a tasty snack, or for dressing cuts, or for sticking up trail markers!

I got really lucky earlier and scored a nice bota bag or waterskin at a thrift shop for a little under 3 dollars. It's nice, I put water in it to see if there were any holes, and it's perfect. I figure it will not only be good for the bug out bag, but I also love backpacking and hiking.

The problem is, it's from a thrift shop. I am not drinking from it until I know it's sanitary.

How do I clean this? Is it just dish soap, water, and shaking, or will this require something different?

First of all, I'm sorry if this is the wrong place. I see 'no blog spam' in the rules for posting, and although this isn't a blog but a series of videos which will be uploaded in mid November by a friend I hope this can be the exception.

A friend of mine has recently started a 100 day journey in the wild Yukon, and will be recording a video each day. He won't upload any video's during his trip (he won't have internet access, to my understanding he's really roughing it) but will upload them once he returns. He's really wants to come home to seeing a bunch of people subscribed, which is why I'm plugging his channel.

Even if you don't intend to watch the videos, subscribing would mean a lot. Once again, if this is the wrong place please let me know and I will remove this post asap.

tl;dr

Friend afk in yukon wild, lots of vids on his return (hopefully)!

I'm a city boy who has spent most of his life playing video games in doors. I've never had a dad to teach me or show me much of the great outdoors. I'm getting older and bored of this lifestyle. I've recently started mountain biking. It seemed okay at first, but the more I realized that I didn't know anything about survival, the more daunting it became to me.

My friend who's been doing it for years can never really go ahead of me on the trail or else I'll freak out. Also, if we do get accidentally separated because of a fork in the trail, I'll go into fight or flight and freak out wondering if he's okay and if I'll be okay and where on earth everyone is.

The thing is, the more I wonder about what can happen and how to prepare, the more scared I become for the next trip. I do not really want to be a person who can not enjoy doing some ""dangerous"" things. 

Some of my key fears are:

* Bears
* Dehydration
* Breaking a limb and getting stuck
* Becoming unconscious
* Heights and cliffs! (especially)
* Getting lost (this amplifies all the other fears) 
* Being alone

I assume educating myself is the first step. I've tried to read up, but I don't get to test the knowledge out often. So I don't know what I can trust yet. Does anyone have any advice on getting started? Any advice for getting over any of the specific key fears mentioned? Or at least share a similar story about when they got into the outdoors. It may seem like I'm simply not meant for the outdoors, but I do not want to be this way honestly.",,False,,t5_2qh7j,True,,,True,t3_sjdnw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/sjdnw/any_advice_for_a_city_person_looking_to_get_out/,

A pan or whatever you call it where I can boil water.

Cellphone of course.

Band aids.

Condoms (Never know if you'll get lucky)

Bandage.

Some sterile gloves.

Duct tape.

A good book.

Thank you!
* * *
So I'm turning 26 in two weeks and this time I want to do something different. I will go out ""in the wild"" for 10 days, unless I need to cut it short for some unexpected reason. 

I enjoy running and hiking, so I go out in the mountain fairly often, but I have never camped alone before. That is why I would like to humbly request your help.
* * *


**Some background info**

* I will leave at the end of June and I will be trekking the Pyrinees and prePyrinees (Spain). I expect it to be hot (avg 25ºC or 77F, max 35ºC or 95F, min 18ºC or 65F)
* I expect to cross fairly small towns or mountain shelters where I should be able to buy ~~water~~ food and other supplies every two nights.
* I want to only take a backpack and everything to be light enough to be able to run comfortably. To me that means 10kg max max, preferably 5kg max. The less the better. (I still haven't weighed any of the stuff below, since I am first making a list of the absolutely required stuff).
* Every night will be spent camping in a different place.
Most of my day will be spent hiking and running. I will also read, write and reflect.


**First instance list of things to bring**

* Small first-aid kit
* Emergency whistle
* Small swiss-army knife
* iPhone (GPS, Emergency Phone)
* Solar charger for phone / battery charger (need to read on that)
* Regular lighter
* Headlamp
* Three 1L water containers
* Water purifier (Aquamira drops)
* Wet wipes 
* 100 euros in paper bills
* Credit card
* Sun-screen
* Sun glasses
* Vaseline
* Foot patches
* Talcum powder
* Tooth brush + tooth paste
* Hammock + tarp
* Sleeping bag
* Cat stove (still need to try this)
* **Food**: 3000Cal/day * 3 days

* Clothes total (worn + backpack)
** 1 long-sleeved T-shirts
** 1 trousers
** 2 sets of underwear
** 2 sets of socks
** 1 shoes
** 1 cap

** Safety **

I will have a cell-phone, an emergency whistle and first-aid kit with me. Also, my girlfriend and family will have a document with my expected approximate location every day. If I don't contact my girlfriend at least once every 24h, she will report me missing. Anything else I should consider?

**Questions**

* ~~Should I bring a sleeping bag?~~ Thanks!
* ~~Do I need a stove? Can I get on without cooking? (In order to reduce weight?) How possible is it to eat properly and be perfectly fit without cooking? What food should I bring?~~ Thanks!
* Is there anything missing or superfluous in my list?

**Advice?**

* the bite of an unknown species, which venom I can not identify.

If you do recommend mess kits, are there any in particular you could recommend? Or would a simple aluminum Coleman mess kit suffice? Or should one spring for a stainless steel kit?
Thanks!

**edit**: Sorry for the late reply everyone (was at work building windmills :) )

All of these options you shared with me are great looking items. I have a decent feel on what would be good for me, and the product I'm likely to purchase. Going off of advice from thirstyone, I'm planning on a somewhat minimal set that I can cook over a campfire, without worrying about keeping the temperature right. Plus with this set [here](http://cascadedesigns.com/msr/cookware/simple-cooking/alpine-stowaway-pots/product), it appears I'll be using little room, and even have a bit of extra storage (for silverware, or extra food).

I've been trying to get this new survival hobby kickstarted, and I've already learned a wealth of information from all of you in the subreddit, and I wanted to let you all know that it is **VERY** appreciated.

I would consider my self a novice at survival.  I have a fair amount of knowledge and experience but not nearly enough to satisfy myself (or enough to pull solo trips without being in an acceptable amount of danger).  However I've long since abandoned a few pieces of common camping gear.  One of which being my tent.  I find that a tarp is fine for when I don't have enough daylight to build a shelter.  

The other day I went out with a friend knowing the weather was going to be cold but confident that a jacket/sleeping bag combo would be enough.  After hiking a good 4 miles off trail to our camp site we decided to set up.  During the hike and the hours after it the weather was in the low 70s so thoughts of cold weather weren't fresh on my mind while setting up.  I ended up creating essentially a bivy bag, just enough to keep the wind out.  And with that we went to bed.

That night it hit 27 degrees.  A by product of which was an incredible amount of condensation on the inside of my shelter.  I'd never done such a small shelter before and didn't realize what it would to do my bag.  I ended up waking up around 4:30 and incredibly cold and more than a little wet.  So cold I could barely get my boots on and couldn't work a lighter.  

As struggled to find firewood through uncontrollable shivering and limbs that didn't want to respond, I realized how close I had come to being in trouble.  If there hadn't been a few active coals left and I didn't have a friend I may not have been able to get a fire started.  I've had thoughts of going out alone some time just to get away, but I don't think I'll be attempting it until summer.

If so, no problem with deleting this post.

Basically I have 3 stages for my kit: First the most basic things. The second stage is a dry bag with some very important, added items. The last version is for longer trips, rarely used and basically adds three more items.


Basic things (kind of an EDC):

* Knife ([Opinel Inox No8](http://www.opinel-usa.com/proddetail.asp?prod=Opinel-No-8-carbon-steel-folding-knife))
* Firesteel ([Primus](https://www.expeditionexchange.com/primus/)) and Charcloth
* Cordage
* Cotton bandana
* [mini Lamp](http://cascadedesigns.com/en/msr/tents/tent-accessories/enhance/led-tent-lights/product) with red light
* my watch with a compass

Second stage forming a very handy package:

* [Fällkniven F1](http://www.fallkniven.com/en/shop/details/370/10/military-knives/f1)
* [sharpener](http://www.fallkniven.com/en/shop/details/368/13/sharpeners/dc3)
* a pencil sharpener (makes perfect kindling and pointy sticks for traps or to cook something on the fire)
* [GSI DukJug 1L bottle](http://www.gsioutdoors.com/products/pdp/1_l_glacier_stainless_dukjug/bottles_jugs/) (can be used to cook/boil) with duct tape
* Duct tape
* Rope (it's not paracord, but similar)
* [Compass](http://www.recta.ch/en/dt-220) 
* Candle
* [Head lamp](http://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en-us/shop/mountain/lighting/storm-headlamp/)
* Water desinfection tablets for 25 liters
* Clothing (a warm hat, warm socks, a fleece pullover)
* Medication against fever and diarrhea, painkillers and antibiotics
* Whistle
* edit: bic lighter (thank you, /u/olofpunktnilsson)
* edit: [Maya dust](http://www.knifeworks.com/lightmyfiremayadust.aspx) (thank you, /u/olofpunktnilsson)

Third stage:

* cooking pot (1.2L, stainless steel)
* a [shelter-half](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelter-half)
* [water filter](http://www.katadyn.com/chen/katadyn-produkte/produkte/katadynshopconnect/katadyn-wasserfilter-endurance-series-produkte/katadyn-pocket/)

The waterfilter stays at home almost everytime, as I just won't need it.

As far as I know, I lack the following items:

- more first aid stuff. I have a good first aid kit, but I'm not happy to just take it with me (even though I do so) because it's too big

- Axe, machete, saw. I could add a small axe, maybe. But with the bigger knife, I can do many things only slightly less comfortable

- thing's for hunting and fishing. Which is illegal around here anyway, except for emergency situations. Fishing line is very useful, and adding a hook won't hurt. But beeing realistic, that's neither my first nor my 10th problem I'll be facing if I need these things...

- toilet paper and handsanitizer, even though it's not THAT important

What else? Thoughts on what to add or leave out?


**Edit:** 

I feel like I should expand on the intended usage. It's more used in something I might call ""advanced camping"", aka survival. Add this stuff to my backpack when I'm travelling. It's the base or actually almost everything when I go hiking and sleep in a tent or bivouac. This means I will have good boots and clothing and at least some food. And it means that I will practice as many skills as possible. But living in switzerland, the only situation I could really use ""survival-things"" is when hiking in the mountains and the weather changes very fast or something similar.

But the main point is that I need to be able to re-use my equipment again and again (and that's why I don't like paracord bracelets that much ;)). And that's why long-term items i.e. the sharpener are in there.",,False,,t5_2qh7j,1348502854.0,,,True,t3_10cjte,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/10cjte/my_survival_kit_thoughts/,

Knife - Kabar Becker BK2: From what I've read on here and all over, it's a solid, reliable knife that'll last for years to come, and it's reasonably priced.

Axe - Estwing Hatchet: I know a lot of people don't include hatchets in their bags due to weight issues, but it's just under two pounds and brings some added utility to the pack (can be used as a hammer , etc). Would probably sow some kind of loop to slip the handle into on the outside of my bag so it wouldn't have to take up space inside.

Fishing Net - While I do enjoy pole fishing, it takes up more space than a folded net would by a longshot, especially when you include things like tackle and whatnot. Plus when it comes to a survival situation you're not fishing for the sport of it.

Sabrecut Saw - Takes up next to no space and is lightweight, good for taking apart those bigger branches that I don't want to dull my knife on by batoning.

Knife/Edge Sharpener - pretty standard.

Firestarters - Ferro Rod, Waterproof Matches, 2xBic Lighters, Vaseline soaked cotton balls: from what I've read on here it's a good idea to have three ways to start a fire, and those are the most solid/reliable ones from what I could tell. Cottom balls in a photo film canister for fuel.

P38 Can Opener - This is less of a wilderness survival one, more of a general survival one. Plan on keeping one in my wallet at all times, just in case.

Water Purification - Lifestraw: The way I look at it, this will be good for quick use when I really need water, if I need more to fill my canteen I'd have to boil some to fill it.

Paracord - Goes without saying, so many uses.

Swiss Army Knife - Small and lightweight, but you get a lot of utility out for not a lot of room taken up.

Stainless Steel Water Bottle/Cup - Obvious reasons, though I haven't been able to find a good Bottle with a cup that can fit on the bottom, anyone have any recommendations?

SAS Survival Guide - From what I've heard, an incredible amount of knowledge packed into those pages. Invaluable to have.

Basic Butchery of Livestock and Game by John Mettler - Hunting is new to me so this one is a pretty obvious choice. I'm going deer hunting once the season starts in the fall with a relative who knows how to field dress and is going to teach me, but I doubt I'll always be lucky enough to bag a deer. This will come in handly for the other animals that I won't have a chance for someone to teach me.

As far as hunting goes I already have a bow and have been practicing at the archery range near my house lately. I know it's not the best thing to hunt with as far as saving space goes, but the fact that it can take down big and small game alike, and in the woods you'd be surrounded by a limitless supply of ammo make this seem like the best option for me.

I already have a bag to store all this in, as well as a tent/sleeping bag. I can gather some basic things from around the house like toilet paper, gauze, and extra clothes but some of the more specific medical supplies I'd still need to get. All this stuff together came out to a total of around 200$, giving me a bit of room for a few more items. I know I need some first aid supplies but from what I've read the pre-made kits you can buy in the store are pretty terrible. Is there any other glaring hole that I'm missing? Any advice would be appreciated.

I was wondering if any of you have seen, heard or know where to get one of these maps.  From what I remember it is made by NGA which stands for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.  The maps that I have seen are rather large and extremely durable, and they have the ability to be rolled or folded to be pretty small.  

The map also has different items on it which would be extremely benificial to survival like; different wildlife, edible plants, potential threats in the area, venomous wildlife and more.. These maps were made with survival in mind and I know that Military and different agencies use these type of maps, but for the life of me I can't find any (should of snagged one when I had the chance j/k).  I haven't seen one made that is of the U.S. which is the one that I would want, but I am sure they exist.

I've picked up 30m of Mammut 5mm static rope, and I wonder if it can be used in an emergency situation with a climb-rated biner, a sling harness, and using either a biner brake rappel, or a munter mule. 

In a hiking situation I wouldn't want to bring my usual 60m, 11mm rope, as it's too heavy. This 30m of cord is light enough and small enough to pack down in my backpack, and I figure it could get me out of a few situations.

I don't live near anything that could be considered a real mountain, so escarpments are the most common thing around, and most of them aren't larger than 15-20m high. This 5mm static should be stronger than regular paracord, and I figure that in most cases it would be doubled up anyways, so it should be okay. Am I off my rocker with this?

I just typed it up for a relative who was on a fishing trip and missed the chance, she tells me ""we just threw it back"". 

- If you find yourself [faced with a Weever](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weever), you'd better be prepared in dealing with it. They *are* worth eating. 

- If anyone else has any methods for this or other species that are venomous, please share as this information is invaluable, and might save someones life one day. It may turn into an interesting library of methods after a while.

-------------------------------------

*To safely gut a Weever* (this was with a ~40cm Weever, caught at 80m depth in the Atlantic, near Tenerife)

Firstly, WEAR LEATHER WORK GLOVES. Never handle one of these bare- if you get stung you're not going to enjoy your dinner.

If you really really *really* want to cook a Weaver, which is apparently one of the best tasting fish (that's anecdotal), you need to prepare it safely. I had it mildy curried and shallow fried, with pommes frites/

It must not ever be smaller than 10cm - and it looks healthy (if dead). DON'T GUT IT FIRST, they are slippery bastards and might get stung before you even start. So, take the spines off.

Use a decent, stiff bladed knife to cut the head, tail and most importantly those nasty buggering spines off. The essential part of this process is that you take the fins off with a 4cm (1,5"") area around, and as far as you can UNDER the fin. The DORSAL needs to come off with at least 4cm either end clear cut, and ALL the way to the backbone beneath. You might lose some tasty looking flesh in doing this, but it'll save your life. Ingesting something that toxic is basically bye-bye time.
Continue to gut the rest of the fish and cook however you see fit.

This safely removes the toxic spines. The reason you take out so much is that the spines' venom/sting/nasty for the heart toxins are generated by cells that spread gradually away from the each individual spine on the fin/dorsal.

Probably better off with Cod, Salmon or Halibut.

Try if you dare. I'm not responsible, but you're better prepared than prior to reading this... Happy fishing!",,False,,t5_2qh7j,False,,,True,t3_1iztcf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/1iztcf/how_to_safely_prepare_weever_fish/,

I dug up what's quoted below.  It mirrors what ballistics data for 220gr 10mm loads tell us.  

In a sentence, if you're hiking in the wilderness of bear country, get familiar with a Delta Elite 1911, Glock 20, or something that shoots 10mm and has a lot of ammo.  

When faced with a surprise life or death situation you will miss, and 4-6 rounds won't cut it.  A double action magnum revolver carries too few bullets and takes too long to reload.  A guide gun carries 4-6 rounds and takes additional time to shoulder.  In decades of wilderness I've been fortunate enough to never have to kill a charging bear in self defense.  The largest I've killed in a hunt was only 400 pounds.  The fact remains, 10mm is the best cartridge on the market for this task.  They're more packable, lighter, carry more ammunition per magazine, and are less prone to failure.

&gt;Alright, spent a while doing some testing for my own benefit. I was attempting to answer 3 questions, but the results could actually help answer several others.

&gt;1) How much of a penalty would a person pay, performance wise, running a reduced load in a .44 Mag, i.e., can a lower velocity load still perform like a higher velocity load with a high SD bullet?

&gt;2) How much performance can be had from a more packable gun, like a 10mm, in comparison to a .44 Mag?

&gt;3) How much difference is there between standard FMJ and hotter loads in the 10mm?

&gt;To answer this I shot spruce, otherwise known as AK ballistic gellatin...


&gt;Here is the general gist.

&gt;.44Mag w/ 300g WFNHCGC @ 1340 penetrated about 13"" of spruce.

&gt;.44Mag w/ 300g WFNHCGC @ 1010 penetrated about 6 1/2"" of spruce.

&gt;10mm w/ 200g HCSWC @ 1000 penetrated about 6 1/2"" of spruce.

&gt;10mm w 180g FMJ @ 1000 penetrated 4 1/2"" of spruce.

&gt;There were several different rounds, but it ended up being 4 180s, 4 200s, and 4 300s (2 each of 2 speeds), so chrono speeds aren't great averages, just ballpark. 

&gt;***My thoughts*** IMO, this shows that if you aren't carrying full tilt+ 44 loads with heavy hardcast, you aren't accomplishing anything particularly special with it. If you choose to download the round for followup shots, it may be acceptable to carry another platform without any major performance penalty. I am not particularly concerned with frontal area of the bullet on a brown bear, because a killing shot isn't going to be one that makes it bleed out, so the .029 larger hole shouldn't be particularly significant. 

&gt;The 200g load has a smaller meplat, which could make some difference in penetration. It was the only one I had, and I figure it makes a best case scenario as long as it doesn't tumble, which it didn't. That being said, I'm not expecting a huge drop in penetration with a slightly larger meplat. 

&gt;With the significant difference between the 1000 and 1340 FPS penetration on the .44, it makes me think that the Buffalo Bore 220g 10mm, which clocks over 1100 FPS, could easily show penetration 75-80%; of the hot loaded .44. Also note, I believe that the 1340 .44 load is over book max, so is there for comparison more so than to show what a .44 is capable of. That being the case, the gap between the hottest Buffalo Bore 10mm and .44 in penetration may not be that large.

On the subject of pistols, he said ""Now, if you can find a cheap gun out there that works for you, great! More money in your pocket! But before *I* buy anything, I ask myself;

*Would I bet my life on this?*

And if the answer is *no*, then I save up for the item I had in mind.""

Vehicle: 1997 Land Rover Discovery with G90 tires (tyres). I've taken it off road on a few trails and it's done great. One day I hope to get a wench for it. 

Communications: ICOM 2200H with enabled D-STAR board(I liked it because it had 65 watts), a Yaesu VX5-R, Yaesu FT-60 and I hope soon to have Yaesu VX-8DR (it has all inclusive built in APRS, GPS, etc.). I also have wire on hand to make a larger antenna if need be. 

Repeater list of California (where I currently live) and Nevada.

Medical kit: I have a decent amount of medical training and pretty much have a mobile mini MASH kit. IV, Sub-Q fluids, tools, local anesthesia, antibiotics, chorohexidine (enough to make 6 gallons worth), many types of anti-inflammatory, a bottle of liquid charcoal, and just about everything else to get you somewhat stabilized. 

Respirator with organic vapor canisters. I work with a lot of chemicals that out-gas cyanide as part of my job, so I usually have one on me at all times, you never know when you'll need it. 

Tampons and kotex pads. Hey, it happens to me about once a month. Tampons are nice because they have a string attached to it, makes for good bait to hang on a branch attract critters when it's all bloody. EDIT: I would advise not doing this around bears. Unless, you have a weapon that can take out a bear, then awesome! Plus the little tubes in the applicator make great straws. Tampons are also nice if you need something that catches on fire easily (the dry cotton that expands several times in volume). Again, keep the tubes/ applicator. 

Machete, Hunting knives. Axe and folding shovel in the Landy. 

Flint and steel striker in addition to some steel wool and 9v battery. 

Mechanical Pencil lead (hook it up to your car battery. Makes an amazing flare, but burns your car battery out quick. Also melts any cables you have). 
Alligator clips

Jumper cables

ratchet set/tool box. I have a Land Rover, it's pretty much a must to take a tool box with you on expeditions.
Small mirror

Tent (take this when I go camping

Sleeping bag (again, same as above)

a pot.

Clothes. I'm a woman and therefore usually have about 5 changes of clothes in my truck at any given time.

Body Jewelry. Can make great fishing lures along with a worm, or a piece of cow patty if you are hunting catfish. Fishing hook and some wire snare. 

Telescopic snake hook. Holds an 8 lb snake pretty easily. Great for moving vipers and fits in my backpack. 

2 Gallons of water in the truck at all times. The jugs are also handy.

Water purification kit.

 In addition to a large packet of beef jerky and several servings of Muscle Milk protein powder with branch-chained amino acids. It's a quick meal in a pinch. Just add water.

I spent most of this morning with this new toy. I was digging up feral edibles in a gravel pit. hacking at grasses, small bushes, and trees suitable for shelter building, and I got to say I'm in love. This shovel has instantly become one of my favorite pieces of kit. It feels safer than a machete and better suited for hacking away at ground level. It shipped very sharp and made short work of the grasses I harvested. I was crunching through tons of stone, bits of concrete rubble etc without really damaging the edge.

I've seen the collapsible shovels before, never bought one because they felt so jankey, the cold steel shovel is solid, really fucking solid. given enough time, and a suitable location I could totally build a little dugout shelter with this tool. It's worth it. My only complaint is that it should come with a nice kydex sheath stock, also being sharp on all sides of the spade one cannot really baton split. not a problem if you have other tools, but it would have been better to leave at least one surface thicker and unsharpened. just thought I'd share my report.",,False,,t5_2qh7j,False,,,True,t3_o4o1l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/o4o1l/special_forces_shovel_with_sheath_cold_steel_high/,

It was a very educational experience and I figured I can share my mistakes for your education/entertainment.
Here are a few things NOT to do when attempting to create an ember with a bow drill:

* Know which trees are which. Choosing a random piece of dry wood might not be the best solution unless you were trying to just get a face full of smoke. Also, there aren't any conveniently placed planks in the forest. Have the tools to properly split a dead branch for your hearth.

* Don't half-ass the knots on your bow, they have a tendency to come undone at the most inopportune moments.

* Don't half-ass the hole in your handhold. Carving a hole in a rock with another rock is frustrating but having your drill sail into the bushes because it wasn't held in place firmly isn't any fun either.

* The bow doesn't need to be as thick as your wrist. It gets heavy, fast.

* Don't rub the bowline against your shoe unless you're looking to add some new air slits to it.

* Just because you haven't made a fire doesn't mean the drill set isn't really, really hot.

* Do not use a crooked drill. 'kinda straight' pieces of wood make for an 'interesting' drilling experience.

* Don't start with too short of a drill (even if it is the only straight part of the branch). It tends to get magically shorter as you go along.

* Lastly and I think my favorite ""not to do"" item; Don't try to bow-drill on an upwards slope of uncleared forest floor unless you want your bow to pull a big pile of dirt and wet leaves onto your hearth just as it starts smoking.

Hey /r/survival.

I've been lurking around here for a while, after a growing interest in learning essential survival skills recently. I'm lucky to have quite a bit of woodland near my home, so I'm planning on a few day excursions over the next few weeks to hone my skills.

Background: I was in the Scouts from a very young age, and I left about 2 years ago. I feel that I know more than the average person about survival, but still not enough to be able to capably look after myself for an extended period of time. Time to fix that! I'm hoping to take part in some expedition work next year which will involve me being out of my comfort zone, in the wild. Over the next few months I'd like to develop essential skills and build a strong kit that I can rely on to properly prepare myself for future endeavours. 

Now, all I have so far is a nice 5.11 backpack and a copy of the SAS Survival Guide, which I'm currently reading through. 

I want to start by practising basic stuff such as the following: 

- Building different types of fire and being proficient at lighting them using different methods e.g. lighter, firesteel, flint, magnifying glass (solar), matches and so on. 
- Be able to identify wood and effectively collect and process tinder, kindling and larger wood. 
- Be able to set up a 'base camp' - so clearing the area, putting up a tarp/shelter and/or using the natural area to create shelter and protection. 
- Knots, need to practise these.
- Fishing? If I can find somewhere.

If there are any other skills you want to encourage as basic requirements, please do.

Kit-wise, I'm not sure what I need to be packing. I want to buy functional, multipurpose items and slowly build up my kit as I need it. It makes no sense to splurge on something like a tent and cooking set when I'll initially just be spending a few hours a day getting to grips with the area. I've done a little research on this sub and a few other forums, and here's what I'm planning to get so far:

**Edged tools:**

- Knife - Mora Companion Stainless. Orange sheath for visibility. (I don't want to splurge on a 'big' knife like a Becker BK2 yet, and I hear that Moras are fantastic.
- Multitool - I'm in two minds as to whether I need one of these or not. Leatherman have nice offerings, but they aren't exactly cheap. 
- Hatchet - not immediately, but I think this could be really useful for chopping wood rather than using my Mora to baton. I'm not sure though. Looked at Fiskars X7 and really like it. 

**Fire:** (You could argue that I don't need all these, but most items are super cheap and tiny so it makes sense to carry them)

- ~~Firesteel - Light My Fire ones any good?~~ PURCHASED
- Waterproof matches.
- Lighter
- Magnification glass
- Cotton balls soaked in vaseline and shoved into a film tube- Apparently these make great, cheap firestarters.

**Shelter:**

Okay, this is the area which I'm a bit stuck on. I could get a tarp, and that is pretty big and multifunctional. I've also seen 'survival blankets' which look good, as well as ponchos, but the disadvantage is that both of them don't cover the same area as a decent tarp. 

I will be making natural shelters too, but I'd really like something that I can rely on and put up quickly for shelter, use as a floor cover, and so on. Suggestions are appreciated!

- 15m/50"" Atwood 550lb paracord. 

**Other:** 

- I have 2 x 1L bottles that will be fine for now for carrying water.
- Bandana/Buff? - cheap and multipurpose.
- Waterproof notepad to record what I do. 

**First Aid:**

I have a small first aid kit, but I don't think it is geared towards a survival situation. Ideally I want it equipped to deal with cuts, grazes and wounds, which is vital if I'm going to be carrying edged tools with me. I need to do some more research in this area. I have a Red Cross handbook (I volunteer as a first responder) which I'll use for reference and to build a better picture of what I need. I'm curious to know what you guys consider to be first aid essentials though. 

If there's anything that I've overlooked, please let me know. I want to purchase stuff that is good value, multipurpose and durable; items that allow me to focus on developing the skills I need to survive.

Also, I'm located in the UK, so please bear that in mind when recommending items.

I love the style and functionality, but I couldn't fit my gear for 2-3 weeks of survival in it (well I could -- but I'm not willing to go *that* far).

I love to camp and I have a 70 liter big hikers backpack, but most of the time I only fill it halfway because most of my camping stuff is ultralight/compact, and I do not require much comfort to be happy. I can be a bit impulsive, so I would like to always have most of my basic camping gear with me.

Neither my current 70 liter backpack nor my current 25 liter daily commuter bag fill this requirement.

-----------

An ideal backpack for me:

 * wouldn't make me look like I'm scaling the himalayas... 
 * a bag that could be carried in every day situations without everybody looking at me (because I will use it for work as well)
 * but still nearly indestructable and weatherproof (doesn't have to be waterproof, but a fitting cover would be nice
 * about 35-40l (10 US Gallons) sized, 
 * preferably black/gray/green/natural color
 * multiple compartments, space for a hydration bag, attachment for drinking tubing
 * comfortable of course!
 * some form of modularity (easy attachment of pouches).

---------

It seems to me that bags between 25l and 60l are hard to find, and when I find them they are often smaller ""hiker backpacks"" rather than slightly bigger ""emergency/survival kits"".

I was wondering if anyone had any experience using either one of the Escort [1000 ml](http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/SportsRec/Camping/WaterStorageBottlesTreatment/PRD~0760564P/Escort+Stainless+Steel+Wide+Mouth+Bottle%2C+1000+mL.jsp?locale=en) or the [750 ml](http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/SportsRec/Camping/WaterStorageBottlesTreatment/PRD~0760563P/Escort+Stainless+Steel+Wide+Mouth+Bottle%2C+750+mL.jsp?locale=en) water bottles for boiling water in a fire.    
    

- **Edit #1**: I am curious whether or not the walls are thick enough to be able to withstand the heat if its place right in the coals and if there is a coating inside that may leech into the water. Basically I am hoping this is a cheaper version of a Kleen Kanteen or stainless steel Nalgene bottle.

- **Edit #2**: I have emailed Canadian Tire the question and they are looking into it. I will post their reply for anyone else interested.    

- **Edit #3**: I'm still waiting for a response from Canadian Tire.    

- **Edit #4**: Just went to [MEC (Mountain Equipment Co-op)](http://www.mec.ca/Main/home.jsp) in Barrie and they have some ""[Filzer Kewl](http://www.filzer.com/products.php?id=115)"" 1L water bottles on clearance (Not on MEC's website any more because they are clearing them out) for $7.75 CAD which have no coatings inside. Just thought I would let you guys know.    

- **Edit #5**: I finally got a response from Canadian Tire:  

Thank you for contacting our office regarding the Escort Stainless Steel Water Bottle. Please accept our sincere apologies for the delay in responding as we wanted to ensure we obtained the manufacturer's feedback. They have advised our office that they do not recommend using the bottle for boiling water. They add that it's not the purpose and the effects are unknown. We thank you for providing us with the opportunity to respond.

****
Hi /r/survival. I've enjoyed this reddit immensely, read a lot and after careful thought, begun to construct my own kit.

I'm a well established outdoors man, however there have always been some bits lacking in my personal kit. I plan to create a BoB [bug out bag] just as much as a usable, long distance hiking pack that I can be self reliant with. I've not much money, so go easy when it comes to the blades and other bits. Who knows, I might be able to afford suggestions/upgrades as time goes by. I'm open to this as I want to allow others to tag along with me in time to come. I'll post pics of the complete kit on this thread when the mail man brings it.

* Blades:

MORA Bushcraft hi-carbon (the yellow one)

Bear Grylls Compact Parang Machete

Gerber Multitool I've had for ages

Micro scalpel (my spare craftblade, for splinters and such like, carving hooks)


* First aid (in a sealed tupperware)

2x Foil Hypothermia Blankets (in case one blows away on the mountain tops)

2x Triangular bandages

Micropore tape/a few compeed/that kinda stuff

Antiseptic wipes

(+more I'll list when I photograph)

* Sleeping kit

Sleeping bag (dependant on season, Snugpak winter, Gelert Lightweight summer)

Lifeventure Hammock, with slings

Paracord tarp support (+ significant length for backup)

Artiach Compact (therma) sleeping mat

Camo net (I like to hide out) 7""x7"" MOD issue (I've got good mates)

Waterproof Tarp

* Clothing


Underlayers from my whitewater kayaking days

MTP british army issue jacket, ski trousers (decent waterproofing basically) 

Lightwieght Rab walking waterproof

My lovely LOWA boots

Stinky socks

Tube of travel wash, for in-river washing of stinky socks

Various time-of-year applicable headgear, handgear

* Carrying all this

80 liter Vango backpack that's served me well for 12+ years up and down every mountain I can throw at it. 
Yes, it really ought to be replaced, but it's going good for now.

Bergen cover (can hold most of the gear listed should pack break down completely

Waterproof linings of various sizes for different depts of kit

A few plastic bags

* Hunting

--- this is the bit I need help with ---

Snares -- where do I buy one? Can I build a decent one/set at home and take them out?

Yo-Yo fishing reel, can't wait to test this baby. Might be ace, might be crap, but it's fun to try anyway.

*Some* experience of tracking.

I'm in the UK so no guns :(  Although I've an air rifle that might be sufficient for squirrels/unruly pigeons.

* To cook what I've hunted

Various Firesteels

Magnesium block w/firesteel (worn out a bit now)

A bunch of Waxed non safety Matches

mess tin with lid-cum-shallow-container and handle

*missing item: water purification, iodine probably in here, can't afford purifier yet, but won't be outside UK for a year at least*

* Navigation

Various maps of landscapes around UK, 1.25000 &amp; 1.50000

Compass (oh yeah, and my hi-db whistle)

Knowledge of stars, sun, moon direction, plus built in pigeon gps.

Actual GPS (Garmin XYZ I've forgotten, with the back sealed with vaseline for immersion proofing [proven to work on rivers!])

Mobile phone, GS3, wouldn't rely on this much though.

(Mini) Binoculars, so I don't have to walk all the way to that point to see what's there.

~~~

I've run out now, can't think of more, I'm sure there are a few bits I've omitted but this is a fairly comprehensive list thus far.

Cheers!

Oh yeah, loo roll.

**The inevitable additions** 'tings i forgot bra..

Flashlight/headtorch : preferably LED. Hard to buy anything else these days.

Sunglasses &amp; sunscreen (for obvious reasons in hot, bright climates). Didn't think of that, mostly because I'm in Britain. *cue the rainy day jokes*

Duck tape : also, electical tape.

Superglue, for those monster wounds you can't patch up right.

Some kind of hatchet? Dont forget we're workin on *one backpack* here. Things in hands aint great.

Wire saw with strops (I expect it to break pretty soon on)

Home made snares - wire and 550 line.... let's see

Mousetraps!! (why not!!) [ps I'm not a nutter, I understand and utterly adhere to the rules of the road concerning animals, trapping, hunting and all the law that relates. I pay license/Licences to the appropriate parties, landowners, gamekeepers or the ngbs. Just to make it crystal clear.]

Diphenhydramine, aspirin, ibuprofen, and lomotil for your first aid kit. Gauze sponges also. [cheers, ligament](http://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/16oid2/im_getting_my_first_survival_kit_together_input/c7xys6h)

[100m roll of paracord](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Paracord-Commercial-Strand-100ft-BLACK/dp/B00864OILE/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358356521&amp;sr=8-2)

The ten and retrospectively obvious [ten essentials](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Essentials) as raised by SeanUR, thank you sir.


I still need to buy food over and above this list above- if suggestions are going to come in, then make it relvant to 4 days away as that's my max in terms of money, actual time and so on... I am willing to take actual -UK purchase-able suggestions - I mean... why not??!


Don't forget survivalists, I'll be updating this thread in the days to come. . . If you like - request videos/kit reviews on whatever bit 'o kit you want to know about, and I'll try to line it up for when I get out there. Hmmm. reddit does funny things to you doesn't it?!!?

Exposure to the elements, dehydration and hunger are of course the most central problems that anyone faces in a survival situation. But depending on where in the world one attempts to survive, different hazards exist. In this post I want to limit the discussion to flora and fauna, ie. plantlife and animals.

Even the most well equipped survivalists will perish if they consume deadly mushrooms. And a bear encounter will ruin anyones day. 

**Those reading this, think about and answer these three questions.** 

1. What is the most and second most dangerous plant in your area?

2. What is the most and second most dangerous animal in your area?

3. What steps have you taken to limit the danger from these?

I greatly appreciate all of the feedback I have received, and will continue to track this post should anything else come up.

And upvotes all around to everyone who came to help.

I'm a mild doomer with love of many ""preparedness"" and ""surivalist"" topics and I was wondering what is YOUR must-haves and must-avoids for living in a post apocalyptic world when it comes to housing.

Here are a couple of mine.


**Must haves:** 
Nearby Water source

Close to woods for fire building and trapping game

Close enough to the city to still make a living at a good job

Enough land to raise chickens/goats and start learning to plant a garden



**Must avoids:**
Far enough away from civilization to avoid nuclear fallout and city exodus (can't avoid all fallout but you can avoid shockwaves and some of the smaller nuclear explosions)

Avoid areas where mobs would form (suburbs/cities and areas in between).


**Optional wants:**
A defensible position (backed up to a lake or high up)

Natural caves on property

Well already dug

I've seen people use up to 1/8 of pocket survival kits (think Altoid tin) just to carry a whistle in it. Unlike most items, whistles only serve a single purpose, which not only is already fulfilled by many other ""signaling"" items, but doesn't actually require any special tool. A whistle is a boring one trick pony.

Can't people simply whistle using their fingers? I mean, it's not that difficult to do and it's pretty loud.

They say that the more you know, the less you have to carry. Why does so few people apply that principle to whistles?

I would also like to know if there's any data/story demonstrating the actual usefulness of whistles. I never heard any story where a whistle saved a person, but maybe that's just because they're so common and boring. I just want to know what justify this single purpose item to be part of even the most basic survival kits.

It was overall pretty sweet. We(my parents, 2 brothers, my gal and I) went for my dads birthday and my SO was probably the only person that not  familiar with Survivorman and his other exploits/shows. He started with a video then came out and played guitar with a percussionist and another guitar player(both were pretty good). The 3ish hour show was about an equal mix of music/music with video/Q and A. Most of us agreed that he could have had some story's ready to tell and it would have been a bit more enjoyable.

 Almost everything he talked about stemmed from a question. I appreciated it because my brothers and I were all called on and got decent responses. He was only asked about Bear Gryll's a few times and most were indirect. His answers were somewhat smug, but I think he is somewhat entitled to that smugness. He actually cited Cody from dual survival as the most capable of other Survival show hosts which makes me think I should watch that show more then the one episode I got through. 

His music was pretty similar to the recordings he has put out. I wish he had played harmonica a bit more cause he jammed on it, but he was good at guitar too. He also played piano for one song. He played 6 or 7 origanal songs and 3 covers. Hard sun by Eddie vedder, Wish you were here by Pink floyd and Wild world By Yusef Islam(Cat Stevens( Steven Georgiou) . They all sounded good and a lot of people were singing along. He had video for a few songs. One of his videos is a bit dorky but most have a lot of awesome shots.

I saved the best part for last. At somepoint someone asked him a kind of wierd question(cant recall what it was). He giggled and said  something like 
'Is this reddit ? are we doing an A-M-ORIA or something A?' I shouted out 
'Yes, you should do one!!' And pointed at him really hard. He pointed way hard back and was like
'I'm working on it! we just need to figure out when!'
So thats pretty rad.

Tldr: Pretty much what you would expect it to be. Very enjoyable, 99% family friendly(dropped the f bomb after fudging a lyric from big hard sun), and pretty dorky.

I couldn't fulfill any gear/signature requests as it was cash only and i'm broke. Sorry!

Edit: Disclaimer - I have not tried harvesting or processing Chaga myself (yet). Please do so only after thorough research and consulting with an expert or two.

1246079676.0,15,self.Survival,8w42d,"In retrospect, I was never in any danger of dying. It was tough to convince myself of that at the time though. ",19,4,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/8w42d/in_retrospect_i_was_never_in_any_danger_of_dying/,"Note: Killarney Park is a large wilderness canoe/hiking area in Ontario Canada. 

At first I thought it was a bit of lark. At first I thought it was going to make a fun story to share around the campfire.

Later I realized that being scared silly is a great story only in the light of day. Living it...well, it was a - for real - scary story. 

Those are never fun. 

Here is how it happened: 

My brother and I decided on a last minute trip to Killarney. And, in our arrogance, we decided that the big loop through Killarney Lake, Three Narrows, Muriel, OSA and eventually back to George Lake was eminently doable. 

Our arrogance was not that we were doing this trip. It has been done many, many times before. Our arrogance was that we thought we could start so late in the day...

We left the George Lake beach after 5:00 in the evening. It was going to be earlier, but unexpected last minute demands by my boss and the unexpected (but really all too predictable) delays on the highway resulted in a later start than even my pessimism predicted.

Really no problems so far. We make remarkably quick time in the canoe (given my all too obvious commitment to fatty foods) and we are at the Killarney Lake /  Three Narrows portage in very good time. 

The portage into Three Narrows and on to our eventual campsite was well within our reach and at least marginally within the limited daylight available to us. 

Just the three kilometre portage, a quick paddle/tiny portage and then we set up the tent in time for bed. 

Easy right?

Well, if it were THAT easy, this would not be much of a story.

A quick note on our portage method is warranted here - My brother and I do one and half portages. He takes the canoe the entire length of the portage. I take a pack ½ way, drop it off and return to the start of the portage for the second pack. In the meantime, my brother has dropped off the canoe and walks back along the portage to the pack I dropped off earlier and returns to our destination lake. 

By this method, we each walk the portage just one and a half times. In an ideal world, we are at opposite ends of the portage at the same time but end up at the far end of the portage at the same time. Of course it never works out that way but, through experience, we often get close. 

And on this night we were busting our humps. We got to the start of the three kilometre portage while there was still plenty of light. My workhorse of a brother quickly picked up the canoe and hustled down the trail. I followed soon after with a great big mother of a pack. 

After what I estimated to be about half of the length of the three kilometre portage I dropped the first pack and headed back for the second pack.

But an unexpected thing happened on the way back to Killarney Lake – it got dark. Sure it MIGHT have been light out on the lake but under the cover of the trees it was dark. Frankly REALLY dark. 

And that was not the worst  - our only flashlights were in the pack I had left half way down the trail. 

I carried on back towards Killarney Lake. How bad could it be? (Hint: the fact that I asked this rhetorical question suggests that it gets really bad.)

So. Well before I get back to Killarney Lake, it gets COMPLETELY dark. So dark in fact that I can no longer follow the trail. I tried. There was really nothing to do. I stopped walking, lit a small fire out of the twigs I could easily find and sat down with the expectation that my brother would come find me with a flashlight he surely had on his person somewhere.

You, dear reader see this coming but it did not occur to me (initially) at the time. My brother was in the same predicament as I but on the other end of the portage – with his flashlight securely ensconced with mine in the pack I had dropped off earlier. 

He (quite reasonably) did exactly was I did – hunker down with a fire and waited for me.

So it turns out we both spent lonely nights on near opposite ends of a three kilometre portage. Each with a small fire. Each worried about the other. Neither of us with a flashlight, a sleeping bag or a tent, each expecting rescue by a flashlight bearing brother – at least initially.

Oh, if that were the end of the story I would be a happy man. Oh how I wish that I could report that I spent an uncomfortable night and was reunited with my brother soon after first light the next day.

Alas no. 

I found in the first light of day that my wandering the night before had resulted in my NOT being on the portage at all. I woke (because I eventually DID sleep) to find that I had spent the night in the middle of F*CKING nowhere! I had apparently wandered off the trail in the gathering gloom the previous evening. 

So what now? I had no idea which direction to travel in and had no idea if my brother had been wandering the trail all night looking for me. 

What I was sure of however was that I was hyperventilating from panic and I did what any panic stricken, overweight, forty- something, Survivorman-wanna-be would do in this situation – I yelled and screamed and cried just a little. 

When none of that worked, I walked downhill – always downhill - through muddy streams, bogs, skin tearing underbrush and within easy reach (I imagined) of multiple famished bears). 

I figured eventually I would hit a lake. I eventually did – Killarney Lake it turns out but I did not know it right away. I managed to hail a couple out on the water (by this point it was mid-morning) who were reasonable and reassuring. They took me in their canoe  back to the start of the portage and accompanied me along the trail until I found my brother (who was walking back towards Killarney Lake at the time). 

Once reunited, we eventually brought everything back to Killarney Lake (and yes, we never left each other’s side on that portage) and spent two more nights on Killarney enjoying the security of each other’s company before heading back to the car and home on the Monday. 

The moral of the story?

None. 

There are quite a few things we did wrong. It is easy to see them now sitting as you are at your comfortable desk with the confidence that comes with electric light and four strong walls to protect you. 

I guess if there is any moral at all, it is this...Don’t be stupid.

I've been playing with an idea for some years now.
I have a dream and a hope that one of you people out there behind the screen can help me.

I have lived in the Capital Region of Denmark for all my life more or less, but I have always loved being in nature, and less ""stressful life"" of 1000 + people around you.
the only person I really have known that when a good and great outdoor &amp; bushman have been my father.
But he unfortunately died way to early .. and I've never really picked up on it before it was too late ... : (

I have searched for quite sometime now for a course in outdoor survival and bushcraft in Sweden &amp; Norway and even the United States.
But all off them have been for a very short period of 2-4 days or maybe a week at most ..

some my question really is, do any of you know of a survival &amp; bushcraft course or a website that offers this kind of traning? I hope to find something for 3 + months

It's something I need to get on with in my life, to ""honor"" my dad, but also to get a free space for the normal big city life

Assuming you are in wilderness survival situation, one thing that I believe is often overlooked is eye protection. Survival in the woods requires many activities that present great danger to the eyes. Wood chopping/processing, walking through dense brush, UV damage, random dirt/grit, embers from crackling fires, and etc. Eye injuries are extremely hard to treat in the wilderness and can be just as devastating as breaking an arm or leg. 

This recently hit home for me because a friend, and fellow enthusiast, was chopping wood and got a large sliver in his eye. Still doesn't know if he will see from it again. Could have easily been avoided.

This brings me to the non-depressing and fun part, gear recommendations and reviews! I was hoping someone can suggest some good eye protection options for survival? 
Personally I want something a bit better than the basic safety glasses from Home Depot. I am looking for some that are polarized anti-glare, have UV Protection, and are comfortable enough for constant wear. Maybe I should be looking Military grade? Please help out with some ideas. Thanks!

1341348444.0,15,self.Survival,vzx1b,Received in the mail today: ILBE USMC Marpat backpack. (First impressions [pictures included]),21,6,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/vzx1b/received_in_the_mail_today_ilbe_usmc_marpat/,"(disclaimer, this is my first real suspension backpack; constructive criticisms of the bag and/or review are welcome)

[Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/TSjRI) ^(I apologize for the graininess.)

I was looking for a well-made/well-designed pack with a good amount of options, and space. I heard nothing but good things about the ILBE USMC Marine issued backpacks, and I decided to put down some cash on an [ILBE USMC MARPAT](http://www.ilbepack.com/). Most of these packs are used, and I found the pricing ranged from ~$75 for the main pack, and ~$125-$150 for the complete pack. I was able to find some new on ebay, so I broke down and bought a new one for $235.

I wanted something that would last me for life, and would work as a plain survival pack, hunting pack, or even a BOB. It would need to have plenty of space, as well as have options for attaching plenty of gear to the bag itself and I really wanted a pocket that would hold a rifle. Running through the bag today, I am satisfied to say that it has all of these qualities. 

Details:

- Digital Woodland Camo (Good for hunting game/ Staying hidden)
- 4500 Cubic Inches.
- TONS of compression straps. 
- Two strap systems on the back to hold a sleeping bag, and tent (or other items).
- Pockets on the sides, as well as 'tunneling loops' towards the top of the bag to hold a rifle, axe, or canteen system. 
- A detachable 'lid' with plenty of inside storage.
- A detachable ""Radio"" compartment bag on the inside.
- A 6 point detachable 'divider' to divide contents into 2 sections.
- 2 side access zippers.
- Lots of MOLLE webbing.
- Great suspension system.
- Other features.

This bag is very well made. There is double stitching on most areas, the zippers are very heavy duty and are tied on the ends with paracord wrapped in heavy duty rubber tubing.

As a quick suspension test, I loaded the main compartment with about 30lbs of gear, and with the pack on - I barely feel encumbered.

The only criticism that I can come up with, is that I would have liked to see a few more pockets whether in/on the main pack and/or the lid. But some people honestly prefer it better that way.

I can go on about this bag all day, but until I field test it, I can't really give it a ""true"" review. I will most likely make a 'field review' post, and show pictures of the bag with my loadout.

As a novice survivalist, I am definitely satisfied with the purchase. I probably could have gotten something that would have gotten me by just fine for less money. However, when it comes to my life- I don't mind putting in an extra few dollars.

So, as the title says, I'm looking for something durable and reliable for general outdoors use. I'm not up to anything extreme, but I grew up in a household where the screw in front of you would be screwed in with a knife or a screwdriver depending on what was closer to hand.

Camping, some casual whittling, and general use.

Currently, I'm considering the [1] KA-BAR USMC because I'm a sap for the WW2 generation and I'm probably just falling for the ""military-style"" marketing ploy.

My budget is somewhat flexible, but I'd prefer not to go above $50 if I can avoid it. I'm not too concerned about aesthetics, just functionality.

Any suggestions fellows?

EDIT: Okay, I'm liking the other opinions on the KA-BAR since that's where I was leaning in the first place. Now, a quick run by Amazon revealed the knife selling for only $50 where KA-BAR is charging $90-100 for it. This makes me a little suspicious. All the reviews are either very good, or are complaining only about the sheath which is supposedly not made in the U.S. like the knife itself. For anyone interested, here's the[ link](http://www.amazon.com/KA-BAR-Marine-Fighting-Knife-Straight/dp/B001H53Q6M).

~~Now, the $40 drop is a pretty big drop. I know all the reviews are good, but what are the chances that knife is fake?~~ Answered

EDIT 2: Okay, so I'm back to questioning the previous choice! There are a lot of complaints about the KA-BAR being a ""tacticool"" knife... my biggest draw towards it is that it's a big, heavy blade, and I've never heard any review about it that hasn't mentioned that the things are virtually impossible to damage without going out of one's way to do so. I like a big, thick blade because I'd likely end up using it to pry, ~~dig~~, cut somewhat thick materials, add torque, and a lot of the rough stuff like that. I don't entertain any fantasies about fighting with it. I'm trained in martial arts, and I'm fully aware that a knife fight is the last thing I want. Moreover, I'm more proficient with my bare hands. 

For bushcraft uses (my upcoming camping trip) these Mora's are being touted as being really good for that use. My one question, then, I suppose, is whether they can stand up to the beating I'd be describing above?

I have been going over some of the internet forums and various other sites about bug out vehicles or Get Out Of Dodge transportation. I have found some things I agree with and some things I disagree with. Here is my ideal vehicle with a list of supplies in order to succeed in getting where you need to go.
First of all is the vehicle. I am choosing a 1988-1998 GM heavy duty truck that has a 8 foot bed (long bed) and a quad cab. The gas powerplant would be swapped with a cummins 12 valve inline six diesel engine coupled with a manual transmission. Why diesel? Diesel engines last longer and are built to higher stress specifications than gasoline, diesel achieves better fuel economy, diesel provides much more torque, diesel fuel has a longer shelf life than gasoline, and there are alternatives fuels that you can run in a diesel engine (vegetable oil, A-1 type jet fuel, etc.). The reason I chose a 12 valve 5.9 liter cummins is that it has mechanical injection (compared to electronic) and it is easier to work on.
So here is a list of supplies (including the vehicle):
GM pickup 4 door quad cab long bed with 5.9 cummins swap (manual transmission), 4X4 emp protected starter, non electronic ignition auxiliary fuel tank (for extended range) bolt cutters (for gas station locking lids) truck cap [1] http://www.4are.com/product/v/gallery.php front brush guard with 12,000 lb winch towing line locking fuel caps hand crank fuel transfer pump with filter (since gas stations will not have power) extra oil, fuel filters, oil filters, coolant, power steering and brake fluid, transmission fluid, transfer case oil, differential oil extra parts: starter, alternator, serpentine belt, thermostat, glow plugs, bulbs, fuses, headlights mechanic manuals (chilton, motor) tool set: both metric and SAE, electrical and duct tape, wrenches, sockets, Allen wrenches, breaker bar, torque stick, jack, non electrical air pump for tires radio antenna ham and cb radio flares flashlights batteries perserved food, cooking supplies, stove water, refillable water containers, water filter, iodine tablets hunting knife, bowie knife, leatherman high powered rifle with scope, long barreled high capacity 12 gauge shotgun, pistol (all with plenty of ammo, parts, and cleaning supplies) gps, maps (local, state, national) first aid kit flashlights, batteries trailer hitch skid plates for truck drive train
This is just a simple list. Tell me what you think and your examples of a G.O.O.D. vehicle.

The ""sisc"" is so strong I couldn't break it by hand, But I'm not sure what the breaking strength actually is.

I didn't purchase this for survival purposes (as I've heard every argument pointing towards rifles with minimal moving parts, ie, bolt-actions), but in the event, does anyone have a clue on what the greatest length of time is I could use the rifle without maintenance and with little to no problems?

I ask this primarily because soviet weapons seem to have a reputation for being neigh indestructible. I've read many stories about the SKS being used as ""the poor man's hunting rifle"", so I have no doubt it'd do the trick for bagging game of all sizes.

Also, for the bolt-action experts: what higher caliber rifle would you recommend? I've read all about CZs and Marlins being the best .22 bolt actions, but I'd like to know their higher caliber equivalents.

Do outdoor equipment stores often carry some kind of telescoping poles that would fit tents of differing sizes or that can be cut to size? (I doubt it..)

So, if I were to go to a big hardware or home improvement store what kind of materials should I think of buying that could be used to contruct a replacement? I was thinking some form of pvc pipe or similar plastic tubing that was flexible enough to stretch through the sleeve and could be cut to size... but then how would you guys construct the ends so that they'd taper to fit into the metal circle where the poles touch the ground?

Thanks for any suggestions!

I have been following you for years but not till recently have I begun to understand what it is I am learning from watching your ordeals.  Not an serious outdoorsman myself, I respect your survival and primitive living skills, but there are life lessons running deep through your work that are translatable far beyond simply sustaining one’s life.  Surely you have heard the adage ‘eat to live, not live to eat’ which should be every survivalist’s creed, but honestly I think you prove a different point.  Out in the bush you will be nearly starving to death and all you can find to eat is rotting animal fat, insect larva, mice and all manner of things no comfortable living city dweller could stomach.  But you, a lost, starving man with few options, always thoroughly enjoy whatever the world offers you to sustain life.  This lesson goes so far beyond survival.  Everyone needs to breathe to stay alive, but life is so much more worth living when you truly love each breath.  You are a man of composure, control, and zen.  You don’t hold grudges and you are quick to forgive your bad luck.  In your film Stranded, as you struggled for ten hours to make an ember with the fire bow, you didn’t once curse or give up; you accepted your situation and did not curse or lash out.  You love being alive and thus you love anything that sustains it.   Caught up in my life in the city of Chicago, it has become a series of goals that increasingly lack meaning.  Get the degree, get the job, get the girl, get the house, make some babies.  I work hard to get to these waypoints but I have little love the process of getting there.  It lacks meaning.  Observing you gives one an idea of how to live well, but I have a feeling these true revelations can only come through experience, by being in places where you have to take the stance that you want to live; where you have to fight for the life you love.  In Snowshoes and Solitude you say that living primitive is suited for villages and that being alone would be considered a punishment.  If you ever do decide to make that village, I would love to be your snowshoe maker.

Thank you so much for your time and stay safe out there- you really are helping people.  Your fan and student,

Finally I got a free weekend and my brother and I decided to do it. We looked at a few different areas before finally deciding on Wayne National Forest in Southern Ohio. The trail was 15 miles long in a big loop and was not as easy trail as it was in Appalachia country and had tons of large hills. 

Long story short on the setup here, we failed to control our alpha male ""screw precautions we can do this with nothing"" thought process. It was the middle of march with an average temp of around 40-50 during the day and dropping to the 20's at night. We took no tents, no sleeping bags, very little food, some small fire kindling I got from walmart, and water.

STORY: 

We got to the trail head at about 12:30pm and started our hike. It seemed easy enough at first, there were groups of boy scouts camping everywhere and it was fairly flat where the land was concerned. The temp was higher than usual at around 65 and the sun was shining strong. We decided to travel 7.5 miles the first day and finish the other half of the hike on day two. 

The first day was beautiful! We walked through a few small patches of pine forest, came across an old wooden moonshine still, a beautiful pond, and a mid size stream with a awesome waterfall about 5 feet high. We got carried away and just kept walking and walking. The first mistake we made was not making any effort to track how far we had gone We were enjoying the scenery so much that we lost track of time, we had hiked for 4 hours but at the time it didn't seem like we did. We finally got exhausted and set up camp around 6pm on a small patch of ground about 40 feet off the trail. It was on a slight hill but decent for a shelter. 

I built a simple shelter. A large stick held up by two trees, with alot of smaller branches to make the roof. I then buried the shelter in dead leafs. It was small but decent. Behind our campsite was a small pine forest, and the area didn't have enough dead branches to feed a fire for the entire night. So we ended up using the pine wood for the fire as there was tons of it there. Little did I know just how much smoke Pine wood created, it was almost unbearable...but the sun was going down and it was all we had. We were so exhausted at this point that our hands were shaking, so we used the last hour of daylight to rest a bit because we were simply out of gas. 

Once the sun went down we immediately regretted not bringing supplies. Out of nowhere a simple overnight hike turned into a real survival situation. The temp dropped to the mid 20's, we used a ton of energy on the hike and setting up camp and my body was screaming for nutrients and I had none. It was so cold we were unable to sleep. The shelter held no heat so we were forced to lay as close to the fire as we could handle just to stay warm. so close in fact that the side of my brothers boot had melted without him even noticing. Everytime we would start to fall asleep the fire would go out, and the cold would wake us up half frozen to death. Needless to say we got zero sleep that night, and had nothing but water to put in our bellies. 

The moment the sun came up we hit the trail. Like I said earlier we were not keeping track of how far we had traveled the day before, and decided that going back the way we came would be shorter than finishing the rest of the trail. The sun was up but the temp had dropped drastically from the day before, never getting above freezing. We were both tired, hungry and much more out of shape than we thought. Each uphill climb became harder and harder as my body quickly lost strength. I had noticed that lifting my head made me dizzy, and out of fear of passing out kept my eyes on the ground. Every single step I took was an achievement, simply because I was still conscious. 2 hours into the hike back I quickly realized that just how far we had traveled the day before and were wrong to go back the way we came. At one point I finally started to lose my will, I laid in the grass just wanting to give up. It was so cold I could no longer move my fingers. The effort I was putting into the hike had my body covered in sweat yet I was freezing and shaking. I didn't think I was going to make it back, My body just refused to move. I then realized that I was in a heavily wooded area with very thin trails and there was no way for any rescue teams to reach me. I knew that I had no choice but to keep walking. So I got up and kept putting one foot in front of the other, silently saying to myself ""keep going, keep going, each step brings you closer"" another 2 hours passed and we finally seen the parking lot. I then realized that I had just had my first near death experience. Part of me was ready to just lay down and quit, but I made it. 

So what was the reason for me telling this story (as bad at story telling as I may be)? NEVER make the mistake of purposely putting yourself in a survival situation unprepared. Take precautions and take supplies!

-I didn't have a map
-I didn't track my progress
-I didn't read the weather report for the weekend
-I didn't prepare for the cold
-I didn't think, that with the season we were in I wouldn't be able to find food

don't make the same mistakes I did...it's not a fun lesson to learn the hard way. I will be going back to that same trail again in a few weeks, but this time I will beat the trail...not the other way around!",,False,,t5_2qh7j,False,,,True,t3_1faylb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/1faylb/my_first_primitive_camping_trip/,

So where would you go? Would you pick a colder northern place like Washington, BC, etc. or would you go for warmer but swampier/buggier climates like Florida?

The longest Ive lived in the wild is about a week but I plan on doing a full month within the year so Ive been thinking about this a bunch lately. Im curious to see what you guys think. Almost all of my ""survival"" has been in Albertan wilderness, but I feel like theres better places out there- probably somewhere warmer.

I consider myself pretty well prepared most of the time, but recent weather events have exposed a major hole in my day-to-day preparedness: I do not regularly carry a flashlight on my person. 

I need recommendations for a small but powerful flashlight, no larger than a Bic lighter or so, easy to carry in the pocket of my jeans. I'd prefer it cost no more than $20.00 USD. 

Thanks in advance for your suggestions! 

EDIT: I am not, not, not going to want to use a flashlight that mounts on my belt. I hate belt-mounted stuff. It's uncomfortable and looks stupid to me, hence I'll end up never using it. It needs to fit in my jeans. ",,False,,t5_2qh7j,False,,,True,t3_1cmqvi,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/1cmqvi/small_flashlight_recommendations/,
