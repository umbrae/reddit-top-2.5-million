This explains a couple of [apparent plot holes](http://www.cracked.com/article_19435_6-movie-plot-holes-you-never-noticed-thanks-to-editing.html).

First, when the Joker arrived at Bruce's fundraiser for Harvey Dent, the Joker wasn't randomly killing people--he had a plan, and part of what made his plans horrifying was his ability to tell the police exactly who he was going to kill and then kill them.  Killing random bystanders doesn't accomplish that.  When the Batman (who the Joker thinks is Harvey Dent) jumps out the window to rescue Rachel, the Joker expects them to be the same person, so there's no reason to keep looking for Harvey Dent at the party.

Later, when Harvey Dent is being transported by police, the Joker uses an escalating series of weapons against the convoy, but doesn't use the rocket launcher on the paddywagon containing Harvey Dent.  The only weapons he uses are ones that can't penetrate the paddywagon's armor, and he gradually escalates to make the threat to Harvey Dent seem real.  He does this to discover if they really are the same person:  If the Batman shows up, Harvey Dent isn't Batman.  If the Batman doesn't arrive, Harvey Dent is Batman.

The Joker never wanted to kill Batman (he says as much in the interrogation scene, ""I don't, I don't want to kill you! What would I do without you? Go back to ripping off mob dealers? No, no, NO! No. You... you... complete me.""), he wanted to force Batman to break his ""one rule.""

My theory is that everyone in the Simpson family is a genius, Lisa is the only one who embraces it.

Grandpa may be senile now but his flash backs show him doing a number of things that require a variety of skills such as being a fighter pilot and an accomplished pianist, that suggests that he has at least an above average intelligence. Marge was an excellent student but choose a life as a house wife because it is what made her happy. This is important because everyone besides Lisa chooses happiness over intelligence. 

Homer would be one of the smartest men to ever live excepted for the crayon he had lodged in his brain at an early age. The crayon was briefly removed he becomes a genius, doing such things as proving god doesn't exist, but he put it back in order to avoid ostracism from his friends and community. Unlike Marge his choice is more serious; miserable but a genius or happy but a moron? 

Bart essentially makes the same decision as his father but at a much younger age and without having to alter his brain. In one episode he shown to have been incredibly gifted when he was younger but his grades steadily declined. Why? That episode would have you believe it was the ""Simpson gene"" which makes male Simpsons idiots. But the removal of the crayon from Homer's brain and his boost in intelligence  proves that to be wrong. Instead Bart witnessed that despite his fathers many faults and crippling stupidity he is happy. This was proof for him that ignorance is indeed bliss. He decides to follow his father's path but his intelligence leaks through on several occasions when it comes to pranks, which are original and clever. Yet his denial of his intelligence stops him from succeeding at school even when he wants to, and he torments Lisa because he feels bad for her and wants her to make the same decision he did.

Lisa only reinforces his decision because of how unhappy she is. Her intelligence will never bring her happiness. She is by far the saddest and mopiest character but for better or worse has decided to stick it out. 

Maggie, being an infant, has not been forced to make this decision yet but seems as intelligent as the rest of her family, one time rescuing Homer from a crazed tow truck driver. She will have to make the same choice with two examples, her brother and sister, to guide her.

When they try and escape from Leela in the head museum, Bender gets shocked via an old light fitting. My theory is thus; in doing so, it caused Bender to reboot. In the penguin episode, we see that Bender resets into a mode relevant to his surroundings - he sees penguins, he boots into penguin mode. Therefore, since he rebooted in the hall of criminals, the first thing he sees is the heads of famous criminals, and therefore reboots into the lovable but highly-illegal rogue.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1hmqed,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1hmqed/bender_from_futurama_wasnt_a_criminal_until_he/,

(Very long, it even has maps)",1984,301,273,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/130it2/lord_of_the_rings_a_theory_about_the_eagle_plot/,"It's been a while since I read the books so I'm not sure if my theory matches up with them. I've based the theory (mostly) on the films, and obviously there's a lot of **spoilers**.

I think everyone knows the eagle 'plot hole' in The Lord of the Rings. Why didn't they get the eagles to fly the ring to Mount Doom? My theory is that Gandalf had planned on doing exactly that. 

I'll explain chronologically.

Gandalf goes to Saruman looking for help after learning Frodos ring is the One Ring, they need to come up with a plan for destroying it. But Saruman reveals that he's working with Sauron and imprisons Gandalf for not joining him. Gandalf needs to escape and he also now knows he has to come up with a plan for destroying the ring by himself. When he thinks to get the eagles to help him escape it sparks the ideas that he could also have them help get the ring to Mordor. After all, he's not an idiot.

When he escapes on the eagle he doesn't go directly to Rivendell to meet the hobbits, he first goes to meet the eagles where the eagles live which we know from The Hobbit is in the northern parts of the Misty Mountains, on the eastern slopes. [Roughly here](http://i.imgur.com/oVZtc.jpg). 

Gandalf and the eagles discus the plan for the eagles to take Frodo and the ring to Mordor and the eagles agree to do it, even though it could be dangerous for them because of the nine dragons the Nazgûl ride - the only things in Saurons defences that could stand in the eagles way. But they would have the element of surprise and much greater numbers if they did end up having to fight the dragons. 

They see that their ability to fly is the only advantage Saurons enemies have against him and that this plan is the only plan that has any reasonable chance of success. Gandalf and the eagles agree that the plan should be kept very secret. If Sauron hears about it he'll realise the one weakness in his defences and quickly try to protect himself against it, and there goes the one advantage his enemies have.

Gandalf can't risk losing this advantage so he tells no one when he arrives at Rivendell. Nobody can know the plan until they reach the eagles and are flying on their way to Mordor because if they're captured they could have the plan tortured out of them - in the same way Gollum had the location of the ring tortured out of him. When they leave Rivendell they're a group of nine, not a just Frodo, Sam and himself like he'd planned for. But that's fine, he thinks, there are plenty of eagles to carry them.

Gandalf just has to get the fellowship to the other side of the Misty Mountains and go north to meet the eagles where they live, because meeting them anywhere else would mean a greater risk of being seen by the enemy. He can't take any chances of the his plan being discovered in any way and is being extremely careful because as far as he knows the survival of Middle Earth rests on the secrecy and success of his plan.

There are four main routes across the Misty Mountains, [they're marked on this map.](http://i.imgur.com/dMyLm.jpg) From north to south:

* High pass

* Redhorn pass

* Moria

* The Gap of Rohan

Being closest to the eagles the High pass would have been ideal for Gandalfs plan, but he decided against it because it was the obvious route for crossing the mountains (for whatever plan they might have) so Saruman was watching it. It was also infested with goblins and orcs who could see them travelling north after the pass, inform Sauron or Saruman who might then realise they were going north to meet the eagles thus discovering the plan.

The next most northern pass is what Gandalf settled for, even though it's a very dangerous pass and even though it would mean a long journey north to meet the eagles, it is still the safest route for his plan to remain secret and that is all that's important to him now. Keeping his plan secret was the main reason for him choosing the Redhorn pass. But Saruman was watching here too and sent storms to stop them.

The Gap of Rohan would take them far too close to Isengard, and more importantly too far south. Which was no good for the plan as they'd have to travel the whole length of the Misty Mountains up the eastern side to meet the eagles. So the Gap wasn't an option for Gandalf and the only way left was Moria. Which he didn't like at all and we see he's very reluctant. We think it's only because of the Balrog but it's also because of the risk of goblins and orcs seeing them go north on the eastern side (like the High pass) and because it was further south than he'd planned for which meant it would take longer to reach the eagles.

They almost get through Moria but Gandalf ends up fighting the Balrog and falling down the chasm. When he's about to fall he realises he has to tell them the eagle plan quickly before he falls, and in a way that any nearby orcs and golbins won't understand. He says ''Fly, you fools'' hoping at least one of the fellowship understands what he really means... but they don't. He falls and fights the Balrog. Meanwhile the fellowship escapes Moria and carries on with the only plan they've known - get the ring to Mordor.

Gandalf the Grey dies in the battle against the Balrog, but he comes back later as Gandalf the White. When he comes back he has forgotten a lot of things about his previous life. Even his own name, until he's reminded of it when Aragorn calls him Gandalf. *And he even forgot his plan to meet the eagles.*

At the end when he needs to get Frodo and Sam away from the erupting Mount Doom he knows only one way to do it - calling the eagles to fly them out of there. This is when he remembers the plan, calling the eagles reminds him of it in the same way Aragorn calling him Gandalf reminded him of his name. But by this time the ring is destroyed and the plan is redundant.

**TL;DR** (I don't blame you) Gandalf secretly planned on taking the fellowship to where the eagles live and having the eagles fly them to Mordor. The eagles lived on the other side of the Misty Mountains but all the routes for crossing them were too dangerous and difficult, and Gandalf (along with his secret plan) ends up falling down a chasm in a battle with the Balrog. Just before falling with the Balrog he tries to surreptitiously tell them the secret plan but was too surreptitious and they didn't understand. When he came back as Gandalf the White he had forgotten many things, including the plan to meet the eagles.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_130it2,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/130it2/lord_of_the_rings_a_theory_about_the_eagle_plot/,

Dig a little deeper and start looking at the naming conventions of the film.

You have Dr. King Schultz, a third party outsider who's current job is to thwart the evils at hand and the spreading issue of racism and slavery running rampant throughout the south.

Fine- he used to be a Dentist- whatever- this is Tarantino right? He's wrought with quirky decision making. 

But then take a look at who he's first hunting; The Brittle Brothers. Aside from a few things, the only thing that comes to mind when I hear the word Brittle is sweet sugary Brittle Candy- as in Peanut Brittle and Caramel brittle, all syrup cooked to sweet perfection. He finds and eradicates them with the help of freed slave Django, only to name his next target; Calvin Candie- owner of ""Candie Land""
In short- the south is an invented cavity laden cesspool. The infection of slavery is growing and Dr. King Schultz is the living remedy. 

Not to mention to one look at Calvin Candie and you see-maybe more than anyone-is in need of a Dentist. He sucks down Coconut juice- pure, cavities causing straight cane sugar. So in context you see,
He **IS** the cavity and Dr. Schultz is there to to eradicate him.

1375833051.0,1408,self.FanTheories,1juix7,Gatsby is black,1974,566,152,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1juix7/gatsby_is_black/,"As insane as this sounds, I've done the research. It's plausible. The idea isn't original; it was first proposed by Carlyle Thompson, a professor of African American and American literature at Medgar Evers College of the City University of New York. There's actually quite a bit of evidence to support it, just as there is to support the queer reading of Nick.

Gatsby is described by Nick, ""his tanned skin"" and ""short hair look as though it were trimmed every day"" (Fitzgerald 50). The short hair and the appearance of daily trimmings could definitely refer to the grooming habits of African American men.

Gatsby's West Egg mansion is on ""more than 40 acres of lawn and garden"" (Fitzgerald 5), which is specifically interesting, because freed slaves were to be given 40 acres and a mule by decree of Sherman's Special Field Orders, No. 15. ""More than"" is stated, but instead of giving us that exact number--it could be 41 acres or 400--but we're given 40. It should be noted that 40 acres and a mule was oft promised, but a promise not always kept and inconsistently applied (Oubre 79). There's an obvious metaphor for a man who feels deserving of something he doesn't get, i.e., Daisy.

Gatsby would be unlikely to achieve the level of success he did in the roaring 20s if he were black, and some of the upper-crust white folk would be likely to notice or take issue with his race, so it's only a plausible theory if he were able to pass himself off as white. There is evidence for this, too. For one, the manner in which he makes his fortune is bootlegging during prohibition, and bootlegging is a sort of counterfeit product. That could be a metaphor as Gatsby is a counterfeit person. He pretends to be someone he's not, he seeks an imagined perfection of a flawed woman, he lies about his past, he's secretive about what he does and his intentions, and being a man of color could be just one more lie he's living. He's even changed his name from Gatz to Gatsby, something more Nordic-sounding.

Gatsby is quite proud of his heroism in Montenegro. Of all the places he could have earned a medal, it's one where the word ""negro"" is right in the name--negro/black, mont/mountain--and it's mentioned by name seven times immediately like Fitzgerald wanted it to stand out. Also, his valor at Montenegro was immediately proved true by the medal Gatsby carried around. In other words, Gatsby lies, but the ""negro"" part is the truth.

How do we know he lies? He just told us on the previous page, ""I am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle West--all dead now"" (Fitzgerald 65). We know for a fact later on that his father remains alive and is far-from-wealthy. Was his family dead, or was he dead to his family on account of his color? ""I was brought up in American but educated at Oxford, becaue all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It's a family tradition"" (Fitzgerald 65). He's awfully concerned with establishing a European heritage.

But here's the passage that really blew my mind with this reading:

        ...a limousine passed us, driven by a white
        chauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks and a girl. I
        laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in
        haughty rivalry.

        ""Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge,"" I thought;
        ""anything at all. . . .""

        Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder. (Fitzgerald 69)

First, let's note that this happens as they are crossing Blackwell's island. Again, a geographical location is used that denotes ""black.""

According to Merriam-Webster's online dictionary, ""Modish"" means ""Conforming to or following what is currently popular and fashionable."" In other words, these are African American men who turned the social paradigm on its head and are being driven by a white chauffeur. In spite of a possible slave heritage, they are able to afford the luxuries of the time, looking at Gatsby, his ride, and his present company with a sense of rivalry. If these black men are able to realize the American dream, surely a man of African descent who can pass for white can achieve this success. Yes, anything is possible, even Gatsby. Even a black Gatsby.

There are smaller clues, too. After Myrtle is struck by a car, the incoherent speech of a man is ""M-a-v-r-o----,"" which is interesting, because ""mavro"" is Greek for ""black.""

One the same page, a ""pale well-dressed negro"" described the car, Gatsby's car, as ""big"" and ""yellow."" Now back to the Montenegro thing, which literally means ""black mountain,"" which may describe Gatsby, big and yellow may also describe him as ""high yellow"" was a term to describe light-skinned blacks, the product of mixed race backgrounds due to the golden skin tone (Dalzell, 2009). He may be a ""black mountain"" of a man, but he's also ""high"" like a mountain, but, although technically black, also ""yellow.""

Is this a meaningless distinction? No. It's not trivial at all. Tom Buchanan is an awful human being, and we're treated to Tom's racist rant:

        Have you read 'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this man Goddard? . . . Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don't look out the white race will be--will be utterly submerged. It's all scientific stuff; it's been proved. . . Well, these books are all scientific . . . This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us who are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have control of things . . . This idea is that we're Nordics. I am, and you are and you are and . . . and we've produced all the things that go to make civilization--oh, science and art and all that. (Fitzgerald 12-13)

How are we supposed to feel about this? Well, Daisy openly mocks him and Nick says he's pathetic. Tom believes that the Nordics are the master race and that it's imperative for him and people like him to keep the colored folk down. Wouldn't there then be great irony on his wife's competing love with a non-Nordic person? A black Gatsby?

It's at least a suspicion on Tom's part when he puts the pieces together and outs his fears:

        I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife. Well, if that's the idea you can count me out. . . . Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next they'll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white. (Fitzgerald 130)

        ""We're all white here,"" murmured Jordan. (Fitzgerald 130)

Not only does Tom suggest that Gatsby is black, Jordan picks up on it and defends his whiteness! Why else would intermarriage between black and white even be brought up? He may have even suspected this for a long time before, pausing before he includes Daisy as a Nordic in the Goddard rant with a wink and a smile when he lays out the Goddard nonsense. Perhaps he sees her as sullied having had her history with Gatsby.

The trouble is, there's plenty of evidence to suggest that Fitzgerald was both a racist and antisemitic (Blogger.com 2010). That really changes the perspective. That underscores what Fitzgerald's true intentions were in the Goddard passage from the book, actually The Rising Tide of Color: Against White World-Supremacy, by eugenicist Lothrop Stoddard, published in 1920 (Turlish 1973). Fitzgerald was obviously familiar with it. It's even more interesting to note that both Fitzgerald and Stoddard had the same publisher, Scribner. As for the name change, Henry H. Goddard was a famous eugenicist (Thompson 2004). The plot thickens.

It forces one to consider that Gatsby is a cautionary figure, that negro men could be among us, passing themselves off as white, throwing lavish parties, living the lifestyle, wooing our women, acting as elaborate con artists, bootlegging, and involved in all manner of illicit affairs. Maybe that's the real reason he doesn't win in the end. Maybe that's why he's killed, as white men conspire against him. Maybe that's the real reason no one shows up to his funeral.

The first time we meet the Ewoks in the series, they capture Luke and the crew, and C3PO translates that basically their intent is they're going to eat them. This is before C3PO gets treated like a God and gets them to let his friends go.  

...In the end scene in the movie, they've just defeated the Death Star, blew that son of a bitch sky high, and the Ewoks are having a feast.  

...What exactly are the Ewoks eating? There is a *xylophone made of storm trooper skulls and chest plates*...and they're having a feast.  

The Ewoks aren't celebrating the death of the Empire. They don't even understand anything about the socioeconomic structure of the galaxy outside of their little forest. They thought C3PO was a God, so clearly they are unaware of technology. Their celebration wasn't because of Freedom, it was because they just got the motherload of tender human flesh vittles.  

That cute little Ewok plushie you had as a kid? You know the one. Wicket? Yeah, that little fucker *eats people*.  

And, by extension, the entire main cast of Star Wars *might* be cannibalistic, too. I mean, I dunno. They're attending the banquet.

The whole show is Stewie's interpretation of the world. How an infant sees the world and tries to understand it from his limited knowledge. 

That's why each episode seems so exaggerated, so extreme. Stewie is interpreting his family's actions and filling in the blanks due to his limited vocabulary and understanding of the world.

In episodes where people talk to Stewie, it's usually short conversations. This is akin to people making baby-talk with a toddler - they do engage him in conversation, but they are not as elaborate as Stewie interprets them. 

That's why Brian, a dog, talks. He sees Brian as another member of the household, not able to understand that different species cannot communicate with one another. When the family talks to Brian, they are in fact talking to him in the way a petowner would talk to his/her pet, not engaging him in conversation. Stewie doesn't understand this, and sees the dog communicating with everyone as a normal person would.

This explains Peter's stupidity and Louis' strict demeanour. You see, Peter works all day, and when he returns from work, he spends his time with his family, and like most fathers does silly things to make his infant laugh and smile. Stewie interprets this as the way that Peter actually is (and exaggerated highly) because he doesn't know Peter any other way than the silly acts he performs to his child in an attempt to humour him. Louis seems strict and naggy because she is a stay-at-home mom, and Stewie spends all his time with her. He sees a side of her that he doesn't see in Peter, which is why she comes off as a firm woman to him. I'd even go as far as say that she is the one that disciplines Stewie in Peter's absence, which is why Stewie has such a hatred and desire to kill her because of it. 

My suspicions later got confirmed in an episode where Stewie went on the show ""Kids say the darndest things"". They were interviewing Stewie prior to the show and asked him a question, to which Stewie replied in a well thought-out eloquent response, but was met with silence from the interviewers. This is because he just babbled a long sentence of baby-speak, instead of saying anything comprehensible. Only when Stewie changed his vocabulary to that of a small child, where they able to understand him and started laughing. 

Tl;dr - The show is about how Stewie sees the world, which is why it's so wacky and extreme.

So from what we see, the joker a very smart tactician, has very good fighting skills, and also very knowledgable of officials. This has me to speculate that he may have been a war veteran. 

His superb fighting, being able to overpower a door guard, almost beating batman, and easily making a pencil disappear might be from military training. his precise planning, from the bank heist, to the escape from the police station, even the last scene, it's all planned perfectly, might imply that he was a high ranking general or tactician of some sort. And he knows a lot about ""the system"", meaning he probably worked for the government, but ended up hating it. Another note, during the police burial ritual, he seemed to know what the movements were, perfectly, implying he has had some training.

Also, war has been known to make people "" Insane"", and his strong almost painless resistance to batmans interrogation might imply that he was a prisoner or even a hostage once.

Thoughts?

Edit: a lot of people have pointed out that he was probably more of a spec ops agent, when you think about it, it may be true. And his psychological manipulating might mean he was some sort of spy.

On another note, he also said "" what am I gonna do without you? Go back to ripping of mob dealers?"" Might imply he was also in organized crime once. Probably after the war.

(TDK),1647,432,157,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/15c8vo/the_joker_knows_that_he_is_in_a_movie_tdk/,"In The Dark Knight, the only target audience for the Joker’s sense of humor is us, the viewers. Not his victims, his minions, or even himself. 

Christopher Nolan and Heath Ledger’s Joker is different from other historic portrayals of the character. In comics or cartoons, the Joker often punctuates his crimes with a pun or one-liner, which he then maniacally laughs about. He doesn’t care if anyone else thinks the jokes are funny, because his target audience is himself.

In comparison, TDK’s Joker laughs relatively little, and, like any good comedian, he knows that you don’t laugh at your own jokes. When he does laugh, it’s usually a response to something unexpected that someone else has said or done (the interrogation scene, Batman throwing him off a ledge).

If the Joker is not his own comedic audience, most of his “jokes” only make sense in the context of his awareness (or self-delusion) that he is in a movie:

**The Bank Robbery**

*“No, no, I kill the bus driver…”*

In the opening scene of the movie, the Joker robs a bank with several henchmen, who kill each other off, only to be killed off in turn. It’s a successful bank robbery in which the only fatalities are the robbers. But none of the henchmen sees the whole joke, only the small part in which they participate. The joke is only funny if you are the Joker (who doesn’t laugh, dutifully playing the part of comedian) or the movie audience.

**The Scars**

*“You wanna know how I got these scars?”*

The Joker has different stories about where the scars came from, but nobody hears two differing accounts. Each story is told to a different group of people: a handful henchmen and gangsters (“My father was a drinker…”), Rachel Dawes (“So I had a wife…”), and Batman (Story unknown). From their perspectives, he tells a traumatic story of how he became the way he is. The only people who know that Joker’s past is multiple-choice are the Joker (who doesn’t laugh) and the audience.

**The Pencil**

*“It’s…it’s gone.”*

True to form, the Joker does not laugh when he makes the pencil “disappear”. Nor does he expect the gang leaders to laugh, as they are enraged and mortified. The only ones who laugh (though perhaps guiltily) are the people sitting in the movie theater watching through the screen.

**The Plans**

*“Do I really look like a guy with a plan?”*

When talking with Harvey Dent in the hospital, the Joker claims that he doesn’t plan, but just does things. From any character’s perspective (except for Batman and the Joker), his actions do seem random and chaotic. It is only with the semi-omniscient perspective of the viewer that his plan can be seen in full. This is the same reason the Joker doesn’t want to kill Batman. He is the only other “freak” that sees the whole big picture and gets the jokes, even if he doesn’t find them funny.

**The Fall**

*“You just couldn’t let me go…”*

At first glance, the end of TDK is very similar to the end of Tim Burton’s 1989 Batman. A pitched battle atop a skyscraper, ending with the Joker plummeting to his doom. Except in this movie, his fall is halted by Batman. Listen to his last line again: “You see, madness, as you know, is like gravity. All it takes is a little…push!” He builds to a punch line that never actually comes. This delivery of the line and the rising of the music make it seem like he is going to suicidally cut the rope in an act of defiance. But instead, his act of defiance is to refuse to give you the sense of closure that his death would bring. At the end, he laughs, not because he is mad, but because he put one over on us, the audience.

The Joker’s viewer-centric sense of humor shows up many other times in the movie (the hospital gown, his reaction to the delayed explosion, the phone call, “I’m only burning my half”, etc.), reinforcing that he believes there is someone else out there, laughing at the jokes. 

From a certain perspective, this makes Joker the sanest character in the entire series, as he is the only one who realizes that they are all in a movie, playing games for someone else’s enjoyment. The Joker is a grease-painted Neo—he doesn’t kill for his own enjoyment, he kills to show that life and death are just jokes for a godlike audience in the constructed fantasy-land they inhabit. 

He tries to make Batman see this. When Batman says he has one rule, against killing, the Joker tells him, “That’s the rule you’ll have to break to know the truth.” He then says that the truth is that the only way to live in the world is without rules, but this is only part of the truth. The ultimate truth he refers to is that the world they inhabit is a fiction.

This is why Lucius Fox believes that the Gotham-wide cell-phone sonar is wrong. His strong moral reaction is not against the invasion of privacy—the quasi-omniscient perspective gives the user a godlike power that destroys the illusion of reality, revealing that the world is nothing but a movie, a story.

Batman comes close to an awareness that he is in a movie, but he chooses to deny it, remaining blind to this fact for fear of becoming like the Joker. “Sometimes the truth isn’t good enough…Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded.”

Is this the right choice to make? Only you can decide…

**tl;dr: The Joker knows he's in a movie, and we (the viewers) are the only ones his humor is aimed at. Batman comes close to realizing the truth, but chooses to remain blind to the illusion.**

You've been there from the beginning, when a former Senator told you his idea for a new order. A greater good. You don't ask yourself if he's wrong, who are you judge right and wrong? You've been locked away from the world and its complex politics that don't translate well to movies. Your greatest order in the securing of peace? Killing the Jedi, religious fanatics who instrument chaos and war to acheive their ends. But when you're looking down the hot barrel of a DC-15A at the youngling you just killed, you pause. Was this child really all that evil? Even now, had he been too old to save from the corrupt  ideologies of his elders? A fellow trooper throws you a sideways glance. *(How long have I been standing here?)* You shake your mind clear and move on. You're no traitor. And it was probably too late for that child. Probably.

You've traveled across the galaxy, from hot deserts and open grasslands to misty forests and swamps.

You turn to cast a sideways glance at the trooper next to you, who likewise has another of these poor creatures at his feet. You wonder if it's the same one who looked at you in the Temple all those years ago, if his face is screwed up in pain and self-loathing. You see only a mask.
 
 
The alarm is going off. Intruders in Cell Block 1138. But you came to the decision a long time ago. As the elevator continues up *(Three floors left)* you know what you can do. You can miss the target. You're skilled enough to do it. *(Two floors left)*. Anything more, and you could be called a traitor.

The doors open.
 
Blaster fire fills the air, but although troopers fall around you, none of the intruders are hit. The shots go wide, go overhead, and suddenly you know. You know you weren't the only one spending sleepless nights in the barracks, the only one living in the safety of your own secret thoughts. Your brothers in arms are living   reflections, in both body and mind. A euphoria of possibilities opens to you, secret resistances, open rebellions. But then a searing pain in the chest, the smell of ozone and cooked flesh and you're staring at the ceiling lights. Another trooper's face swims into view as he checks your vitals. And the euphoria slips away as you fall into blackness. Even if you lived, nothing would change. Nobody would admit that they had missed, would risk the torments reserved for traitors.

1365118080.0,1137,self.FanTheories,1bp3bg,Willy Wonka is the final regeneration of The Doctor,1535,398,137,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1bp3bg/willy_wonka_is_the_final_regeneration_of_the/,"I know most Wonka-based theories involve him being a psychopathic murderer and cannibal, or the whole story being a children's version of *Dante's Inferno*, but I propose a lighter take on the character and story.

He is the final regeneration of the Time-Lord known as The Doctor.

Let us look at what we know about Wonka. A lot of this is from the books, especially *Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator*

First, His personality:-

- He is an eccentric, super-genius
- He has a very child-like sense of wonder, excitement and curiosity
- This however seems to cover a darkness within him and a profound lonliness
- Loves exploration, danger and adventure
- Charges headlong into most situations
- Able to remain calm and level headed, even in the most dire of predicaments 
- Does not suffer fools easily

Even here, we can start to see the similarities, but when we look more into the character's history, we can see a pattern emerging.

First, in *The Great Glass Elevator*, we learn that, despite his youthful nature, he is actually very old, which is why he is retiring and passing the factory on to Charlie. This is despite the fact that he created a drug called Wonka-Vite which has the ability to regenerate a persons body, making them 20 years younger with each pill, Wonka states that he does not wish to waste the pills on himself, we will come back to this later.
  Of all his inventions and machinery, possibly the most remarkable is the Great Glass Elevator itself.

- Has the ability to fly
- Can travel through space
- Is practically indestructible
- Is able to generate gravity and oxygen despite not appearing to have the technology and equipment to do so in such a small box.

This last fact means that the form of the elevator might just be a disguise for a larger ship. One that is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.

Now, in the second book, Wonka and the Buckets travel into space and encounter a deadly alien race that Wonka identifies as the Vermicious Knids, an evil race of aliens which swarm throughout the universe and have devoured numerous other sentient alien races

This means that Wonka has not only traveled into space before, but has visited many other worlds, including the Knid's homeworld Vermes, which he describes as being 184,270,000,000 miles away (52 times Pluto's distance). The only spacecraft we see Wonka in possession of is his miraculous Glass Elevator, which again gives more credence to the idea that the elevator is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside as Wonka would need space for food and area in which to live and sleep, not to mention all the navigational equipment.

So let us recap:

Willy Wonka is a bizarre but wonderful eccentric genius, who is far older than he looks and acts, has a childlike sense of wonder and goes on exciting adventures throughout space in his indestructible box-shaped ship, visiting far-off worlds and battling evil aliens. Does this sound like anyone else we know? Even Wonka's dress sense would not be out of place for the Doctor (If you don't believe me, look at the 6th Doctor and tell me that could not easily be Wonka)

Here is how I think everything might have come about.

The Doctor is far into his final regeneration. The TARDIS is unable  to make long voyages through time, either due to it's age (It was already a museum piece when the Doctor stole it/it stole him), or due to severe damage. The Doctor makes the decision to retire to his adoptive planet, Earth. There, to protect himself and those around him, he sheds the guise of the Doctor and all his known aliases and renames himself William Wonka. Because of his love for jelly babies, he opens a small sweet shop where he can share his fantastic adventures with the children who visit, whose parents merely shrug them off as fairy tales. Because of the Doctors intelligence and incredible sense of taste (Something which is demonstrated multiple times), he begins to create all kinds of fantastic confectionery, the likes of which have never been seen on Earth before, and before long becomes the number one manufacturer of sweets in the world. He disguises the TARDIS as an elevator within his newly opened factory, but before long, begins to worry about his growing age and impending death. He becomes a recluse and spends his time working on a formula that will allow him to regenerate once again so that he can fix the TARDIS and once more travel through the cosmos,. However the years pass, and the loneliness begins to consume him. Although he creates the formula that could make him younger, it cannot return his regenerative abilities so he decides to simply live out the rest of his days, but would like one last adventure, and needs a new companion to assist him, and who he can finally pass his legacy onto, but he has to be sure that they are worthy enough to face the dangers ahead and take on this responsibility, so he places five golden tickets within the packets of his chocolate bars...",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,1365119054.0,,,True,t3_1bp3bg,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1bp3bg/willy_wonka_is_the_final_regeneration_of_the/,
1347521688.0,1124,self.FanTheories,zt9l8,"The Real Reason Emperor Palpatine created the Empire, Death Stars, Sun Crusher, etc. Reposted from the original Fan Theories thread, with a new addendum that includes some stuff I left out in the original post.",1409,285,367,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/zt9l8/the_real_reason_emperor_palpatine_created_the/,"My favorite Star Wars conspiracy is that the Emperor wasn't spending all those resources creating crazy superweapons like the Death Star and the Sun Crusher and putting together gigantic fleets of Star Destroyers wasn't to stop the Rebel Alliance, but rather in preparation of the [Yuuzhan Vong Invasion](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong_War) that would happen about a quarter century after RoTJ ended.

Now the Emperor is a pretty smart guy. I mean, he got himself elected to Chancellor of the Republic, started a war, earned himself absolute control on *both* sides of the war, then managed to turn the galaxy against the guys who for a millennium had served as icons of peacekeeping, justice, and democracy. And that takes some serious strategizing! But here's the thing:

At this point, the Republic was falling apart, with or without a Sith-led Separatist movement to nudge them in the wrong direction. The senate was a clusterfuck where nothing ever got done. Corruption reigned supreme. Even the Jedi Council wasn't doing it's job properly. Ideally, Jedi are supposed to act as bastions of compassion and moderation. The way the Jedi would be tasked to deal with a situation is as a balancing influence between, say, two conflicting nation-states, or a particularly quarrelsome trade agreement. Everyone respected and would listen to a Jedi, and even without acting on behalf of the Republic, they should be able to arrive on a scene and be able to allow discussion and bureaucracy to flourish.
Instead, the Jedi Council of the waning days of the Republic had grown inward and conservative, spending all their time meditating on the state of the galaxy and not enough time heading out there and fixing shit. This held throughout the war, when Jedi were surprisingly quick to jump to open combat as opposed to discussion.

In short, the Republic was completely and utterly unprepared for a *real* invasion, from a force that wasn't being controlled by a puppetmaster who was preventing either side from gaining an advantage until the moment was right. The kinds of fleets that were commonplace in the Empire would have been impossible for the Republic to even agree to create, let alone have the wherewithal to actually build. What Palpatine did was take a failing system and tear it out by the roots, replacing it with a brutally efficient, military-industrial focused society - one that could adequately prepare for an invasion of the scale of the Yuuzhan Vong were already beginning.

Second of all, if you think about it, creating a weapon that can destroy planets doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you're fighting a war against a well funded, but decentralized and scattered rebellion. The Rebel Alliance wasn't fighting a war of planets or borders or resources, they were fighting a war of attrition. What good is the ability to destroy a planet when your enemy doesn't even officially control any? The destruction of Alderaan, the only notable use of the Death Star, was a move made by Grand Moff Tarkin, whose [Tarkin Doctrine](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Tarkin_Doctrine), though it heavily influenced the way the Empire kept a tight grip on even the furthest systems, was not the ultimate purpose of the ""ultimate weapon"". Tarkin was convinced that the Death Star was *his* tool, one of intimidation and despotism, that he could use it to keep the Alliance, the biggest threat to *his* power, at bay. And we all know how that venture turned out.

No, the real purpose of the Death Star was to be able to fight a force that could completely terraform an [entire planet](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Belkadan) into a gigantic, organic shipyard in a matter of months, and was backed by dozens of 100+ Kilometer across [worldships](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Koros-Strohna). In fact, without the timely arrival of the seed of the original Yuuzhan Vong homeworld, Zonama Sekot, and a Jedi-influenced heretic cult that spurred a slave uprising, it's very unlikely that the denizens of the galaxy could have survived the war at all under the leadership of the New Republic. In fact, it's not really even fair to say that they ""won"" the war in any sense, with a sizable portion of the population of the galaxy eradicated, Coruscant, the former shining jewel at the heart of every major government for millennia, captured and terraformed beyond recognition, and the New Republic forced to reconstruct itself as the [Galactic Alliance](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Galactic_Federation_of_Free_Alliances). Undoubtedly, for all it's flaws, the Empire could have hammered out a far less Pyrrhic victory over the Vong. And if Palpatine hadn't underestimated the abilities of both the rebellion he never considered a comparable threat, and one young Jedi, perhaps the galaxy could have avoided the deaths of uncountable sentients during the Yuuzhan Vong war years later.

**TL;DR:** The Emperor destroyed the Republic and built Death Stars to fight off an extragalactic invasion.

**REPOST ADDENDUM:** Since I didn't include this the first time around, there is ample evidence to suggest that Palpatine knew the Yuzhaan Vong were preparing an invasion. It's clearly outlined that the Chiss were [aware of the Vong](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Far-Outsiders) (Though perhaps not the threat they posed) at *least* as early as 27 years before the Battle of Yavin, along with Palpatine, who in [Outbound Flight](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Outbound_Flight_%28novel%29) explains his purpose behind destroying the eponymous expedition was to prevent the discovery of an ""immensely powerful and hostile alien empire"" heavily hinted to be the Vong. So there you have it: Solid proof that Palpatine was aware of the Yuzhaan Vong as well as the threat they posed, *5 years* before the Clone Wars even began (22 BBY).",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_zt9l8,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/zt9l8/the_real_reason_emperor_palpatine_created_the/,

This is expanded on in The Animatrix, when we learn that humans disburse sky darkening nano-machines as a last resort prior to losing the initial war.  But what if the actual reason was to isolate the machines on Earth and keep them from going into space?

Machine A.I. is developed by humans at some point in the future when our technology had advanced enough to allow it.  We have to assume that at the same time human progress in space also advanced, and only continued to advance after the machines were created.  If that is the case, and considering they had roughly a century to do so, humans would most likely have colonized the moon and Mars by the time the war between humans and machines started.  

With the downfall of humans on Earth being an inevitability, I think that blackening the sky was a means to protect the humans in space and prevent machines from reaching them.  I believe that the nanomachines are designed to disable and disrupt electronic equipment as it passes through the cloud barrier.  This is evident in Revolutions as the human hovercraft breaks the cloud barrier and immediately stalls.  It's unlikely that the hovercraft would have such an arbitrary altitude limit.  Once through, any machines passing through the barrier would be disabled and crash back to the surface.  

I am also further convinced of this by the fact that the humans losing the initial war to the machines must have known that by blackening the sky they would also have killed most, if not all, of the humans still alive on Earth for little or no gain.  Machines obviously used power sources other than solar energy and the disruption of that one source would only have caused them a temporary set back, which was the case anyway.  It makes more sense that the humans on Earth, knowing that they would be overrun, cut off the machines from the human colonies in space so that the continued survival of the human race was guaranteed.  

Otherwise, think of it this way, if solar power is so abundant and important to the machines, why wouldn't they just leave Earth?  The machines have massive processing power capable of creating and running a dream world for billions of people, yet they can't figure out how to build a rocket?  They also have unfettered access to the Earth's raw materials.  If the barrier is only to keep the sun out and not to keep machines in, then they should have no problem with going into space where they would have access to solar power.

If something happens to the ball (it falls of the edge...) too bad, here's another one.  

Pacman is the flipside to this. A single man is reduced to collecting lost balls in the sewers under the tennis court. Nobody from the high society would ever want to use these balls again, but he is collecting them to sell them to less affluent social climbers who would use them to show off to their friends. And while the upper class will never use the balls again, they still have the sewers guarded by guards (the ghosts) that try to kill the poor ball collector on sight, because they can't suffer anyone stealing from them.

All in all pong and pacman are both parts of a series of didactic games that try to show the dehumanization of the lower classes by the upper classes. Pacman starts to resemble a ball himself, at least in how he and others see him, the guards (who are a similar social level as pacman) slowly are losing their humanity.

Beatrix's first life change event comes when she first learns she's pregnant. Mentally she's making the shift from stone cold assassin to mom. We see that reflected in her refusal to kill her own attempted assassin, even when she has the clear opportunity. For her abandonment of duty, she's shot in the head and wakes up 4 years later.

Waking up and realizing she's not a mom anymore, takes that assassin switch and flips it back on. Her reaction after that is sudden and predictable.

02 - Congratulations!

Beatrix kills her rapist and pimp in the hospital, flies to Japan and wipes out the tea house then kills O-Ren. She shows two acts of mercy, the first being in the tea house itself when she's confronted by a sword weildiing child, slapping his butt with the flat of the sword and sending him home, and leaving behind a mutilated Sophie as a gruesome calling card.

The second name on the Death List results in another fundamental change. When Beatrix realizes that Nikki has seen her mother's death, her first reaction is shame. She tries to hide the knife behind her leg. From this point on, Beatrix doesn't kill another person, even people who really deserve it.

Budd is bitten by a Black Mamba, courtesy of Elle. Beatrix pluck's Elle's eye out, but leaves her alive. She also doesn't injure Esteban, the sadistic pimp in Mexico who ultimately leads her to Bill. She also doesn't hunt down and kill the guy who helped Budd bury her.

Upon reaching Bill's hacienda, BB gets the drop on her mother and what ensues is an elaborate play act. They pretend to shoot each other and pretend to be dead. This is foreshadowing the ""death"" of Bill. It's all just one big play act.

This is the 3rd switch flip for Beatrix. She went from killer to mom back in the hotel room when she found she was pregnant, she went back from mom to killer when she woke up in the hospital. Now she's a mom again.

Beatrix hits Bill with the 5 point palm fist of death technique, but it seems that she's using the same form as the eye pluck learned from Pai Mei and it also looks like she hits Bill 6 times, not 5 as you'd expect.

Bill seems to be bleeding from a bit lip, not internal injuries as he asks ""Pai Mei taught you that...?""

Beatrix responds ""Sure he did"", but the whole time she's shaking her head ""No.""

08 - Sure he did:

Bill then takes his 5 step walk of death, but if you look at his weight placement, he actually takes 6 steps. This is his acknowledgement. She hit him 6 times, not 5. so he takes 6 steps, not 5. It's a quiet acknowledgement that ""If I pretend to kill you, you pretend to be dead.""

At the end of the film Beatrix is on the floor of a motel bathroom 1/2 laughing and 1/2 crying and saying ""Thank you!"" Who is she thanking? Bill. Why? For letting them all go. Pretending to kill him and him pretending to die is the only way either of them can exit the situation gracefully. They both love each other, they don't really want to kill each other, espectially not after it turns out BB is not only still alive, but has been cared for by Bill all these years.

BB meanwhile is watching a classic Heckyl and Jeckyl cartoon. Previously Beatrix and BB had been watching Shogun Assassin, the story of a Japanese assassin and his son killing their way across Japan (based on the manga ""Lone Wolf and Cub"".) Drawing the obvious parallel, the Bride and her daughter aren't killers anymore, they're trickster crows.

10 - Thank you!

There are two credit sequences at the end of Kill Bill, Vol. 2. The first being in color. Everyone who dies is shown at a point from the film where they were still alive. Except Bill. Or is he? If you look closely and compare his body position to where he was when he fell, his feet have moved.

11 - Color credits:
http://imgur.com/a/Mkt5G

But was moving his feet a continuity error or a deliberate hint? For the answer to that you have only to look at the black and white credit sequence. Every actor on the death list who dies has their name crossed off. Daryl Hannah, whose character was blinded but left alive is marked with a huge question mark. But David Carradine? His name is not marked at all.

The only conclusion based on this entire sequence is that Beatrix does not kill Bill in Kill Bill.

His job requires him to blend in with a large number of environments where the norm is to have a drink in hand or situations where someone he is talking to expects him to have a drink, but because he is a spy who needs a clear head, his tolerance for drinks needs to be high enough that anywhere between 1 and 3 martinis will have no effect on his reflexes.

Even when he is not on assignment, Bond drinks, partly because he needs to maintain a high tolerance for alcohol, and partly because the drinking has become habitual (in this case, it's possible you would consider him an alcoholic - but the motivation seems to be more of an association to his job persona than anything else).

In Skyfall, Silva tells Bond about the actual results of his Psych Evaluation where the doctor failed him, citing (among other things) an alcohol dependency. The irony behind this is that the alcohol dependency is a result of, and necessity to, the very field work that the evaluation was about.

While bored today, I started thinking about how the Mario games connect with each other. Obviously these are games that are not really made with continuity in mind, and only really focus on a complicated plot in rare occasions. But I was looking into it today and I think I've made a few revelations about the universe of everybody's favorite Italian plumber.

I know these fan theories often have holes in them, and I'm sure mine will have some too so feel free to point them out but I'll present my argument by **bolding** everything that I've found to be fact in the Mario universe and elaborating on these facts with analysis and sources.

**Cranky Kong of ""Donkey Kong Country"" was the original Donkey Kong from the arcade game, making his son, the present DK, Donkey Kong Jr.**

This is something that was well established in the Rare Donkey Kong games. The opening scene of Donkey Kong Country is Cranky standing on top of the original setting of the Donkey Kong arcade game's first level, getting pushed out of the way by DK. Cranky makes several references to being the original Donkey Kong through the course of the game. While the relationship between Cranky and Donkey Kong varies, the strongest indicator is the fact that Cranky himself refers to DK as his son in ""Donkey Kong 64."" If DK were Cranky's son, this makes the case that the DK from ""Donkey Kong Country"" to today is actually the original Donkey Kong Jr. all grown up. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranky_Kong#Cranky_Kong

**Mario and Donkey Kong are the same age.**

Seen in ""Yoshi's Island DS"", the Yoshi's get help from many different babies to save Baby Luigi in a prequel to the main Mario games. These babies include Peach, Wario, Bowser, Mario, and DK, making them all around the same age.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi's_Island_DS#Plot

If we know this to be true, it would be impossible for adult Mario to share a game with Donkey Kong Jr. outside of Kart and Sport games, which often have baby versions of characters. 

But if this is true, then how does the game ""Donkey Kong Junior"" work? Known as the only game where Mario is the antagonist, whipping Cranky Kong in a cage while DK climbs to save him, it features a fully mustached Mario with a very young Donkey Kong. There could really only be one explanation for this.

**The Mario from the Donkey Kong Arcade games is *not* the Mario from the main series.**

It actually makes a lot of sense. Mario is a plumber who lives in the Mushroom Kingdom and loves Princess Peach while Jumpman is a carpenter who lives in New York and loves his girlfriend Pauline. So either Mario made a TON of dramatic life changing choices after Donkey Kong Jr. or, more simply, they are not the same person.

We are also to assume that is would be impossible for the Pauline of the ""Mario VS. Donkey Kong"" games to be the same Pauline of the Donkey Kong arcade game, due to the fact that Pauline would have to age the same as Cranky Kong, making her elderly.

This explanation is also a little nicer when you think about it. Jumpman is triumphant in winning Pauline's heart at the end of Donkey Kong, while Mario is innocent of evil crimes that Jumpman committed in Donkey Kong Jr.

This is where more theory comes in. If Jumpman and Mario are not the same person, do they have a relationship? Well, at the end of Yoshi's Island, it is shown that **Mario and Luigi have two parents.** While a good look is never given for these two figures, they could very possibly be Jumpman and Pauline. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiiMtfnVhcQ

So Mario and Donkey Kong have parents who we've met before, and Donkey Kong has even shared a game with Mario's possible father! That's pretty nice, right?

Well... not for everybody.

**The antagonist in ""Donkey Kong Junior"" dies at the end of the game.**

OK, hear me out.

In Donkey Kong, after getting hit with an obstacle on your way to the top, you do a couple spins and finally fall to the ground with a halo around your head. You died. You have lives that could bring you back to life, but in that instance you did die.

Now, when you beat Donkey Kong (or Donkey Kong 3) Cranky falls to the ground, hits his head, and looks very dizzy. As we know, he also returns in more games well into his old age.

This is the end of Donkey Kong Junior:

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVAtTPrwOGc

Jumpman falls to the ground and lies down with a halo floating above his head. He's dead. As the antagonist of the game, he has no extra lives. Because it's impossible for this to be the Mario of games separate from the DK arcade games, he has never come back in a story that takes place after this. Even Donkey Kong 3, which takes place right after DKJ, doesn't feature him.

Let's start off by mentioning how Pixar absolutely loves to put Easter Eggs into their movies which can be seen [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_8x3n15L7E), and how Boo was put into Toy Story 3 as a [small cameo](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9wv3mCUr7aE/TSR_tG0l8wI/AAAAAAAAAbI/hWmTRRdvwy8/s1600/BooToyStory3.jpg).

So why can't she be in The Incredibles?

All right, all right, I'll go a little bit more in-depth. [Here](http://a69.g.akamai.net/n/69/10688/v1/img5.allocine.fr/acmedia/medias/nmedia/18/78/58/36/19468836.jpg) is Boo in Kindergarten, and [here](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MU1UvrSZLfE/TagF-eKUDfI/AAAAAAAAAQc/JZ36o59jQvw/s1600/film-the_incredibles-violet-68777.jpg) is Violet. Look a little alike? I know what you're going to say, Ozzertron you handsome devil, their hair colour is different! To which I would reply, well, so what? It's not like hair colour is something that will never change, especially on a teenager going through a moody phase, trying to seem more mysterious. Back to Boo. In the scene in the locker room in Monsters, Inc., while Sulley is playing Hide-and-Seek with her he is amazed at how good she is at hiding, why it's almost as if she's *disappearing and reappearing* in another spot altogether, and no, I don't mean teleportation, I mean invisibility or maybe even some light telekinesis. Boo being as young as she is, wouldn't understand completely how her powers work and would only be able to use them when she is happy and relaxed, which explains why she doesn't use them when she is afraid of Sulley's child-scaring demonstration or around [Randall](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kdCPMDhBT6E/T5sdOv_bBhI/AAAAAAAAAxw/U1VTPwIF9Ho/s1600/Randal.jpg) and his ""Scream Extractor"". Forgive me if I'm wrong, but didn't Violet have a similar problem where she was unable to perform under heavy pressure or have little faith in her ability, possibly stemming from some traumatic early childhood experience where they didn't help her out in a bad situation? I'm not too sure on that one, I haven't seen The Incredibles in a while.

 Early on in Monsters, Inc. it is established how each professional scarer is assigned to children that suit them the best, which would work out well because with Randall's camouflage or ""invisibility"", would be ideal with a toddler coming to terms having superpowers. Randall would be the representation of what Boo doesn't understand about herself or possibly what she may become, which fits in with her being only able to use them when she is happiest or the most sure of herself. At the end of Monsters, Inc. Boo is no longer afraid of Randall which in turn allows her powers to flourish. 

In the locker scene, it would of been easy for her to turn invisible or to simply float over the stall's walls. But what about her clothes you say? Well in The Incredibles Violet turns her head invisible to peek around corners or over a set of stairs and isn't it possible that Boo would do the same thing? Or, possibly her over-protective father could have his [Superhero fashion designer friend](http://www.virginmedia.com/images/pixar-incrediblesedna-300x400.jpg) make her some all-purpose toddler invisibility clothes so she could be better protected in case she ever needed them. Mr. Incredible would have known about her powers from a very early age, proven by Mrs. Incredible saying how Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers. On the subject of Mr. Incredible, didn't you ever wonder why Boo identified so quickly with Sulley? I mean, it's not like his large, hulking frame could of reminded her of anyone, right? I also noticed that Boo had a complete lack of fear of heights when she was happy and with Sulley, almost as if she had a way of catching herself with her telekinetic powers so that she didn't hurt herself.

tl;dr Boo from Monsters, Inc. is Violet from The Incredibles because of reasons.

That the World's never seen before.
In Dexter's Laboratory
Lives the smartest boy you've ever seen
But Dee Dee blows his experiments
To Smithereens!
There's Gloom and Doom
When Things go Boom
In Dexter's Lab

Why does it say gloom and doom? Dexter doesn't seem too distraught by Dee Dee so something else has to be it. Then it hit me, What if one of Dexter's experiments exploded and killed his family and the family he lives with now are the creation of a little boy that wanted to be with his family again? What if he blew up his family and resurrected them through science? Then I realized that Dexter wouldn't makes such an erroneous miscalculation, also he wouldn't make Dee Dee bug him so often, but then a second thing hit me
""Dee Dee blows his experiments
To Smithereens!
There's Gloom and Doom
When Things go Boom
In Dexter's Lab""
What if Dee Dee played with one of his experiments and killed them all? Dexter survived, but blamed himself for their deaths and did his best to recreate them.

Support to my theory:
1.) This would explain why the family is so dimwitted, the ignorance of his family lessens the likelihood that they would discover the truth, He made Dee Dee exceptionally dim and loyal because he knew her curiosity, as evident from the accident, so even if she does get in the lab she doesn't find out anything or tell her parents of the lab.
2.) The entire family gets roasted and blown up and changed into monsters but are unharmed next episode, Dexter made his family impervious to damage to prevent the same accident happening to him again.
3.) He is convinced he is smarter than Mandark who is clearly, more academically proficient, signifying he feels superior in his ability to create and recreate life.
4.) He has ability to create clones as seen in several episodes.
5.) He has mastered the control of central nervous system as seen in the episode where he replaces the brain of a dinosaur with a dog.
6.) He has the ability to create a rapid aging process to make his clones age at an expedient rate, as in the episode ""Old Man Dexter""
7.) He has shown the ability to control the intellect of a person as in the episode ""Dexter's Assistant""
8.) He expressed extreme confusion at the fact that his mother got sick, and even said ""Mother's do not get sick they take care of the sickly"" in the episode ""Maternal Combat,"" something that seemed very ignorant for a boy genius to say, unless he was noticing faultiness in her programming

They've mastered dimensional travel, and all of their energy needs are met by one resource: the resonance of a child's laughter/screaming.

But a few hundred years ago, they ran their first test of a dimensional portal.  It was probably a simple doorway tied to it's own nuclear power plant just to make the doorway to another realm.  The first monster to step through was probably a big hairy monster.  He stepped through the door and happened into a child's room.  A very sick child.

Upon seeing the monster, the child screamed, and so did the monster, who fled back into the monster realm through the portal with two things.  First, the child's scream caused a reaction with the monsters' technology.  They noticed a power surge at that time, as, for whatever reason, they're power source seemed to resonate with that sonic vibration.

The second was a flea carrying Yersinia pestis.  Excited at the prospect of a potential new clean energy source, no one bothered to check that first monster for any contaminants.  And fleas were certainly not unknown in this world.  He went home to his wife and kids where the flea could find a place to lay its eggs, and he didn't even think about that itch on his shoulder.  Then six days later, he started to feel ill.  So did his wife and kids...

A few weeks later, the neighbors started showing signs.  A plague spread through the monster world.  It wasn't hard to figure out that it was that first encounter with that child that started it all.


TLDR:  The monsters from the Monsters Inc. universe made first contact with the human world during the Black Death.

Jack is pretty much flawless, while Billy Zane is an almost cartoonishly bad person with pretty much no redeeming factors.  

There aren't really any shitty poor people.  They're all merry and easy going and they all talk with various folksy accents.  

On the flip-side, pretty much every rich person in the film is awful.  Other than a few of the historical figures, every rich person is a stereotypical rich person.  They're snobs, materialistic, manipulative, judgmental, and so on.    

This could just be that James Cameron isn't very good at writing complex characters, which it probably is.  But for the sake of this subreddit, consider that Rose is recalling an event that happened 84 years ago. 

She's forgotten the details, but she remembers that Jack was awesome and Billy Zane was considerably less awesome, even evil.  She is remembering things favorably as a self-justification for the decisions she made.   

I assume she became estranged from her family after the Titanic sank, so Rose remembers her mom as being a controlling, money-obsessed harpy as a justification for abandoning her. 

She remembers most of the historical figures like Molly Brown and Thomas Andrews positively, because they all became kind of famous or better known after the event.  80 years of hearing about how great or brave they were influenced her recollection of them.  

Another thing: Almost everyone that dies is remembered fondly, while pretty much everyone that lived was a piece of shit.  This is really just manipulative filmmaking, but it could also be Rose retroactively assigning some weird survivor's guilt to everyone that lived.  This also applies to the class distinctions that are made in the film.  More rich people survived, so they are all assholes.  Whereas very few poor people survived, so they are all saints.  

There's also a lot of name-dropping to current events at the time.  She remembers everyone else kind of being oblivious to how important what they are talking about is, while she was pretty much always fully appreciative of everything.  She's using the benefit of hindsight to show herself and Jack as being on the right side of history.  Of course she loved Monet in 1912.

TL;DR: Titanic is a favorable recollection of events from a semi-senile old lady who is justifying her decisions, viewing the past with the benefit of hindsight, and talking shit about almost everyone that survived.

Shifty figures lurk outside of a bank, which erupts in an explosion.  Batman springs into action.  The police chase the dapper robbers up to a rooftop, where they encounter...the Batman. Seconds later, the crooks are disarmed, beat to submission, and trussed up for the cops. Pan up to the Gotham skyline, where Batman keeps watch.

----
You know what doesn't make a lick of sense? Police zeppelins.  Don't get me wrong, I love the visual, the 1932 World's Fair style of them.  It immediately tells you that this is a place where we use zeppelins instead of helicopters.

...except, it isn't.  In [the first episode](http://youtu.be/ftYM3VYldwk?t=2m15s), we see Batman chasing a monster and colliding with a GCPD zeppelin. The cops spot Batman and immediately call for choppers.

Why would you need choppers?  **Because the zeppelins are a complete waste of money.** They're too slow to pursue anyone in a vehicle, they're so high that the tall Gotham skyline blocks their line of sight, they don't have the ability to do anything other than wave spotlights and call for help.  Despite what I can most generously describe as their sharply limited utility, Gotham has invested in no less than **three** zeppelins, with crew, maintenance, repair and upkeep, etc.  By my math, that's between two and eight squad cars of beat cops worth of budget and manpower for each zeppelin!

So, a big part of why Gotham City needs the Batman is because the GCPD opted for a big, showy, meaningless display as opposed to boots on the ground.  At least regarding the Animated Series, the mismanagement of police resources has given criminals every advantage and led directly to the lawlessness and chaos on the streets.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1bv4u4,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1bv4u4/batman_the_animated_series_the_real_reason_that/,

**Fair Warning - This post contains spoilers for the following movies**

*Avengers*

*Dark Knight Rises*

*Loopers*

Here's how it breaks down:

**Grade A Theories**

Anything that reinterprets events in the movie by only touching on what actually happens on screen. A great example of this is the theory [Loki meant to 'lose' to the Avengers as part of a deeper scheme](http://maskofreason.wordpress.com/2012/05/23/very-good-writing-why-loki-won-in-the-avengers/). This theory stick to what we've seen Avengers (and the films leading up to it) without needing to make up any other details.

**Grade B Theories**

This would be theories that add information outside the plot of the movie without contradicting what we've already seen on screen. A good example of this would be theories about the Joker from The Dark Knight being a member of the League of Shadows and/or having used the ""clean slate"" software mentioned in The Dark Knight Rises. Neither of those ideas goes against what we've seen happen, but it still requires the creation of events that happen off camera to work. As a general guideline, the more events that have to happen off screen for a theory to work, the less convincing it becomes.

**Grade C Theories**

These are theories that actively ignore or contradict information we've seen in the movie. For example, a lot of people on the imdb boards for Looper argue that Cid and Joe are the same person. This ignores the fact that Cid is way to young to grow up and travel back in time and be as young as Joe.  This is different from the theory that Kid Blue is a younger version of Abe, which doesn't contradict the events of the story (but still requires adding new information) and would thus be a grade higher on the scale.

**Grade D Theories**

This would the ""everyone's dead/the main character's dead/it's all in this person's head"" type of theories. These are among the laziest theories that contribute the least to a given work. A perfect example of this is the notion that Rugrats takes place mostly in the head of Angelica and none of the other children are real. This theory creates a bunch of new information out of nowhere with various back stories for each baby dying, ignores scenes from the show where the parents interact with the other children when Angelica isn't around and doesn't really make the show better or more interesting.

While such theories can sometimes yield interesting ideas (like the one about Ed, Edd and Eddy being in purgatory) they're generally a waster of time. But the ""it's not really happening"" branch of theories aren't actually the worst variety to be found...

**Grade F Theories**

The lowest ranks of theories are ones that go like this: ""[Character X] from [Story A] is secretly [Character Y] from [Story B]. This would be things like ""The Joker in Dark Knight is really Tyler Durden from Fight Club"" and often are lazily based on noticing that actors often play different roles such as the lame idea that ""Walter White from Breaking Bad is actually the dad from Malcolm in the Middle"". These theories not only add nothing good to the material being discussed, but actually make them sound stupider.

*So there you have folks. A quick and easy guide to evaluating the difference between bad, good and great fan theories. Thoughts and comments?*

**Edit**: Just to clarify since so many have brought it up, this scale isn't meant to say that lower grade theories are automatically worthless, so much as to show which one are more or less convincing.

From the moment of his birth, Simba portrays himself in an idealistic manner. His birth is greeted with glorious sunshine and there are wide celebrations over the arrival of the new leader. 

In reality, Simba is ambitious and power hungry, he organises the death of his father so he can claim the throne which he believes is rightfully his. Simba attempts to stage this assassination as an accident, but Mufasa's loyal brother Scar learns the truth. Scar exiles Simba and reluctantly takes the throne himself. In his own portrayal of his life story, Simba blames Scar for the death of his father. In one fell swoop he is able to exonerate himself from blame, and disgrace Scar. Later, after Simba’s coup succeeds, Scar is forced to confess to the murder of Mufasa. Scar’s show trial further cements Simba’s hold on Pride Rock. 

Scar is a good leader, but there was nothing that he could do when a drought ravaged the land. The water dried up, and the food supplies dwindled shortly afterwards. Simba hears of this devastation, and decides that the timing might be right to return from exile and make a play for the throne.  To legitimise his claim, Simba appeals to the popularity of the great leaders of the past. He claims that the ghost of Mufasa visited him personally and ordered him to remove Scar from power.  Simba then blames scar for the environmental problems that had plagued the land for the past years. In Simba’s film, he shows the people that the land is now green and pleasant, just a short period into his reign. 

As well as the character assassination of Scar, Simba’s propaganda machine also vilifies the hyenas. Their homeland is decreed off limits to other lions. This ensures that the populace under the new government is isolated and vulnerable. The threat of an external enemy is used to keep the lions in fear and strengthen Simba’s grip on power. We are all one, part of the great circle of life, apart from the traitorous hyenas.

At the end of his film, Simba attempts to ensure power for his heirs. He portrays his son’s birth in the same manner as his own, hoping that his cult of personality will pass on to the next generation.

1346111740.0,777,self.FanTheories,yxkdf,Han Solo is force sensitive,907,130,157,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/yxkdf/han_solo_is_force_sensitive/,"First off, I would like to point out that this is looking ONLY at the evidence given by the original Star Wars trilogy, with a little bit of supporting evidence from the prequel trilogy, and not any of the expanded universe novels, games, comics, or any other media.  Only the evidence given by the movies is being looked at here.  That said, I feel that there is evidence given in the films that point towards Han Solo being force sensitive.

The first piece of evidence is the asteroid field.  C-3PO tells Han as he flies into the field that successful navigation of an asteroid field is nearly impossible.  Han does it with ease.  Imperial pilots are supposed to be the most well trained pilots in the galaxy, and the ones following Han and the gang are in smaller, more maneuverable ships.  None of them survive, yet Han manages to get through the asteroid field without any major damage.  

Adding to this is Han’s piloting in general.  The first time you see him fly the Falcon he manages to outmaneuver two star destroyers.  At the end of A New Hope he manages to get past the Death Star’s defenses and take out Vader and the other pilot.  Despite being the only target of multiple star destroyers and fighters, he evades all of them for presumably weeks or even months, depending on how long it took Luke to be a jedi.  We’ve seen piloting like this other places, in both Luke and his father Anakin, But Han seems to take it to another level entirely.

Next we have Han’s blaster skills.  Blasters in the Star Wars universe tend to be… inaccurate.  The stormtroopers are supposed to be highly trained and extremely accurate, yet they seem incapable of hitting their target most times.  Even Chewie and Lando seem to have trouble making the mark from time to time.  Han rarely misses.  Whether it’s with his pistol or a stormtrooper blaster, Han seems to always hit his mark.  There’s only one other character who manages to fire a blaster with unerring accuracy in the entire series, and that’s Obi-Wan when he kills General Grievous.  

The last thing is that Han survives the carbonite freezing process.  Lando more or less says that there’s a good chance Han will die.  Granted, he may have just been saying this to save his friend, but it seems more likely that he legitimately thinks Han will die.  But he doesn’t.  He stays alive in the carbonite for (if I remember correctly), over a year, with no ill effects other than a temporary loss of eyesight.  Jedi are shown to be a little tougher and harder to kill than normal humans, and its Han’s unconscious connection to the force that keeps him alive during the carbonite freezing.

Han attributes a lot of this to luck, and he does have an incredible amount of luck.  But as Obi-Wan tells us, there’s no such thing as luck.  Han has an unconscious connection to the force that allows him to do all of the feats he shows in the films.

He is distraught when this man is killed.

* He is given the chance to save his fuhrer and his country and chooses not to. He only wanted to live in a secluded area with the aforementioned man where he would be safe.

* He knows how to ""think like a rat"" because he has spent his entire life concealing his sexual preference. He acts in a completely flambouyant way and yet is clearly competent enough that no one has determined his orientation.

* He has chosen a role in the Nazis where he travels a lot and is never in one place for long. This prevents people from continual exposure to his mannerisms, which they can only assume is a way of unsettling his enemies rather than his natural disposition.

* Through his interactions with two different *very* good-looking women (one of which is a movie star, and the other of which is so beautiful that a national hero who could have any other woman he wanted is completely head-over-heels in love with her) there isn't even a hint of attraction - in fact, although he murders one and terrifies the other to tears, the threat of rape never even enters one's mind (very much unlike Django Unchained).

* In fact, the only person he shows any interest in meeting is the leader of the Basterds, who he's developed a mental image of as a cunning tactical warrior (he's squirming for joy in his chair!). He is openly disappointed to learn this man is really a simpleton - never meet your heroes.

The evidence is circumstantial, but still pretty compelling.

1. Han hung out in Tatooine, a place rife with slavery (see Episode 1).

2. He did business with Jabba the Hut, a known slave owner (Episode 6).

3. He has secret compartments in his ship that hide the presence of lifeforms (Episode 4).

The third item is the most important piece of evidence. We know from the opening sequence of Episode 4 (where they allow the escape pod with C-3PO and R2-D2 to get away) that the Empire has the technology to detect lifeforms on a ship even as it's flying through space.

When the Millenium Falcon is captured by the Death Star, Han and company hide in the ship's secret compartments as the Empire scans the ship carefully. Presumably this scan uses similar technology as the scan in the opening sequence, but they don't find any lifeforms. So the compartments must be very, very good at hiding lifeforms.

You might think that Han uses the compartments to hide himself sometimes, but he says, ""I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them,"" so he's apparently never used them for that purpose. Why does he need compartments that hide lifeforms so well? To hide his slave cargo?

Maybe whatever design the compartments use to hide smuggled goods also happens to hide lifeforms.

This can set up a perfect tie-in with Aquaman.

Aquaman was there in Man of Steel and there are some pretty good instances that actually point to it:



**Why did the oil rig blow up?**

This has been mentioned before - **The name of the drilling company was Merrevale Oil, which is the same company that drills in Atlantean ground in the comics.**

It was Aquaman who sabotaged that rig. I like to think that Aquaman has had it with the continued pollution of the oceans and has started taking a stand.

The sequel movie could show some naval intelligence picked up by a Wayne Tech Satellite that describes an incredibly fast moving and compact ""bogey"" under water.




**The Whales?**

Why were whales hanging around the blown up oil rig? They were doing whale calls (signalling to Aquaman?).

Superman was floating in the water and the whales were at a distance... the scene cuts after that and Superman is shown stealing clothes.

I say the whales made sure that Superman was alright and ""washed up ashore"" before gaining consciousness and hence not interfere with Aquaman's plans.




**After defeating the world engine**

The world engine lands in the Indian Ocean (practically Aquaman's backyard). After it has been destroyed... Superman is again found conveniently lying on a beach and soaking in that sweet sweet solar juice.

I think that he was carried there by Aquaman or some of his dolphins.

Barbara Gordon is a fairly big part of the batman mythos (both as batgirl and oracle) and even though they called Jim's wife Barbara in TDK, one scene gave me the impression that batgirl was gonna be in the next one. 

The scene I'm talking about is the finale, where Harvey Dent is holding The Gordon's hostage. His wife and son both get a good amount of emotional screen time but all the time that Barbara (referring to his daughter instead of his wife) is on screen, her face is obscured and you can't quite make out who is playing her. 

Even after a load of digging, I can't find who played Jim's daughter and I think this happened because Christopher Nolan didn't want to commit an actress to batgirl.

It could even tie into the TDKR mythos. 8 years pass, Bruce is moping in his house, and super villains are still fucking up Gotham. With this in mind, Barbara (now between the ages of 18 and 21) inspired by Batman saving her when she was young, takes up the mantle to save Gotham.

On top of that, her expertise with computers and genius intellect would be a much better explanation to her discovering Batman's identity compared to Joseph Gordon Levitts ""psychic orphan"".

To add to this, the joker is didn't die at the end of TDK so if Heath Ledger were still around they could have tied it into The Killing Joke plot line.

1340509509.0,757,self.FanTheories,viey4,Krillin is the Best Fighter in Dragon Ball Z,874,117,139,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/viey4/krillin_is_the_best_fighter_in_dragon_ball_z/,"I didn't come up with this, but I thought it was worth sharing. 

So before Dragon Ball Z there was Dragon Ball. It had a lot of human characters that were skilled martial artists and (even though none were as strong as the alien Goku) they were able to hold their own in a fight. Once DBZ came around the human characters were quickly overpowered by all the space aliens, androids, and magic monsters that could destroy planets with energy blasts from their fingers. The amount of energy these people had got increasingly ridiculous to the point where the show was pretty much a shouting match followed by a ""who can make the biggest lazer"" contest. As a result the human characters either became comic relief or they were killed off to give the non-human heroes motivation to fight harder. 

Essentially the humans became useless background characters with one major exception. Krillin was Goku's best friend and was with him through most of his adventures and battles. Most people think he is just some comic relief and occasionally moral support, but there are those who argue that he is the best fighter in the entire Dragon Ball franchise.

It's obvious to anyone who watches the show that Krillin is no where near the strongest fighter (not even close), but he manages to hold his own against seemingly impossibly overpowered opponents throughout the series.  

**Examples of Krillin Badassery:** 

* One Saibamen warrior obliterates Yamcha (who was about the same strength as Krillin) with one attack. Krillin manages to fight off three of them at once and destroy all three of them with one attack. 

* After all the stronger fighters have thrown everything they have at Nappa he is still standing there unscratched. Krillin throws his special attack (Destructo Disk) at Nappa. Vegeta sees it coming and freaks out! Nappa realizes how dangerous the attack is just in time to escape with only a gash on his face. Had the attack landed it would have killed him for sure. Krillin was the weakest fighter left, but he came this close to taking out a guy at least 10 or 20 times as strong as him with one attack and was the only one to draw blood before Goku showed up. 

* Later on Namek he's the only human (except bulma) on the planet and clearly the weakest fighter there. That doesn't stop him from holding his own against guys that are probably hundreds of time stronger than him. Yeah he get's his ass kicked, but he actually manages to put up a fight against impossible odds. He eventually dies, but only at the hands of Frieza (the most powerful dude in the univere). It wasn't some weak pointless death either. Krillin managed to cut off part of his Frieza's tail (more damage than Vegeta, Piccolo, and Gohan did combined). His death was so bad ass that it made Goku go Super Saiyan. 

* He is resurrected later by Goku and all is good until the Androids show up. These things are way stronger than Frieza, but who is out there fighting them with the Super Saiyans... It's Krillin. The guy lands a few punches, and doesn't do much damage but can you blame him? These androids make super saiyan look like a joke. He's still only a human, but he doesn't use that as an excuse to stay home and watch the action on TV like everyone else. 

* Flash forward to the Cell Games where Cell (who is a combination of the androids, Frieza, and all the strongest fighters) creates half a dozen ""Cell Jrs"". Goku, Trunks, and Vegeta have to go Super Saiyan (the form that made a fool of Frieza the most powerful creature in the universe) to beat these things. Krillin manages to fight one by himself and seems to be evenly matched. He only loses after getting sucker punched while checking up on Goku (who was getting his ass handed to him by a Cell Jr.) That means until he let his guard down, Krillin was fighting something that's easily as strong as a Super Saiyan. At this point Krillin, a human, manages to hold his own against a creature that a few years ago would have considered equal in strength to the most powerful creature in the universe. 

* There's also [this moment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl9VH0nCR5Y#t=3m27s) where Krillin attacks Buu (the most powerful creature in DBZ) and would have won had it not been for Buu's regeneration powers. Notice how Yamcha doesn't even bother to try to do anything. Krillin knows what he's up against but he still gives it his best shot. Buu totally doesn't see it coming, and had it been another villian without regeneration powers, his Destructo Disk would have saved the day. 

**Conclusion:** Krillin is the greatest martial artist of all time, despite being one of the weakest fighters in DBZ. He was outmatched and underpowered from episode 1 of Dragon Ball Z. He could never be as powerful as the increasingly more god like beings he found himself surrounded by. Inspite of this, he never quits or retires from action. The little guy goes into battle against things he knows he could never hope to defeat, but he never gives up and actually manages to hold up his own in a way that the other fighters would never be able to do if they found themselves at such a massive disadvantage. If he relied on powering up and firing a massive lazer every time like the others he would have been killed in a heartbeat, but instead he relies on his own skill and his brains to keep him alive and fighing.

1375724928.0,737,self.FanTheories,1jr3zg,What do the houses in Hogwarts really represent?,931,194,155,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1jr3zg/what_do_the_houses_in_hogwarts_really_represent/,"This is a theory i found while looking at the building Hogwarts. Hogwarts is a combination of a few different types of buildings: it has features of a castle (the west wing and the large tower), a palace (the quad), a monastery (church-like area in the north-east and the great hall) and a school (courtyard in the north wing).

I think all these building elements correspond with a certain house: 

_______________________
**Gryffindor**: Knights.

* Their ideals are all about being brave and honest, much like the rules of chivalry in medieval times.

* Their common room is located where the castle guard would normally be staying: the top floor of the donjon (the largest tower of a castle).

* Their head teaches transfiguration, the relation between this subject and knights is shown when she transforms statues into an army of knights.

* The ghost of Gryffindor is of high standing, but he doesn't have the authority that the baron of slytherin has. He also tries to get in with what appears to be a group of knights, somewhat like an order.

* The house flag is red/gold with a lion on it. This is obviously a reference to the knights of England and Richard Lionheart, and lions look like fighters too.

* The only heirpiece of Gryffindor is a sword. 

_______________________
**Hufflepuff**: Monks.

* Hufflepuff is all about being brotherly to eachother and working hard, no matter what they themselves can get out of it. Many monks lived under the motto ""Ora et Labora"", pray and work. They worked hard, loved fellow humans and had no possesions.

* The Hufflepuff common room is located somewhere near the kitchen. In medieval monasteries the dormitories of the monks would almost always have a direct connection to the refectory (eating hall). The great hall (including the kitchen under it) is modeled after a medieval refectory, so it makes sense that the Hufflepuffs stay closest to it. It is also said that the entrance to the room is through a barrel. Monks would often brew beer or wine, so a barrel is fitting.

* The head teaches herbology. One of the things monks used to do was grow herbal medicine in their courtyard or garden.

* The ghost of Hufflepuff is a fat monk.

* Badgers have a white stripe from their head going back. this is symbolic for showing knowledge and clarity (white) in the rest of the world (the grey tints the rest of its fur has). Early monks wanted to spread Christianity in the dark ages.

* Voldemort makes a cup that belonged to Hufflepuff into a horcrux. As i said earlier, monks are known for brewing drinks, so the cup would be used for wine. A wine cup also ties into the Christianity part of the monks, as the wine is a symbol for (or for some is literally) the blood of Christ. 

_______________________
**Ravenclaw**: Scholars.

* Ravenclaws are people who want to achieve great things and be as smart as they can be. The goal of going to school is the same.

* Their common room seems to be near the school-like area of Hogwarts, but that's really all that i can connect to the place. In the last book it is said that the common room is very brightly lit by many windows. Being enlightened also means you have a lot of knowledge.

* The head of the house is a dwarf, but he is certainly not weak. One of the attributes of a scholar could be that they may not look strong, their knowledge makes them very powerful.

* The ghost of ravenclaw doesn't really have too many ties with being a scholar, but she did attend Hogwarts and she is the only house ghost who is still at the age of a student.

* The raven is a symbol of the Norse god Odin, whose name was derived from the old-norse word for wisdom or poetry. There is also the Welsh hero Bran, who was legendary for how wise he was. Bran means Raven.
Edit: Apparently the emblem of Ravenclaw is an eagle, not a raven. What i could find on eagles: as a larger bird they have supreme oversight, much like you would say about someone who is very smart. They are also considered very efficient, getting a lot out of small resources. If a human were to do this, they would have to be quite wise. The eagle was also used as a mark for the Roman legions. This also hints at great gains with small resources, as the legions could beat larger armies by using smart tactics.

* Rowenas diadem gives the wearer infinite knowledge, and it is also worn on the head, so this is related to the wisdom a scholar strives to have. 

_______________________
**Slytherin**: Nobility

* The throne is given to the first son of the old king and noble people are only allowed to marry other noble people. Royalty is just as obsessed with pure blood as Slytherins are. Slytherins are also supposed to be good at manipulating people to get what they want, something you can often see in the royal families of history (for example: Aggripina manipulating Claudius into making Nero his heir). If my theory is correct, then Rowling definitely seems to have some commentary on the nobles of England and the Royal house.

* The location of the common is a symbolic one: the real intentions of royalty are hidden from the public, so they are underground. The room is said to be grand, yet cold. This ties into the ideals of royalty: to impress the people, but to be emotionless (Queen Elisabeth does not smile a lot, for example). There are also tapistries. tapistries used to be extremely expensive in the middle ages, so only very wealthy people, mostly nobles, could afford them.

* Snape is potions teacher. Through history, regicide has been very prevalent, and poison was very often the weapon of choice.

* The house ghost is a baron and he seems to have a lot of authority, he is the only one who can tell Peeves what to do. This authority also applies to nobles, and a baron is a noble.

* The snake probably has something to do with poison and being untrustworthy. The obvious choice would have been the lion, king of the animals, but that was already taken by Gryffindor. I found that the snake has much more to do with Voldemort than with royalty, reasons in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1jr3zg/what_do_the_houses_in_hogwarts_really_represent/cbhm3f5)

* The medallion that Voldemort makes into a horcrux is an heir piece, passed on generations, much like crown jewels.

The thing that bugs me is, why would he keep it up even when talking himself or to people who already know his identity?  One example that springs to mind is his delirious rooftop call for help to Alfred in BB; another is talking to Fox during the end of TDK. See also any of his later interactions with Catwoman or Bane in TDKR.

Part of Batman's schtick is the whole thing of being crazy-prepared.  In TDK, one of the Joker's thugs tries to remove the mask after he crashes the Batpod, only to be shocked into submission.  This establishes a contingency plan of maintaining the secret, even when unconscious. Why then, could he also not have also installed some sort of throat modulation into the cowl to unconsciously alter his speaking voice? This serves the dual purpose of making him more intimidating, as well as hiding his true identity, all without any effort on his part.  If he should lapse and use his regular voice, the suit would automatically turn it into the batgrowl.

Finally, I find it interesting to note that, at one point in TDKR, he is in the Batcave talking to Alfred.  He is wearing the suit, but *not the cowl*, and his voice is normal.

**EDIT**: Alright, people keep pointing out that he uses the batgrowl (or something similar) both when he discovers the gagged policemen in TDK and when he visits Gordon in the hospital in TDKR, unsuited both times.  He can, *of course*, alter his voice at will, but I just wanted some explanation for him to keep using it even when apparently unnecessary.  People also point out that he (while suited) arguably does *not* use the voice when taking Rachel back to the batcave in BB, or in TDKR's climax.  I guess that's pretty solid dis-confirming evidence, but this whole thing was kinda toungue-in-cheek anyway.

1355566289.0,739,self.FanTheories,14w21r,"[How I Met Your Mother] The ""Carly is the Mother"" Theory (Post from /himym)",923,184,125,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/14w21r/how_i_met_your_mother_the_carly_is_the_mother/,"So this is pretty much the only not faceless theory as to who the Mother is that doesn't end with the dirty ""R"" word (R*bin). I've decided to explain this for those not in the know, or those that simply haven't joined the dots yet. 

*The Theory*

In S6E19, Barney meets his estranged biological father, Jerome Whittaker. Now, much to Barney's shock in the episode, he has started a new family after abandoning Barney as a child. This family consists of his wife, Cheryl Whittaker, his son, Jerome Jr. (""JJ"") Whittaker, and his daughter Carly Whittaker. Now, we meet the first two in that episode. We do not meet Carly, because as Jerome tells Barney, she is *at college*. 

Now, let's recall two very important factors in the identity of the Mother.

- Attends Columbia University, New York at the time Ted is first a Professor (2008/2009) (S5E1)
- Takes Economics 305 at College (the class Ted incorrectly showed up to teach), or was present in this class in 2008. (S5E1)

So Carly already meets the ground-level requirements for the character. Furthermore, she has decided to live away from home, presumably living with a friend. We know that the Mother;

- Lives, or has lived with Cindy at some point. (S5E12)

There's not much evidence for who could be The Mother in Cindy's apartment other than a lot of yellow objects and a glimpse of an ankle. I have heard rumours that if you watch S5E12 you can see a photo frame with ""C+C"" on it (Cindy + Carly), but I'm putting that down to rumour as I haven't spotted it myself. Anybody with Season 5 on Blu-Ray, have at it.

This whole theory adds a nice literal twist on ""Uncle Barney"" (and as we know, Aunt Robin), as he would literally be Ted's kids (half) uncle. *CONFLICT*: **Uncle Marshall &amp; Aunt Lily, who obviously have no biological connection to Ted.** Many have keyed Carly as a ""red herring"", in other words something that seems to be the truth deliberately made to be such, so Carter Bays and Craig Thomas can pull the carpet out from under us. **This is highly likely. I will be the first one to admit that.** However, as opposed to having a new, random character play the Mother, wouldn't it be more satisfying to know that the Mother was intrinsically linked to Ted from the beginning, through his friend Barney?

If you look at it in a very linked way;

- Over the years, Ted (and Ted's friends, who he meets through Ted) help Barney turn from his relentless pursuit of endless streams of women. He has a legitimate relationship, and learns to come to terms with his father issues, sparked in truth by the death of Marshall's father, and seeing what that did to such a close friend, decides to reconcile with his Father

- He meets his Father, who introduces him to his new family (sans Carly). During these two episodes, Barney's father talks a lot about the ""right girl"", and Barney claims he has already met the right girl (clearly Robin). This is after Barney has split up with Robin, so clearly this is a catalyst for his feelings for her in Season 7. 

- Barney marries Robin. **He is only able to do this because he has no fears about hurting his friend Ted, who by now has moved on from Robin**. Who should be at the wedding, but Barney's half-sister Carly.

*I.e. If this were the case, and this theory were true, Ted would be the ""architect"" of his own happiness. Through his acceptance that Robin was unattainable, to his support of Barney, he becomes the person that he needs to be to set in place the destiny laid out for him.*

I made this thread due to **recent developments**, and that is the surprising news that Barney's sister has perhaps been cast. 

A tweet from CBS has claimed that **Pretty Little Liar's Ash Benzo** is playing Barney's **????**. This is a presumption, but what else could it be?

*https://twitter.com/CBSTweet/status/279085158253096960*

**Also, there have been rumours abroad that Rachel Bilson (Cindy, Mother's Roommate) and John Lithgow (Barney's Dad) have been recast for Season 8.** This means that Cindy will be helping Ted get The Mother; because her own personal storyline has been wrapped up, and she was revealed to be a lesbian so her purpose will not be as a love interest. Barney's Dad being recast for a season involving Barney's wedding doesn't seem strange, but when you presume that it means Barney will invite his half-brother/step-mother, and thus half-sister, it makes a lot of sense.

Also, she is scheduled to appear in the January 21st episode, interestingly titled **Ring Up!**. It's obviously to do with a wedding; Barney and Robin are most likely going to be engaged by January, so they will be planning. The episode prior to this on January 13th, and what might be a cause for introducing Carly, is titled **""Band or DJ?""**, and again, sounds like a wedding plan episode. Now, we know that The Mother; 

- Plays bass guitar, possibly in a band. (S5E12)
- Ted will meet/or talk with the Mother shortly following the Scherbatsky/Stinson wedding, at the Farhampton train station. She is wearing a trench coat &amp; heels, suggesting she has come from a formal occasion. **She is carrying with her a guitar, confirming Future Ted's earlier statement that The Mother plays bass guitar. She is also dressed very formally in a dress and high heels, suggesting she has come from a formal event, like a wedding.** (S8E1)

If Barney met his half-sister, learned she played bass guitar, and was looking for a band to play at his and Robin's wedding (as we know that after next week's episode, Robin and Barney will be engaged), don't you think he'd ask his new family member out of obligation?

Now it's odd that they'd cast The Mother so soon... but keep in mind, this is not an official statement by CBS. It could still be another *????*, but I fail to see who else it could be. I've always maintained also, that it would be highly amusing for the rest of the gang to meet The Mother before Ted. Barney clearly will if this is the case; and then she could run into Lily, Robin, and Marshall. 

Again, this is all theory. But it's all starting to come together. The Mother *will* be revealed soon. And my money's on Carly.

I recently read an article titled ""The Character Most Likely To Die In The Breaking Bad Finale"" on this subreddit- you can find it here:
http://www.modernthrill.com/2013/the-most-likely-to-die-character-in-the-breaking-bad-finale/
I found it very interesting, and pretty detailed in it's analysis. However, the first line on Walter's chances is something I disagree with, and also something that I'm starting to notice around this forum quite a bit. It states that ""Breaking Bad is primarily a show about one man’s descent into hell.""

Now, I've heard/read/seen a lot of variations on this, but it is essentially the same idea- the show is about a man who ""breaks bad"", turns evil, and ends up living out the sick and twisted fantasy of him being in absolute power. It's a valid analysis, and also one that I THINK the series creators have confirmed, but it's not one that I agree with.

""Breaking Bad"" is a show that is about cancer. Walter White is a cancerous cell. For those of you who are not entirely familiar with cancer, essentially it occurs when a cell starts doing something it is not supposed to be doing, goes completely haywire, and eventually engulfs surrounding cells, organs, and the body into it. The fact that Walter White (cell) is diagnosed with cancer, instead of a hundred other terminal illnesses that could be hidden from his family while he goes on his meth cooking binge to support them, is no coincidence. Also important is the fact that pretty much any cell has the potential to turn cancerous (under certain conditions), even ordinary, helpful, inconspicuous cells. And what happens to the cancer cell after it ""breaks bad"", grows uncontrollably, and destroys the host? It dies.

So, maybe it will all end in flames, with Walter dying, but the important thing here is that Walter won't die until everything that was once a part of the old, normal ""host"" (his life) is dead. He is inoperable, malignant, and destructive- which was his cancer's diagnosis at the beginning of the series.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,1362425319.0,,,True,t3_19ngbd,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/19ngbd/breaking_bad_fan_theory_walter_is_cancer/,

He makes a bet with Johnny, whoever the better fiddle player is wins, a golden fiddle against Johnny's soul.  Johnny, clearly not too bright and quite arrogant, takes the deal.  They both play, and upon hearing Johnny's song, the Devil concedes that he's been defeated, and departs, leaving the golden fiddle with Johnny.

There are a number of aspects about this story that simply do not make any sense.  The first one, of course, is why is does the Devil seem to have a quota of souls he needs to get like he's got a boss up his ass about it, but that's not particularly relevant here.

The first relevant point is about the contest; there is no third party there to judge it.  Neither the Devil nor Johnny seem perturbed by this, as if they're both trusting that the ""loser"" won't fight it.  This is even weirder because one wouldn't even have to be dishonest; they could simply have different opinions about eachother's relative skill (as I'm sure many competing performers do), and right there, the bet becomes messy and unresolved.

Even stranger than that, however, is that the Devil actually does it.  He ""knows that he's been beat"", and just turns tail and runs.  This is the Devil, the embodiment of evil, the Prince of Lies, he who pretty much fucks around with bets and bargains for a living.  It seems very odd that he would simply go, ""Shucks, I guess he was better after all,"" and leave.

A final point, which, as I said before, is subjective; I honestly think the Devil's solo is better.  I know nothing about fiddling (heh), but his just seems cooler; it's got more kick and emotion.  Obviously, many might disagree, but if I was judging that contest, I'd give it to the Devil.

So, if none of this adds up, what's another way to look at it that would make more sense?  Let's see what we know; the Devil is tricky, Johnny is arrogant and probably not too quick.  So the Devil comes along, sees this kid, and wants his soul, so he sets up a trap for the kid.  He sees that Johnny's number one flaw is his pride, and he plays on it; by offering a bet, he challenges Johnny's pride.  Johnny can't possibly refuse, even though he knows it's a sin, because his pride won't let him.  That and Johnny's thickheadedness are what prevent him to see he's being played; obviously the contest will be rigged if no one's judging it.

So the Devil plays his solo, then Johnny plays his, and the Devil concedes.  Truth is, it doesn't matter what Johnny played here; he could have played like a monkey with Parkinson's doing a Nickelback cover, and the Devil would have still conceded.  That's the genius of it.  He challenges this average fiddle player's pride, then loses to him deliberately, inflating that pride to an enormous extent.  The gold fiddle that he leaves behind is nothing to him, and the wealth probably won't help Johnny much.

Think about what happens after this meeting.  Johnny goes through the rest of his life thinking that he's, quite literally, ""the best that's ever been"".  He thinks he's the number one fiddle player in history, so good the Devil himself bowed before his skill.  That pride will torment him his entire life.  It'll push people away from ever getting close to him, and leave him mystified when clubs won't book him because they ""don't understand his genius"".  He'll end up in the gutter, a man ruined after spending a life chasing a delusion, and when he finally pulls the trigger, he'll open his eyes to a familiar face, one who now has the soul he was after.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,1376460450.0,,,True,t3_1kbwxd,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1kbwxd/the_devil_beat_johnny_in_georgia/,

To combat this, he donated a lot of money to an animal cruelty group. After doing so, he felt very good so he adopted 4 pets: a cat named Dennis, a bird named Sweet-Dee, a dog named Mac, and a rat named Charlie. 

The explanation for Dennis is that he is very full of himself, he enjoys the leisures in life, he marries a girl who has ""fish"" breath, and he lives with Mac because Mac is his ""protector"".

The explanation for Sweet-Dee is that she loves the limelight, squawks a lot during stress, IS EVEN SHOWN AS A BIRD IN 'Who got dee pregnant?', and constantly told she looks like a bird by the gang.

The explanation for Mac is that he prides himself in being the ""sheriff"" of the pub, he loves to attack things (his love for karate), in season 6 episode 11 he screams SQUIRREL while driving through the forest therefore has a keen sense of critters, has a unique cat-dog loving relationship with Dennis, loves to bang things, grew up with a dog and cares for it greatly.

The explanation for Charlie is that he loves cheese, cats constantly try to get into his apartment, he loves the trash, loves raccoon meat, bites santa claus in the neck out of anger, and all of season 6 episode 10.


So there you have it, Always Sunny in Philadelphia is about a man and his 4 pets.

EDIT: ALSO, may I add that in season 6 episode 11, Frank is caught in a unique stare showdown with a rabbit.

(Refers to events of book 4 only).,919,209,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1gp6f3/harry_potter_the_real_reason_mrs_weasley_doesnt/,"Firstly, this only refers to the events of the 4th book in the series.

Mrs. Weasley doesn't want Fred and George to start a joke shop because they've been doing illegal underage magic to create the merchandise.


A lot of the stuff that Fred and George invented seems to need magic in order to be constructed. I would imagine some of the stuff can be done with a potion, but the vast majority requires the creator to perform magic when creating the item.

When Ron and Ginny explain 'Weasley's Wizard Wheezes' to Harry (beginning of book 4), Ginny says:

* ""We've been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but we never though they were making things. We though they just liked the noise.""

At this point, the twins are 16, several months short of turning 17 and being allowed to legally perform Magic outside school. Evidently the explosions (Which I consider to be some form of Magic used to create their Joke merchandise) have been going on for awhile. As early as Book 2, when Harry came to stay with the Weasley's, it was noted that:

* ""...small explosions from Fred and George's bedroom were considered completely normal.""

The Twins were 14 at this time.

We might wonder why the Ministry never came after the twins, after all, they are under 17 and supposedly tracked by The Trace. But the Trace isn't foolproof. Dumbledore explains on this point when Harry questions Dumbledore about an underage wizard performing magic in an adult wizard's home. Dumbledore replies:

* ""They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic. They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offspring's obediance while within their walls.""

Meaning that the Twins were doing magic all along, but the ministry had no idea who was performing it (Fred and George are pretty good at bending rules and not being caught).

The second part of Dumbledore's statement suggests that wizarding parents are responsible for their children's underage magic if the Ministry is unable to detect it.

**Likely, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley would have gotten in some sort of legal trouble if anyone discovered that Fred and George had been performing all kinds of underage magic, most of it dangerous and experimental (the kind likely to cause a Magical Catastrophe).**

By the time they do start the joke shop (age 18), they have been of-age long enough that no one will suspect the items were invented with underage magic, so Mrs. Weasley isn't angry about it anymore.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1gp6f3,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1gp6f3/harry_potter_the_real_reason_mrs_weasley_doesnt/,

In season two we learn in ""Chickenfucker"" that Barbrady is illiterate, and the town helps him to learn how to read. This raises the question how the hell did he get the job as the towns ""only"" police officer if he's illiterate? I believe that Barbrady is either the town idiot, or an adult with autism, and the entire town feels bad for him and lets him play police officer for small petty crimes. 

Evidence for:

-Barbrady wears a big misshapen police badge (looks like it could've been made by him) and runs his entire operation out of little tiny building.

-No one takes him seriously or even calls him when there's an actual crime afoot, instead it goes right to the Park County Police Station (seemingly located in South Park as well) with the redhead ""nice"" cop. 

-He has no partners or fellow officers and many times kids and adults have just left or entered his jail as they pleased. 

-All he ever says when there's a crime and he happens to be around (it appears he never answers 911 calls) is ""Move along, nothing to see here."" He is saying this because it was the one thing he was told to say at a crime until the real police can show up.

Evidence Against:

- He has carried some policeman duties such as arresting Eric Cartman in ""Die Hippie Die""

-He conquers his illiteracy in Season 2

- The other police officers are ""Park County Police Officers"" not ""South Park Police""

So that's my fan theory, I'm sure there's things I've forgotten, and I'm welcome to any corrections or mistakes I made.

EDIT- I just realized that he arrests kids and puts them in jail cells multiple times, and we know South Park has a juvenile hall (Trent Boyett in ""Kindergarten"").

1375397344.0,708,self.FanTheories,1jizec,The Joker's execution and The Dark Knight Rises,926,218,138,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1jizec/the_jokers_execution_and_the_dark_knight_rises/,"Possibly the largest unanswered question from The Dark Knight Rises is the question of what exactly happened to the Joker. After Heath Ledger's tragic death, Christopher Nolan promised that they wouldn't recast or address the Joker in The Dark Knight Rises because he wanted Ledger to have full ownership of the role. Obviously that explanation plays better in the real world than in the Nolan Batman universe, which means we still need an in universe explanation for the Joker's absence.

There is quite a bit of evidence to support the idea that the Joker was executed during the events of The Dark Knight Rises.

First, given that all of the prisoners from Blackgate were freed, we can clearly see that the Joker was not incarcerated in Blackgate. It is possible that the Joker was incarcerated in isolation elsewhere in Gotham, but in the chaotic months that Bane controlled Gotham, there would be no corrections officers there to guard him. Obviously the Joker would be able to escape during this time. Since the Joker obviously played no role in The Dark Knight Rises it is safe to assume he isn't in Gotham.

Second, we must look at the nature of the Joker's crimes and the implications of the Dent Act. In virtually any death penalty state, the murder of the police commissioner, a judge and other law enforcement officers would automatically be grounds for the death penalty. As Gotham is more or less an analogue for New York City we can assume it held a similar opinion on the death penalty prior to the events of The Dark Knight. In New York there is currently a moratorium on the death penalty, but even after the moratorium death sentences can be handed down, they just can't be carried out. The Dent Act saw a significant increase in both police and prosecutorial powers, that made it virtually impossible for those involved in organized crime to plead insanity or be given parole. Given this extreme push for law and order its not that big of a logical leap to argue that the moratorium on the death penalty would end. This would put the Joker in line as the first person to be executed in Gotham in a long time.

Third, we need to look at the timing of The Dark Knight Rises. Death penalty cases tend to have a rather lengthy appeals process. 8 years is actually on the shorter end for a death row inmate to go from conviction to execution, but it is far from unheard of. We know that Batman remained active for a short while after the events of The Dark Knight, but retired sometime during the eight years between The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. During The Dark Knight, the Joker spoke to his need for Batman to exist as his counterpoint. He needs Batman around to give meaning to his existence. In the comics, the Joker enters a catatonic state upon Batman's retirement, and I would think that something similar would happen with the Joker in the Nolanverse. As such, the Joker's appeals process would be shortened as the Joker would no longer mount any defense against his upcoming execution because he doesn't have anything to live for outside of prison.

Fourth, we can look at the timing of Commissioner Gordon's confession during The Dark Knight Rises. At the beginning of the the movie, Gordon is set to undo The Dent Act by confessing his involvement in the cover up of Dent's crimes. Gordon obviously feels guilty about his role, but reconsiders and decides the timing for his confession isn't right. It is very interesting that Gordon specifically cites the timing, so we have to ask ourselves, what is unique about the 8th Dent Day that makes it so the timing isn't right? I believe that the Joker is set to be executed in the next few days (a nice symbolic sort of timing alongside Dent Day), and Gordon's confession would likely result in a stay of execution and possibly a reinstatement of a moratorium. I would argue that Gordon is considering whether he can literally live with blood on his hands due to his lie. 

When Bane reads Gordon's speech outside of Blackgate, Blake and Gordon get into an argument about the morality of Gordon's actions. Gordon states that Batman agreeing to take the blame for Dent's crimes and death allowed him to keep his hands clean. Blake responds that Gordon's hands look dirty to him as Blackgate's inmates were unfairly incarcerated and denied parole. Blake is not the sort to be soft on crime, by any stretch of the imagination. As a beat cop, Blake would know better than most the sorts of criminals that were incarcerated in Blackgate, but even still is opposed to Gordon's lie. Bruce Wayne first becomes Batman because he sees a broken justice system that allows violent criminals to operate with minimal fear of prosecution. If prosecutors were empowered to go after criminals in a much stronger fashion there would be little need for Batman. The only moral line that Batman draws is that Batman refuses to kill. Since Blake takes up the mantle of Batman, we can argue that he would have very similar morals to Batman. Strong on crime, but opposed to killing for any reason other than self defense. Yes, Blake has a problem with Gordon's methods, but he clearly supports Batman's extra-judicial actions so he shouldn't have that big of a problem with Gordon's actions unless they violate a key tenant of his morality.

Fifth, we need to look at the timing of Bane and Talia's plan. We know that Talia is the reason for the development of Wayne Enterprise's fusion reactor. Obviously the development of the reactor is a huge part of Bane and Talia's plans to take over Gotham. Talia approaches Wayne Enterprises under the guise of Miranda Tate about 5 years after the events of Batman Begins, and the project is shelved about 5 years before the events of The Dark Knight Rises. As the fusion reactor is an integral part of Talia and Bane's plan, it is fair to say that their plans was developed at least 5 years before the events of The Dark Knight Rises. So my question is: why did it take so long for Talia and Bane to put their plan into motion? Yes, their plan was very complex and involved an enormous amount of people and infrastructure, but even still I don't believe it fully accounts for the time gap between The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. It seems to me that they were waiting for something. Ras Al Ghul's plan in Batman Begins was to force Gotham to devolve into chaos as a wake up call to the rest of the world. Talia as the heir to the League of Shadows wanted to finish her father's work by bringing out Gotham's ""true colors"" before destroying it and exacting her revenge from Batman. It is impossible to predict what would happen in Gotham if the Joker was running around free, during the months that Bane occupied Gotham. As such, Talia and Bane could not guarantee that their plan would go off as planned, as long as the Joker was running around Gotham. For example, the Joker may very well start arbitrarily executing people just to see if he can luck out and find the trigger man just to see what happens. Given that Bane was willing to free the Scarecrow and use him as the judge for his citizen's tribunals, he clearly has no issues with working with the mentally unstable, but only if they are under his control. Bane had already given a speech espousing the need to free all of those held under the Dent Act, but either executing the Joker or keeping him incarcerated would be a tacit endorsement of a key implication of the Dent Act. In effect, Bane would be acknowledging the rightful authority of the state. Talia and Bane needed the Joker eliminated, but they couldn't fall in line with Gotham authorities and do so themselves. As such, they needed to wait until after the Joker had already been executed.

Finally, we have to look at the fact that Gordon held onto his speech long enough for Bane to take it from him. They find the Congressman in the bar with Selina the day after Dent Day. At this time Gordon still has his speech in his jacket pocket. This indicates that Gordon is still thinking about resigning. I don't think Gordon would be so careless as to leave such an earth shattering speech on his person if he were not still considering confessing. If it was only about Gordon's opposition to the symbolism of Dent Day, Gordon would've simply filed the speech away and waited until next year to confess. This to me indicates that there is another timely issue that would be effected by Gordon's confession. I believe that the timely issue is the Joker's execution. The clock is ticking on the Joker's execution, but when Gordon is shot he no longer has the ability to intervene. Bane takes Gordon's speech, but does not immediately act. Instead he sits on Gordon's speech for a short while, before revealing it to the world. I believe that during this time, the Joker is executed.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,1375399183.0,,,True,t3_1jizec,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1jizec/the_jokers_execution_and_the_dark_knight_rises/,

When the Narrator and Tyler were talking one bit of dialogue stuck out to me. Tyler said he called his dad that year, saying ""I'm 25, what now?"" When Tyler says his dad says for him to get married The Narrator says ""I can't get married, I'm a 30 year old boy.""

If Tyler and the Narrator are one and the same, why aren't they the same age?

Because Tyler came into existence when the Narrator's dad left his mother. He said his dad would start a family then move to a new place and start another family and do this same thing ""every six years or so"". Placing about a 5 year or so difference between the Narrator and Tyler. Tyler had been brewing in the back of his mind for 25 years. Waiting to manifest. 

Edit: I understand what people are saying about Tyler being what the narrator wants to be. I get that, that's pretty clear. What I'm saying is that the seed in the Narrator's mind was planted when he was but a wee child. Possibly born of a childlike notion akin to ""Maybe if I were better dad wouldn't have left."" But also Tyler is a part of the Narrator. Its like there are two people working someplace. One takes the day shift, one takes the night. Tyler takes the night shift. While the Narrator ""sleeps"" Tyler is in charge, and he works night jobs. But when the Narrator starts going to groups, this disrupts the cycle.

That was a cover story.,856,170,92,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1fv95h/jurassic_park_wasnt_just_supposed_to_be_an/,"Jurassic Park's conceit is that John Hammond plunged InGen into genetically fabricating (Not cloning, as is often thought) dinosaurs. Throughout the novel it's explained that since the dinosaur DNA obtained was incomplete, they used other DNA to fill the gaps. This meant that essentially, the dinosaurs were wholly manufactured by InGen, and could thus be engineered and patented by them also. 

The park wasn't intended to be the main focus nor the sole revenue source. The resort, tour, merchandise, and spin-offs were a small part of what InGen was really trying to do. By fabricating complex lifeforms and trademarking them, InGen had the potential to do that with *any* species, all the way up to and including human beings.

If anything, it behooved InGen to let Jurassic Park fail. The park's failure for any number of reasons could be used to write off the other company's losses on its books. Oh InGen's debt load is too high? That's because the park cost so much. They report it as a loss and get tax breaks. This lets them funnel more money into their engineering. 

We never got to see much of InGen outside John Hammond's vision, but it's safe to say he alone didn't oversee everything the company did. He was a very frivolous person who ignored critical details, leading to his eventual downfall. InGen stood to profit long-term by Jurassic Park's failure as a *tourist attraction*, so they could knock off Hammond from his post, and focus on where the money was - patenting and contracting its genetic designs. 

**tl;dr** InGen wanted the park to fail anyway to get rid of Hammond. It would then write off those losses and use Jurassic Park's products (the dinosaurs) to win contracts to develop other patented, genetically-altered organisms, possibly including human beings.

1350580406.0,675,self.FanTheories,11p518,Dodgeball: Steve the Pirate is an ex-Navy sailor with PTSD,803,128,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/11p518/dodgeball_steve_the_pirate_is_an_exnavy_sailor/,"First thing's first, PTSD is a serious condition and I'm not mocking it in any way.  Now, with that out of the way....

So I was watching ""Dodgeball"" last night, and noticed for the first time during the car wash scene that Steve the Pirate has a couple Navy-Style tattoos. Now, I know normal people and pirates can also have tattoos, but these appeared to be basic Navy style; blue ink, anchor with ropes, etc.  This got me thinking.

Steve the Pirate is one of those oddball movie characters that never really gets an explanation; but how and why would someone act this way 100% of the time, and why would everyone around him completely ignore it. So here's my half-worked theory:

Steve the Pirate is an ex-Navy sailor who suffers from PTSD.  Any number of things could have happened to cause this, so I won't speculate too much about that, but the evidence starts to pop up in the movie if you think about it.

1. Steve's actions early in the movie:  Some typical PTSD symptoms are flashbacks, hyper-vigilance or alertness, and avoidance of real-life issues.  The first time we meet Steve the Pirate, he ""attacks"" Peter and asks him ""who goes there?!"" even after clearly seeing Pete's face. Steve is showing an insane amount of over-alertness, and a clear paranoia of danger. He also seems detached from the situation, since he doesn't notice for several moments that the person he's holding a knife to is his friend. After coming to his senses, he clearly sees he made a mistake and goes back into super-pirate mode.

2. Everyone else's reaction to Steve:  Everyone else in the group completely ignores Steve's quirks. Even when Peter is jumped by him, he is startled at first, but quickly talks Steve down and than disregards it. Why? Because Peter, possibly having known Steve prior to his condition, is aware of the real problem.  Steve may have been violent, unproductive, or visibly upset much of the time after developing his condition, but prior to taking up his new identity. They realize Steve is using his pirate persona as a way of escapism. If Steve can act in a surreal manner in his everyday life, it makes his problems seem less important to himself, and allows him to function as a ""normal"" member of the group. Thus, everyone else lets him play it out.

3. What does Steve do for a living if he's constantly at the gym or dressed as a pirate?: The answer, is nothing. (This is where my own personal experience comes in, since a friend of mine went through this.) PTSD is something that can cause a soldier or sailor to be Medically Discharged from service. It is also something that can prompt Social Security and Military benefits to kick in. So, the answer here is that Steve, because of his condition, receives funds and benefits from the Government in return for his service to the country, and his ongoing side-effects from it. This explains how a person could possibly continue such a visible charade while still being able to support himself financially.


Near the end of the film, in a moment of weakness, Peter becomes fed up with letting Steve live this lie and tells him he's not a pirate. If Peter can't escape his real-world problems, why should Steve be able to? This causes Steve to take a long, hard look at what he's been doing, and what he's been putting his friends through. Steve ultimately comes out of it having made a breakthrough of sorts, until he sees the buried treasure, that is. Steve of course knew he wasn't a real pirate all this time, and his friends knew it too, but Steve is now able to at least admit that he knows what he's doing, even if he still finds it more fun to say ""GARRRR"" a few times a minute.

I actually think this makes Steve's character more real in terms of the movie. Steve the Pirate was one of the more unbelievable aspects of the movie in my mind before coming up with this. He goes from being an off-the-wall joke character with no back-story, to a believable addition to the actual group of social castaways.

1356227607.0,666,self.FanTheories,15b25f,The Simpsons: The Springfield Effect,826,160,147,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/15b25f/the_simpsons_the_springfield_effect/,"The legendary town of Springfield is a mysterious place that seems to be trapped within a dimension in which time and space as well as all laws of physics hold little to no meaning. This disregard for all the natural laws of physics allows the town to be much bigger than the space it takes up. West Springfield has been reported to be three times the size of Texas. It is also able to shift location as needed. It apparently shifts location to anywhere in the lower forty-eight states. The movement seems random. Sometimes it shifts several times a day, other times it will remain in the same place for several weeks before suddenly moving. Springfield also seems to be able to be in more than one place at once. Inhabitants have stated that their home borders on the states of Nevada, Maine and Kentucky. 


This state of geographical flux also seems to affect the internal geography of Springfield, allowing for the church to be next to a local bar one day and then on the other end of town on the next. Similarly, the home of a local family, the Simpsons, is located next to the nuclear power plant on one occasion and miles away from it on others. Some structures have spontaneously appeared for brief periods of time and then disappeared forever. These include, but are not limited to: The Springfield Buddhist Temple, a mansion inhabited by former president George Bush, a mountain known as the Murderhorn, a statue of a two-headed goat that solved crimes, and a cliff that displayed the face of a local resident – Lisa Simpson – carved into it. In all cases, nobody seemed to notice that these places had appeared or vanished.


The city is also stuck in a time loop. No citizen of Springfield ages and children repeat the same grade over and over again despite having graduated multiple times. There have been internal chronal fluctuations. Apu Nahasapeemapetilon – a Springfield shopkeeper – is the father of octuplets. His children have suddenly aged a year while the rest of the town didn’t age at all. Again, these internal fluxes are not noticed by the local populace.


There is, however, one exception. Death is still permanent. Unless – and this seems to be the one exception to the exception – when a local resident perishes on October 31st, also known as Halloween. On this day, the physics that do apply to Springfield are nullified. People’s heads turn into donuts, cloning suddenly becomes common place and, on one occasion, a school of witchcraft had been established in Springfield.


The residents seem oblivious to all these strange occurrences. A commonly held theory is that whatever causes the disregard for physics and time also affects the memory of the town’s inhabitants. Whenever a citizen of Springfield leaves town, he or she is always able to find their home again. It is unknown how this is possible. Theories include that the traveller is drawn to the town, no matter where it is currently located. This would imply that citizens of Springfield have more senses than other human beings, most notably a sixth sense that allows them to find their home. Alternate claims are that the town shifts location to the place where the traveller has left the town when the traveller wants to return home. This would imply that the town is a sentient and aware being, having some form of clairvoyance. 


The reasons for the so-called “Springfield Phenomenon” are unknown. It is possible that yearly visits by extra-terrestrials from a planet known to citizens of Springfield as Rigel-7 hold some connection. The voice of the Judeo-Christian God himself has been heard in Springfield on numerous occasions. It is thought to be – despite all scientifically established fact – possible that He cursed the town for some form of misdeed. There are also theories as to what this misdeed is. Most popular among them is the claim that a local man named Homer Simpson once claimed or – given the town’s temporal instability – will claim that not even the Almighty could stop his ploughing business.


On one occasion, the town of Springfield was placed under a glass dome. This seems to have removed the town’s inability to travel. It appeared to be unable to move away from the dome or escape it. It is unknown what happened to travellers from Springfield during that time. Claims that the glass dome arrested Springfield’s ability to bend time and space remain unproven.


Perhaps even more curious than the fact that time passes outside town as a logical progression from day to day and year to year, its residents acknowledge the passage of time without noticing any kind of anomaly. Prime example among these occurrences is the visit of a local known as Lisa Simpson in Washington D.C. She was instrumental in helping then-president George Bush I – president from 1989 to 1993 – passing a law that expelled a corrupt congressman. Yet Lisa, perpetually being eight years old, is now chronologically too young to even be alive during Bush’s presidency. 


Another example deals with the visit of Springfield family Simpson to Italy. There, they encountered Robert Underdunk Terwilliger Jr., colloquially known as Sideshow Bob, who had become the mayor of a small Italian town and had started a family. Even though years had passed for Terwilliger, the Simpson family were the same age as when Terwilliger had last encountered them in their hometown. Not only did the Simpsons not notice this, Terwilliger did not either. It is also worth noticing that Terwilliger himself is a former resident of Springfield, which may account for his inability to notice these fluctuations. Further observation will be necessary to determine whether Terwilliger will remain immortal outside Springfield’s town limits while his family ages. Should that not occur, tests will be required to determine whether prolonged stay outside the town limits will undo what physicists refer to as “The Springfield Effect”.


Since the residents of Springfield – affected by the Springfield Effect – never age, the question arises of how old the people inhabiting the town really are. Reports of Springfield first surfaced in 1987, with more concrete data beginning to arrive around Christmas 1989. From that point onwards, Springfield appears continuously in the rest of the world’s linear history. Whether or not he town of Springfield experienced history in the same linear fashion as the rest of the world did, is unknown at this point. However, stories told by the locals and shreds of historical evidence suggest that the town and its people may in fact be much older than the late 20th century. Stories have surfaced of the Springfield residents of today existing as lumberjacks in the 19th century and pilgrims in the 17th century. There are even reports that the town existed during the times of ancient Greece. While some of these may be attributed to hearsay and rumours, the fact that the inhabitants of Springfield in these stories perfectly mirror people in the modern Springfield is intriguing. This would also imply that the residents would suffer from a kind of amnesia that may or may not occur in regular intervals, erasing the memories of the town’s inhabitants to suit the needs and mindsets of the times changing outside of town. This would enforce the belief that the town itself is a sentient being. This would also lead to the conclusion that the townspeople manufacture false memories on a daily basis and would thus open the possibility that they have been alive for hundreds of years but have lost all knowledge of their immortality.


These selective memories seem to be confirmed as locals, currently known as Marjorie “Marge” Simpson, née Bouvier, and Homer Jay Simpson have reported to remember their high-school time as taking place during the 1970s. When asked to repeat their memories a few years later, they remembered the same period as taking place during the 1980s.


Tests to determine Springfield’s physical properties have all yielded less than conclusive results. One experiment – conducted by local scientist Professor John Nerdelbaum Frink, Jr., led to the entire town exploding. This, however, did cause the town to cease to exist. It instantly rebuilt itself and life within town limits continued as if nothing happened. This generally seems to be the case whenever catastrophic events occur, which they do with alarming regularity. However, these disasters never seem to affect anyone living outside of Springfield. Similarly, outsiders do not even notice the catastrophic damage to the town.

**EDIT II:** I am now working on an updated, expanded and better laid out version of this. So stay tuned.

1338393290.0,666,self.FanTheories,uc8cj,Inglourious Basterds is a mirror to confront the audience with it's own violent nature,766,100,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/uc8cj/inglourious_basterds_is_a_mirror_to_confront_the/,"This is a theory about the meaning of Inglourious Basterds I've thought up myself, but it's very possible that other people have thought of it as well. It seemed a bit obvious to me, but most people I've told about it IRL didn't think of it, so I thought I'd share.

Basically, IB shows us that we are all violent, sick creatures, and in the right circumstances, would be no better than the nazis. There is no good or evil.

First, consider the actions of Aldo Raine and his men, the supposed ""good guys"":
-They violently kill and torture their enemies and that's all they do. Their leader makes it abundantly clear: ""we go there for one thing, and one thing only: killing nazi's"". They don't kill for a strategic goal, or kill the few to save the many: they kill for the sake of killing.
-They don't just kill people in battle: they kill and torture unarmed men and prisoners, people who've surrendered. Raine even tortured a wounded woman, who risked her life and betrayed their country to fight for HIS side, just to be sure she was telling him the truth.

Now let's consider the actions of the nazi's, the supposed ""bad guys"":
-We see very little nazi's actually killing people. The only ones who do are Landa and his men, and the few soldiers in the restaurant scene (who had no intention to kill: they wanted to take the basterds prisoner)
-The only actual non-violent act of nobility in the entire movie is performed by a German soldier, who rather dies than betrays his country. His reward is being violently and cruelly clubbed to death by the ""bear jew"". You could consider Shoshanna and Marcel's sacrifice noble, but it was nevertheless an act of cruel murder (burning a theatre full of people).
-Hans Landa effectively tries to end world war 2 by surrendering to Raine. He doesn't care wich side wins, as long as the war ends, effectively saving thousands, if not millions of lives. We all know how he was rewarded for this by Raine.

Next, let's zoom out for a bit. Remember the way this movie was promoted? Watch the trailer again if you don't: http://youtu.be/5sQhTVz5IjQ The trailer (and all the accompanying promotion material, such as the movie posters) focuses heavily on Raine and his men and their mission. We were essentially promised a movie full of flashy nazi-killing. People went to the theatres expected exactly that, while the nazi-killing scenes made up barely ten percent of the movie.

Maybe you remember what effect these expectations had on the viewing experience: all those long scenes, filled with mostly nothing but dialogue, created a huge tension among the audiences, who were waiting and waiting when the movie would finally deliver the violence it promised them. On the few occasions that it did, it was usually over in a few seconds. We demanded blood, and we didn't get it, and this made us uneasy. I can't think of a better way to confront people with their own bloodlust.

But Tarantino can: remember the climax scene in the movie theatre? What was happening there? If you were watching it in a movie theatre, you were part of an audience watching a movie about killing nazi's, which at that moment was showing a movie theatre full of nazi's watching a movie about killing allied soldiers, and howling and cheering for all the violence going on on-screen. Basically, you and the rest of the audience where watching yourselves: first you saw a theatre full of supposedly bad people: they were, after all, cheering on the images of people getting killed. Next, you were watching an entire theatre full of people getting burned to the ground, and you probably loved it. You were doing the exact same thing those nazi's were doing a few minutes before.

If those people on screen were bad people, what does that make us? The conclusion is that there is no good or evil, only violence.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_uc8cj,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/uc8cj/inglourious_basterds_is_a_mirror_to_confront_the/,

Evidence:

* **Career and Lifestyle**: There are lots of struggling actors in Southern California working menial jobs to make ends meet. After a while of getting nowhere, they usually either become a character actor, do porn (which has been hinted at for Penny, but of course never happens), or do something else. That something else could be related to acting, but it is a little bizarre that  Penny constantly gets absolutely nowhere in the industry and never thinks about her return on investment.  She's taken acting classes, but never has gotten an agent, headshots, or any of the work associated with being a professional actor and building an identity, reputation, and network in the industry.  She did take some community college courses earlier this season, but again it was taken as a joke, she's getting massive help from Bernadette and Amy.  The truth is that Penny never wants to better herself, since that would complicate or destroy her cover.

* **Computer and technlogy**: Penny is seen using a laptop and the internet, even getting addicted to online gaming.  Not once (at least from what she allows the guys to see) does she think to use this technology to her advantage in pursuit of her acting career (start a website, twitter, post YouTube videos).  She also ""steals"" the WiFi from the guys, claiming to be too poor to afford her own.  The truth is that it is much easier to monitor what they are doing online when they are all sharing the same connection.  Her ""addiction"" to online gaming was a clever way to hover over Sheldon's shoulder as he would start the game, and maybe he played in a windowed mode, so that when he went to the bathroom she could snoop even more directly.

* **Friends, roomates, and other relationships**: Before Amy and Bernadette were brought into the series as regulars, Penny was basically friendless (outside the geek guys).  She had lots of boyfriends (mostly there to entice Leonard to make his move), and generic party friends, but nobody she confided in, and nobody she moved out to California with.  If she was really a struggling actress she would want to make her paycheck stretch as far as possible, which would include getting a roomate or two.  Not once has the landlord put up an eviction notice, or a note that rent was late.  There was an episode where her power was cut, but that can be simulated by flipping a switch in the circuit breaker.  Penny doesn't have real money troubles, because she's well taken care of.

* **Why?**: In ""The Staircase Implementation"" the origin story of Leonard and Sheldon's relationship is revealed, and why the elevator is broken (explosion caused by Leonard, who just recently broke up with Joyce Kim, a North Korean spy).  The truth is that an explosion happening inside an elevator shaft, probably garnered a couple of calls to the authorities, and although the local police may have dropped the case, the feds did not.  They know that two scientists, that routinely work on government projects, live there and may have even stumbled upon the relationship Leonard had with a North Korean spy.  Leonard and Sheldon can't be prosecuted without revealing the secret rocket fuel, and so the feds simply monitor them, and when they need more information they send in their best agent.

I'm typing this all on my iPhone so please excuse any errors, formatting, spelling or otherwise.

Through out the films there is a running theme of overall morality and the struggles with moral compromise. In TDK, we are shown that the end game for Gordon and Batman is to accomplish a successful transition over to Harvey Dent. As we all know this plan is scrapped when the Joker exposes his ace in the hole and corrupts Harvey and transforms him into Two Face. 

The reason this plan was so important was because Dent was everything that Batman was and MORE. Like Batman, Dent was incorruptible, but as a public figure and elected official of the city's legal system he had that one thing Batman would never be able to attain, credibility. It is those attributes as Harvey Dent, and not Two Face, that made Dent the shining light Gotham needed, it's ""White Knight"".

Now Bruce Wayne/Batman, as we all know,  is that ""immovable Object"" with the one rule that is unwavering. The inability to kill even when it serves the greater good. Although he can be perceived as not the hero. As Gordon states at the end of TDK, ""because that's what we need him to be, he's a silent guardian."" (Paraphrased of course). Batman's operation outside of the traditional legal system is what makes his methods so effective, but in the long run will never be fully sustainable or accepted by the public and this what makes him ""The Dark Knight"". 

Then in TDKR we are introduced to John Blake, a relatively made up character in the Nolanverse outside of one obscure coloring book appearance. We learn he is a forgotten child of Gotham, a son that was forced into a boy's home in the inner city. He eventually ages out of the system and become a cop with GPD and a very enthusiastic one at that. Very similar to Comish Gordon, so much so it draws ire from other senior officers on the force. We see he has the smarts to apparently figure out what nobody else did up to that point, that Bruce Wayne is Batman, and possesses the grit to do what is necessary when his life is in danger. As the movie comes to a close we are let in to the fact that Blake's real first name is Robin, in the ending montage we see that Wayne Manor has been converted into the new location for the boys home that Blake was raised in and that Bruce had given Blake the coordinate and the means to get into the Batcave. We assume that Blake is to take over as Batman and possibly even cultivate new apprentices from the boys school overhead. 

Blake is chosen to take over because he is a very close to perfect balance between Harvey Dent, (being groomed in the legitimate legal system of Gotham and knowing when to use lethal force even though it sickens him to do so) and Batman (the symbol, the morally incorruptible anti hero that can stand against the underbelly of Gotham alone).  He is the next generation of Gotham, the forgotten son of Gotham that embodies both most of the best characteristics of both Gotham's White and Dark Knights. He is the balance, he is the Gray son. 

TL;DR- Robin John Blake is a made up character by Nolan that was never a Robin in any of the comics. But he is the perfect mix of Gotham's White and Dark Knights, Harvey Dent and Batman making him the Gray Son. As in Grayson, the original Robin.

Autobots are the evil, misguided ones.",765,124,186,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/100uuo/the_decepticons_are_the_good_guys_autobots_are/,"I've talked a little about this [before](http://pt.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/xtxtj/this_is_kindof_a_stupid_question_but_is_there/c5u6rev) but thought I'd consolidate and flesh it out a bit here.

Throughout all of the Transformers continuities (the notable exception being *Shattered Glass*) there have always been the ""noble Autobots"" and the ""evil Decepticons"". As a child I accepted this at face value but as I got older — and especially as different continuities appeared — I found myself disagreeing with this assertion.

I believe the Autobots are the evil ones. The Decepticons are the true heroes, and Megatron is about as pure as they come.

In the generally accepted comic book canon Megatron was an energy miner — a nobody, in the grand scheme of things. The Autobots ran Cybertron and a great deal of the Cybertronian government bolstered by the Autobot military (led by Sentinel Prime) was corrupt. It was through this corruption that birthed Megatron and the Decepticons. The Decepticons didn't fight for conquest, they were fighting for their rights. They were fighting for their fair share of energy and a better standard of living, something the corrupt Autobot government would not allow purely for profit-driven class reasons.

Megatron was effectively trapped in a system where nothing he could do within the law could have a positive effect on the society he was a part of. It was illegal for him to speak up and illegal to organize, and the entire political system was engineered to keep things that way, to keep the ruling class Autobots in power. The only recourse left to him was all-out revolution. Anything else would have been an impotent half-step, an incomplete effort that would have done nothing more than invite the corrupt to improve their ways and make another attempt at takeover.

So, Megatron found himself at the vanguard of a movement to destroy the corrupt Autobot leadership. And how do you go about fighting a corrupt government with a powerful military at their disposal? Through terroristic tactics. Sneak attacks. Backstabbing. It was the only way to break the cycle. ""All warfare is based on deception.""

Deception. Decepticons.

Did the Decepticons start the war? Nope. It was the Autobots who fired first, both figuratively (through manipulations of corrupt government) and literally (with the attack on the mining team that Megatron was on the receiving end of). Megatron counterattacked in self defense. Sure, he was brutal, but would you really be expected to be gentle if someone was out to deprive you of life and limb?

In the early stages of the war the Autobots never sought peace with the Decepticons, they sought surrender. Of COURSE the Decepticons aren't going to accept that. As the war raged on their pleas for peace were seen, perhaps rightfully so, as the pleas of a society which was almost ready to give up. You can blame Megatron for draining Cybertron of its resources all you want, but the fact remains that the Autobots were draining Cybertron at least as much as Megatron was. And while the Autobots were fighting to maintain the status quo and keep the Autobots in power, Megatron was fighting for equality and the end to political corruption and oppression. If that meant tearing down an otherwise-unresponsive power base and all that supported it, and there was no other way to affect such a change, then wouldn't the end actually justify the means?

So what about Megatron's obvious contempt for other forms of life? My response to that would be, so what? Humans are at least as contemptuous to other forms of life as Megatron is. We humans routinely stomp out ant nests, poison wasp hives, step on spiders, bomb cockroaches, evict bats, and run over squirrels without barely a second thought, and that's just in our domestic existence. In the broader sense of the world humans are responsible for mass deforestation and ecological rape for the sake of providing power, food and shelter for its population. And why shouldn't we? Those ""lesser creatures"" don't have the same degree of sentience as we humans have and certainly aren't capable of understanding our needs or why we do what we do. In that regard, humans are no different from the Decepticons.

And that's exactly the kind of contempt that Megatron views humans and most other life forms in the universe. The extension of the battle to Earth and the involvement of the humans was just another resource allocation to Megatron. In his eyes, the humans — a species which he generally regarded with the same contempt as we humans regard cockroackes — allied themselves with the power-hungry socially-suppressive Autobot regime. So, from Megatron's perspective, the Autobots landed on an energy-rich planet that the local vermin were willing to share with them in order to maintain their oppressive rule. Megatron would no sooner enter into talks with the human race than we would open negotiations with cockroaches in our homes. What do we humans do when we move into a house or apartment that has cockroaches in it? We exterminate for our betterment. And so does Megatron. So he's not being ""evil"" there either. He's just got a different perspective which the humans lack, and if you were to ask him, the humans are incapable of even understanding the existence of that perspective.

Optimus Prime is heroic to be sure, but what are his motives? If peace were truly his primary goal then he would have entered into negotiations with Megatron a LONG time ago, with the first concession being the dissolution of the Autobot regime. He didn't do that. Why not? If he were to tap into the wisdom of the Matrix he certainly would have seen the corruption of the Autobots, right?

Unless the Matrix were already similarly corrupted by Autobot sparks. Whoops.

Mind you, this isn't to say that the Decepticons were saints. Many of the Decepticons were psychotic. Shockwave was particularly nasty. But Megatron, like all good military leaders, made good use out of the materials at hand. Who cares if they were psychotic if they helped solve the problem? And when their usefulness has come to an end and they have nothing left to offer the new society, they're discarded. We humans do the same thing; look at our prison system.

So, there you have it: Autobots are manipulative power-hungry bots seeking to reinstate themselves as the head of a socially corrupt society. Decepticons are desperate terrorists looking to restore their home world and create a dictatorship to ensure Autobot corruption never happens again.

1363228411.0,637,self.FanTheories,1a9dga,Regarding Pokeballs,782,145,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1a9dga/regarding_pokeballs/,"If you ever look inside of one in the anime, it's basically a bunch of mirrors. So, how exactly does this work? Well, the pokemon is converted into light, and then bounces around inside the pokeball at lightspeed, until it is needed again.  

Whenever a pokemon is caught in the anime, there's a red light around it as it gets sucked into the ball. Whenever one is released, the light is blue, or close to it.  

That's a redshift and a blueshift. If you've taken a quantum mechanics course, you know that humans have a wavelength, but it's negligible. Like, it's so damn small, it doesn't really matter. All things have a wavelength. So, the pokemon's wavelength increases as it gets sucked into the pokeball to compress it's body into data stored as light, and it decreases as it's being released, until it returns to the wavelength of the solid pokemon.  

This also explains how you can store pokemon in a PC. You're converting the solid pokeball with light stored as data into even more compressed data. ^dawg

Basically, the world of Pokemon somehow figured out quantum computing and how to convert matter into energy for the sake of storage.  

The fucked up part is, they somehow used to use apricorns to do this, in the way olden days.  

So, like, they carved god damn *acorns* into computers sophisticated enough to convert matter into energy.  

...Or, it isn't the storage device that does it, but Pokemon possess the ability to convert matter to energy, and the pokeball just exploits this and forces them to do it. This would make sense, as the more they exert themselves and train, the more energy (or, experience) they build up. When they reach a certain point, they're able to convert that stored energy into matter - ""evolution"" - and become larger, and fundamentally change their bodies.  

And if they possess the ability to spontaneously turn matter into energy and vice versa, this also explains how they can shoot out fire or water from seemingly nowhere. They're converting their own body's chemistry into this raw form. Which also explains why in the games there is a limit to how much they can do this before it's drained out.  


**tl;dr**: Uhh...I'm not sure I can summarize this. Pokemon convert matter to energy, pokeballs exploit this in them and force this change to occur, storing them as data and light. There's some actual science in the show that backs it up.  

Afterthought: I think pokemon *actually* obey the laws of physics. Wat.  


**(edit: further delving into this idea)**  

This would also explain why you can't capture a pokemon that has fainted. They lose the ability to convert to energy when they're not conscious.  

And have you ever wondered what happens when a pokemon dies? Well, they don't leave a corpse, that's for sure. I mean, have you seen the amount of graves in Lavender Town? Or the other grave sites in the other games. Imagine fitting a dead snorlax into one of those tight graves, you *couldn't*. That's because when they die, they convert completely to energy. This energy might sometimes reform as a ghost pokemon, though.  

Really, the gravestones are just markers. There are no bodies in any of the pokemon towers.  

And, for whatever reason, the ghosts just like to hang out there. Maybe they're attracted to sadness? Maybe they know their old owners might be there crying at their memorials, and they have the longing to go back and see them, even if they don't consciously remember them?  

This is getting off topic from pokeballs, though, and delving into an entirely new theory altogether.

-Why do demons communicate with things that can be picked up by a baby monitor

-Why if they were Demons did they scout out the house first. If it was end of days they wouldnt be careful or make plans.

-The demons stayed away from lakes. This doesnt make sense if only holy water could hurt them.

-Whats with the crop circles. Why do demons make huge patterns that can be seen from the sky yet do not put them anywhere else like walls or doors. 

I think they seem a bit too logical to be evil chaos incarnate monsters

I mentioned before in comments but I think that the Aliens have come to earth many times throughout history always causing chaos. We have intergrated them into our Lore and Religion. So the demons actually are the aliens. 

Also user nothis theorised the tap water was contaminated with something that made it harmful to the aliens. The girl mentions it near the start about stuff in the water. Thats why she gets a new glass all the time. Would explain why the air moisture doesnt kill them .

end edit...

Whenever this movie comes up in conversation people always mention 2 things. 1 the movie was terrible and 2 Aliens with a weakness to water invade a planet full of water. 

Why invade earth? A world so full of water it falls from the sky and the creatures are made from the stuff. 

My theory is that they were not invading. They were dropping off criminals . Earth is so inhospitible to them they use it as a Prison planet. Possibly for the worst kind of criminals with life sentences. 

Why it was a prison and not a invasion or raid

- in an environment so dangerous to them they walk around naked with no weapons, protection or technology. Obviously they get no help when they arrive and have to rely on their natural defences like the poison.

-If it was a raid to kidnap people they still had no devices other than close quarters gas (lol) to subdue the targets. They were hardly the special forces of their race. one of them got trapped in a pantry for godsake

-In no point during their visit do they use Spacecraft or weapons to attack earth defences. Nor are any alien ships recovered. Prisoners dont need help. 
And again if it was a kidnap raid surely they could of used some largescale gas deployment from their ships.

-They are sophisticated enough to make navigational beacons without being detected (crop circles). So its highly likely they would have technology to determine if Earth was safe to colonise. They would quickly discover Earth would be a hellhole to any alien that landed, Yet they still did. Perfect place to exile political prisoners tho.
also explains why this so called invasion was over so quickly. Not even a week. Worldwide invasion. 2 days. They pretty much dropped them off and got the hell outa there.

-Aliens were seen worldwide in small numbers. Why spread so far when you only have one or two alienguys as backup. Its because they didnt want the criminals meeting up with old partners and forming plans. Spread out the smart ones so they cant build a rocket.

-The family manage to pick up alien messages on a baby monitor. As stupid as this sounds I theorise that the aliens around the farm managed to build some crude communication device. Using our radio technology. 

-Its sort of implied that they sent scouts down first. (They hear one outside the house early on) I find it unlikely that the aliens reported back to their superiors that Bumblefuck USA or some Brazil suburb were great places to start the invasion. Id say they were scouts sent down to make sure there was no equipment and resources the prisoners could use to escape.

The Aliens probably make visits every hundred years or whatever to drop off large amounts of prisoners 

This theory kinda makes the last alien scene, where it dies to water, sad. Because really he was a desperate man with no where to go.

TL;DR Either the Aliens were prisoners or the stupidest invaders in the universe

* No emotional attachments. Goku's key to transformation was the despair from losing Krillin, and how the same would happen to all his friends on Earth and countless other species if he failed. Vegeta's was his desire to surpass Goku. Gohan's was his need to make his dad proud of him. In Saiyan society, this kind of emotional attachment didn't happen. Vegeta didn't give a rat's ass about Nappa, Raditz, and Kakarot early on, despite them being the last of his dead race. Bardock didn't care about his son until he started seeing him in visions, and I'd bet he completely forgot Raditz existed. Saiyans just didn't care enough about anyone but themselves to have a ""need"" to transform.

* Saiyans hardly ever fought at their own level, thus they hardly ever improved from their fights because of it. They just fly off to planets full of weaker species, genocided their race, laughed at their inferiority and ran off. Raditz, Nappa, and Vegeta all lost their composure when they think they might be outmatched. Raditz freaked out, Nappa fought sloppily and Vegeta decided ""fuck this planet and everything on it."" Weightlifters don't get stronger by lifting the same weight all the time, and gamers don't get better by sticking to easy mode and noob servers. When Vegeta started fighting opponents who were actually threats to him on Namek, he gained power very rapidly.

* The Zenkai, or power boost from recovering from injuries, is hardly ever taken advantage of. Of course, this blends with my previous point of Saiyans never actually fighting people equal to or greater than them. And I highly doubt a Saiyan beat down when genociding a planet would be allowed to heal and gain power from it, either. And when Nappa lied broken at Vegeta's feet, Vegeta killed him, saying that a ""crippled Saiyan is a useless Saiyan,"" and it's likely it was standard practice to execute damaged Saiyans before Frieza blew their planet up. If Nappa somehow recovered from his injuries, (I don't know how effective the PTO's healing tanks are) I'm sure he would get a substantial power boost out of it. Possibly even stronger than Goku was at the time. Minus the Kaio-Ken of course. Even then, Goku's love of challenge and Vegeta's massive pride (they're both kind of idiots, choosing honor over reason whenever possible) kept them from abusing the Zenkai to overcome any problem they had. Except that one time with Frieza. I give Vegeta a pass for that one, though. Frieza's some scary shit.

* Saiyan Hierarchy keeps the ""low-class"" Saiyans down. Vegeta tells Goku that no amount of training could bring Goku up to Vegeta's level, and he probably beat this into Nappa and Raditz's heads whenever possible. The low-class Saiyans don't have the motivation to train and surpass the elite and nobility, and thus, the elite don't feel any reason to improve themselves to keep the lowly commoners in check. If Nappa and Raditz were to train hard enough to approach Vegeta in terms of power, Vegeta would probably train several times as hard just to keep himself ahead of them. Assuming he doesn't get angry and kill them first. Bardock and his crew pretty much said ""lol fuk dat shit"" and became much more powerful than their ""class"" says they should be, with Bardock ""rivaling King Vegeta"" in terms of power. This of course, is what causes Frieza to see the Saiyan's potential and wipe them out before they became a problem. Smart man, too bad he was too much of a proud dipshit to finish off Vegeta and Goku when he had a chance.

So, tl;dr:
-No emotional attachments
-No real challenges, and no improving from losing a fight
-Hierarchy keeps the low class down, and keeps the royalty from improving as a consequence

But wait! Why doesn't Goku become super powerful in Dragonball? He obviously has emotional attachments, lost fights and improved all the time, and he didn't let anybody keep him down! Why wasn't he a Super Saiyan by the time he hit puberty? Because he didn't need to. His motivation in the Piccolo saga, for example, was ""become strong enough to defeat King Piccolo."" And he did. Then it was ""become strong enough to defeat the Saiyans,"" ""Become strong enough to defeat Frieza,"" and so on. It wasn't until late in the series that his motivation was ""Become as strong as it was physically possible for him to be, then become more powerful than that."" Vegeta had a desire to get revenge on Frieza, sure, but Frieza and his henchmen did a good job at keeping Vegeta down. When Vegeta found out about the Dragonballs, and gained a desire for immortality, that his motivation to defeat Frieza was rekindled, and that's when his power grew. Once Frieza was killed, his sole motivation from then on was ""Become strong enough to defeat Kakarot."" And with Goku's motivation of ""Become as strong as you possibly can, and don't stop ever"" is when their power levels grew to the godlike ridiculousness that it did.

In short, Raditz didn't have to be as weak as a Saibaman. He could probably ascend to Super Saiyan just as easily as Goku did if hea had the chance.

The game's [trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4imWvoqxmc) says that you play as the captain, but there are several problems with this.

For one, while you loose the game if all of your crewmen die, additional crew can be purchased throughout the game, so all three of the original crew (presumably including the ship's captain) can be killed off, but but the player still controls the ship provided that there's still some form of a crew aboard. If, however, you were the AI, the player's involvement would only be hampered if the ship itself were destroyed, or if there was no crew aboard to perform the tasks that required a physical presence (which happen to be the game's actual loss conditions).

Secondly, the player has full control of the ship, even if you were to lock all of the crew members in rooms without access to the ship's systems. Or, to cite an extreme example, you can be down to your last crew member who is recovering from near-death in the med bay, but the ship is still fully controllable. Who would be able to do this, if not an AI?

Thirdly is the pause ability. At any given point, the player can pause the game and calculate their next move, selecting targets for the weapons systems, managing power output, relaying orders to the crew, etc. Obviously no human can stop time to consider their next move, but if we were controlling an AI, this would simply be because the AI was making decisions at such a rapid speed that time *seemed* to be standing still.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_18gpbr,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/18gpbr/ftl_faster_than_light_you_are_the_ships_ai/,

After the death of his parents, Bruce Wayne's young mind cracked and he created the character Batman as a detective that would solve the mystery of his parents' murder. Alfred couldn't take care of the child that had gone insane with grief, so he sent him to Arkham Asylum, a place Bruce grew to revile. In Bruce's delusional state, he made villains out of the caretakers and gave them names based on their physical characteristics or general demeanor. Since he would never solve his parents' murder, he created stories in which these villains hatched preposterous schemes and he would foil them as a means to keep himself distracted. 

Alfred would come to visit and attempt to be the voice of reason, but never could really get through. Dr. Jonathan Crane tried various methods to snap Bruce back into reality, but Bruce's reality is so terrifying that he receded back into the delusion. Dr. Edward Nigma, a therapist, would try to reason Bruce back in to the real world, but Bruce would twist his words into riddles. So, he continues to chase these villains and bring them to Arkham Asylum from which they will inevitably escape - because they were never actually incarcerated.

I was trying to figure out why the Joker has multiple explanations for how he got his scars and it all started making sense.

My explanation of the scenes will involve the scene as it happens and then me trying to explain how each part supports my theory.

He has two fully spoken stories which are;
-his father who was a drinker got mad at his mom one night and cut his cheeks
-he did it to himself to make his gambling-addicted wife realize the scars didn't matter

Before he starts a monologue, there's some sort of trigger. Let me explain each scene first.

During the scene when he kills Gambol, he's in Gambol's [underground?] casino/bar, much like the setting his wife would have been in where she would have been gambling or his father if he had been drinking. This is the first trigger. He grabs Gambol and after he does, the camera shows him looking far to the left and right before staring Gambol in the face. This is where he's noticed his surroundings and his emotional trigger is pulled. He tells Gambol his story before killing him.

The next person he tells a story to is Rachel Dawes at the dinner party. Before he does though, he says to a man, ""You remind me of my father...I *hated* my father."" [first trigger] This is where Rachel intervenes and he says, ""So I had a wife, *beautiful*, like you."" [second trigger] ""Who tells me I worry too much, that I ought to smile more."" [signs of depression/emotional distress] ""Who **gambles** and gets in deeps with the **sharks**."" [Gambol was part of the mob/loan sharks] Then, he says ""I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars."" His voice gets very forced and shaky when he says that last line. ""She can't stand the sight of me! She leaves...""

During the last storytelling scene, where the Joker has Batman pinned, Batman says, ""What were you trying to prove? That deep down everyone's as ugly as you? You're alone."" [trigger] Joker: ""Speaking of which, do you wanna know how I got these scars?"" Then, Batman interrupts his mouth with cold steel. As he's hanging upside-down, he says ""...until their spirit breaks completely. Until they get a good look at the *real* Harvey Dent."" And then, ""Madness...as you know is like gravity...all it takes it a little push.""

Okay, so to summarize, each time the joker is about to tell a story about his scars there's some sort of trigger that puts him into a state of focus that makes him want to tell the story in the first place. Each story is a recount of a traumatic event from his past. The scars are only an excuse for him to be able to say what happened because he's in a state of denial and tries to associate the event with his scars instead of just himself; his dad was abusive, his wife was spiteful of him and left, he had little to no money afterwards, etc. This is why he has multiple stories for the origins of his scars. The order he tells the stories in parallels his life starting from when he was young, to when he was a young adult. He only includes the scars in his stories because they connect with his current state. When he's describing the scene when his wife left him, he says she left him because she was disgusted with him and because of traumatic denial, he tried to explain to her that it didn't bother him so she shouldn't worry about it.

His life has been one bad accident after the other and each bad thing that happened left an *emotional scar* until one day he was finally pushed. [perhaps losing his job?] He carved his face as a way to manifest his mentality as a physical object much like some extremely depressed people will self-harm to make the pain ""real"".

**tl;dr the Joker from TDK isn't talking about his physical scars when he explains ""how he got them"", he's referring to emotional scars that he collected all throughout his life and each retelling is just a different traumatic event.**

One last note, I think that Batman was purposely meant to interrupt the Joker's third time telling the story as to leave more about his traumatic life unknown as to spare the innocence of the audience, much like Batman tries to save the innocence of Gotham from collapsing into madness.

When The Joker first makes his appearance to the Gang Members he lays down his offer to end Batman only within minutes to hear to himself labeled as""crazy"". His rebuttal? ""No, I'm not...No. I'm....not."" 
It's an understated line, but it's incredibly important, it's not just banter- it's a threat. A warning.

Making the mistake of labeling The Joker as ""crazy"" is mis understanding The Joker entirely- because he simplest sense he isn't.

To be brief, The Jokers ""Insanity"" as displayed throughout the film, is a front, it's literally his *joke*.
Every victim he confronts he provides a freudian-esque run up to a punchline- an insight or background to why he-is-who he is. All of which would be a psychologists wet dream. The only problem is, none of them line up- ""My father abused my mother and that's why I have these scars."" ""My wife- was was a gambler... and that's why I have these scars."" Theres always a reason- The story changes every time- with none providing a clear or cohesive narrative to one another because they are all lies.

The truth is, as Joker states in the very beginning, he is not ""crazy"".
A line which the Joker speaks in the interrogation room harkens to a line that is taken directly from the story in Arkham Asylum (The book not the game) The truth is, however tantalizing to a psychologist the Joker's case may be the truth is more or less pointed out here:
http://thewednesdayreader.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/joker_5-1.jpg
To paraphrase:
It is stated by the woman:

""In fact, we're not sure if he can be properly classified as insane. His latest claim is he is possessed by Baron Ghede, The Voodoo Loa (Another lie.)
...

...It's quite possible we may be looking at another kind of Super Sanity here. A brilliant modification of human perception. More suited to urban life at the end of the twentieth century.""

He he sees himself- if anything-  as an artistic reaction to the human condition, not a product of it himself. He simply claims himself to be a perfection of the modern humanist climate, rather than insane or as he so neatly puts it in the film,

""I'm not a monster. I'm just ahead of the curve."" 



The Joker was not ever insane. This is part of his gimmick.

I am surprised no one has come to the same conclusion I always had when I watched it. 

Hank is a closet homosexual. Growing up with his manly man father and in Christian beliefs caused him to suppress that side of himself. He did it so much he would reject anything he considered flamboyant, like feelings and stage performances. He married Peggy, mainly cause of her acceptance of him, but subconsciously because she is the closest he will ever come to a male on his own. Her large feet, male structure and boyish personality made it easy to accept her as his life partner. As well it took the pressure off of him to find a mate. He still rarely touches her, only when sexual need reaches a point. Most likely he never reaches a full orgasm, hence the potential reason he only had one child. 

His son is almost exactly like him, but living in a more free environment can follow his own flamboyant lifestyle. Hank sees this and is constantly trying to suppress it, worrying for his son. At the same time though he does not want him to grow up like he did so he supports him to a point. 

Hank's original true love was Bill. Bill back in the day was a handsome, all around good guy that had girls swooning. He was kind, strong, and respectful. Hank always loved him, but due to his suppressing those feelings he turned it to adoration of a best friend. Even to this day Hank takes good care of him, even though Bill has been broken and become a shell of his former self. 

Dale is the oblivious friend Hank needs. Hank can relax more around him because of how Dale can not see what is right in front of his face. Boomhauer knows. He always knew. Difference is he is incredibly respectful and cares for him unconditionally. He knows how delicate Hank is, so he will not try to help him open up. He will only remain by his side, like a faithful guard dog. 

Hank's parents know as well. His father knew since he was a child, and in such has always been hard on him. In all fact he loves his technically only son. (Discovers another later on, but not until they're grown up.) Due to him being a tough man, he believed if he only toughened his son up he can brake homosexualities hold on him. Yes impossible but we are ta;king about 70's or so and middle america. He was harsh, cruel, but all alone it was his way of trying to help the only child he had. Hank's mother on the other hand laos knew. She just did not want to accept it. She ignored it, and ignored her then husbands abuse becuase she didn't want to see it. She still loved him, he was her baby boy. Unsupporting, but loving. Even as he is grown she has a reserved way of talking to him. Kind, loving, but not supporting.

He took out all the major players, was the catalyst that would send Dent on a rampage, and finally left Gotham knowing that it's citizens, even it's prisoners, were both able and willing to sacrifice themselves rather than destroy a boat full of other people. A moral realization that would lead others to be more morally invested. Oh, and he killed everyone in front of Gordon (The most trustworthy cop in all of Gotham) so he would be the next logical person inline to be commissioner, which gives him the power to vet other good cops, (like the kid from Third Rock from the Sun) going even further to vanquish crime from the city that is as scared as he.

The width of the Brooklyn Bridge is 85 feet. During the scene where the tail destroys the bridge, the tail of the creature is double, even triple the size of the width of the bridge. I would estimate it at over 200 feet, [as shown by this picture.](http://i.imgur.com/aEBxsSo.jpg). I understand that there is some warping, but I think this is the best example. Now according to [this infographic,](http://s3.media.squarespace.com/production/465215/5327199/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/3705840490_b30241110d_b.jpg), the cloverfield monster is 180 feet tall. If we look at just the foot, it is [60 feet only in width](http://i.imgur.com/Mt04jVk.jpg). If we compare that to the official ""to scale"" figure that came out, which shows the tail, [the tail is nowhere near 200 feet.](http://i.imgur.com/6CeEQbi.jpg). Thus, I believe that the monster on the bridge is in fact the mother of the child that has awoken. I think she just accidentally takes out this bridge because she is just so big that her movements can't coincide with all the man made structures. 

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

**In response to the final close up scene being a third monster:**

I don't agree with this. Hud falls for a decent amount of time after he is ripped in half, around 6 seconds. If we use the formula for distance (d=1/2gt^2), it equals to around 178 feet, which is close to the 180 mark. I think there are two monsters. A baby, and the mother in the ocean. It's kind of like a tall building. You look straight up at a tall building and it doesn't look AS big as compared to farther away, kind of like [this picture.](http://i.imgur.com/8SmdOkW.jpg) I believe there a two main monsters, along with the tiny parasites which I chose not to count.

Eventually, her family leaves and she's adopted by Miss Jenny Honey. In order to escape her family's criminal past and to honor her new mother, Matilda renames herself Hermione Jean Honey. 

Under the care of a teacher, Hermione learns to respect good teachers and gives up her pranks, even becoming somewhat of a stick in the mud.  Miss Honey does some growing as well. She goes to night school to become a dentist, where she meets a fellow older learner, Mr. Granger. They fall in love and eventually marry.

He was fired from Disney very abruptly when he suggested his next short film which would feature computer graphics as opposed to traditional hand drawn animation, which Disney felt threatened their animators who were not familiar with computer graphics. He then worked with/helped found Pixar and they began to write Toy Story. 

Toy Story is essentially the story about Woody, a traditional western kid's toy, who is threatened by Buzz Lightyear, a new, more popular futuristic kids toy, but in the end, they are united by their love of making Andy happy; much like Disney and Pixar were united in, one could say, their love for entertaining children and storytelling.

I would not be surprised to know that this is a favorite fan theory out there: At the end of the movie, Smeagol's last act (falling into the Fires with the One Ring) was one of self sacrifice on the part of Smeagol against Gollum to save the world rather than a last desperate struggle of a villain.

Well, it most likely was a desperate struggle, but I think that it was an internal one. 

From the book:

&gt; 'Precious, precious, precious!' Gollum cried. 'My Precious! O my Precious!' And with that even as his eyes were lifted up to gloat on his prize, he stepped too far, toppled, wavered for a moment on the brink, and then with a shriek he fell. Out of the depths came his last wail of *precious,* and he was gone.

It just always seemed odd to me that we have this creature, Gollum, who has been able to do amazing feats of strength and dexterity for the entire series with little more than a loin cloth. This guy who can literally climb mountains like a spider... should suddenly at his moment of triumph trip over his own feet.

I think that Smeagol knew Gollum would eventually win out so he bid his time. When Frodo and Smeagol were fighting over the Ring, I think that that last bit of Smeagol made Gollum walk towards the edge. He guided his feet.

It paints Smeagol in an entirely different light.

I think that all of the Matrix is really just one metropolitan area and the surrounding suburbs leading to some wilderness around the edge, likely some coastline as well, and that it is really much smaller than it appears and smaller than anyone inside it thinks that it is.

For one, almost all of the storyline seems to take place in this one, random city.  It is never clarified which city they need to go to, where they need to jump in, it's always the same one.  This makes little sense if the programs and the agents have the whole world at their disposal.  Why would they always stay in the same place?

Then, there are small lines certain people say.  Trinity says that they're always supposed to avoid the freeway.  It could be just blanket referring to a freeway in general, but it seemed to me that she meant that specific one.  Then, even more telling, is when Link tells Neo, ""You're all the way up in the mountains.""  This is the starting point of my theory right here.  Two points: one, the Merovingian literally could have sent him anywhere.  If the world was a recreation of Earth, why not send him to the Himalayas, get him further out of the way?  And why didn't Link have to specify which mountains.  Yes, if I live in Boston, and I say I'm going to the mountains, you probably don't need me to specify which ones, but in the Matrix, they could have been literally any mountain chain anywhere.  The only way it makes sense is if there is only one mountainous region in the Matrix, and it's at the edge of the program, the farthest away the Merovingian could have sent Neo.

Why is the Matrix so small?  Because it's built for people, specifically, the last people of a devastating war.  If only ten million people survived, then the robots would only have built a region for those ten million.  No point in creating the rest of the world if there's no one to populate it.  The whole populace is kept under the impression that there is a world outside their tiny city and surrounding land via imports and news reports and the like, but a small piece of programming keeps them from ever actually travelling outside of it to see what's there.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_19pju6,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/19pju6/the_matrix_is_a_small_closed_system/,

1369925441.0,522,self.FanTheories,1fc7hw,"Everything in Iron Man 3 actually makes perfect sense. Tony Stark's actions, Mandarin's idiocy, Jarvis's strategy, Pepper's turnaround, all of it.",696,174,182,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1fc7hw/everything_in_iron_man_3_actually_makes_perfect/,"There are five main points I'd like to address, based on the biggest complaints I saw after people watched the movie - Tony's treatment of Pepper in the beginning, his decision to use only the defective Mk. 42, Jarvis's use of melee combat rather than ranged, the ""gotcha"" of Mandarin being a character actor, and the last-minute hail mary with Pepper, respectively. I apologize for the wall of text.

* Tony Stark hadn't slept for 3 days prior to the beginning, was explicitly described as experiencing paranoia and anxiety, and was growing obsessed with his newest ideas for how to protect Pepper and himself. He then receives that Pepper is in the arms of another man. Given this, his behavior - however erratic - is admirably controlled. He had lost track of time while testing the remote operation of the Mk. 42 (which he no doubt developed so that he could keep himself out of harm's way for Pepper's sake) and wasn't expecting Pepper to walk through the front door feeling frisky - he panicked and hoped he could pretend to walk downstairs, ""de-suit,"" and walk back up after helping Pepper settle in.

* Very *very* strangely, no one sees the suit fly away after the mansion is destroyed. Given that, his ""non-suit"" actions aren't only about proving he doesn't need it, but they also make sense from a tactical perspective. Stark is assumed dead after the mansion is destroyed and he doesn't want to alert the enemy to the fact that he's still alive (especially not via the media buzzing over an iron man suit emerging from the mansion's basement) - that would put Pepper in danger (we later find out this was for naught, but it still made sense). Even in the case of assaulting the home of the Mandarin, it makes far more sense to be comparatively stealthy (we've established the suit isn't exactly subtle) because the Mandarin might have an escape route that Tony doesn't know about.

* Unfortunately, we know from Tony's quick capture that he was indeed detected - giving the Mandarin time to get in character. He presents himself to Tony as a drug-addled idiot, because he doesn't want to alert the world to the presence of the Ten Rings. The Ten Rings are ""owned"" by Killian in the sense that he provides them with enough supplies to keep the entire Middle East under control, making their role similar to that of a cartel. (Consider - how could Killian ""own both sides of the war on terror"" *without* controlling the Middle East?) I'm not saying with certainty that this is the case, only that an apparent idiot pretending to be a mastermind could just as easily be a mastermind pretending to be an idiot. In any case, it would be very unusual for the Mandarin to use - by coincidence - they same symbols that were also in use by a band of Middle East warlords (who could presumably deny involvement in the explosions - I mean, real-world groups denied involvement in Boston) *and also* have sleeper agents in the very areas that the Iron Patriot is raiding.

* In the final battle, Jarvis is aware that a single bullet could kill Stark - and because the extremis soldiers are just that, soldiers, they could easily find cover and get an angle on Stark. Engaging at range wouldn't only be futile (they could simply regenerate if hit), it would be dangerous - encouraging the soldiers to find cover, making it harder to distract them from their main goal of killing Stark. On the other hand, engaging in melee combat encourages them to abandon their firearms, stay in place out in the open, and fully concentrate on fighting the suits, because hey, if they can be destroyed, why not just kill Stark after destroying them?

* Finally, why was Pepper so apt at fighting in the final scene? Because Extremis doesn't only grant healing factor and human torchiness, it improves on the brain itself, as seen in Killian's projection to Pepper. She's able to do what she does because at this point *she's that good*, thanks to Extremis. Why don't her clothes melt? Because Killian has developed clothing to tolerate the heat of Extremis at this point, as he doesn't want to give his enemies a free show (pecs and dragon tattoos aside) while he's fighting them. Why is Killian dead? Maybe he's not, and he just wanted to avoid fighting another Extremis subject because he's not sure if he'd win; ditto with the rest of the Extremis soldiers. Once Pepper is looking after Stark, Stark really doesn't need the rest of his suits anymore (which are really just copies in any case; the originals weren't battery-powered) because Extremis-on-Extremis combat would probably be suicide. Even Killian himself only evacuates when a subject is ""misfiring"" because he doesn't know how to kill them and isn't sure he'd survive the attempt.

*I threw a wish in the well,*

*Don't ask me, I'll never tell*

*I looked to you as it fell,*

*And now you're in my way*

It starts off with the prostitutes introduction to her pimps. The wish in the well is a reference to her wanting to get enough money from prostitution so she can live a happy life. The second line is about how she will keep what she has done with her clients a confidential. The third line is about how the pimp is starting to get into rough times due to the prostitute not doing so well. The last line is about how the pimp is in her way of achieving her dream.

*I'd trade my soul for a wish,*

*Pennies and dimes for a kiss*

*I wasn't looking for this,*

*But now you're in my way*

Soul for a wish? Yeah, she will sell herself to achieve her dreams. Pennies and dimes for a kiss? You know exactly what that means. She sells kisses as a cheaper thing. She wasn't looking for this because she fell into hard times.

*Your stare was holdin',* 

*Ripped jeans, skin was showin'*

*Hot night, wind was blowin'*

*Where you think you're going, baby?*

Now we go to her and a client. The man is staring at her because of her hot fit of ripped jeans and her provocative outfit showing her skin. The night is hot and the wind is blowing on the corner. She then questions the guy on where he is going and tries to reel him in.

*Hey, I just met you,* 

*And this is crazy,* 

*But here's my number,* 

*So call me, maybe?*

She just met her client and the thought of prostitution is crazy. She gives him her call number so he can maybe call her for a fun night.

*It's hard to look right,*
 
*At you baby,* 

*But here's my number,* 

*So call me, maybe?*

The lady of the night has troubles looking at the man because she will possibly have sex with him in the future and is trying to picture it.

*And all the other boys,* 

*Try to chase me,*

*But here's my number,* 

*So call me, maybe?*

The other clients chase her because she is attractive. Then the generic lyric plays afterwards.

*You took your time with the call,*

*I took no time with the fall*

*You gave me nothing at all,* 

*But still, you're in my way*

The man was hesitant to call the prostitute, but when it happened the harlot was ready to fall onto the bed to engage in casual reproduction.

*I beg, and borrow and steal* 

*Have foresight and it's real*

*I didn't know I would feel it,* 

*But it's in my way*

This section is about how she is poor and has to beg and steal to get things other than prostitution and how it brings her down.

*Before you came into my life* 

*I missed you so bad I missed you so bad* 

*I missed you so, so bad*

*Before you came into my life*

*I missed you so bad*

*And you should know that*

*I missed you so, so bad*

This took me the longest to figure out, but I'm going with that this is her highest paying customer, which is something she has waited for for a long time and will bring her out of her slum life.

He is the quintessential old hippie, supposedly irrelevant in the time of Desert Storm.  But in this story, he's anything but irrelevant.

Correspondingly, Walter represents the right-wing, angry jingoistic conservatism of the GHW Bush era.  Donnie represents the political center, always being shouted down and ignored by the extremes.

Yet, they are all attacked by nihilists, who believe in nothing.  Nihilism is the enemy of all of their ethics.  ""Say what you will about the tenets of national socialism, at least it's an ethos.""  The bowling alley represents unity, a place where everyone is judged on equal footing (even a pedophile like Jesus Quintana).  It's no coincidence that the nihilists attack Dude/Donnie/Walter there.  

See, by the Coens' estimation, the political center in America are gutless, just along for the ride with the left and right, and in the face of people who believe in nothing, the middle drops dead, because being confronted by nihilism forces your own beliefs to the fore.  When Donnie gets attacked, he panics, because he truly has nothing to fight back with.

Furthermore, when Walter - the right - scatters the ashes of Donnie - the political center, they cover the face of the Dude - the left.  The right was more vocal both in denouncing the middle and in mourning it, while shitting all over the people who actually tried to do something about the fucked up world.

And in the story, everyone wants something from the Dude.  Just like everyone wants to be associated with the great figures of the 60s, because of their legendary status as rebels and patriots.

Meanwhile, the Dude is shown having little to no attachment to his own principles.  He has a poster of Nixon bowling in his apartment.  He steals phrases from everyone he encounters (GHW Bush saying ""this aggression will not stand"", for example).  He undermines his own legitimacy by identifying himself with drugs and desperation, caring more about saving the Creedence than his car or the money in the trunk.  The decade of the 1960s was full of frauds and charlatans.  Everyone who protested wasn't MLK Jr.

And Walter is willing to literally offer up his dirty laundry in order to steal money from the capitalist system.  Hello?

The landlord with the dance cycle wants the Dude to ""give him notes"" - to review his dance routine.  Why would anyone want the Dude to review anything of theirs?  Why would Mr. Lebowski want the Dude to save his trophy wife, if he didn't think his own natural approach was a failure?  Why does Maude want the Dude's baby?  Why does Jackie Treehorn not just have the Dude shot?

Because everyone wants a piece of the 1960s.  Everyone wants to be the successor to that ideology, because it was the last legitimate decade of American citizenship and civil disobedience.  But the only real successor to the Dude in the film is Sam Elliott's character, the Stranger, who takes comfort in the Dude's abiding, ""takin' er' easy for all us sinners.""  Everyone else is trying to take from him.  The Stranger gets it. 

EDIT 1: Adding some more thoughts from the comments----------

Maude represents the frivolous state of the arts in the USA and how they crave legitimacy by association with the last people to do anything that actually affected American culture. The fact that she is aware of the nihilists, is descended from capitalism, but wants to breed with liberalism shows that she has nothing on her mind but opportunism and a need to be accepted. Her and Bunny are two sides of the same coin.

Bunny represents the corruption of the American dream by greed and self-absorption. She has rejected all ideologies other than self-interest.

Oh, she cares.  She's counting on it.

The universe of Dr. Horrible is filled with super villains (and presumably more super heroes than just Cpt. Hammer).  I believe that Penny is one of the secret masterminds behind the Evil League of Evil, and she has been working for months on a plot to turn Bill into a truly merciless, cold-hearted terror.  I also don't believe that she's really dead at the end of the sing-along.  What is my evidence, you ask?  Why, it's almost entirely circumstantial!  But who cares, it's a fan theory.

First up: There are too many coincidences.  Penny *happens* to run into Billy at the *exact moment* he's about to steal wonderflonium? (Remember kids: never bounce wonderflonium.)  She *happens* to stand *exactly* in the path of the rampaging van?  She invites her boyfriend to meet her *at the laundromat*?  She *happens* to be *the only person* to get hurt by the exploding deathray?  Shenanigans, I say!  Shenanigans!

Next up: Penny's random knowledge base.  Remember: Dr. Horrible does a video blog on a regular basis.  He does not wear a mask.  He is one of Cpt. Hammer's primary antagonists.  There is *no way* that Penny hasn't seen Dr. Horrible's face before.  She's observant enough to recognize Billy as The Guy from the Laundromat, but *not* That Guy who Tried to Freeze Everyone at the Statue Unveiling the Other Day?  I don't buy it.  Especially when Penny has shown that she at least knows who Bad Horse is (and is pretty quick about letting it slide when Billy lists Bad Horse as an idol).  Penny knows who he is, and she keeps quiet about that recognition because she's trying to twist the Doctor's mind until he snaps, and will finally be ready for the big-time.

Penny's priorities:  Penny seems to desperately want to change the world for the better.  Just like Dr. Horrible himself.  Her sweet song to Billy in the Laundromat is full of metaphors, right?  ""Every drop of rain keeps water flowing to things growing in the ground.""  She means that hardship helps to make us grow into our potential.  When bad things happen to us, it turns us into what we were meant to be.  Just like when Dr. Horrible saw the girl he loved ""die"" in his arms, pushing him to become cold and closed off, and make ""the nightmare real.""

Penny's last words: ""It's okay.  Captain Hammer will save us.""  Humbug.  Look at her body language and lyrics before this moment.  She *clearly* doesn't really believe in the Captain.  ""I guess he's pretty ok.""  And she's literally *just* seen the Captain try to murder someone, and it was *his* actions that resulted in her getting impaled with ray-gun pieces.  Her dying words make no sense.  ...Unless they were carefully crafted to make Billy crack.  The last words that, more than *any other words*, would drive him over the edge.  I'm not sure if Penny is *part* of the Evil League of Evil, or if she is an outside agent and just wants to make sure that Dr. Horrible gets *into* the ELE (and is truly ready for it), but I am convinced that she wanted things to happen exactly as they happened.

Meta-evidence:  Eventually, there is supposed to be a Dr. Horrible 2.  Now, I know that that doesn't really *mean* anything, but it may be minor evidence that Penny is still alive.  Penny was the center of Billy's world.  When he planned for global domination, she was still on his mind (""Penny will see the Evil Me, not a joke, not a dork, not a failure..."").  When he was about to kill for the first time, he thought of her (""No sign of Penny... good. I would give anything not to have her see"").  What would he be without her influence?  What possible motivator in his life would be strong enough to fuel the plot of a new musical?  Penny being alive would give him *exactly* the type of conflict needed  to fill another hour or so.

Tl;dr: Penny worked to manipulate Dr. Horrible, sculpting him into the perfect super villain, then faked her death as the coup de grace.

He is a philosopher.,665,162,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1cefwr/the_joker_is_not_a_psychopath_he_is_a_philosopher/,"“All fear the man who has nothing left to lose.” What about the man who values nothing at all?

In his long career, The Joker has shown his remarkable intelligence and the patience by planting bombs in hospitals, poisoning water supplies, taking over of Arkham Asylum, and countless other elaborate “performances”, all of which must have required days, if not weeks, of planning and preparing. This tells us that he’s not random, nor is he impulsive. **He is in control of his actions.**

In the Nolan movies, Bruce Wayne admitted that people need theatrics to inspire them, or to get them to change their beliefs. Joker is doing just that. 

We have all spent some times thinking about the meaning of life and our purpose in the world. **We are the embodiments of our beliefs.** The Joker is an absolute nihilist. He came to the logical conclusion that there is no point to anything, that morals and rules meaning nothing. That life is a big joke.

**The Joker is not a psychopath. He is a philosopher**. This theory makes him much, much scarier. He’s not a mental accident, he’s a normal person like you or me. He chooses to be what he is, the embodiment of his beliefs. He’s trying to show up what *we* are doing wrong. His actions are physically propagations of his twisted message. (EDIT: ""A Preacher might be a better term for this, but I can't edit the title"")

He’s just trying to educate us, to show us *his* truth. Like Allen Moore said “[The difference between a man and a monster is one bad day.]”

[Does this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa0R_2K9iec) sound like the ranting of an impulsive, unpredictable nut job that cannot control his actions? Even when he appears to be impulsive, I believe that that is part of “the show”. He will do something “crazy” become he has become his beliefs.

*“…it’s about sending a message.”*

We’re looking at a prophet spreading a poisonous philosophy, a self-employed actor who is always in character, and like Batman someone who is so dedicated to their beliefs that their persona consumes them. Being deranged to The Joker is like being brave to Batman; it’s what they choose.

Wanna hear something *really* funny? Batman has every reason to be just like the Joker. He’s just not getting the message…so the Joker keeps trying...

Wait, wait, I got another one! Mr. J was just like us once. We have the suits and ties, the paychecks and the degrees, and follow the rules. Maybe we’re the ones who are crazy.

Now, what does this mean for mankind? Well, it means that once we're all dead, or gone...the toys inherit the Earth.

If you watch the show with this in mind, you spot reasons it is true all over the place, but here's a few.

* The Hills were told that they would never get pregnant

* Obvious physical likeness to Bill and dissimilarity to Hank

* Bill's recurring crush on Peggy

* Peggy admits under duress that she slept with Hank and one other man (the story that follows I think is a lie)

* Bill passes on the Dauterive family recipe to Bobby to keep the family tradition alive (Redcorn does something similar with sending Dale's/his son on a spirit quest)

* Lots of father-son type bonding between the two

Here is the plot synopsis from Columbia Pictures:

*One thousand years after cataclysmic events forced humanity's escape from Earth, Nova Prime has become mankind's new home. Legendary General Cypher Raige returns from an extended tour of duty to his estranged family, ready to be a father to his 13-year-old son, Kitai. When an asteroid storm damages Cypher and Kitai's craft, they crash-land on a now unfamiliar and dangerous Earth. As his father lies dying in the cockpit, Kitai must trek across the hostile terrain to recover their rescue beacon. His whole life, Kitai has wanted nothing more than to be a soldier like his father. Today, he gets his chance.*

After Earth was actually Will Smith's idea from the very start, and he hired M. Night Shyamalan as the director and Gary Whitta as the writer to help realize his vision. The finished script was actually worked on by Shyamalan as well, but the point is that Will came up with the concept and was likely involved in many parts of the production.

**But Will Smith isn't a Scientologist.**

Yes, he is.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Village_Leadership_Academy

This is the private elementary school that Will and his wife Jada founded in southern California, which their children Jaden and Willow both attended. (So does Suri Cruise.)

Now, here's the kicker: one of L. Ron Hubbard's most clever achievements was the development of something called ""Study Tech"", which is administered by a Scientology front organization called Applied Scholastics.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_Tech

Study Tech teaches that students are only unable to learn because of three barriers: absence of mass, too steep a gradient, and the misunderstood word.

* ""Absence of mass"" refers to the need for physical examples or models, which is most often found in the use of modeling clay.

* ""Too steep a gradient"" refers to the repetitive, step-by-step structure of lessons from which you cannot deviate under any circumstance.

* ""The misunderstood word"" refers to the Dianetics/Scientology belief that the moment you get to an unfamiliar word in a passage, you are to look it up immediately and start the passage all over again.

I cannot stress enough how damning this is to the question of whether or not Will Smith and his family are Scientologists. Why? Because the only schools that use Study Tech are private Scientology schools. Anyone can purchase and use Study Tech, but the only people that bother to use it are Scientologists because it doesn't actually work. Study Tech focuses on LRH as the ultimate authority on learning and, in turn, students slowly get indoctrinated to Scientology.

The Smiths also donated $20,000 to the Hollywood Education and Literacy Program, which is a Scientology home-schooling organization administered by Applied Scholastics.

And that was just part of their $122,500 donation to the Church of Scientology in 2008. And in 2010, Smith donated $1,200,000 to the Academy.

**Okay, so he's a Scientologist. What does After Earth have to do with Scientology?**

In my opinion, everything.

The promotional material and trailers make it very clear that ""survival"" is not only a theme in the movie, but also a marketing buzzword. In the book Dianetics, as well as innumerable other works of Scientology literature, LRH emphasizes repeatedly and strongly that ""survive"" is the highest command of existence and that everything in life is subservient to this command.

In fact, the core of Scientology, the Eight Dynamics, revolve around the concept of survival, as seen in this information and video from the official Scientology website: http://www.scientology.org/what-is-scientology/basic-principles-of-scientology/eight-dynamics.html

The material/trailers also emphasize a few other concepts, such as:

* Abandoned Earth. In the now-infamous Xenu mythos, Earth is obliterated by atomic weapons detonated in active volcanoes, and billions upon billions of people die. The planet is abandoned, but eventually repopulated after the fall of Xenu's Galactic Confederacy at the hands of the Loyal Officers. In After Earth, Earth has been abandoned for a thousand years, and Cypher Raige and his son Kitai (that's Will Smith and his son Jaden) are the first humans to return since it was abandoned. Note that it does not specify when Earth was abandoned, and I have a feeling that might be a plot twist in the movie.

* Emotion control. In the trailer, Cypher says ""Fear is not real. It is a product of thoughts you create. Do not misunderstand me. Danger is very real. But fear is a choice. "" This is directly in line with the Dianetics belief that negative emotions are from traumatic experiences in our genetic memory, encoded on our cells in the form of ""engrams"". Exploring and clearing these engrams form the core of Dianetics therapy, called ""auditing"". In the process of auditing, you learn to control your emotions and take ""cause over life"", or direct influence over your problems. The infamous E-meter device measures your ""tone"", which is a numerical value on this scale: http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/FULL.HTM

* Parental influence. LRH very strongly believed that one can exist in another's internal universe, or ""valence"", and that one of the most commonly experienced valences is that of the father or mother. The trailer makes it abundantly clear that one of Kitai's challenges will be to gain his father's respect, or overcome his father's influence or something related to that, which is directly parallel to the concept of ""existing in another;s valence"", which is cited by LRH as a common source of unhappiness.

* Space planes. The shape of Cypher's and Kitai's ship, which is remarkably similar to an airplane, is no coincidence. LRH taught that, in the distant past, interstellar travel was accomplished in ships that looked exactly like DC-8 planes.

* An elite spacefaring superhuman paramilitary organization. This is the Ranger Corps in the movie, the Loyal Officers in the Xenu mythos, and the Sea Organization (or ""Sea Org"") in real life.

Stuff I found in the trailer: http://i.imgur.com/G9CQymF.png (Will Smith is wearing the uniform of the Ranger Corps, which bears more than a passing resemblance to... http://i.imgur.com/TDTUJGW.jpg (...the official Sea Org uniform.)

Remember that LRH frequently said DC-8's were used to transport Xenu's prisoners to Earth in his nuclear holocaust. South Park elaborated on this)

But to me, the killing blow is that, from what I understand, Kitai's goal in the movie is to reach this landmark on the surface of the Earth to get his ship's beacon:

**But why would he do this? Why make a ""Scientology movie""?**

Because LRH himself tried and failed.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolt_in_the_Stars

And because Scientologists literally believe that science fiction stories, what they call ""space opera"", are repressed memories of events that occurred millions of years ago.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_opera_in_Scientology

I'm not entirely certain of the Smith family's intentions, but I'm fairly confident that After Earth is a major motion picture made to exalt Scientology, its mythology, and its creator. Instead of Scientology's recent tactics of negatively attacking others, they are trying to positively bolster themselves.

**But I won't become a Scientologist because of a movie.**

Maybe not consciously, no. LRH was a greedy man, but he was not a stupid man. He understood that works of art can imprint concepts and sensibilities onto others, even if it's only in a subtle, indirect manner. That is why he attempted to make Revolt in the Stars into a movie, but ultimately failed. The next attempt was Battlefield Earth, and we all know how that went. But with someone as high-voltage as Will Smith, and with much larger financial resources, his dream of a big-budget Scientology movie might finally come true.


I know, right? I'll view the movie and update this accordingly if I find more interesting information. If anyone has any questions about Scientology or wants to discuss what this movie is trying to do after it's released, I'd welcome that. In my opinion, Basically, Scientology isn't some little church, it's the most powerful example in the modern world of a malicious, evil cult.

But most of the episodes have absolutely nothing to do with meeting their mother. So what is Ted trying to tell his kids?

He's telling them that he's going to marry Robin.

The very first episode revolves around meeting Robin and Ted has had an on-again, off-again relationship with her since. Several times it has been brought up that Ted and Robin have an understanding that if they're not married when they're older then they'll marry each other. We've also seen that Ted had a great deal of trouble coming to terms with his own parents seeing other people. So Ted is taking a very roundabout course in telling them in order to soften the blow.

We know Robin is going to marry Barney and Ted presumably will marry the mother of his kids, so why are they both single? There have been several theories on here that Barney is dead at the time that Ted is telling his kids this story. It's my theory that their mother is also dead, leaving Ted and Robin alone late in their lives.  This would also explain why their mother has never been a factor during the telling of this story.

Ted's whole story has been about how he has loved numerous women in his life and he's trying to tell his kids that while he truly loved their mother, he also loves Robin and has for a while.

Edit: This gives the title a double meaning since it would be how he met their biological mother and future stepmother.

Edit 2: **TL;DR**: Ted will marry Robin sometime in his 50's, after having kids with the ""mother"" in the title.

Now normally I just figured the whole parents rarely appearing thing was just to focus on the actions of the kids(akin to shows like Peanuts), but I realized that the lack of parents was show how the characters dealt with parental neglect.

First off as to where the parents are, they are most likely off to work(probably in a nearby city, judging by how they essentially worship the city in the episode where the Ed's build a city), but where they are is irrelevant.

As to how the characters cope, I have made a list.

Ed being not the brightest was completely oblivious to the fact that he was being neglected

Due to the combination of her parents never being around, and her brother being slow, Sarah started to act demanding and angered, to discipline her brother and keep some order in her life.

Because his mother was never around, Jimmy drifted to the closest thing to a strict female figure to fill the gap in his life. Thus he had his friendship with Sarah.

Due to the notes his parents left, plus them never being around, Double D probably felt that his actions caused his parents to never be around,and that they would love him more if he kept everything is perfect condition. Because of this, he developed Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.

Having his parents not being around made Eddy look up to his brother to the point of near-worship. However, his brother was actually an abusive asshole. Eddy fixed this by creating false memories about how amazing his brother was. Having his only role model being a fantasized version of someone who was abusive turned Eddy into an emotional wreck.

Deep down Kevin was actually felt terrible about his parents never being around. He didn't want the other kids to know though, so he became hardened, and took his anger out on the Ed's. He most likely really didn't hate them, they were just the easiest target in the cul-de-sac.

With parents never being around, Johnny desperately tried to make friends to fill the void in his life. Johnny wasn't very good at making friends though. So, he created Plank. Plank started out as a simple imaginary friend, but as his home-life got worse, Plank became the thing that Johnny's life revolved around.

When it comes to Naz and Rolf, I just don't know. They're isn't really any support from the show that could help me form any theories about them. If anyone has any ideas, let me know, because I'm at a loss. 

Note: There's probably a similar theory like this on the internet, maybe even on this sub.

The original song talking about how one man was inside of another man and how it was terrible but felt good, and then the musical wherein the Night Man sneaks into the boy's window and ""enters"" him, everybody calling it rape but Charlie insisting that he was entering his soul and becoming him. And then, of course, Charlie narrates at the end of the play that this story was autobiographical.

This combined with the powerful implications that Charlie was molested if not outright raped by his uncle leads one to believe that it is a metaphor for a blocked-out memory.

Two things, though. One, Charlie openly remembers these instances with his uncle, making constant thinly-veiled mentions of it. Two, he flat out shared his uncle's bedroom in the past, meaning there is no element of sneaking in to his house. So it would stand to reason that, despite his uncle's sexual misconduct, this character of the Night Man actually does not represent him.

Now recall way back in the first season, where everybody thought that Charlie had been molested by his gym teacher. Mac goes and does homework that leads him to believe that Charlie was unmolestable, that he was a psychopath as a child and not submissive enough to appeal to a molester. That's actually very much at odds with who he frequently appears to be that we have seen. He has on rare occasion snapped and he does have his illiteracy and subsequent lack of real world knowledge but, for a protagonist on this show, he is shockingly well-adjusted.

So let's assume for a moment that we can take Charlie's play at face value, that the Night Man is a demon who used to possess him and made him do evil and that he later overcame. Certainly it would explain how he matured into the relatively sweet person we see him as today.

I posit that the Night Man is, in fact, a suppressed aspect of Charlie's personality. As a child he struggled with these psychotic tendencies but as he grew he disassociated with them and built them into a separate personality, a supernatural being who sneaks into his soul and causes him to fall to the temptation of evil.

The Day Man is, in fact, Charlie as he views himself in the present. The musical makes this very apparent; Charlie was the Boy, being victimized by the whims of the Night Man, but then he defeated the Night Man and became the Day Man, who is a ""champion of the sun"" (representing good, obviously), ""master of karate"" (martial arts being a form of self-discipline) ""and friendship for everyone"" (this lyric having been written by Dennis but one that instantly resonated with Charlie, delightedly exclaiming ""that's it"").

In the same episode as his initial songs about the Night Man and Day Man, we see him writing a second song where, after having been rejected by The Gang's band, that an unexpanded-upon ""they"" took the Night Man away from him and he wants him back. This is him considering giving back in to being a violent psychopath because that felt good and without friends who care about him what reason does he have not to?


The Troll doesn't really factor into either interpretation of the events and was most likely written in to give Frank a part in the musical, given how close they are.

Anyway.

We've all heard the big criticism of Jurassic Park - that dinosaur DNA simply couldn't have been extracted from the bellies of mosquitoes entombed in amber for millions of years. This HowStuffWorks article (http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geology/dinosaur-cloning.htm) nicely sums up the problems with the science behind JP: First, that DNA would degrade beyond any usefulness after that amount of time; second, that the mosquito's own DNA could mix with the dinosaur DNA, and also that multiple types of DNA may be mixed together inside any given mosquito; and finally, the extremely small chances of finding a perfectly preserved mosquito containing the DNA of a single species of dinosaur. And given that Jurassic park is said to contain fifteen different species of dinosaurs (noted by Nedry and Dodgson at the restaurant scene in the beginning), the odds against their using fossilized mosquito-amber DNA are staggering.

So how, then, did they make the dinosaurs?

Short answer - they didn't. The idea of Jurassic Park containing ""dinosaurs"" is just a cover, a convenient lie that allows InGen to do huge amounts of genetic experimentation and also gives John Hammond the opportunity to make tremendous amounts of money. 

Let's look at the evidence, shall we? First off, you may know that since JP's release in 1993, scientists have uncovered numerous pieces of evidence that show the dinosaurs depicted in the film are inaccurate in one way or another - the Velociraptors are way too big, the T-Rex should have had feathers, Dilophosaurs probably didn't have neck fins, et cetera. But if the dino's were built from real DNA, then wouldn't they have been perfect representations of the dinosaurs as they were millions of years ago? It's almost as if the dinosaurs were artificial creations based on limited scientific knowledge, rather than actual clones. 

So if they're not real clones, what are they? To me, the dinosaurs are simply genetic experiments. They're laboratory creations cobbled together out of reptilian, amphibian, and avian DNA in order to represent not real dinosaurs as they were, but the idea of what we think they should be. They're big and green (or brown) and scary, have chomping teeth and terrifying roars. But they aren't dinosaurs. No dino ever existed that looked quite like a Jurassic Park velociraptor, or had the shaking frills (and venom-spitting ability) of a Jurassic Park dilophosaurus. This also explains the biggest problem the park's creators had - keeping the dinosaurs female. Dinosaurs didn't have the ability to change gender originally - that was something bestowed on the JP dinos by humans because of the way they ""fill in the gaps"" of the dino DNA with frog DNA. What Hammond and Co. don't admit is that there *is* no dino DNA in the first place. It's all an act. 

Now, you may also remember the speech that John Hammond gives Ellie Sattler while they eat ice cream and watch the park fall apart around them. He begins talking about his own origins as an entertainer, and brings up his first big creation, a flea circus:

&gt;Do you know the first attraction I ever built when I first came here from Scotland? It was a flea circus...Petticoat Lane. It was quite spectacular. Spared no expense. There was a miniature merry-go-round and a wee trapeze and a car-carousel... and a see-saw... They all moved, motorized of course, but people would say they could see the fleas. ""Oh, I can see the fleas, mummy, can't you see the fleas?"" Clown fleas and high-wire fleas and fleas on parade... But this place... I wanted to show them something they could see... and touch. Not just devoid of merit.

This speech is particularly important, because it shows Hammond's rationale behind building the park in the first place. Just like his flea circus, it's a deception. It uses something that isn't real to provide entertainment, and allows the audience to fill in the gaps. With the flea circus, imagination and childlike innocence was all that was needed, but with Jurassic Park, the deception is much grander - and as Hammond says, not entirely devoid of merit. However, it's still a lie - the dinosaurs aren't dinosaurs.

Hammond's tendency to lie and theatricize is also shown when the scientists visit the ""birthing lab"" in the beginning of the movie. This lab is nothing but an act as well, created to lend credibility to the lie that the dinosaurs are real. We know from the sequels that Jurassic Park's lab isn't where the majority of the dinosaurs are born - they're created at Site B, then transported to Isla Nublar later on. Even the mosquito-in-amber cane he carries around with him is a lie. If it had real DNA in it, he would have used it for research rather than decoration. The fact that he topped his cane with it shows that it's likely valueless - either a mosquito from the wrong era that he uses for appearances, or an out-and-out fake. Either way, it only furthers his deception.

Hammond simply wants to create a believable narrative - fossilized mosquitoes in amber, ancient DNA, and genetic recombinations - for visitors to hang on to so that he can show them his fabricated dinosaur creatures, take their money, and laugh all the way to the bank.

[Long-ish]",580,129,143,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1cw19y/why_the_hulk_is_always_angry_longish/,"So, in the Avengers, there was a question as to why Bruxe Banner could change into Hulk at will, and to answer it Joss Whedon basically said, ""doesn't matter. Watch Hulk punch a giant space whale."" That left me a little unsatisfied, so I began to think about it more. Here's what I came up with:

In ""The Incredible Hulk"", the movie that was supposed to be the Hulk prologue to the Avengers, Bruce Banner is entirely dependent on his heart rate. It's not dependent on the emotion ""angry"" because he can turn into Hulk if he's scared or even really aroused (side note: I'm pretty sure aroused Hulk would be 10x scarier than angry Hulk). What if Hulk isn't just a body modification, what if its a mind modification also, but the two are inversely proportional? Imagine a ""Hulking out"" graph. On one end is Bruce Banner, with genius level intelligence, but under average strength and durability. On the other end is The Hulk, who is incredibly strong, but basically a high functioning animal when it comes to mental capacity. The higher the heart rate, the stronger the Hulk (which we already know is true because Hulk gets stronger as he gets ""angrier""). So when Bruce says ""I'm always angry"" it's not Joss Whedons cop out, he is litterally always angry in the sense that he always the Hulk, just the Bruce Bannner version of Hulk. Bruce Banner is shown to be learning how to lower his heart rate at will through meditation. What if he finished his training, so he knows how to both lower and raise his heart rate at will? That would explain why he can all the sudden turn to Hulk at will. It would also explain why the fuck he was in India. Has no one ever thought that? Why did he choose India? He wants to stay calm and composed, so he decides to live in a country with a huge over population problem? Bullshit. But if he's continuing his studies in meditation, India would be th place to go. Well that's what I have on the matter. If you have any objections or things to add, I'd love to hear them.

TD;LR: Bruve Banner is always angry because he's always the Hulk.

Now recall the story of Wayne Enterprises throughout the movies. In Batman Begins, the company is healthy, strong, and it goes public right as Bruce returns. Within a pretty brief time, Bruce manages to buy back control of the family business through shell companies, silent partners, etc.

In The Dark Knight, the company is still solid, except that Mr. Edwards discovers money being funneled into Applied Sciences. Bruce is still firmly in control, but he still has a board of directors and the company is doing well But at the beginning of The Dark Knight Rises, Wayne Enterprises is bleeding like a sieve, apparently. Money is drying up left and right.

Alfred and Fox suggest it's because Bruce hasn't been around, but that doesn't make sense. The company should still be well-managed by its board, and if Bruce really was a problem for the company, the coup we saw in the film would have occurred years before.

Also, Bruce doesn't seem very surprised when he's told the company is losing money. He also doesn't much care about losing ""all"" of his money when Bane raids the stock market. He also doesn't bother trying to recover the stolen sums, even though it should be pretty easy to void transactions in the wake of a terrorist raid on the stock market. So what gives?

Bruce had been building Batman Incorporated for years. He didn't just quit Batmaning because he was bummed over Rachel. When he visits Gordon in the hospital, remember what he says: ""We won."" Bruce stopped fighting crime in Gotham because he defeated organized crime in the city. But he's the goddamn Batman. He doesn't just hang up the cape. Once Gotham was saved (or so he thought), he was setting up centers around the world, using the funds of Wayne Enterprises to do so.

He put money into fusion technology, but he must have known that it could be weaponized. Bruce deliberately sunk cash into a project which he knew in advance he could claim was a failure (because it was brand new science) as a cover for moving money into Batman Inc. ventures. When Bane robbed the stark market, it was just a handy cover to move a great deal of his personal assets into the same project.

Once Bane is down, Bruce moves on. He fakes his death so he can focus entirely on Batman Inc. He's recruited Blake to be a new Batman for Gotham if he's needed. He's also recruiting Catwoman. There's certainly an attraction, but how likely is it Bruce is giving up his entirely identity and the core of his personality to jetset with a retired burglar? No, Bruce is taking Selina Kyle to persuade her to adopt his ideology, a goal at which he has already had partial success, as demonstrated by staying in Gotham (despite being one of the few who could leave) and coming back to save Batman.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1630yu,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1630yu/tdkr_bruce_wayne_did_not_simply_neglect_wayne/,

To elaborate:

Seth is bisexual. This is initially revealed in the dick drawing sequence. In a flash back, Seth explains that when he was in Grade 4 (about 10 years old) he had an irresistible temptation to draw penises on everything. Logically, a 10 year old starting puberty isn't unheard of, and this is also when he would have started to develop his sexuality. However, as also explained in the flash back, his principle was a bible thumper who believed Seth was possessed. The extreme approach taken by the principle to ""cure"" Seth instilled him with the sense that his sexuality was inherently wrong. This indoctrination drives the central plot of the movie. 

How this all ties into the main plot is simple; Seth, due to indoctrination, believes he must be straight in order to be normal and ok. This manifests in his sex drive; he is desperate to have sex with a girl and prove his ""manliness"", directly equates his self worth with his ability to score, and brags non stop about his own sexual opinions. His world is hyper sexualized, but it's all an act; he acts ultra-heterosexual to make up for his true feelings. 

Somewhere between the main events of the film and the flash back, Seth meets Evan. Due to them both being social outcasts, they become fast friends. Seth starts to develop feelings for Evan, and as a result, becomes very attached to Evan. This drives most of their interactions; Seth talks down about Rebecca and Fogell because he subconsciously sees them as competition for Evan's attention. Past this, Seth is always a very needy friend, constantly ""holding [Evan] back"" because he wants to hang on to him. The main source of conflict between their characters is that Evan is moving to a different college, with Seth sees as a betrayal because he figured they would be together forever.

This conflict is ultimately resolved at the end, after the party, where he is able to confess to Evan how he feels without feeling bad or weird for saying it. With this confession, he has finally come to terms with his sexuality. In the final scene at the mall, Seth is able to recognize that while Evan is really important to him, they will ultimate have to go their separate ways. He has finally come to terms with this, and he is able to ""let go"" of his first genuine love, only casting one final glance back up the elevator as they move away.

I've had this idea for a while now, but haven't shared it with anyone except my brother, who pointed me in the direction of this sub.

In the episode ""The Cleveland-Loretta Quagmire"", Peter somehow manifests and crashes the Petercopter and the HindenPeter prompting Joe to ask 'How can you afford these things?""

This type of behavior is a repeating theme throughout much of Family Guy.  Peter and family always seem to have money trouble, yet Peter can splurge on ridiculous items often.

If you recall the episode from season 2, ""A Picture is Worth a 1,000 Bucks"", the story ends with Stewie becoming a model for Calvin Klein.  Stewie, being the ego maniac that he is, would not likely have quit that career so quickly, which prompts me to believe that he continued to model for Calvin Klein for some time, possibly throughout his entire life up to this point.

Peter, being the horrible person that he is, has terrible money skills and would most likely blow all of this money as it comes in, no matter how much was paid each time.  A great example of this is the episode where he finds out he's black and gets a $20,000 reparations check.  He instantly spends the money making PeeWee's playhouse, but somehow has the same amount of money to throw into the crowd at the end of the episode.  I don't believe that he would have had the time to sell off all the items from the playhouse to gain back all that money, which leads me to believe that he has another large source of income.

Peter receives large amounts of money regularly from Stewie's modeling career, which he then blows on crazy extravagant items.

1372798488.0,442,self.FanTheories,1hit13,The game in *Jumanji* is actually just an elaborate time machine that makes you pay for each use by completing the game. (x-post /r/movies),570,128,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1hit13/the_game_in_jumanji_is_actually_just_an_elaborate/,"I am lazy, so I was scrolling through Netflix the other day and came across Jumanji. Having not seen it for years, I decided that I could watch it while relaxing on the internet. By the end, I was horrified and confused and disturbed by the power of this game. Not because it can materialize infinite creatures, but because it is basically a time machine a la Primer.

Basic plot: Kids start playing Jumanji game in 1969. Sarah is bad, Alan is worse. 30-ish years later, Judy and Peter start playing. They are a little better, continue through the game. There's monsters and baddies, etc. Game ends. Then what? We are back in 1969. Alan and Sarah are young again, the entire world is exactly as they left it, with one exception: they still have all the knowledge that they acquire in the previous timeline (evidence by the fact that Alan attempts to find Judy and Peter).

This makes Jumanji, the game, a very powerful tool. Imagine being able to continue life over and over again, changing your course each time. All you have to do is start the game with a roll:

Player 1: First roll. Game start. Time-0 established.

Wait X years

Player 2: Throw dice. Game continues

Player 1 and 2: Finish game quickly. If you survive, return to time 0, with all the knowledge of the world acquired since time 0. We know that each new roll will supersede the previous roll, like when Judy rolls the dice to stop Alan from drowning in quicksand. Also, the track is very short, only 30 spaces. Since the average die roll on 2d6 is 7, you should finish in 4 or 5 moves, very easy to do with two people.

We know that things play out essentially the same way the next time through the timeline, because Peter and Judy almost have their parents killed in the same way. And we also know that things can be changed, because Alan's dad is still living in the second timeline. Thus, you are perfectly capable of making lots of money (think Biff in BttF:PII) and / or just trying out a different life.

That game is NUTS. Why did they throw it away?

Edit:  The words of the Jumanji game:

Jumanji:

A game for those who seek to find *a way to leave their world behind*.  You roll the dice to move your token.  Doubles get another turn.  The first to reach the end wins.

Adventurers Beware:
Do not begin unless you intend to finish.  *The exciting consequences of the game* will vanish only when a player has reached Jumanji and called out its name.

(italics mine)

To me, this shows that: 
a).  The game creates and alternate reality.
b).  Finishing the game collapses the alternate reality, returning the players to their state just before the game began.

tl;dr - Jumanji is OP, should not be thrown away.

It's probably the only cartoon I can think of where a main character's voice actor has noticeably gone through puberty on the show.
What if the writers of Adventure Time did this on purpose and tailored the structure of the early episodes to reflect this?
If you notice, many of the earlier episodes are pretty random and a lot more about fun zany silliness. That's not to say that they weren't good, but just that there didn't seem to be much direction for telling a coherent, larger story. However, as the characters have developed and grown, so has the show. Seemingly one-shot characters started to fit into a larger continuity. Previously overlooked details that once seemed to be used as gags started to be incorporated into cohesive story arcs.
The narrative structure of AT parallels Finn's coming of age. When Finn was a preteen, he thought like a preteen and most of the adventures were random silliness. As he grew older, the show began to reveal a larger continuity in regards to the post-apocalyptic subtext, Finn status as (possibly) the last human in Ooo, and the moral gray areas of several characters. As a boy grows into a man, he begins to realize the world isn't as happy-go-lucky as it seems. As we venture further and further into Season 5, a lot more is revealed about evil/moral ambiguity (Finn the Human/Jake the Dog), painful relationships (Simon and Marcie), and the dark origins of Ooo itself.
With Finn being the only prominently featured human, he is meant to be the most relatable character to the audience. As the show has been evolving, the audience have been growing up with Finn.

What lead to this was a series of events starting with corporate ability to minimize cost and still produce great amounts of high quality, cheap goods/services without a human workforce. This led to large lay-offs.

Massive unemployment then led to lower demand for goods and caused all markets to go out of balance. The government then stepped in and mandated that businesses of certain sized had to have a certain amount of workers that receive a living wage. Since these corporations honestly had no use for their human workers, they gave them low priority/responsibility jobs like pushing a button all day.

However, the gov't again realized this system was flawed due to lack of innovation and no fear of being laid off. [Notice how George's boss always threatens to fire him but never actually follows through. There must be mountains of paperwork invovled.]

In Iron Man 1, Tony Stark makes the life changing decision that he will no longer be a weapon maker.  This gets rendered pretty hollow by the fact that he then spends all subsequent movies obsessively building and perfecting the Iron Man suits, described as the greatest weapon ever invented.

Watching Iron Man 3 it occurred to me that the claim has more legs than I gave it credit for.  

By Iron Man 3, the suit has advanced far past the one seen in Iron Man 1.  The advances have focused on the speed at which the suit can be donned, it's mobility, situation specific builds, remote control, and Jarvis' ability to control multiple armors.  

What hasn't improved are the weapon systems.  Stark seems to be slinging the same basic repulsor throughout the series.  In Iron Man 2 he features a devastating 'one off' laser beam that seems to be abandoned in later versions, and in Avengers he lets loose with missiles.  

If the weapon systems of the armor improved at the same pace as its utility, I'd think that Stark would be able to just slaughter Killian's extremis thugs.  Remember in Iron Man 1 when he shoots those mini-projectiles at the hostage taking terrorists?  Imagine a system like that taken to the same extreme as the other improvements, combined with all the crazy ass repulsor tricks he could be building in. 

So I think that Tony Stark really did abandon his life as a weapon maker.  He's obsessed with improving the armor, but doesn't seem to have interest in even minor weapons upgrades.   He builds the shield, not the sword.

Re-watching Kill Bill Vol. 1, I noticed a lot of possible hints that point to a very close relationship (close to calling them best friends even) between O-Ren and The Bride.

Firstly, The Bride knows O-Ren's entire life story - the loss of her parents, how she killed Boss Matsumoto, how she became the top female assassin. Now one can assume that anyone in their type of business would know some of these facts about O-Ren's past, but she is the only assassin from both films whose background and current position is revealed extensively. The entire first movie is almost dedicated to her. The only other person on The Bride's list to receive as much development is Bill.

One of the biggest hints to their friendship was the scene after The Bride kills Gogo. ""Silly rabbit, trix are for kids."" This could be a simple play on words in reference to The Bride's real name, but it seemed that that little phrase held special meaning to them (e.g. an inside joke). Note, she did not share any witty banter with any of the other assassins. 

Not only that, but the overall tone of the fight with O-Ren was a lot less vicious or aggressive. Granted they were fighting with samurai swords, but even their facial expressions weren't as angry, but rather somber.
When they exchange words after The Bride lands her first blow, O-Ren pauses and goes on to apologize for ridiculing her earlier; not in the way Vernita Green ""apologized"" (begging for her life), but in a truly regretful and graceful manner. It should be noted that there was never any patronizing from The Bride, like there was with Vernita, or any aggressive ""bitchiness,"" like there was with Elle Driver. Both O-Ren and The Bride showed a mutual respect for one another.

Leading to the final hint: The Bride's reaction when she finally lands the killing blow to O-Ren's scalp. Not once did The Bride turn around to look at her triumphant victory. She is instead facing the opposite way panting as if she was trying to cope with what she had just done. There was even a moment where she seemingly starts to turn and face O-Ren's lifeless body, but she walks away instead. Why would a highly trained, cold-hearted assassin react in such a way?

TL;DR - Other than Bill's death, it seems that the only other death that truly affected the Bride was O-Ren Ishii's. That alongside many other clues lead me to believe that The Bride and O-Ren were very close, maybe even best friends during their years in The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad.

The idea of hate, greed, and bigotry are all distant memories. War still exists but only because the Romulans are a bunch of bastards. Everyone goes through life with an almost treacly desire to better themselves, humanity, and the Federation as a whole. 

Nobody is shown sitting around playing video games or drinking their lives away, by their teenage years, most of them know their way around what would be, to us, graduate level scientific theories and practices, and it seems like they've all got at least three hobbies, one of which should necessitate a lifetime of study to master. Seriously, when's the last time you met a published part-time archaeologist who is also a sea captain?

So, what's the deal? My personal theory takes us all the way back to the dawn of warp technology. With the sudden appearance of a post-scarcity civilization for everyone on Earth, a lot of people, particularly considering the horror of the last fifty years or so, have gone from living hand to mouth to having everything they could possibly desire *and* space aliens to boot. It would be like the whole planet won the lottery. Unfortunately, the story of people who win the lottery is usually a sad one.

Unprepared for this new reality, a sizeable chunk, even a majority of the population would likely succumb to a deep ennui. Without any threats to their physical well-being, they look inward and find themselves wanting. You might call some of them clinically depressed, but for the most part, it's just a gnawing feeling of ""what's the point, anymore?""

By the thousands or the millions, these lost souls just give up. Some significant portion goes so far as suicide, but mostly they just fall into their easy lives of luxury. Purposeless, they retreat from the rest of humanity. They stop befriending, stop loving, stop having children. They just opt out of life, ceding the world to the driven and the purposeful. In fairly short order, this massive opt out of the gene pool has a transformative effect on humanity. The tendencies to learn, explore, and build entirely for their own sakes go from being a periodic blessing on the artists, engineers, and scientists to being the new normal. Sure some people still look out on the vast ease of it all and wonder, “Why bother?” but we never meet them in the shows. They are humanity's weird older brother who didn’t move out of mom's basement and so rarely find themselves in a position to go toe to toe with the Dominion.

In many ways, they’re humanity’s dirty secret, millions or even billions of the saddest sacks there ever were, wasted away in a world which cannot threaten them and therefore isn’t much worth their time. They can’t even really dream of Heaven to relieve them because, really, what could possibly be better than the lives they already can’t be bothered with?

I feel as though the director put a lot of importance in this winter setting to set up the phase 2 movies. 

With all of the Avengers fighting at the same time, people always wonder why they aren't helping each other out. This is because they have their own problems to deal with.

In Thor: The Dark World, the trailer shows footage of Thor in England where it's snowing. If T:TDW is set in winter-time England, it would only make sense for it to occur at the same time as Iron Man 3, 6 months after the Avengers.

In Captain America: Winter Soldier, not much has been released as far as plot goes. What I can gather is that it is also set in winter-time around the same time as T:TDW and IM3.

This cannon ties into rumors about Captain America: Winter Soldier. According to this article, ( http://screenrant.com/avengers-2-war-machine-captain-america-2/ ), the war machine is set to appear in Captain America: Winter Soldier. With soldiers from Iron Man 3 in this movie, it helps make sense of the last scene in Iron Man 3. A big problem that people had with the film was that the suits didn't arrive until the last scene. Having all of the Iron Man suits helping out Captain America would  help make sense of this plot hole.

1367328897.0,429,self.FanTheories,1deqpf,Why does so much of Doctor Who take place in the present day of England?[X-Post with DoctorWho],585,156,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1deqpf/why_does_so_much_of_doctor_who_take_place_in_the/,"Any fan of Doctor Who knows that the Doctor really liked hanging out in the early 1960s when the show first came on, but now prefers hanging out in the year 2013 instead. Funny how that works, isn't it?

Why does the Doctor have a preferred hangout in a specific place that moves slowly forward in time? We know from the early episodes of Doctor Who that the Doctor and Susan had many adventures prior to An Unearthly Child, but that he and Susan stayed in 1963 for about six months before the beginning of the first episode.

The reason for this is that the the Doctor's wild adventuring ways were having too negative of an effect on a young impressionable Gallifreyan girl. Gallifreyan children, of course, grow up at the same rate as human children. Susan was rapidly growing up with only her grandfather as a parental figure, having lost her parents or contact with her parents under unclear circumstances. So the Doctor decided to pick somewhere to settle down and raise his granddaughter. The First Doctor, being a stodgy old-fashioned fellow, wanted a place and time for his granddaughter to grow up 'properly', without being exposed to too much vulgar sexuality or violence, while at the same time being a fun and interesting period that didn't oppress young girls either. So, he chose 1963 in England. A safe bet. Rock and Roll and the Beatles were around, but not too wild (yet), English society was relatively safe and the early 60s were interesting enough to keep a young, curious girl like Susan engaged. By the time the wildness of the late 60s and early 70s rolled around, Susan would be grown and she and the Doctor would be back to adventuring around the universe.

Of course, it didn't work like that. The Doctor lost Susan, and his best link back to her was the time and place where Susan briefly spent her adolescence with her grandfather, at her happiest and most content. So no matter where he traveled, he kept going back to England in the early 1960s, and kept finding young female companions to travel with, trying on some level to replace what he'd lost. But every time he returned to the 60s, the Doctor had to keep moving forward in time to avoid running into himself, and he'd occasionally overshoot his mark by a few weeks or months. Eventually, the 60s became the 70s, and so on. As the decades ticked by and centuries of personal time passed, links to Susan faded and so the Doctor began to adopt this period of Earth history as a replacement for his lost homeworld and family. His relationships with his companions finally began to evolve as well.

In between traveling to other places and times across the universe, the Doctor keeps on returning to the same place and continuous timeline because it provides him with a sense of familiarity and security. A place even the Doctor can call home, which started off long ago as a link to his lost granddaughter.

1365185356.0,427,self.FanTheories,1bqxe1,[Matrix] Neo's real world powers explained (aka Zion is really real),513,86,117,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1bqxe1/matrix_neos_real_world_powers_explained_aka_zion/,"I'm going tell about Neo's real world powers.

I think this question has bothered a lot of people and they can appreciate having a sensible explanation to consider. I do not think the Matrix within a Matrix theory is a sensible explanation- only convenient. 

I'm going to explain this by taking you backwards through the trilogy.

I can only recall two 'powers' that Neo possesses outside of the Matrix: 

* He fries the Sentinels

* He has sight after he's blinded. 

It's been a few years so maybe I'm overlooking something. Most people ask about the fried Sentinels. I'm going to talk about the sight first.

Bane blinds Neo in the third film. Neo is then able to *perceive* this red and amber representation of the world. It looks almost like heat vision but it doesn't pick up standard heat signatures. It is something radiating, though. We know it isn't as simple as heat because Neo cannot see Trinity. She's been impaled and she's lying beside him. He calls for her. He follows the sound of her voice fumbling around the debris before finding her body. They speak a few words and she tells him she's been impaled. Neo is surprised. He doesn't want to believe it. He feels around and discovers it's true. Moments before that he was her copilot helping her navigate the expansive fields of pods. 

Neo is directing Trinity to find the machine city. He surveys the fields of pods and a great machine metropolis in the distance before fixing his attention off in another direction. He points and says, ""There. Those treetops."" But they aren't treetops. They are power lines. Tremendous power lines. Trinity notices delicately correcting him. Neo 'sees' but I think it is more accurate to say he *senses* or perceives.

Near the end of the second film Neo and company are in their ship when the Sentinels group up outside of a particular range. One of them swirls around and hurls an object at the ship. Neo knows it's a bomb. These Sentinels are a good distance away. The crew quickly exit the ship fleeing on foot over uneven terrain. It's an impossible escape. Neo resolves, ""we aren't going to make it."" Trinity insists, ""we have to try."" She scales an obstacle and turns to see Neo stationary. He says, **""Something is different. I can *feel* them.""** We understand what he means. He doesn't feel them in a tactile way; he senses them. He turns extending his arm and the Sentinels gyrate wildly before dropping to the ground mere seconds before Neo collapses. He finds himself in limbo between the Source and the Matrix. He's jumped from his physical body that was not jacked in to the Matrix and landed in the train station that programs use to travel between machine city and the Matrix. Physically, though, he's lying in a med facility on a ship next to Bane.

During a conversation with the Oracle, she explains powers possessed by the One saying, ""they extend beyond this world."" 

&gt;NEO: Tell me how I separated my mind from my body without jacking in. Tell me how I stopped four sentinels by thinking it.

&gt;ORACLE: The power of the One extends beyond this world. It reaches from here all the way back to where it came from.

&gt;NEO: Where?

&gt;ORACLE: The Source. That's what you felt when you touched those Sentinels.  

It's now the end of the first film. There's a series of numbers on the screen as we've seen in the Matrix. The trace attempt halts and the screen flashes a warning - ""carrier anomaly detected"". Neo is talking into the phone saying, **""I know you're out there. *I can feel you now.*""** He's talking to the programs operating within the Matrix. He's broadcasting his message on a phone but he's talking directly to the machines. Quite a long way from conversations about rabbit holes, which brings us nearly back to the beginning.

Morpheus offers Neo two pills, he explains that the red pill is part of a tracer program designed to disrupt input/output **carrier signals**. When Neo ingests the pill, it causes his carrier signal to drop the Matrix feed. A little worker bee Sentinel rushes over to assess the situation. Neo removes the tube from his throat and stomach just before the worker grips him revealing an array of sensors and scanners. He's unplugged from the Matrix and flushed down the sewer slide. Once in the waste water, he's promptly picked up by Morpheus et al.

You might suspect how Neo seems to have powers outside of the Matrix. The very important clue is the **carrier signal**. Consider that the Sentinels are in constant contact with the machine city. Yet they have no wires. The command and control infrastructure of the machines is wireless. It's signals based. Hey, it's a frequency on a spectrum. But what frequency? What spectrum? Doesn't matter. What matters are these signals.

At this point, there's enough to explain that Neo interacts with the Sentinels over a carrier signal they use to communicate with machine city. We can further explain that when Neo is blinded, he's better able to sense or perceive the carrier signals emitted by the machines. That explains why he cannot see Trinity but he can see all of the machines. Additionally, he can see Smith in Bane's body. That's a bit different. The one common component there is the code. It's a small step explaining that a carrier signal is not the actual message. It just carries it through a medium. The message is modulated *input code*. The modulation of a signal **over the carrier signal** allows the receiving station to interpret specific information. Ergo Neo 'sees' the modulated code being communicated over the carrier signal. That modulated code shares a base element with the program imprinted upon Neo. So can anyone from the Matrix do this? No.

When the Oracle states so plainly that the One has powers beyond *this* world (the Matrix) she's revealing that the powers are linked to both the machines and the Source. Typically we think of the Source as the source *code*, which is partly right. It's the source of the carrier signal upon which the the machines modulate code. It's the broadcasting tower. The powers of the One extend to the Source because the power is the ability to modulate input code over the machines's carrier signal(s). In the Matrix this means flying and stopping bullets. 

Before things get too deep consider that we perceive radiation (heat) the same way Neo perceives these carrier signals. The reason no one else can sense the Sentinels *and* control them reaches further back than the movies. Only the Architect exposes any detail regarding the One's physical difference, on top of his cognitive difference.

The theory is complicated because it is assembled from highly subtle and nuanced clues given when the Architect explains to Neo why he is 'here'. Neo is born *genetically* unique. Never mind the function of the One for a moment. The genetic difference is subtle but in the environment that the machines have constructed for humans, this small difference has tremendous implications. Quite a leap of logic so let's build a bridge.

The evidence is presented almost entirely in the conversation between Neo and the Architect. My explanation of this is a separate comment indicated in the footnotes. There are numerous minor points scattered throughout the trilogy but we have plenty in the exchange. 

&gt;NEO: Why am I here?

&gt;ARCHITECT: Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly which, despite my sincerest efforts, I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision. While it remains a burden assiduously avoided it is not unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of control. Which has led you inexorably….here.

&gt;NEO: You haven’t answered my question.

&gt;ARCHITECT: Quite right. Interesting…that was quicker than the others.

Neo is a thumb drive. He's carrying the prime program and some other bits of code. The curious bit is that the Architect tells Neo he been altered by the process though he's still human. *Altered.* Has everyone been altered by the 'process'? What makes Neo different?

No matter. He hasn't answered the first question. To this the Architect explains that Neo is the sixth integral function. This is the metric the Architect uses to quantify instances of the Matrix. The emergence of a *unique* human born in the Matrix begins his count. The first was an anomaly. Unexpected. Neo, on the other hand, is a forgone conclusion up to the moment he chooses to save Trinity. What to make of these integrals and anomalies and remainders? It's rather simple, really. **Genetic mutation**. Unpredictable, uncontrollable, spontaneous mutations at the tiniest level of humanity require the Matrix to refactored with each definitive step of human evolution. It is minor, mind you. But it happens. You didn't think humans remained genetically static all those years, did you? This is what the Architect cannot account for and concordantly why he *needs* the One to return to the Source with his **'code'**, as well as the prime program. The One, as a function in the Matrix, is a construct of the Architect and the Oracle's making. The person who expresses this genetic mutation allowing the prime program to be imprinted upon his cortex is fed the prophecy as a way of channeling him to the Source. It's easy enough to spot from the outside looking in, I imagine.

Neo processes information much more efficiently than others. Think of people who pick up languages like a sponge. The Architect admits as much remarking how quickly Neo realized his question was not answered. You could say more *quickly* but that's only partly correct. *Directly* is better. The fact is Neo is more sensitive to *signals*. In his body that means signals traveling up and down his spine. But the machines hacked right in to Neo's body and started pumping code into his cortex. Neo's body assimilated the Matrix. It imprinted upon Neo because Neo is different. We certainly know is that Neo is different as a human and as the One. Everyone says so at some point in some way. 

So Neo is *telepathic* because of a genetic trait? **No**. Neo simply has a uniquely sensitive, direct nervous system. It sends and receives signals in a very special way. Recall Dozer &lt;Tank&gt; feeding him all those capabilities - ""He's a machine."" Trinity bewildered in the first film - ""How'd you do that? You move like they do."" Recall Neo fighting Smith at the end of the original when he's moving in such a way that Smith appears in slow motion comparatively. See? Neo's signals abilities are incredible. &lt;Mouse- ""Morpheus is fighting Neo! Look at that, his neurokinetics are way above normal!"" /u/LoganPhyve&gt; It just so happens that Sentinels have incredibly sensitive radios integrated into them. These radios can pick up a signal broadcast from the Earth's surface by machine city even when they are miles beneath the surface near the Earth's core, where it is warm.

Neo is becoming aware of this sensitivity he has for signals by the end of the first film. He *feels* the programs. Then he *feels* the Sentinels. When he dies, he's discovered that losing his sight reduced the noise pollution in his nervous system (no more visual noise) and that freed him up to better register the carrier signal of the machines. Turns out his very sensitive nervous system was overwhelmed by so much sensation. Eliminating a sense made it easier to recognize how he was different. So the ending... The Architect and Oracle settle for 99.9% allowing the genetically unique and refusers to voluntarily be freed.

*My take on the Matrix within a Matrix theory:* 

It's the technical equivalent to ""it was all in his head."" You might as well say that Neo never really woke up in front of his computer when Morpheus messaged him. Further, why the *hell* did we see a conversation between the Oracle and the Architect at the end of the Trilogy, where the Architect says people will be allowed to leave the Matrix, if the truth is that Zion is a Matrix within a Matrix? Only the audience is witness to this conversation.

Neither movie is something everyone has seen, so let me explain.

Game of Shadows:  1891.  Moriarty assassinates and invests, building a huge empire of everything war-related from bandages to bullets.  He is developing new weapons at his factories.  He uses a mad bomber scheme in England to cover his tracks.  Then he tries to start World War I by having an assassin (who has had his face replaced to look like an ambassador), murder the prime minister of Germany at a peace conference.  It fails, but Moriarty explains that World War I is coming and he can wait a few years for it.  Holmes reveals that he's taken all of Moriarty's fortune.  The two go over the Reichenbach Falls and presumably die.  Holmes is revealed to be alive.

LXG: 1899.  A mad bomber named the Fantom is terrorizing England.  ""M"" recruits supernatural and science fiction literary characters to stop the Fantom from blowing up a peace conference.  They succeed, but ""M"" reveals that war is coming and now he has samples of these character to create super soldiers/technology.  Fantom is revealed to have been ""M"" the whole time.  When they track him down, ""M"" is revealed to have been Moriarty, to which Moriarty replies: ""James Moriarty, the so-called Napoleon of crime? That man died at Reichenbach Falls. He died, and I was reborn.""  Then Tom Sawyer kills Moriarty.

So I don't think it takes a lot to see that LXG can be considered a direct sequel to GoS.  Even trite things like a different actor for Moriarty can be explained with the false face technique and the dialog seems to support this.  The timing works out.  Moriarty's plot is very similar, but in LXG he has lost his fortune and is relying on developing new superweapons instead of controlling the supply of current weapons.  Moriarty is still holding out to the idea that World War I is about to break out and he wants to make money by supplying the countries.  He'll keep trying to start the war, but he's content to wait if he has to.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1gz17n,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1gz17n/sherlock_holmes_a_game_of_shadows_is_a_direct/,

Remember this ...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el0x9-1j7lo

Admittedly, Eminem storming out makes him look homophobic.

But...

It later came out (no pun intended) that Eminem was in on the prank. Think about the homophobes you've met. Think about how many would let a man drop from the ceiling and put bare ass cheeks in their face for the sake of a joke. None. Ergo Eminem is not a homophobe.

But we already knew that. We'd just forgotten.

Remember this?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY2p7oE7Bpw

Yeah, what homophobe would take the stage with Elton John? It's not like this was arranged and the end of the relationship. The two are close friends. Eminem recently said Elton calls him once a week. Em says when he decided to finally get clean he called Elton first for help. Tight friends. Homophobes aren't tight friends with homosexual icons.

After all, this: http://www.showbizspy.com/article/225724/eminem-is-a-little-bit-kinky-rocker-elton-john-says-eminem-gave-him-a-cock-ring-as-wedding-present.html

But I guess just because he goes along with gay pranks and has gay friends doesn't mean he necessarily believes in equality. Except for when he said he supports gay marriage.

Of course, he didn't phrase it like that. He phrased it like Eminem. If I remember right, he says, ""I think everyone should be allowed to be equally miserable.""

I bet the amount of rappers from 8 Mile with a progressive attitude like that (even hidden under miles of sarcasm) is pretty ... slim (pun intended). It's almost like he knows something about what that particular brand of oppression is about.

Eminem's arc is also weird. He got famous but then disappeared. He vanished into a drug addicted haze. But most musicians do their drugs on the road. Slim vanished into his mansion, barely seen for years, abusing Ambien, erasing huge chunks of his memory. It's almost like he felt that people on the road . . . the people in his life . . .couldn't accept him. But they accepted him as a gangster, a white boy, and a rapper. So what were they rejecting?

Now at this point, all you can really say is that he is decidedly progressive on the issue of homosexuality, no matter how you view his method of expressing that. The drug addiction hints at some deep secret. No telling what. Maybe he just struggles with fame. But buried in his music, I find little hints that there's another side of Eminem. Maybe one that even he rejects.

First, even the Inception like nature of his personalities suggests something off. Ok so Marshall Mathers is the real person, and his stage persona is Eminem. That's fine, everyone has a rap name. But then there's another personality, Slim Shady. That personality is prominent in the song ""My Name Is . . . "" introducing to the world that this persona's name is not Eminem as it says on the record, but instead, Slim Shady.

Slim Shady has this to say...
""Well, since age 12, I've felt like I'm someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt.""

So he hits puberty, can't stomach the real him, and kills him off?

Hmmmmmmm...

The lyric continues ...
""Got pissed off, ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
and smacked her so hard
knocked her clothes backwards like Kriss Kross""

Again, hits puberty, takes the hetero sex symbol of the day, rips off a symbol of her womanhood and hits her with it. That sounds like he's frustrated with his sexuality to me.

But maybe I'm just looking too far into that one.

The next exhibit is the thematic element of Eminem's hatred for his wife. It really seems to go much deeper than ex-wife drama. He talks about her like his biggest mistake in life. Curious.

I'm going to wrap it up with the crown jewel of my argument. ""The Real Slim Shady"" which I believe to be mostly about Eminem veiling his sexuality. 

Lets just look at this chunk of the first verse.

""Feminist women love Eminem""

Let's be real, we both know feminist women love gays. (EDIT: I'm making a joke here, but people aren't getting it.  This line is not really a staple of my analysis)

""Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin around grabbin his you-know-what
Flippin the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though!""

Women are sick of Slim Shady. They love Eminem. They don't like the fake version of him. They like ""the real Slim Shady.""

""Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's goin on in your parents' bedrooms""

He's saying sure, maybe he is different, but it's no worse than your parents sex lives. Sure seems like he's comparing his sexual desires to theirs. Like people shame his, but there's really nothing wrong with it.

""Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose""

He wants to get on tv and admit his sexual desires, but social taboos prevent it. This disgusts him, because while he can't say that he wants to have sex with men, Tom Green can hump animal carcasses.

""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel don't they?
""We ain't nothing but mammals.."" Well, some of us cannibals
who cut other people open like cantaloupes [SLURP]""

This bit seems to be about kids not knowing themselves sexually. Like maybe he was told he just didn't understand sex yet, but he felt he understood it just fine, if differently.

""But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope""

Just look at this line. This is the genesis of much of my theory. This line states as plainly as possible that he just doesn't get why it's not ok for men to marry in light of all of the other sexual differences we tolerate. I contend he throws the ""Eww"" sound effect in there to disguise it, but I think it's honest.


""[*EWWW!*] But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes""

Under the traitional analysis of this song, you would assume the antidote to men eloping with other men is . . . women waving their pantyhose and singing the chorus about being your real self?

No . . . he's saying the antidote to homophobia is letting lose and acknowledging the real self. He's the real Slim Shady. The Slim Shady that doesn't get what's wrong with two men marrying. That's the real Slim Shady. All the other Slim Shady's are just imitating.

The song concludes with . . . 

""Ha ha
Guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up ""

Stand up . . . for gay rights. (EDIT: Again, this is mostly sarcasm)

In conclusion, I think each one of these arguments independently would be a weak case for having insight into someone's gender. But together, they make quite a coincidence.

My first thoughts were sparked by a Calvin and Hobbes strip (sorry can't find a link).
Some time later while watching 'A New Hope' i noticed how many of the supposedly giant creatures  had insect-like qualities, hard exo-skeletons, joined bodies and simple often toothless jaws. noteably the [Sarlacc](http://images2.fanpop.com/images/photos/3600000/Sarlacc-star-wars-creatures-3636276-300-246.jpg), the [Rancor](http://listverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/rancor.jpg) and the [Exogorth](http://images.geeknative.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/starwars-spaceslug.jpg). Insects on our planet have these qualities because at their dimensions it provides the most effective weight to energy requirement ratio. An ant can lift a huge multiple of it's own weight but if an ant were our size it's exoskeleton would crush it's internal organs.
So how could these traits be possible within a multitude of enormous creatures in the star wars galaxy? if the sentient being were tiny of course. The more i think about it the more it makes sense.
Much of the impossible star wars technology seems more plausible in miniature. hovering vehicles are much easier at a miniature scale because of the minute distances and forces required. the acrobatics feats of the jedi and others are more attainable and realistic (fleas jump 200times their own height etc.) and i believe that the laser rifles and light sabres could be more likely because of the nano scale wiring and arcing distances. also the power of their computers could be explained by the ability to manufacture extremely small circuitry which because of it's size could avoid some of the issues with waste heat and resistance.
Many of the apparently human sized beings posses clearly insect and other smaller organism's traits especially the slug like [Jabba, his ascociates](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080324151352/starwars/images/9/9e/BibFortuna_Jabba_Ep6.jpg)  and the insectoid [geonsians]( http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20070204115953/starwars/images/6/6d/Geonosian1.jpg)

That being said, I did avoid a spoiler... so, there! The Correct title: 

""The Real REason Tenzin and Lin Bei Fong Broke Up."" 

One of the first things I noticed about the show was the relative age discrepancy between Tenzin and his wife, Pema. He is currently 51, while she is 35. Lin is 50. We learned in Episode 6 that Lin and Tenzin were previously involved, and that involvement broken when Pema confessed her love for Tenzin. However, we do know they had problems. They had grown apart before this - Pema only sealed the deal. 

Pema had her first child with Tenzin, Jinora, Ten years prior to this series. Lets assume they had some courtship, although padding the years isn't required - lets say two years for their courtship. That puts Tenzin at 39, Pema at 23, and Lin at 38. 

Tenzin and Lin grew up together. They were probably happily in love for some time, and planned on living a long life together. But by this point in time, Tenzin knew there was something wrong. 

Put Simply; **Lin was barren.**

 Despite years (decades, even) of trying to conceive, Lin was unable to bear Tenzin's children. This is a HUGE problem for Tenzin; he is, like his father, The Last Airbender. If he does not produce offspring, the Airbenders die as a race. It took his parents three kids to produce an airbender (he was the youngest child) and here he is, with a woman he's known his entire life (and, with all likelihood, has been intimate with for 15-20 years) and she cannot produce a single child. They argue. They fight. They grow distant. Tenzin worries that his will be the last of his kind; that he will forever keep the world out of balance by denying them more airbenders. 

Then, suddenly; A blushing young Pema, hardly into her twenties, nice, pretty, and *fertile* confesses undying love for Tenzin. Sure, she seems lovely - and perhaps Tenzin actually loves her back. But in the end, it wasn't the lack of compatibility that drove Lin and Tenzin apart; It was the fear of extinction.

Mr and Mrs Potato Head demonstrate that toys can live, even when parts of their body are separated, and they can operate those parts remotely, somehow. Mr Potato Head even manages to animate a Tortilla and use it as a replacement body. Mrs Potato Head's eye works, even when lost, and she can see out of it. This makes me think that a toy's consciousness is not isolated or centered to a specific part of their body. This is important because it makes me think that, even if a toy was torn apart, it would be conscious in all of those parts. Imagine if you scattered all the tiny pieces of a toy across the world- would they still all exist, trying to find a way to reunite? If there is a center for consciousness of a toy, what would it be? It's not the head, as Mr and Mrs Potato Head don't have them. I don't think it's the body, as Mr Potato Head can exist without, and use a tortilla as, this body part. It's obviously not the arms, Woody loses his, and I doubt it's the legs. So how do you define what it is that causes a toy to lose its conscious thought?

Which also makes me think, what happens to toys that are incinerated,  as Woody and the gang were going to be in the ending of Toy Story 3? Would that be enough to finally kill their consciousness? I think so, probably. But since all of the toys' bodies would still exist, in a different form, would they still be able to think? I don't know. I hope not. That would be really fucked up.

Some other things:

Boo's one laugh is able to power all the doors in the facility while the Monsters chase around the world, but after a while in the monster world, the power fades.  It could be coincidence, but if time passes slower in the monster world, it would allow for more chasing in the human world and running from closet to closet while explaining why it ran out after a short time in the monster world.

My wife took the long view on this idea and came up with an idea of why the monsters think kids are toxic to touch.  The Black Plague was only like a 100 years ago to them.

If there's a difference in the time rates, it would make sense for the monster technology to rectify that so that the monsters can scare the kids.  If they can do this by freezing the kid's room or having the whole scare take place in the span of a second, it would explain why adults never see monsters and kids can't get their parents to get them in time.

Immediately Majin Buu's creation, he destroys one of his creators (US Revolution) because he didn't like the way he was being treated. 

Buu goes on a rampage, not killing people outright, instead he transforms them into food and consumes them whole. In some cases, becoming slightly more powerful in the process(US imperialism).

After an unpleasant, but altogether insignificant episode of emotional trauma, Buu is so conflicted that he splits himself in half, and the two fight to the death. (US Civil War) The evil side wins, and consumes the rest of Buu, becoming more powerful and wicked than ever before.

The rest of the Buu Saga (WWII) is just a long, brutal war between the Z fighters and Buu. Buu carelessly kills millions of innocents during the struggle, but eventually the Z fighters are able to defeat him (with the aid of a demi-god) and Buu ends up returning later as an ally. An incredibly powerful, but childish ally who is in need of guidance from the more experienced, and wise Goku.

Here are some side things that don't really fit the timeline, but work with the theme:
When Vegata first encounters Majin Buu, and realizes he is not powerful enough to win, he makes a noble sacrifice and goes Kamikaze.

The one time Majin Buu destroys a city instead of eating it (the episode with the blind kid?) the city doesn't explode in a sphere of light as is traditional in DBZ. It is engulfed in a distinctive mushroom cloud.

1368554568.0,415,self.FanTheories,1ebtg8,Chiaotzu in Dragon Ball Z is the ghost of a dead child that haunts Tien. Here's why.,545,130,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1ebtg8/chiaotzu_in_dragon_ball_z_is_the_ghost_of_a_dead/,"I first posted my theory onto a comment thread in /r/dbz a few months ago on my old account, but I found this sub today and thought that I'd post it here as a real post. 

**First, my theory:**
I believe that before the events of Dragon Ball (or at least before we meet Tien and Chiaotzu) Tien and Chiaotzu had a connection from an early age. I think they could have been brothers or were orphans and lived in a children's home together. Tien took a role as a big brother to Chiaotzu in life, protecting him and spending his time with him. Something tragic happened during their childhood, which led to Chiaotzu's death. Tien may have even caused the death himself as an accident. As they had a bond in life during their childhood, Chiaotzu was scared to passover to the otherworld without Tien and clung on to life. He eventually manifested his spirit in the form we know it today and began to haunt Tien. Tien himself was so damaged by Chiaotzu's early death that it broke something in him. With Chiaotzu dead, he ran away from home, as it only gave him painful memories. He became the bandit figure that we first see him as in Dragon Ball. He was a violent person who only showed affection to Tien in the beginning. He eventually joined Hermit Crane's school, which was a negative influence on him too. The only peace he got to himself was achieved by the intense meditation that he did.



**Here's my evidence:** 

* My strongest piece of evidence is Chiaotzu's appearance. Chiaotzu bares a very striking resemblance to [jiang shi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangshi). Jiang Shi are a type of zombie/ghost/vampire in Chinese folklore. Look at the similarities between [Chiaotzu](http://www.miccostumes.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Chiaotzu_By_KingCrackRock_by_kingcrackrock.jpg) and [Jiang Shi](http://alishamcostanzo.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/jiangshi.jpg) and [here](http://www.gothic.stir.ac.uk/documents/uploaded/image/Kasia%20pictures/kyonshi/paper.png).  If I remember correctly, Chiaotzu's appearance is based on Jiang Shi. Jiang Shi are typically exetremely pale white with red cheeks. They wear official garments from the Qing dynasty, like those worn by Chiaotzu. They usually have very little emotion in their face, like Chiaotzu and have very stiff, unemotive bodies, just like chiaotzu did in the original Dragon Ball.

* My next piece of evidence is the powers that Chiaotzu uses. Chiaotzu has mystical powers that are never explained during Dragon Ball. He could fly before all other characters and in a way that the others didn't (with stiff limbs, in a standing position). He has telekinetic powers that he uses to move objects and has used them to fix the World Martial Arts Tournament twice. Telekinesis is is used by poltergeists. He has a power in which he can paralyse an opponent that he used to try to fix the fight between Tien and ~~Chiaotzu~~ Goku in the the World Martial Arts Tournament, which is a power commonly attributed to ghosts.

*  In the Japanese versions of the manga and anime, Chiaotzu often refers to Tien as 'Tien-san' which is implies obedience, familiarity and respect. This supports the theory that they were brothers or at least that Tien held a big brother role for Chiaotzu.

* Tien and Chiaotzu are almost inseparable throughout the series. They are almost always together and even live together on a farm after the events of Dragon Ball Z. The few times that they are apart, Chiaotzu shows anxiety to being away from Tien for so long. They protect each other and care about each other more than they care for the other characters.

* In many episodes of Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, Chiaotzu makes passing remarks about never being able to grow up, when his size is made fun of or brought up. I think I remember one of these remarks in the episode, 'Changes', in which it shows the Z fighters at that time had grown up to how they look now and even Piccolo who was the antagonist had grown up.

* Tien meditates very frequently. He is shown to sometimes be unwakeable during his meditative state and produces energy coming from his body. He does this (in my theory) to try and shut out the memories and the demons he carries with him from Chiaotzu's death. (You might also be interested to know that Tien is based on a character from Journey To The West that uses meditation in order to reach enlightenment and to open his mind's eye, which enables him to see things how they really are. Dragon Ball is roughly based on Journey To The West and many of the characters hold striking resemblances to characters from Journey To The West.

There is other evidence to my theory and other things that imply that my theory could be true in the manga and anime but I can't remember from the top of my head.

**TL;DR:** Chiaotzu and Tien were close as children. Chiaotzu eventually died, which broke Tien, who then ran away, became a bandit and started meditating to relieve the pain. Chiaotzu manifested himself as a Jiang Shi; a form of ghost/zombie in Japanese folklore.

The evidence is that Chiaotzu bares a striking resemblance to Jiang Shi, has ghost like powers, little emotions shown and passes off passing remarks of never being able to grow up. Tien is shown as fierce and constantly meditates in order to calm himself when stressed. The two of them are extremely close and hardly ever seen apart.

I'd love to see some Dragon Ball origin stories that are canon. Stories about Tien, Yamcha, Krillin, Vegeta, Pikon, etc. It'd be a great thing to explore and in most cases, it'd be great because their powers would be so limited. Dragon Ball was so good because the powers were limited, which made the story to be more focused on the adventures. This in turn would make the stories more engaging.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,1368631292.0,,,True,t3_1ebtg8,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1ebtg8/chiaotzu_in_dragon_ball_z_is_the_ghost_of_a_dead/,

Harry and Luna have seen and accepted death. As such, they can see Thestrals. As such, they can hear the spirits coming from the veil. What if only they could see the veil as well? If that veil is made of the same material that Harry's Cloak is made of? Further, if Harry's Cloak has the ability to shield one from Death, could he enter the arch and see what happened to Sirius?

Think about it...the history of Willy Wonka tells it all.

20 years ago, Wonka was producing some of the most popular candy and chocolates...until spies started infiltrating his factory from rival manufacturers.  So, Wonka closed his gates, spent 3 years hardening his security (and building a completely separate factory in secret, btw), and started producing candy again.

But how could he be producing candy in that factory if NO ONE ever came in and NO ONE ever came out?  Because he wasn't producing chocolate in there...he was constructing one the greatest fun houses ever conceived.

But why?

Wonka was getting older and wanted to retire eventually, but wanted to leave his company in worthy hands...and especially hands that wouldn't give away his secrets.

But how could he test someone's loyalty without giving them secrets to keep and seeing if they kept them?  He couldn't.

...so he manufactured secrets.  False secrets.  Secrets so crazy and bizzare (and presented as absolute fact to the golden ticket winners) that if the people being tested ended up betraying Wonka and tried to tell anyone about his secrets, they'd be laughed at as fools.  Or, perhaps, a company may be crazy enough to believe them and actually try to copy the absurdity described to them and fail miserably.

During Batman Begins Ras Al'gul is followed to Gotham by a contingent of League of Shadow's henchmen.

The Hobbit starts off as Bilbo wanting to tell Frodo the entire story of his unexpected journey. As soon as the scenes in the past begin, an immediate change in style and color is apparent. From this point on, the movie is a representation of Bilbo's story to Frodo. Think back to Fellowship when Bilbo is at the party telling about his Troll experience to a group of children.

Rivendell looks exceptionally more luminous and beautiful in Bilbo's memory than when we visit in Fellowship). Also the movie is much more comical and odd in scenes involving Bilbo, whereas departures (Dol Guldur, White Council) are much more serious and resonate well with the early movies. The fact its a story also explains exaggerations like the stone giants battling, always falling and never getting hurt, and much more vocal species (orcs, goblins, and trolls).  

That's all I got, just something I realized in theaters and decided to build on and post after seeing a lot of negative Hobbit reviews on here.

He lives by the pleasure principle and is concerned primarily with immediate gratification through food and sex. It doesn't really matter how Joey obtains these things and he is often blind or unconcerned about the later negative consequences, be they angry girls who never get called back or digestive problems (these being some of the main fodder for Joey's jokes). He can also react aggressively should something or someone come between his pleasure: ""Joey doesn't share food!!!"" And he also avoids anything unpleasant or upsetting as when he put ""The Shining"" in the freezer when it got too scary for him. His choice of vocation also aligns with this as acting offers immediate personal and sexual benefits for him while he is performing a role, but has scant long term prospects.

Ross clearly corresponds with the ego and operates on the reality principle. While he certainly likes sex and food, he derives his satisfaction through more realistic long term means, primarily his career and academia and romantically through long term monogamous relationships rather than one-night stands. He tempers Joey's Id-like subconscious drives through conscious rationalizations.  Ross is also most likely to reprove Joey's pleasure seeking activities through rational arguments based on negative consequences. And while the use of the word ego to mean self-worth and pride isn't properly Freudian, Ross is clearly the one character with the most pride, self-importance, and arrogance about him.

Lastly, Chandler completes the set representing the superego. He internalizes cultural norms and expectations which manifest as feeling of guilt or shame. He is most likely of the three to vocalize a feeling of how something ""should"" be, or to tell another character he ""feels really bad"" when he hurts them. Interestingly, his own parents gave him a disjointed parental example. Whereas Ross as the ego is likely to reprove Joey's id through rationalizations, Chandler as the superego is more likely to reprove both of them by taking on the ""parent voice"" and impart feelings of guilt and shame onto them: ""Is that really what you should do Joe?"" Perhaps the most telling instance of Chandler being the superego is his time ""in the box"" after taking Joey's girlfriend. This is an extreme expression of guilt and shame, whereas Joey only rarely exhibits such displays, and Ross will stick to his guns and yell, ""We were on a break!"" (a rationalization).

I was talking to my friend the other day about it and explained it to him and it blew his mind and raised the creepiness factor for him. I tried seeing if this somewhat obvious theory to myself, was ""canon"" but there's been nothing but speculation. Various plot summaries confirm Heather as descending into the staircase and then dropping the camera but this is hardly what happens in the movie.

The witch is holding the camera 

Two main things back this up. In the little exposition from the creepy lady at the beginning has her telling the crew an anecdote where she was just chilling somewhere and the witch appeared behind her. She said she ""floated"" and that she didn't even hear her footsteps. In the ending there are no footsteps heard when the camera descends. If Heather was holding the camera, you would expect her to be rushing down there. Instead the movement of the camera is purposefully slow and silent. 

The second piece of evidence is the sound of Heather's screams. If she were holding the camera the screaming would be heard loudly. Instead they sound a little off to the side. 

What I speculated from the ending after watching it: The witch had a thing for killing a victim while another person watched. In this instance, Mike was the victim and she left Heather to the side for her to watch. Heather is screaming because she is watching the witch descend from the staircase. The witch positions the camera on Mike because she wants the audience (or whoever found the footage) to act as another witness to the killing.

So if the RED team has a Demoman and the BLU team has a Demoman, which one of them is actually Tavish deGroot?

Based on Redmond and Blutarch Mann's need to always cancel each other's work out with their own work, the answer is that both Demomen are Tavish deGroot. The Administrator, the only real winner in the struggle, has created a duplicating technology that is likely tied to the Engineer's teleporters and the Medic's medigun technology. Every time a teleporter is used, a scan is taken of the user (including their most recent hat acquisitions) and every time they die (often), a new version is built based on that scan data.

So for the mercenaries involved, all they know is that they pretty much always win, although they are occasionally haunted by dire nightmares of loss and death (commented on by Heavy in *Poker Night at the Inventory*). So how long has this been going on, and what is the endgame? Confined to the Badlands area of the American southwest, this perpetual munitions war could easily have been going on for decades, funded by the functionally undrainable bank accounts of two feuding brothers. 

Saxton Hale, the Administrator, and whatever company she represents are profiting, but how? Are the replicators that quantum-copy and rebuild the mercs removing trace amounts of rare mineral dust from their clothes as they fight again and again in the gravel pits? Are their surviving organs sold on the black market, which is why the HUD of the game would sometimes point out ""Your Spleen!"" when your character explodes all over the stage? Or are the militaries of the world simply paying the Administrator to playtest new weapons technology on live, never-ending subjects?

Whatever the case, these relics of fifty years back - when a man did his job, didn't ask questions, and wore a stylish hat while doing so - are likely still alive and fighting in the present day, thinking that barely any time has passed at all.

I was rewatching the film earlier when this exchange happens, earlier in the movie, between Linus and Rusty:

Linus: ""Hey, can I ask you a question?""

Rusty: ""Yes""

Linus: ""Have you ever noticed how Tess looks *exactly* like...""

Rusty: ""Woah woah woah, don't ever mention that. Ever. Especially not to her.""

Linus: ""Why not?""

Rusty: ""Look - it's not in my nature to be mysterious. But I can't talk about it, and I can't talk about why.""

This is obviously a setup for the reveal later that Julia Roberts exists in this movie universe, and they have to use Tess' resemblance to her. But I was always bugged that they never revealed why Rusty is insistent that Linus can't tell Tess - is she embarrassed? What reason would she have for so disliking this?

I suspect that Rusty's mysterious reason why Linus shouldn't tell anyone that Tess and Julia Roberts look alike is because they are the same person. Because everyone in the Ocean movies knows they're in a movie - except Linus.

Let's look at the first film. Everyone fits their role pretty well as far as a movie goes: we have our evil antagonist, our love-interest, our dashing heroes etc. More importantly, they all fit into preset dispositions: the antagonist is quiet and calculating, the love-interest is beautiful but holds onto regrets, and our dashing heroes are carefree and chill. Except Linus. Whereas every other member of the ""eleven"" is chill and hardly ever worried, Linus spends most of the movie nervous, sweaty, worried and considering backing out. Even when Danny and Rusty have a huge fight and fallout, kicking Danny out of the gang, it is later revealed that this was just Danny and Rusty's ""metaplan"" to get Linus to spring the vault, to open up a window for Danny to get Tess back, and to just mess with Linus. As Linus says when Danny confirms that their fight was an act, ""Why do you have to do this? Why can't you just tell me things?"" Danny responds, ""Where's the fun in that?""

Amazing coincidence? I say no. I say he's the Avenger's version of [The Watcher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watcher_%28comics%29).

His appearances fit with a Watcher's MO. He always just watches and never really interferes. He also seems to appear around critical moments in the universe: he's with the crowd around Thor's fallen hammer, he's a general in the 40s when the world was supposed to be first introduced to Captain America, and he drinks the juice that leads the military to Banner, thus driving him to finally control the Hulk. He also bookends important moments in Tony Stark's life, by appearing to him when he enters a gala (then a pompous narcissistic), and in the second movie as he LEAVES another gala now embraced for doing good rather than just being a playboy. 

In Avengers he says ""Superheroes? In New York? Ridiculous!"" Downplaying the fact he was observing them over decades, as it's a good assumption he was in New York during the attack and would have seen first hand the work of the superheroes.

It occurred to me that, while he is mentioned in the movie, Mario never makes an appearance, and here's why: Ralph is Mario.

First, let's state the obvious.  Ralph wears a red shirt and overalls, and when he goes into his stump, it's in the same way Mario goes down pipes.  Probably coincidences.

Going deeper : Fix-It Felix is most likely a reference to Donkey Kong (big guy climbs building and breaks things, small guy climbs up to stop him, big guy falls down at the end).  However, it's important to note that Ralph's game is called Fix-It Felix **Jr.**.  The reason for this is that there is only one game where Mario has appeared as the villain : Donkey Kong **Jr.** (the sequel to Donkey Kong).  The creators of the movie made a point to append the Jr. to the name precisely for this reason.

Still not enough?  Okay, look at Sugar Rush.  Between the kart racing, item boxes, and food-themed world, it's obviously an homage to Mario Kart, meaning the Sugar Rush world is analogous to the Mushroom Kingdom.  Ultimately, what does Ralph do in the movie?

He goes to Sugar Rush.
He stops the evil king (who lives in a giant castle).
He saves the princess.

(Also, while this may be a bit of a stretch, the aforementioned time that Mario is referenced is when the doorbell rings at the party and Felix says ""I bet that's Mario!""  He then opens the door, revealing Ralph.)

-------------------------------------------

The Ministry of Magic employ Mary to investigate potential muggleborn wizards, part of the role is accustoming them and their parents to the weirdness of the wizarding world. She trains them not to speak of their adventures to other muggles, her denial of their adventures in the chalk drawing that same evening is a demonstration of how to act. The winds changing is just her getting an owl off screen from the Ministry, usually reports or rumours of children to evaluate. She was a Ravenclaw when she went to Hogwarts and excelled in Muggle Studies and muggle interactions, after she passed her N.E.W.T.s with all 5 graded ""Outstanding"" she was offered the full time job.


Bert is a squib, in touch with the magical world and an old friend of Mary Poppins, but has no talent himself. All his tricks come from Magical objects, such as the chalk and the sweepers. Uncle Alberts laughing disease is a real wizarding sickness, Mary wasn't kidding when she said it was contagious. It's caught the same way as the common cold and the symptoms activated by laughter. Micheal passed it on to Mr. Dawes when the shook hands, but it took a while for the symptoms to manifest themselves as he had no sense of humor.


Mary Poppins is never mentioned nor seen in Harry Potter canon because she was killed during the first rise of Voldemort for her unacceptable fondness for muggles and muggleborns. The children whose lives she touched passed on her story to friends and like Chinese whispers her abilities greatly exaggerated over time. A nanny named P. L. Travers was told the tale and penned a series of children's books about Mary Poppins, the books became very popular and have been adapted to stage musicals and film.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1aa96e,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1aa96e/in_1910_mary_poppins_was_a_star_employee_for_the/,

The Earth recovery act was going perfectly fine until one WALL-E unit went rogue.  This particular unit wasn't very good at its job, often refusing to crush particular object. Instead it wanted to keep these trinkets as treasures. However all the other units were still indiscriminately compacting everything, including trinkets this particular WALL-E wanted. So this rogue unit began destroying all the other unit and cannibalizing their parts. It continued its senseless cannibalism until there weren't enough WALL-E units left to combat the growing problems of Earth.  Its continued cannibalism allow this rogue unit to continue operating long past is original operational life span, continuing to function for over 700 years. Alone, he can now selective pull out and protect his trinkets while still compacting all the rest of the earths junk.

In the movie we see tons of mindless parts cannibalism preformed by our protagonist. He takes the trends off of a fallen comrade without a second thought. He hoards the parts of his dead brothers in his trailer along with all his precious trinkets that he had to protect from all the other WALL-E units.  The reason why there is still so much trash on earth despite 700 years of compacting is because all the other compactors were killed early on and thus for 700 years only 1 unit has been working on the trash instead of a whole plant worth of units.

Being forced to repeat the same day over and over again is a curse passed from person to person.  The curse was passed on to Phil Connors by Ned Ryerson.

Think about it.  Phil had been going to Punxsutawney for years, covering the Groundhog Day festival.  What are the odds that he just happens to run into someone from his childhood, that he has completely forgotten, but remembers him vividly?  Ned Ryerson never knew Phil Connors, but because he was able to repeat the day over and over, he eventually learned enough about him to piece together a history.  Remember, Phil Connors does the same thing later in the movie.

So, Groundhog Day is a curse passed from person to person, presumably to change the course of their lives for the better.  In Ned's case, he made a huge insurance sale with Phil and probably managed to get his life back on track.  Phil's change we see clearly in the movie.

The only question is, who would he have passed the curse onto in order to get his life back to normal?  My only guess is Larry, the cameraman.  From what we see of him in the movie, he is something of a hopeless loser in desperate need of a dramatic change like what Phil went through.

His Kryptonian name is the Hebrew sounding Kal-El, which I've seen translated as 'voice of god' or 'traveller of god' from Hebrew. Despite his Kryptonian name, he goes around as Clark Kent to fit in, which might be compared to many American Jews who changed their names to sound less Jewish to avoid anti-Semitism. 

His planet Krypton was destroyed, leaving only himself and handful of other Kryptonian survivors, which can be compared to the Holocaust where few Jewish people survived. To escape the destruction of Krypton his parents sent him to Earth (specifically the United States), like a number of Jews who escaped murderous Nazi oppression or the earlier pogroms in Europe by travelling to the United States or other friendlier nations.   

Alternatively, Superman as an infant being launched into space, has parallels to the story of Moses, who escaped death as an infant by being placed in a basket and sent down the river. And Just as Moses only learns that his Jewish when he becomes a man, Superman only learns that he is an alien when he becomes a young man. 

Despite his super powers, in his daily life people see Superman as Clark Kent, and because of how they view him they often wrongly assume he is feeble, cowardly, and nervous. This might be likened to the incorrect assumptions that can be made of Jewish people as a product of negative stereotypes. 

Also I think it's worth noting that Superman was created by Jerry Siegel and designed by Joe Shuster, both of whom are Jewish.

Goku is the first saiyan to die and come back to life. Whatever biological process is happening in his body that causes his Near-Death Improvement, I think it permanently got turned on when he resurrected.

He was near death, his biology realized he was near death, and when he came back the process activated but stayed on continuously. Dying is the most severe injury you can attain, and his Near-Death defense mechanism must have freaked out when it happened.

His biology concluded that the threats around him were so serious (since they killed him) that that process needed to stay on all the time.

Supporting evidence is that gym leaders *do* get stronger as you progress through the region naturally. More recent games even allow you to rematch Gym Leaders who then have much stronger Pokemon on them, usually after you've collected most if not all the other badges.

**: Cobb is unsure whether he's dreaming or not.** 

**: Michael Caine introduces her as his ""top student"" going so far as to say she's better than Cobb.** 

**: She already knows how to manipulate the dream world expertly. When she's being ""tutored"" by Cobb, she's just playing along.** 

**: She's too nosy, to the point where she begins tailing him for no apparent reason other than to sate her curiosity.** 

**: She's the only one on the team Cobb trusts, even though he's worked with two of the others for years.** 

**: When she gets caught by Cobb sneaking in to his dream, she breaks in further, forcing him to show what he's been hiding regarding Mal.** 

**: Sato was the inception. *(Just because Cobb said he did it first, doesn't mean no one else did it. This is a worldwide business, there would be a market to find someone that can perform inception reliably)*  Him being some big shot business man with government connections that would allow Cobb to escape exile, was the idea planted in Cobb's head that would allow the whole thing to take place.** 

**: Ariadne didn't follow Cobb into limbo because she already had her information. Cobb going there was just follow through so he wouldn't realize what was going on.**

**: The whole architecture of how they went into Fischer's dream was a parallel for how they broke into Cobb's. Using people he knows, gaining his trust, familiar places, ridiculous scenarios, etc... *Note there was a shootout when he went to find Tom Hardy's character that he miraculously got away from that was similar to the first layer of Fischer's dream.*** 

That's about all I can remember off the top of my head. I'll have to re-watch the movie to further support my ideas if this gets some responses.

Like most everyone else, I have my theories about this movie. This one is about The Mandarin.

I propose that the Ben Kingsley version of The Mandarin was in fact the real Mandarin. 

In the comics, when Mandarin found the rings, he found them in an alien ship left behind by the alien race the dragon Fin Fang Foom came from. He studied the alien technology and rings for years before deciding to take over China. In the movies, he may be at a point where he has just decided to start amassing an army to start taking over a nation and has decided to keep a low profile so as not to alert The Avengers to his presence.

In 1999, when the movie opens, Killian is looking for a buyer for his experimentation. I think The Mandarin found him and used his Mento-Intensifier ring to start manipulating Killian. Over the years Killian’s terrorist army grew under the watchful eye of The Mandarin. Soon Killian began getting thoughts that he himself was The Mandarin and also began forming the plan that made up the plot of Iron Man 3. 
All this time, the real Mandarin was watching, waiting, and when the time was right, revealed his face to the world as The Mandarin. The VP ascension plot would have left him with a pawn in the White House that would allow him to start taking over from the inside. Then Stark got involved. Mandarin’s having a good time with some ladies without his rings on and bam, there’s Tony, in his room. Played wrong, all his hard work would be done. So he fabricates the lies of being an actor. Even his arrest at the end was a lie. His Mento-Intensifier ring has the ability to manufacture illusions.

With his army disbanded and plot destroyed, he recognized that now was not the time to try and take over. So he’ll go back into the shadows and wait letting Killian take the fall as The Mandarin and brains behind the operation. As for Killian, he had listened to the real Mandarin’s lies so much that he had come to believe them. When he said he was The Mandarin, he believed that. 

The real Mandarin was Ben Kingsley’s character and could still show up in the future.

Along the way we see holographic movies, flying cars, sleep inducers, food hydrators (lol whut), automated homes, robot trashbins, self-drying jackets, Pepsi Perfect and a 1980s Nostalgia diner. None of these things exist in 2013, and they aren't likely to exist in two years. So what happened? 

Old Biff happened. By stealing the Delorean and changing the past, he set off a chain of events that eventually stranded Doc in the old west. Marty went back to save him, but he chose to stay. Doc Brown never returned to 1985. 

Why does this matter? Because Doc Brown was destined to be that era's great inventor. The first movie establishes that Doc Brown is a great inventor, even if only one of his inventions ever worked right -- a time machine. This effort boosted Emmit Brown's confidence, allowing him to move on and build greater things. 

We also know that the Doc was respected by the scientific community, at least at one point with BTTF2 showing a paper that says ""Doc Brown Commended."" 

In the Third Film, we discover that after being ""stranded"" in the old west, the doc finds a way to re-invent his time machine, building a time machine years before even basic automobiles were available. This revamped time train could even fly, suggesting the hand the Doc would have had in some of the 2015 technology -- and he did this with the inferior technology of the 1885 era. Even if this technology had been culled from an earlier trip to the future, Brown still had to ""invent"" several technologies that weren't available in 1885 (see BTTF 2, where 1955 doc has to rebuild time circuits using inferior 1955 technology due to the absence of certain technologies in that era). Imagine what he might have done in 1985? 

The actions of the third film clearly show that Doc Brown was capable of inventing many of the marvels we saw in 2015. If he created only one of them for public consumption, it would likely have kickstarted corporate competition across the globe. 

Doc Brown was removed from his native time period, and earth lost the catalyst of its next big growth in technology. 

Back to the Future is why we don't have Back to the Future technology. 

EDIT: Also, Doc would have had to invent some sort of power generator not native to the time -- maybe the groundwork for what would have become Mr. Fusion -- he may have had a hoverboard in 1885,  but he still needed to generate 1.21 gigawatts of power to get back to the future.

He does not inform them of what they're getting in to. He doesn't say ""Take the red pill and you will be plunged into a post-apocalyptic dystopia where the earth is dead and you have to fight an impossible battle against machines where you will probably die"". He says some spooky ambiguous ""No one can be told what the matrix is, they have to see it for themselves"", which is bullshit. The matrix isn't particularly hard to explain. Why would someone so obsessed with truth and enlightenment be so resistant to informing a potential initiate of the situation they're in?

Morpheus dangles a big fat question mark in front of people's heads so they won't be able to resist the temptation of the mystery. When someone chooses to leave the matrix they aren't even **partially** informed as to what that decision would entail. The reason why morpheus withholds this information is that if he told them what they were getting into, no one would join, and he wouldn't have a crew for his ship.

The process of being ejected from the matrix is so jarring and traumatic that when the initiates arrive in the real world they are emotionally and mentally shattered. They can't move, they are in constant pain, and their entire understanding of the world has been obliterated. They have NEVER been more weak and vulnerable in their entire lives and cult leaders thrive on vulnerability. Now morpheus takes this chance to tell them that he's on a mission to find the messiah so he can save the world. He's the perfect cult leader, and everyone believes him. Everyone, that is, except Cypher.

The rest of the crew was completely complicit in Morpheus's behaviour even to the point of helping him indoctrinate new members. Even Morpheus himself believes that he is doing the right thing. He's fighting for humanity, and the initiate is human. The initiate does not need to know about all this spooky stuff, he's too brainwashed to leave the matrix of his own free will so I'll just coax him out with a bit of smoke and mirrors. Its in their best interest, they don't know any better, we will be greeted as liberators ect ect.

About three quarters through the film it is revealed that Cypher has made a deal with agent smith. The deal is that Cypher gives Smith the location of the Nebuchadnezzar and sacrifices the crew in exchange for being put back in the matrix with his dream life.

When Cypher was born in the matrix he was not living *his* life, he was living the life that the machines wanted. When Cypher was mislead into leaving the matrix, he was living the life that morpheus wanted. Only when Cypher chooses to return to the matrix with **full knowledge** of the requirements and consequences of that choice, does his life become his own.

The machines wanted to control cypher's destiny and morpheus wanted to control cypher's destiny, so he took a stand. He tried blasting his way out of a cult of pseudo-religious zealots and he died in the attempt.

The traitor is dead, the messiah is safe, morpheus was right, back to the mission. And nobody bats an eyelid.

Basically, the ride-along Walt takes with Hank in the pilot actually ends with the DEA busting Jesse.  Seeing his Chemistry teacher at the scene sticks with him and in his years behind bars, writes and illustrates a comic book where the bust goes differently and he sets off on an exciting new path.

We see in the show that he is a talented comic artist.  His childhood drawings, Apology Girl, and the resulting tailspin chain of events made me think that this story was Jesse's way of explaining his actions to himself.  

The cinematography and sound effects all work together to create very graphic stills to set every scene and the dramatic shots often include a portrait of a main character reacting.

The hard part to explain away is the chemistry.  Jesse knew the game and would have seen enough in his booking to make up an intriguing DEA side story. But the chemistry?  He met a man who was busted for cooking under the assumed cover of a large car wash chain, Gale Boetticher. He corrects all of Jesse's chemistry doodlings in the comic book.  Jesse gets annoyed by this and introduces him as a character that he can shoot in the face.

As for the blue.  Jesse was talking about his comic book to a biker in prison who told him about how he got busted: breaking into a chemical distribution plant to steal a barrel of such and such chemical.

The final pin in the theory is death scenes.  Gus Fring being the most obvious example, the man's face is BLOWN OFF OF HIS SKULL but he walks away for 5 steps and dramatically adjusts his tie.  I've seen several supervillains die in the exact same way.

Part of this is that I just really wish it *was* a comic book but I've been considering this for quite a while now and I've seen nothing to dissuade me.

You don't have to watch the video, but it would explain some of the points I make against it. It misses one big point:
 
Aliens, motherfucking aliens

Even though the 4th movie is considered by many fans to be terrible and often thought of never existing, it actually gives us an out for many of the “Magical” inconsistencies. People who believe in Aliens consistently make the same argument: that maybe, just maybe, God and Deities who live beyond the sky were alien races making visits on spacecraft; highly advanced technology being indistinguishable from magic and all that. 

Making that argument, then maybe he doesn’t just consider aliens as a possibility, maybe, he knows that they genuinely exist. Hence why everything he learns and discovers needs to be kept away from humans. They are all objects or aliens themselves that are dangerous and need to be kept away from people who would use them for “evil.” There is no “Christian” god; one group of Aliens gave a weapon to the Jews, same for the grail and all the other items. It however, wouldn’t explain the creepy cult in the temple of Doom with a clearly “Empowered” leader. Unless of course, he’s an Alien; eating people’s hearts to gain power might not actually work for humans, but he is an alien that does. 

Consider the following: 

1. Indiana Jones always refers to anything he comes in contact with skepticism, even by the third movie, when he is arguing with his dad over God and a religion that technically saved him two movies prior.

2. He always tells people he’s with information like he’s reading out of a book, not “Hey, this is what’s going on;” and more “Hey this is what I’m supposed to tell you because that is what the public is supposed to know.” He never has any extra insight, almost everything he says can be found in a book somewhere.

3. He never actually acknowledges any religions, despite coming in contact with them personally, and we never see him pray. Ever. So, even though he definitely experiences spiritual activity, he acts like there is no God.	

4. In the 4th movie, he is called when the alien spaceship crash lands with the Alien. He is an anthropology professor, why would he get called for an Alien? 

5. Also in the 4th movie, he isn’t surprised at all that Aliens are involved. In fact, he has no questions, comments or anything else for the Alien that does show up; like he already knows what it’s capable of. He wants to leave more than anything. Earlier in the movie when the commie commander brings up the crash, he is more surprised she knew of his involvement, rather than the existence of aliens.

6. Why are the Ark of the Covenant and the alien stuff stored in the same warehouse, Area 51? Those are two things that in the movie, only have one thing in common; they need to be kept away from people. Alternatively, it could be that’s just where they store alien relics.

7. Going off Judeo -Christian Dogma, which is sort of proven completely true in the first movie, all other religions are products of Satan, which is completely screwy when you then have the crazy temple of Doom and Aliens. How, in a truthfully biblically Christian world, do these things co-exist?

Consider the Holy Grail, is keeps people alive and heals them of their wounds. What if it was “Magical” before Christ drank from it? What if, by putting water into it, it releases chemicals or Nano-bots into the water that repairs and heals the body? Christ drank from it the night before, this we know. What if that was the whole reason he survived his crucifixion? Remember the shroud that he bled into that healed people? It would have been have been soaked with whatever was in his blood that would have been keeping him alive.

It would seem as though, at some point in time before the first movie, maybe Indiana’s first expedition, he has come in contact with Aliens and he gets stuck/maybe volunteers to collect all of the Alien relics and put them someplace safe, his museum. It’s why everything “Belongs in a museum;” specifically his, just so he can keep an eye on them. The two men who criticize him in the fourth movie just aren’t in on the details. It also explains why he keeps looking for things; I’d think after the 23rd attempt on my life, I might want to consider another career. Indy can’t, because it is now his life to find them all, he doesn’t have a choice. 

It gets even worse, because he also seems to be sworn to some sort of life or death secrecy. He literally cannot tell anyone, including his father, of the existence and pervasiveness of extra-terrestrial beings.  It would also explain why he gets contacted in the 4th movie about the spacecraft; it’s not that he is the foremost authority on ancient relics; he’s the foremost authority on Alien technology; actually making him one of the best and important heroes ever, to side with Katie on this one.

He is endowed with superhuman powers. However, it is not known how he acquired these powers, and he is only just learning to use them. 

Ace's superhuman abilities are seen in four ways. 

1. He is able to catch a bullet with his teeth. This was a bullet fired at relatively close range, and Ace not only has the speed to catch it, but also the strength to stop it without it putting a single crack in his teeth. 

2. He survives a violent shark attack. This was a fully grown great white shark. It  had Ace in its mouth, and from the way Ace was being jerked back and forth around the tank, the shark was clearly trying to rip him apart. Ace walks away from this without a scratch. 

3. He survives violent car crashes. Ace drives so recklessly he makes his car spin multiple times. Again, he walks away from this without a scratch. 

4. He is able to communicate with animals. Ace is able to keep a skunk parrot, monkey, squirrel, iguana, dog, cat, raccoon, penguin, and others, living in his apartment. These animals couldn't naturally live together, but they could if Ace can communicate with them to make them be peaceful. Also, when Ace is in his apartment contemplating the connection between Einhorn and Finkle, he tells his monkey to ""rewind,"" and the monkey does so promptly. Ace says this so abruptly and spontaneously, it does not seem that the monkey was trained to rewind, but rather does so because Ace is communicating with him.

* **August 6th** - The United States drops an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.  This proves to be the last straw for Russian immigrant Andrei Rianofski now known as American industrialist Andrew Ryan.

&gt; In his eyes, the bomb was the ultimate corruption of his ideals — science and determination harnessed for destruction, creating a weapon that gave the ""parasites"" the ability to destroy anything that they could not seize.

&gt; Ryan's response was to use his entire fortune to build Rapture; a community where ""the artist would not fear the censor, where the scientist would not be bound by petty morality, where the great would not be constrained by the small,"" in the only place he felt the ""parasites"" could not touch — the depths of the Atlantic Ocean. When Rapture was completed, Ryan filled it with several thousand of the world's best and brightest, and for a time, it was everything he dreamed it would be, a paradise of freedom and prosperity. From 1946 to 1958, Rapture experienced tremendous economic progress, and solid political stability.

The exodus of scientists, academics, engineers, and entertainers to the subaquatic city of Rapture causes the slow split from our timeline that results in the continued existence of 1950's societal values, aesthetics, primitive computer technology and significant use of nuclear fission right up until the Great War with communist China in 2077.

1363141534.0,339,self.FanTheories,1a6v5w,The Doctor (Doctor Who) has a name and we've heard it before.,451,112,127,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1a6v5w/the_doctor_doctor_who_has_a_name_and_weve_heard/,"Consider that the Doctor is a time traveller that has influenced countless civilizations. His name is legend. In fact he is the reason we have the word ""Doctor"" in English.

During the battle of ""Demon's Run"" a young soldier switches sides to join the doctor. She tells us she had seen the Doctor as a girl and did anything to run along side him again. We are told that to the people of the Gamma Forests, his name came to mean ""mighty warrior"".

Yet in English the word ""Doctor"" means ""healer"" or ""wise man"" and it is mentioned that if the Doctor ""carries on like this"" what will it come to mean? So we know that the Doctor's influence through time has shaped words, minds, and civilizations.

In ""The Pandorica Opens"" we hear ""There was a goblin, or a trickster, or a warrior -- a nameless, terrible thing, soaked in the blood of a billion galaxies. The most feared being in all the cosmos, and nothing could stop it, or hold it, or reason with it. One day it would just drop out of the sky and tear down your world."" We know by the end of this arc that the being described was the Doctor himself. From a different perspective the Doctor is actually a bad-guy as he meddles in the development of worlds and enforces his own will and morals on everyone without a care.

In ""The Girl in the Fire place"" the Doctor's mind is read and the mind reader remarks: ""Doctor who? It's more than just a secret, isn't it?"" presumably when she saw the Doctor's name and she either failed to see it or was utterly baffled by it.

We now know that in Doctor Who's universe ""The first question, the question that must never be answered, hidden in plain sight"" is ""Doctor Who?"" and that the Doctor has been ""named"" by some ""The Destroyer of Worlds"" and that he has been to the dawn of time and is instrumental in having the universe reborn after it was destroyed. 

We know he's been around a long time and yet he avoids the most distant future when the stars burn out. He fears that time at the end of the age of stars. SO... I put that we know his name already.

It has been hiding in plain sight.

The Doctor's Tardis translates everything to everyone in its sphere of influence. In the Christmas Invasion the Doctor is passed out and regenerating and the translation circuit stops. Later when he comes to, the translation circuit gradually lets everyone, human and alien, understand one another. The only words not translated are proper nouns. Names of races, places, and people don't translate. 

Yet...  to the people of the Gamma Forests, ""Doctor"" came to mean ""mighty warrior"" ... how can this be? Its only sensible if ""Doctor"" is a proper noun that won't translate. That is, when the Doctor introduces himself we hear the untranslated sounds from his mouth and the word sounds like ""doctor"" but in fact we can't hear the ""true sound"" of his name because the translator circuit jumbles things in our minds.

Much the same way the Tardis perception filter makes it invisible to people who don't know to look for it, the Doctor's name has an accidental perception filter on it. We've probably heard him say his name before and didn't quite get it because through history and language his name came to mean something in English ... and every language in the universe.

The Doctor has in fact introduced himself countless times, we just can't hear the name because it simultaneously does and does not translate to mean something in a sort of cosmic Abbot and Costello ""Who's on first?"" joke. The Doctor's true name is more than a secret because it is a secret hidden in plain sight bouncing between translated and not.

The final clue I'll use is when River Song leaves a message in ""The Pandoric Opens"" for the doctor, ""Hello Sweetie"" in greek below her message is Greek. Theta Sigma is a name other Time Lords have called the Doctor but it is not his name, it is his initials.

Theta and sigma initials for -&gt; θεραπευτής συγχρονίζω

Which is Greek for ""Healer [of] Time"" or possibly ""Doctor Synchronized"" 

... and when we feed this through the Tardis' wonky translator circuit it gets caught up in the fact that Healer -&gt; Doctor and Time is a proper name but not a proper name... and the words are in the wrong order.

The ""Who"" part is the actual sound of the Doctor's name in Time Lord aka Gallifreyan so it comes out as Doctor ""Who"" but ""Who"" means ""time"" but ""Time"" is a proper name... so it doesn't translate.

When he says his name ""Doctor"" in actual Gallifreyan syllables it comes to our ears untranslated but we hear ""Doctor"". When he says it as a title it translates to ""Doctor' so the joke is on us his time travel has rendered his name a linguistic mess.

Even the ""The"" in ""The Doctor"" is a quirk in translation. It turns out in Gallifreyan the sounds ""The"" are the sounds of a name like ""Jeff"" or ""Jon"" and poor ""The Doctor"" ... see ""Doctor"" is his middle name ... can't get us to understand. He's basically ""Jeff King"" or something simple thing but the damn translator won't convert ""The"" to ""Jeff"" and ""Doctor"" translates as ""Doctor"" but its his family name too. Never mind that Gallifeyans have funny compound names like Spaniards do where they compound two last names from mother and father. So his full name is ""The Doctor Who"" or ""Jeff Healer [of] Time"" .. where I'm being silly and shifting ""The"" to ""Jeff"" just to show the point.

But... if he leans in close and whispers it to his lady-love then only when the sounds of sweet nothings are exchanged will the translator circuit shut off and you'll hear the unmodified sounds of his name.

**tl;dr** His name gets translated unless he says it to you in a lovey dovey voice in your ear. The real sounds are lost to the translation matrix. In Gallifreyan his name is common like ""Jeff Smith"" but because he travels in time the name became a meaning and the meaning means his name hides in plain sight.

A lot has been said about the drastic tonal shift in the fourth season: it's darker, bleaker, the characters are a bit nastier, and Michael especially seems like a different person.

So maybe seasons 1-3 are the happy fantasy TV show, where the family's antics never cause any real harm to anybody (compared to season 4 where they drastically mess up a lot of peoples' lives in a real way) and all the characters are happier, funnier, slightly more charming versions of themselves.

And most importantly, Michael's character is sort of his idea of what a good father is like, his fantasy of the kind of parent he'd be to George Michael where in ""reality"" he's as terrible as the rest of his family.

Giovanni was living a double life however, one Delia didn't know about; one she didn't **want** to know about. On one side Giovanni was quickly climbing the ranks of Team Rocket. On the other, he was climbing the ranks of love and impregnated Delia.

Ash was born, but it didn't help Gio and Delia's relationship. Giovanni started coming home in the middle of the night, stopped kissing Delia goodnight over time, and barely acknowledged Ash. Giovanni said he was providing, but Delia didn't want any of it. She gave Gio a choice- the family or Team Rocket. Gio said it simply wasn't that simple, he couldn't throw it all away and said ""You don't want to know what I had to do to put this roof over our head."" Delia, crying on the floor told him ""I love you, but I can't have you around Ash with your lifestyle."" ..and Giovanni left.

Ash never remembered anything about Giovanni but over the years Gio and Delia still kept in contact as Giovanni sent money every month to provide for the two. This situation wasn't ideal, but it's what it had to be.

Cue Ash age 10, and by now Giovanni is the head of Team Rocket. Delia calls Gio one day and says Ash is about to start his Pokemon journey, but she worries about sending their son out into the world.

Giovanni comes up with an idea. Giovanni took two of his low level people- Jessie and James and told them to oversee Ash's journey. They were to help him train; make him think he's in trouble, but never actually have anything come of it. 

It was years since Giovanni seen his son, and Jessie/James reported that Ash had been making some real progress. With this in mind, Giovanni set up scenarios for Ash to ""beat"" Team Rocket so he could actually see his son. We see this happen at points like Rocket Hideout and Silph Co. where Ash- a mere 10 year old boy- ""overcomes"" the most powerful criminal organization in the country...and even it's leader. All of these instances grow Ash's confidence and ability as he thinks he has slain Giovanni's best efforts; when really all he has slain is a proud father's heart.

When a lion cub reaches maturity, it is expelled from its pride and becomes a nomad, whereupon it seeks to find its own territory and start its own pride.

We know that in SMB1, Bowser did in fact kidnap Peach. And turned the Mushroom People into bricks etc.

SMB2 was a dream story, and has no bearing on the ""Real"" world, other than nightmares eventually coming to life. Peach is playable anyways, so not kidnapped.

SMB3 was a play retelling (with embellishments) the events of Super Mario Bros. 1

Mario World is the point where Peach finally leaves Mario for Bowser. Bowser is taking care of his kids (from a previous marriage) at this point, so he sends them to help Peach get away from her ex. Mario, of course, assumes Peach is kidnapped and goes after her.

After SMW, Mario briefly moves to a nearby kingdom and attempts to romance Daisy. But ultimately fails. Mario Land. These event lead up to the debut of Wario, and his own adventures. Peach is not involved and is presumably making a life with Bowser.

Mario 64, Peach decides to give Mario one last chance to get it right. She sends Mario a letter asking him to come and get her, maybe a little white lie about kidnapping since she knows that's Mario's rage trigger. And she offers him cake as a reward. Bowser, of course, does everything in his power to try stopping Mario.

Mario Sunshine is a few years later. Peach's reconcilation with Mario went badly and she reconnected with Bowser. And they even had a child together. Meanwhile, Mario is working as a sanitation worker on a  nearby island and gets mixed up in Bowser's family problems.

FINALLY, we get to the Mario Galaxy titles. Wherein Mario has moved on from Peach. To Rosalina. The Princess-Goddess of the cosmos. By this point, Mario's made peace with most of his enemies. donkey Kong, Sonic, Wario... And, after meeting Rosalina. He even makes peace with Bowser. This leads to the whole group of them meeting up ever so often and playing board games, having little competitions. Kart races. Martial-arts tournaments, sporting events... As if they were the oldest and bestest of friends.

By the end of Galaxy 2, Rosalina grants Mario his one desire, and reboots the entire universe so that he can relive the journeys that lead up to him meeting her. So that he can try to become the Man he thinks she wants. This leads directly into New Super Mario Bros. 1 and 2, which are the events of this rebooted universe.

He has a time machine after all, couldn't he just come back after Marty and Jennifer get back from the lake?

The answer is he couldn't, because of one often overlooked scene from Part III. At the end of the third film, we discover that within a few hours of the time Doc arrives to take Marty and Jennifer to the future, Marty was to have a life-changing accident with a Rolls-Royce while drag racing against Needles. This accident, as Loraine explains in Part III, completely destroys Marty's life - he breaks his hand and the man in the Rolls-Royce presses charges against Marty, which forces him to give up on his music. 

This leads his life to become the mess that we see in 2015 - broken down home in what is considered a ""rough"" neighborhood, continued trouble with the law and Needles because of his inability to let anyone think he's ""chicken,"" getting fired, kid who is also a wuss, etc. 

So it's clear why Doc had to take Marty when he did - waiting any longer he may not have been able to pass for his own son, he would have been broken mentally, etc. 

HOWEVER, I feel Doc may have had an even stronger reason to be in a hurry to get Marty to the future - He *wanted* Marty to see what kind of an impact his recklessness when called a chicken had on not only himself, but on his family's future, and give him the opportunity to correct it. 

When they first arrive in 2015, Doc says to Marty ""this one incident destroys your entire family"" in reference to his son getting involved with Griff's heist. However, I believe he may have actually been referring to the accident, which, although Doc never mentions it (and Marty never hears about it, just Jennifer, who remains passed out until Part III before seeing Marty again), Doc clearly knows about it because of Doc's extensive knowledge of Marty's family history, and more minor things like when future Jennifer gets home. I would also say it's safe to assume that Doc did in fact look up Marty like he promised to do in Part I, so it's possible that future Marty and Doc have discussed the accident, and Marty may have confided in him that he wishes it never happened. 

Hurt seeing his friend so miserable, this prompts Doc to want to repay the favor that Marty gave him in 1955 by saving his life in 1985 - by saving Marty's future quality of life in 2015.

So here's what really happened: Doc arrives in 1985 knowing full well that Marty's accident is hours away. He takes him back to the future and knocks out Jennifer, leaving here in the alley, even though he very well could have just left her in the Delorean with him when he went to pick up Einstein. He leaves her there knowing the cops would arrive and take her back to Hill Dale, possibly even calling the police himself. 

When Doc and Marty arrive in Hill Dale, Doc tries to keep Marty from discovering too much initially in order to keep up the appearance that he kept in the first film that no one should know too much about their own future. However, he comes back for Marty's help, with the intention of showing Marty his future ""accidentally"", or at the very least allowing Jennifer to tell him what SHE had seen, however Biff stealing the time machine forces him to change his plans. 

Through the rest of their adventures, Marty grows to not care what others think, and is able to avoid the accident, however that was Doc's plan all along. He wanted Marty to see the impact of this impulse before the accident, in the hopes that it could be avoided.

After her suicide she went to the first dream layer or  reality depending on how deep she and Cobb went before they got stuck in the Limbo and on if she killed her self again after she jumped out of the hotel. She is trying to wake Cobb up so they can live together. Which means that the whole inception takes place in Cobb's and Mal's dream.

Why? 

Because When Saito and Ellen killed themselves in the Limbo they went up one layer. Then they were in the snow fortress layer (3rd dream layer) and the kick proceeds to take them back up through the layers. 

Mal and Cobb didn't have a kick when they were stuck in the limbo and as Cobb stated you need more than one layer to reach the Limbo/get stuck there. Mal and Cobb killed themselves with the train and went up a level. So in my opinion when Mal jumped out of the hotel rooms Window she went back to layer number one while Cobb believed layer 2 is reality.

Most players don't notice it but the cause is, for the most part, a result of leveling up: the more points you put into abilities, the older your hero gets.

Replaying it more recently, something occurred to me. In this game, experience points are said to be the memories of the foe you have slain, literal experiences in their life that you convert into power. Well, what sense does it really make to turn memories into muscle mass? I mean, yeah, it's magic so it doesn't necessarily have to be perfectly logical and the whole thing was written probably more as a nod to the fact that these are called experience but you get them for killing. But the more I dwelt on this, the more it made perfect sense.

You aren't just taking memories, you are literally taking experiences. When you apply these experience points to yourself, you are retroactively appending new chunks into your personal history. All the hours this bandit spent exercising, these are hours that you have now spent exercising. And since this is adding experience and not, say, replacing it, you physically have lived for longer.

And, to take this all to its horrifying conclusion, you are not merely killing people and monsters but erasing them from history. Not entirely, given you don't get their whole lifetime when you kill them, but bits of their lives retroactively never happened. Perhaps so far as to say that the bodies disappear after you kill them because by stealing their very lifetimes you have caused them to die earlier in time than you actually killed them which means that you no longer have killed them right now and they are now dead wherever they were at the point where they were now killed instead of here.

Young adults go to a cabin and reading from an evil book summons a demon, who possesses people and the general area to kill all the characters.

However, I believe that this time the book summoned more than a demon. Almost all of the people in the cabin in the 2013 version seem to have a nearly superhuman level of pain endurance. They all shrug off severed limbs, nails to the face, needles in the eyes, and everything else the deadites throw at them. 

Such a display leads me to one conclusion. Sometime between Army of Darkness and ED2013, Ash's continued confrontations with the deadites led him to become non-corporeal like they are. He was also summoned by reading the book, and possessed people just as the deadites did. The difference being that instead of evil he instilled people with the ability to survive normally fatal wounds, and the endurance to carry on fighting even with lost limbs.

This is shown when Eric is first injured by falling onto the toilet. He's clearly in pain and barely able to move. The attack looks like it should kill him. Suddenly Ash's power possesses him, and he's able to kill the deadite and remove the needle stuck in his eye. Ash continued to go between the remaining survivors until the final confrontation, giving David the duct-tape needle battery revival idea, and Mia the one-handed-chainsaw fighting style that the deadites have yet to counter.

[Kobolds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobold), unlike some other [goblins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblin), have a habit of hanging around humans. They thrive on human attention, and even the ones who live in the mines were known to play with humans whenever they wandered into goblin territory.

They're like children. They NEED attention.

As time went on, fewer people believed in goblins, and stopped making doing the things that would invite goblins and other sprites into their homes. Even so, the goblins still needed human attention. So how do you get a human to give you attention and love when no one is giving it to you willingly anymore? 

You steal one.

Which leads us to:

**2. Jareth was part of a changeling swap**

Unlike Toby, who Sarah wished away (and honestly, how many of us oldest siblings hasn't tried that at least once?), I think Jareth was taken by the goblins and replaced by a [changeling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeling) as an infant.

The goblins make him their ""king"", but the position is one of name only. Sure he gets some magic powers, but they're about the level of party-tricks. His whole purpose is to be ""their"" human. He was raised by them, but he's still a human, with no human friends or family. What's more, he knows he's human.

This puts Jareth is an odd spot when he falls in love with Sarah. When she wishes her brother away, Jareth probably thinks he's lucked out. Not only is he able to show off and (hopefully) gain the affection of another human being, but Toby could replace him, giving him a way out of the situation.

But when Sarah says she has to get Toby back, Jareth is forced to go back to playing his proper role as an antagonist, even though, at some level, he doesn't want to. Throughout the film, his attempts to stop her seem, well, half-assed (""Dangers untold and hardships unnumbered"" seems like a bit of a hyperbole, too, doesn't it? There were like... five.) and he seems genuinely disappointed that she keeps turning him down.

Further evidence of this is found in the [novelization of the film](http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/novel.txt):

&gt;She turned again. The wind blew her hair over her face. Brushing it back, she took one timid step forward. 

&gt;Jareth's voice came from behind her. ""Turn back, Sarah. Turn back, before it is too late."" 

&gt;""I can't. Oh, I can't. Don't you understand that?"" She shook her head slowly, gazing at the distant castle, and to herself, quietly, repeated, ""I can't."" 

&gt;""What a pity."" Jareth's voice was low, and gentle, as though he really meant it. 

[...]

&gt;""You have thirteen hours to unriddle the Labyrinth,"" Jareth told her, ""before your baby brother becomes one of us.""

&gt;Jareth nodded. ""Forever.""

At the end of the prequel trilogy, there are two Sith left (Darth Vader, and Darth Sidious) and two Jedis left (Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda). By destroying the Jedi Order, he brought a balance to the Dark and Light side of the force: there were only two servants to each side.

Now, this happens in Hollywood from time to time, where someone will write an amazing script, but it won’t quite work for a franchise, so it will be reappropriated to a new franchise that is in need of a good script.  I believe that happened with Skyfall.

My Belief is that someone wrote a killer third film for the Batman universe, but everyone and their mother knew that Christopher Nolan would use his own story for the third film.  So, what was originally titled ~~Knight~~fall became Skyfall.

Let’s take a look at the Skyfall film vs. the Knightfall Batman mythos, shall we?

First off, Knightfall is about how Bruce Wayne’s identity is compromised by the crime genius Bane.  He secrets revealed, Bane breaks the Bat’s back.  The rest of the story is about Bruce Wayne’s recovery and growth as a person (his need to allow others to help him).

Skyfall starts with MI6 losing their secrets, and Bond “dying”.  My guess is that ‘M’ was originally Gordon.  The “think on your sins,” bit would have originally been about Gordon and Batman’s cover up of Harvey Dent.

One of the key things about the Knightfall series is that it was a paradigm shift for the Batman mythos.  Batman finally opened his cave and allowed the help of others.  The character Oracle (formerly Batgirl) becomes his tech guru who helps him in that department (See: Q in Skyfall)

Now here is where I think the impact of the Batman script was lessened by becoming a Bond film: The twist in the film at the mid-point would have been that Bane was actually Harvey “Two-Face” Dent all along.  (See: The scene when Javier Bardem takes the thing out of his mouth and half of his face sags)  In the Batman script, I imagine Bane would have taken the mask off and revealed that he was Two Face.  Challenged with revealing the truth, Batman and Gordon must make a decision.

The Subplot of MI6 being under investigation would have actually been about Gordon’s Major Crimes Unit not revealing the identity of Batman, and all of the people being killed because of it.  Their catalyst would have been Harvey Dent’s murder.  Now Batman could reveal that he’s actually alive, but that would complicate things…

The third act of Skyfall takes place at Bond’s old manor, where he is assisted by an old Scottish caretaker.  In the Batman script, I imagine that probably would have been Wayne Manor and Alfred would have been the one to assist him and Commissioner Gordon.  In fact, there’s even a scene where they show Bond’s parent’s gravestones.  That would have been much more emotionally impactful if it were Wayne’s parents’ graves.

Anyway, I couldn’t help but think about this and I thought I would share.  It wouldn’t be the first time this has happened (See: Die Hard 3), and I loved the movie Skyfall (Fuck me, it was beautiful!).  Hope you had fun reading!

Everyone sees her as this gentle, sweet, perfect nanny, but she's incredibly vain. The first time we see her, she's checking out her image in a compact. Then, when she moves into the nanny's quarters, what is the first thing she does: brings out a bigger mirror to show her whole face. She measures the children with a mystical personality detector that sets her as the standard (bringing about the ""practically perfect in every way"" result). The biggest act of vanity on her part comes when they enter the chalk painting. Now remember, Burt had drawn some neutral countryside vistas, but it was Mary Poppins' magic that allowed them to enter this pocket dimension. This extraplanar space was created and populated by her. When they enter, a troupe of her own creations sing a song about how fantastic she is. Then she enters a race with children on mounts that she created and wins. 

My theory as to her origins make these vainglorious acts acceptable however. I believe that Mary Poppins is a manifestation or avatar of Hestia, the Greek goddess of hearth and home. She descended to bring peace and order back to the Banks household. She's a nigh-omnipotent deity which gives her the supernatural powers that she demonstrates (flight, weather manipulation, matter generation and reconstruction, etc...) and explains her attitude towards the mortal children that she is helping. She has to come to this upper-class family because her power is strongest in cities where there are many homes/hearths. I believe that Uncle Albert might be Gelos, the Greek god/spirit of laughter, hence his predisposition towards humor and the loss of his levitation abilities when he is blanketed in solemnity. That leads us to the most interesting character: Burt. The others give some hints as to their true identity, but Burt I have to extrapolate quite a bit. In his opening song, Burt states that he ""can't put me finger on what lies in-store/but I feel what's to happen, all happened before"". My theory is that Burt was a child that Mary Poppins descended upon and touched the life of. He then became one of her priests/shamans. He has an inkling of her magic and almost fanatical devotion to her (as shown by the song in the painting and drawing other followers, the chimney sweeps). I like to believe that in exchange for immortality, Burt must remain in the city and must change his profession daily. If he remains faithful to her, she will provide for him. That explains why he's a one-man band, then a street painter, then a roast chestnut salesman, and finally a chimney sweep.

Her backpack is obviously an ancient enchanted artifact. It speaks with the voice of an old spirit. It produces items instantly. Always one which is useful and the others are distractions. It produces the irrelevant items to test the wisdom of its master. Chose wrong and at best it won’t help, worst the situation could see you die. It does this for its own entertainment.

It is well known that witches kidnap children. First the animals, but I’ll get to that in a second. Now I wish to discuss boots. Does it seem like a monkey to you? It wears shoes. Monkeys have opposable thumbs on their feet. It’s the same as putting them on our hands. Uncomfortable, and we are to believe it walks so far with Dora like that? It’s a pygmy child she has kidnapped and enslaved. Boots worships her as his master and its tail is a clever disguise so other people don’t get suspicious.

Have you noticed Dora’s Spanish? It is never conversational. It’s repetitive; it has a pattern of inflection. It’s a chant. Some of her English as well. Need the back pack to create items? Backpack backpack, backpack backpack, on back the pack, loaded up with things and nick-nacks too. Anything you might need. I have inside for you. It’s the same every time, and the pack comes to life after. She does a chant every time something blocks her way or she needs something done. Something always happens when she starts chanting.

This brings me to Swiper the fox. He’s just some poor peasant that Dora turned into a fox. Ever notice what he does when he swipes something? He throws it away. All that effort to just throw away his goods doesn’t make sense. Unless he wants to steal something specific, something that comes out of the backpack for instance that would turn him back into a man so he can rejoin his family. He steals the first thing he is able, runs off, spazes with it and realizes it cannot help his poor soul so throws it away, feeling a little more dead inside. How does she get rid of Swiper? With a chant.

She can speak to plants and animals. She can see into their soul and know their intentions.

Why does she freeze randomly during the show. What does she do right before she freezes? She asks a question or makes a request for help with a chant. When she is freezing what is she doing? Speaking to another plane of existence. Our children. We exist in a parallel world to hers and yet she asks them for help, because she can communicate with us. Our children are her extra dimensional slaves who help her chant and find objects she has lost.

What his her purpose in life? Kidnapping baby animals, that is what. Where is the baby animal in relation to its mom, over the mountain and through the wood? How’d the baby get that far? It didn't. Its mom is in the bathroom or something and left the kid nearby. Dora swoops in and convinces it that it is truly lost, because babies are dumb. She then travels across the land to her dark trickster master who is disguised as the kid’s mom. Easier to win trust and devour its soul.

One Idea that he mentioned is that 'This is The End' is an actual film within the sequel and the cast are all there watching the premier. 
source: http://www.slashfilm.com/this-is-the-end-co-director-evan-goldberg-has-some-sequel-ideas/

Anyway this is how I believe the sequel should work. Within the sequel the cast (which I shall now refer to as the 'Rogen team') have become very very successful as a result of their film.

This props other famous Comedian/Actor groups to make their own films where they play as themselves, in order to try and emulate the 'Rogen Team's' success. 

Without a doubt this causes the 'Rogen Team' to get mad as they feel that their idea is being stolen and as a result all these comedy-actor groups start hating each other.


Flash forward a few months, All of these comedy-actor groups (including 'Rogen Team') have their films premiering in a special film festival on a remote and secluded Island.

The Paparazzi have been kept off of this festival somehow (you fill in the gaps?)

Suddenly at some point in this festival a natural, perhaps supernatural, disaster occurs and all of these Comedy-Actor Groups are forced into a hunger-games like situation where they all start hunting the other groups, as they diverge into a tribe like mentality.


So Imagine the sequel follows The Rogen Team, with Jonah Hill, James Franco, Seth Rogan, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride and Craig Robinson. 

As they fight and kill other Comedy-Actor Groups. Such as the Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn group.
 

as well as The Adam Sandler, David Spade, Rob Schneider, Chris Rock and Kevin James group.

And the Will Farrel, John C. Riley and Steve Carell group


They could even fight duo's such as 

Ricky Gervais and Louie.CK


or Eddie Murphy and Jim Carry
 

Hell you can even throw in the 'Whitest Kid's u Know' troupe.


So what are your thoughts on my sequel theory? if you can think of other comedy-actor groups feel free to mention.

Edit: Another Comedy-actor group that I thought of is the cast of Seinfeld. Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld would continuously be fighting over who is the leader. Michael Richards could end up killing Craig Robinson or Eddie Murphy, to which he says ""I SWEAR HIS SKIN HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT!"" 

Edit #2: /u/Raneados suggested that the owner of the Island had planned this whole disaster. I then thought that The guy who owns the Island is non other than Bill Murray.
His motive was that he couldn't stand these so called 'funny-actors' ruining comedy in Hollywood, something which he believes he created.
The reason why he thinks he created comedy in Hollywood is because in the film he is played as a delusional 'Bond-esque villian'

First let's get the production evidence out of the way, then we'll get into the cinematic universe clues. 

-First of All, Christopher Nolan is producing Man of Steel. Probably just because WB knows he knows how to do a superhero flick and they want him to oversee it and have MoS have a similar tone to that of batman

- There have been rumors of JGL in MoS as a Batman cameo though these have been denied. But so were the rumors about Marion as Talia.

- Also The Dark Knight is one of Batman's nicknames, the equivalent  for Superman is the Man of Steel. 

Now the argument that this is impossible is, ""Well if superman existed the whole time where was he when scarecrow poisoned the water supply, or joker blew up a hospital? ""
The answer is in the MoS trailer. From an early age Kal-el has been taught by Pa Kent to keep this a secret, and maybe he should have let those kids on the bus die. He is told that the world isn't ready for him, that they would reject him if they knew who he really was. So knowing about gotham's issues he could not intervene in honor of Pa Kent. However, I think he makes his first appearance as superman in The Dark Knight Rises.

If you think about it, at no other time in the trilogy has Gotham been at such great danger then when Bane threatens to nuke the entire city. Since this is such a serious matter, Superman cannot let himself allow all of these people to die, he has also by this point been inspired by batman. 

Now Superman can be used to explain the plot holes towards the end of TDKR such as how did Bruce get back to Gotham so fast after escaping the pit? Why did bruce waste his time putting up a gasoline bat signal with limited time to save the city? And how did Batman escape the blast radius of the nuke with 5 seconds left to detonation? 

Imagine an after credits Man of Steel scene with Supes flying over the ocean, makes a hard right, flying as fast as he can, and grabs Bruce from out of the bat and saves him from the blast. 

An argument to that is he fixed the autopilot. But I think that was to distract from the fact that he is dead. EArly in the movie an exchange between Bruce and alfred goes: Bruce - ""You're afraid that if I fight him, I'll fail."" Alfred - ""No, I'm afraid you want to."" 
Bruce could very well want to die for Gotham, to ""Give them Everything"" and has accepted his fate when Superman steps in. 


One more thing that strikes me is I think DC would be foolish not to do a joint universe for their superheros after the success of the avengers. Having the superheros interact just makes the stories so much richer, each movie is a part of a much bigger picture.  Plus running off the momentum of the dark gritty tone of Batman is perfect for DC and a great contrast to the tone of Marvel's flicks

Trinity died at the end of Reloaded. Neo reaches inside of her chest inside the Matrix and restarts her heart. Then she comes back to life.

It has been established that the reason that you die in real life from a Matrix death is a hardcore nocebo effect; you think you were shot and your body reacts accordingly. So if you die, you think that you died, and then your body makes you dead. So the whole reason any of this works is because it is what you were consciously observing.

Neo dies and comes back inside the Matrix because he was able to fully realize that something imaginary causes him no physical harm to an extent that other people cannot subconsciously get over. This is never said but the second movie does all but directly state that this is how Smith resurrected himself; he recognized that he just didn't have to accept dying because what constitutes him is coding that exists in another system and has no reason to be affected by what happens to his Matrix avatar. The Oracle is able to ""inhabit a new shell"" when her body is destroyed between 2 and 3 because, like Smith, she was actually a program stored elsewhere and the Matrix body is like a user interface.

So these three overcame ""death in the Matrix is actual death"" by fully recognizing that the real them is not the them that's in the Matrix.

But Trinity didn't do that. She was resuscitated. Except, if everything in the Matrix works as a placebo effect, you have to be aware of it for it to work. She was clearly not conscious when Neo restarted her digital approximation of a heart, so how could she be tricked into thinking she came alive again?

Because what came back wasn't really her. Neo created an artificial version of her. An approximation of how he saw her. In fact, he created an idealized fantasy version. Smith possessed a dude and came back into the real world in his brain, so there's precedent for a digital being to inhabit a living body. In the same movie, no less.

But, back to something I said: the new Trinity is an idealized version. In the first two movies, her ""Residual Self Image"" - her idea of what look represents her - dresses in a shiny tight leather jacket and pants. In the third movie, post-resurrection, she dresses in a coat that is fitted at the top but flows out like a cape past the waist, distinct from a trench coat visually if not in description, a shiny leather female equivalent to Neo's distinctive coat. She now dresses how HE thinks is fashionable, not her original style.

In the first movie she completely breaks down when presented with the death of a man she barely knows but has a crush on, in the second she doesn't think saving the world is worth letting her boyfriend kiss another woman. She's somewhat emotionally immature. Come the third movie? She's as stoic and badass as she always tried to present herself, absolutely no slip-ups.

And in the third movie, when she gets killed again, she takes the time to correct her last words into something much longer and more emotional and, above all, extremely flattering to Neo.

And, most damningly, in the third movie she claims to be able to read his facial expressions",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,1349631218.0,,,True,t3_113ee2,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/113ee2/matrix_sequels_trinity_died_in_number_2spoiler/,

It will not contain any spoilers for Iron Man 3.

I've seen this topic come up a few times and have tried to explain it in previous replies to those threads, but I'd like to lay the whole thing out in one place. It may not actually qualify as a 'fan theory' since I believe it's what the original writers were going for in the first place.

My premise is that the Tesseract has been in the possession of many races and each time it has been copied, with varying levels of success, by those races.

At some point in the distant past an incredible source of energy that we will refer to as the Tesseract came into existence. We do not know who created it or what it was created for. It *may* at one point have been in the possession of an unknown alien being (Yes, I know it's Thanos, but he has never been named as such in the films) and his servants, a race called the Chitauri, who may have used it as a basis for weapons and portal technology.

At another unknown point, the Tesseract came in to the possession of Odin, the King of Asgard, who placed it in his trophy room and considered it to be most precious item of his collection. 

The Asgard defended the realm of Midgard, otherwise known as the planet Earth, from their enemies the Frost Giants of Jotunheim. A final, crucial battle took place in the Norwegian town of Tønsberg. It is at this point that the Frost Giant weapon, the Casket of Ancient Winters fell in to Asgardian possession but the Tesseract was lost. The inhabitants of Tønsberg located the Tesseract and kept it safe over many generations, realising its importance.

During the Second World War, the Nazi Special Weapons division, otherwise known as HYDRA, under the leadership of super soldier Johann Schmidt was tasked with investigating ancient legends and discovering whether any of them had a basis in fact and whether those could be used to develop weapons to use against the Allied forces. One such legend brought Schmidt to Tønsberg, where the Tesseract was located and then used in the construction of advanced energy weapons well beyond human technology of the time.

Through the actions of American super soldier Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, HYDRA's weapons factories were destroyed and their attempt to bomb major cities all over the world with Tesseract-based weapons of mass destruction was averted. In defeating Schmidt, Rogers caused him to be drawn in to some kind of portal, created by the Tesseract and very similar in effect to the interplanetary Bifrost Bridge used by the Asgardians. Rogers was then forced to crash the last remaining bomber, with the Tesseract aboard, in to the sea near the Arctic. 

Engineer Howard Stark, one of the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D., was tasked with locating and recovering the Tesseract and was successful. Stark then spent his remaining years studying and attempting to recreate some of the technology behind the Tesseract but was not successful due to the limited technology of his time. He placed his faith in his son, Tony, who he believed could solve the problems he faced. He left his son the necessary information to create a new element, one based on the Tesseract, that could one day provide a source of clean, cheap energy for humanity.

Decades later, Tony Stark was able to recreate this new element and use it to drastically upgrade his miniature arc reactor technology which powered his Iron Man series of armours. He may also have used this technology in the construction of Stark Tower in New York, powered by a full size arc reactor.

All of this is seen in the films, but this is where it all links together.

* The similarity of the Red Skull's 'death' and the effect when Asgardians use the Bifrost does not seem to be a coincidence and leads me to the conclusion that the Red Skull is not dead.
* Additionally, the Bifrost itself may be based on the Tesseract. With the Bifrost destroyed, Odin is forced to use what Loki describes as 'dark energy' to send Thor to Earth, something that cannot be repeated. Thor is only able to return to Asgard with Loki when the Tesseract is in his possession.
* Loki's staff is almost certainly based on the Tesseract. Captain America's remark that being hit by a blast from the staff felt like a HYDRA weapon (similarly Tesseract-based) is the first evidence. Second, Loki attempts to use its mind corrupting effects on Tony Stark but it does not work. I believe this is due to Stark's arc reactor being based on the same technology, and so it insulated his heart from the staff's effects.
* There is a strong similarity between HYDRA and Chitauri weapons, also. The portal used by the Chitauri to invade Earth may be an alternate form of the same technology used by the Bifrost.
* Thor tells Jane Foster that where he is from, magic and science are the same thing. This appears to simply be a reference to the idea that any technology, sufficiently advanced, is indistinguishable from magic. Foster is shown not to be too far off understanding how the Bifrost works.

This is one of many subtle links between the MCU films. Others, such as Banner becoming the Hulk because he was attempting to recreate Erskine's super soldier programme using gamma radiation, are often overlooked.

My theory is that Jim is the immature/lazy prankster of the office and he only comes off as the good guy because the show is written by his character (The documentary aspect is also a part of the story as we now know that the people ""behind the camera"" are a part of the fictional universe). Here's a breakdown of the characters.

Michael - Michael Scott is the manager responsible for making sure Jim gets his work done. Since Jim always gets away with being lazy and committing heinous pranks, he sees Michael as an incompetent dud.

Dwight - The best salesman in the branch (possibly all of Dunder Mifflin/Sabre), and a successful businessman who both owns the building the show is set in and his own beetfarm/bed&amp;breakfast. Jim writes him as an unsympathetic/overly authoritative wierdo not only because Dwight is constantly telling Jim off but because Dwight exists as a constant reminder of how Jim's laziness/unwillingness to apply himself in life has pretty much guaranteed he'd be stuck as a paper salesman while Dwight who does everything wholeheartedly has achieved much success.

Pam - Jim's love interest is the only other person in the office who is written in a sympathetic way because Jim has a direct romantic interest/relationship with her.

Others - Oscar/Creed/Meredith/Angela/etc are all written as caricatures from Jim's perspective, emphasizing only the extremes of their personalities and very little of their redeeming qualities. Angela is the overly religious office bitch, Kevin is fat and dumb, Creed sits far away from Jim and in Jim's eyes he's just a weird old guy.

Toby - Toby is a special case because he is quite sympathetic starting out in the series. This is because Jim does not know him well(he works in the annex) and only sees him as the counterpoint to Michael whom he perceives as an incompetent jerk, though throughout the series his character becomes more mopy and increasingly un-relatable(obsessed with the Scranton strangler). This is because Jim gets to know Toby better as a person and also grows to dislike him more due to the fact that at one point in the series it becomes obvious that Toby has feelings for Pam.

First of all, it has no affect on the story or the way the story is told.

""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia? DUDE, EVERY EPISODE IS CHARLIE DREAMING UP DENNIS'S DELUSIONS.""

OK, cool. So what? 

And it's *so easy* to make these theories because of zaniness and continuity errors in every show: ""Man, how does Walt White get away with all this shit? I bet he's in a cancer coma and is just imagining this."" 

""This documentary should have stopped filming four years ago. I bet this is all Michael Scott's fever dream.""

""You know why there are two Darrins? Because the *real* Samantha had a nervous breakdown after finding out that her husband was leading a double life, and it manifests in her witch fantasy as one husband who looks completely different after a while.""

See? 

Anyone could make this theory for shows they haven't seen. Just go to Wikipedia, look up a character's name and write ""It was all in [any character on the list's] name."" It doesn't matter what the plot is. It works.

Superman descends from the ""utopia"" of Krypton, a sterilized and idealized world where science determines values, and by adopting traditional values and community, becomes human. He reverses the nihilistic process. His very existence embodies *meaning*.

Enemy is nameless.  No motivation, no lines, no backstory.

Superpower is changing its own physical properties (becomes water, concrete, etc).

It is not seen being captured or defeated by the Titans.

Episode deals with losing the things we love (e.g: shops, crushes, TV shows)

Now... what many don't know is....

The show cancelled because it needed to be re-pitched to the new execs at Cartoon Network.  It didn't fit the new business plans.  ~~Key cast and crew  on Teen Titans moved on to Ben 10 Alien Force.~~ *[Edit: Irrelevant]*


What's Cartoon Network's trademark colors? Black and white.  ~~What cartoon does the alien look like it belongs in?~~

The cast and crew aren't the only ones moving on.  Edit: However, the emphasis on white can just be aesthetic value or its blank state when not transformed.

**Edit: Thank you for your interest however I've confirmed the episode was produced far too soon to involve symbolism about Ben 10 and perhaps even the cancellation.  I'm hoping that the cancellation aspect isn't the case.**

I have proof!,366,62,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1cfkfl/another_matrix_theory_the_lady_in_the_red_dress/,"OK, this is gonna be long.

Something I've never seen mentioned is that when you go into the matrix or simulators you cannot **physically** insert the plug to the back of your head (and unplug it) by yourself. Every time we see a person in the chair, they're unplugged by someone else. The handle is on the back of the chair and would be incredibly difficult to reach by yourself.

Ergo, Cypher had help. He couldn't have plugged in and out of the matrix by himself.

Now, I'm not saying he had an accomplice ... but he could have asked to be plugged in for some other reason.

Addressing what-ifs:

1. what if he was just looking at the screen, or typing the conversation with the agent (not there in person) and the scene was an imagining? nope. he talks about eating the steak. he tastes it. also there's no precedent for this kind of ""imagined"" situation in the rest of the film.

2. what if he had an accomplice. unlikely. switch, apoc and mouse are listed as the likely possible candidates, however there are no clues about their participation. 

3. what if he just wanted to ""relax"" in the matrix, have some steak and get a hooker. well, no ... i'm sure that they do sometimes enter the matrix for personal reasons, but due to the danger of agents and being caught an operator would always be there. morpheus would never allow people to be in the matrix unwatched (for their safety). if you want hookers, use the simulator!

4. what if he went from the construct to the matrix (secretly). this is possible, because neo and trinity ""we need guns, lots of guns"" move from the construct to the matrix. so we know it can be done. however, the ship would have to be at broadcast depth and the person who plugs cypher in probably would know that they're broadcasting to the matrix and not just running a simulation. however, to complicate that theory, cypher could have been writing a program that would launch a broadcast to the matrix automatically, and move him in there from the construct. then move him back again once he connected to a hardline.

We know that neo spoke with cypher and cypher revealed that he should have taken the other pill. how he hates the ~~matrix~~ real world (oops!). this scene is an important precursor to the scene in the restaurant.

i think #4 is the most plausible theory. so what i think happens is this:

1. cypher is writing a program that allows him to move from the construct to the matrix (and back). he is a hacker after all. 
2. when neo has a drink with cypher, cypher was finishing or preparing that program. he hides it because neo is smart and a hacker too ... so although neo is new, he might figure it out.
3. when neo leaves, cypher gets mouse to plug him into the construct for sexy fun time with the lady in the red dress.
4. cypher moves himself to the matrix, talks to smith, eats some steak, hardlines himself back into the construct.
5. shags the lady in the red dress ... he's there, so why not!
6. mouse returns and unplugs him.

now, here's the kicker!

mouse offers neo a chance to ""meet"" the lady in the red dress ... he's offering a sexy fun time simulation. why does mouse do this? he seems so innocent and naive. oh-ho! it's because of cypher. cypher approaches mouse and says ""dude, i'm bored. i wanna bang your red dress simulation"". mouse realises ""oh yeah, cool idea"" ... cypher has been using the simulation for sex (maybe regularly) and it becomes his method of getting into the matrix without causing alarm. this is a regular event, so mouse doesn't even notice small changes or programs that might be running in the background. it's late, so he might not even notice that the ship is broadcasting to the matrix. he just plugs cypher in and goes back to bed (or whatever) ... and through cypher's ideas, mouse discovers his inner digital pimp and offers the girl to neo. 

cypher has been planning this for a while. mouse is his unwilling accomplice ... all because it's impossible to physically plug yourself in and out of the chairs.

edit: i'm using the word construct and simulators interchangeably. they're both artificial environments which are not connected to the matrix.

do i win a prize?

When one who is familiar with the comics and the rest of the Rogue's Gallery compares the *Batman Returns* movie version Penguin with Killer Croc, things start to make sense.

-----
Compare...

Killer Croc's features and origin:

* Born a freak. Grayish skin, deformed body, strength.
* Cast into the sewers where he grew up and met other freaks.
* Has a circus-themed gang.
* Obsessed with revenge and is genuinely spiteful.
* Is dirt poor.
* Like most of the supervillains, is clinically crazy in some way.
* Acts crude, sloppy, like a pig. (especially around women)
* Notorious Acts: Invades Gotham with his circus gang; tries to kill Batman when he enters Croc's sewer domain.

The Penguin (Comics/Burgess Meredith) features and origin:

* Born to a wealthy family.
* Parents raised him a gentleman. Went to boarding school.
* Considers himself Gotham's most notorious entrepreneur.
* Is the only Batman supervillain not technically crazy, never thrown in Arkham Asulym when caught.
* Always acts classy; is a man of wealth and taste. Treats women with respect.
* Umbrella-themed weapons.
* Notorious Acts: Tries to run for mayor; sabotages the Batmobile.

The Penguin (*Batman Returns*) features and origin:

* **Born to a wealthy family.**
* *Born a freak. Grayish skin, deformed body, strength.*
* *Cast into the sewers where he grew up and met other freaks.*
* *Has a circus-themed gang.*
* *Obsessed with revenge and is genuinely spiteful.*
* *Is dirt poor.*
* *Like most of the supervillains, is clinically crazy in some way.*
* *Acts crude, sloppy, like a pig. (especially around women)*
* **Umbrella-themed weapons.**
* Notorious Acts: **Tries to run for mayor; sabotages the Batmobile;** *invades Gotham with his circus gang; tries to kill Batman when he enters the sewer domain.*

Bolded are the only origin features he shares with the comic (and Burgess Meredith) version of the Penguin. Other than wearing the costume (top hat, long cigarette, tuxedo, umbrellas) and being called ""The Penguin"" he is essentially Killer Croc.

Killer Croc and the Penguin (Movie) share a sense of tragedy in their stories, despite being brutes with a gross appearance. The Penguin (Comics) does not share this.

-----
Bottomline: Tim Burton was more interested in making his next main villain Killer Croc, as it more fit his style. So he cleverly disguised him as The Penguin, since The Penguin is considered the 2nd-most important villain in the Batman franchise thanks to the TV show that preceded the 1990s movie series. After *Batman* (1989) was a huge success, a sequel was expected, with either Penguin or Catwoman (or both) as the villain(s) even before any announcements were made. Nobody knew who Killer Croc was (there was no 1960s TV show version of the villain), so that would not have been good for marketing.

-----
Followup: The new TV show, *Batman: The Animated Series*, was loosely based on Tim Burton's two movies and involved many of the same production people to spearhead the project, including Danny Elfman. The show featured both The Penguin and Killer Croc. The Penguin maintained his original comic storyline, origin and style but the appearance was slightly similar to *Batman Returns* in that he was short, very fat and had deformed ""flipper-hands"" (he otherwise acted classy, was wealthy and had no circus gang).

So clearly the staff knew that the flag had changed over time, and were intentionally using the modern American flag for certain scenes.

Theory: The modern flag is flown whenever Spielberg believes the speech or action on screen is relevant to modern American politics.  When the movie came out, people were immediately trying to analyze the messages in the movie to see which ones were relevant. By using the flag code, Spielberg makes it even more obvious when certain points are meant to be applied to the current situation. Furthermore, Spielberg is well known to be politically active.

We all remember Penny as the somewhat sappy love interest of Dr. Horrible who suffered a tragic end. I propose, however, that this was merely a guise she put on in order to fool both Dr. Horrible, and Captain Hammer.


In order to prove my point, I must first prove that everything she did and said in the musical was an act. My 5 proofs are:


1: It seems suspicious that she was able to recognize Billy as someone who went to the same laundromat as her. She would have to be pretty good at recognizing faces for that to be the case, but she never recognized him as Dr. Horrible until he said his name during ""Slipping"", even though Captain Hammer was able to do it almost immediately. 
2: During her song while she was trying to get people to sign her paper, she never approaches them. The only person she approaches is some random guy crouching behind the garbage cans. If I had been trying to get signatures, the one person I wouldn't approach would be some suspicious looking guy crouching behind trash cans.
3: Her backstory (""Penny's Song"") sounds suspiciously like Dr. Horrible's current situation (""grew up lost and lonely, thinking love was fairy tale, and trouble was made only for me"")
4: She went from being completely in love with Captain Hammer to saying: ""I guess he's pretty okay"" in a couple days, and she seems unable to see through his obvious ""nice guy"" routine.
5: She knew about Bad Horse, and didn't seem suspicious of Billy for saying he wanted to be like him (and who would honestly believe he meant to say ""Ghandi""?)


These all seem to point to Penny's story being fake, but what is the real story? What is actually accomplished by this act she was using? The only thing that this act accomplishes is to put Dr. Horrible on top. Why would she want to do that, help some random person she never met before? Throughout the musical there was only one person who seemed interested in Dr. Horrible's evil career. That person (I use the term lightly) was Bad Horse. Whatever Penny did, she did not for her own interest but for Bad Horse's interests. When looking at it from this angle, it seems easy to see the grand scheme. For those who aren't sure, here's an explanation:


Dr. Horrible was a genius. It was obvious to anyone who knew anything of his plots. From transporting matter from one area to the other, to freezing time, Dr. Horrible had an impressive amount of potential, but there was one problem: he wasn’t really evil. Throughout the musical, he continually says that the only reason he wants to rule the world is to make it a better place. He is extremely against killing people, and one of his reasons for not fighting Johnny Snow was because there were children in the park appointed for said battle. Dr. Horrible only considered himself “evil” because Captain Hammer was accepted as “good”, and he hated Captain Hammer. Bad Horse wanted Dr. Horrible on his side, but first he needed to make him truly evil. 


Can you see the plot now? Bad Horse knew what a valuable asset Dr. Horrible would be, but also saw that he was wasting his potential, so he had to turn him evil. Think of almost any villain's backstory. They usually all go bad because of some tragedy. Bad Horse and Penny organized the perfect tragedy to send Dr. Horrible to the dark side. Think about the first ""Bad Horse"" song. He states that ""the grade that you receive will be your last, we swear"", but even after he miserably fails, Bad Horse offers him a second chance. Why? Because it's all part of his plan.


 Penny never really died. She faked it. And what was the result? Dr. Horrible has become a cold, hardened villain. The final scene shows him walking into the presence of Bad Horse. An honorary member of the Evil League of Evil.

Ed O'Neil's character is on his second marriage in Modern Family, the first of which he admits didn't go so well because he wasn't a very nice guy.

He has two kids: a blonde daughter and a son.

In Married With Children, the son is Bud. Bud does his best to be just an average guy and be successful with women... but something just feels off. What we are getting is Bud's fantasy of being normal when in reality he is struggling with his own homosexuality.

Kelly is considered the 'blonde bombshell' and constantly gets into dumb hot-girl trouble. For Kelly, the most important things are being popular and attractive, obviously. But this is not an actual character; it is a real person seen through the glasses of exaggeration and caricature.

So now we are in the modern era, the 2010's. We see Kelly and Bud all grown up. 'Bud' has accepted that he is gay and is in a fulfilling marriage with his husband. 'Kelly' has realized the error of her ways and is trying to prevent her daughters from making the same mistakes (this is often alluded to with stories of how wild and crazy the mom was when she was younger).

We also saw a lot of unreliable narration being mixed together between Al Bundy and his wife Peg. We see his point of view when we experience the selfishness and carelessness of his wife, and we can see her perspective when we see the nastiness and crassness of Al. However the character has learned a lot since this series and has matured greatly by the time Modern Family starts. His hard work and occasional ingenuity finally paid off as he owns his own successful company, and he uses the lessons he learned in his first marriage to make his second work out.

First, pay attention to the lack of remorse Rick shows after shooting her. Now compare this to the first time (chronologically) we see him take out a Walker. He leans down next to it and says ""I'm sorry"". As the series has progressed, he has lost that remorse to the point where he casually smirks as he kills the Walkers. This indicates that this incident must take place after Rick has teamed up with the survivors.

After his work on the Mewtwo project, Professor Oak made multiple attempts at bioengineering a human clone. The first successful attempt used a 650 nanometer laser, which produced a subject that, while biologically human, lacked human emotion. Professor Oak made a second attempt using a 475 nanometer laser. This produced a more refined, more ""human"" subject who could easily be mistaken for a perfectly ordinary and rambunctious young boy. The first subject was implanted in a surrogate mother living in the town of Pallet, while the second subject matured entirely in Oak's laboratory. The subjects were named ""Red"" and ""Blue"" after the colors of the lasers used in their creation. Postpartum, the surrogate requested to raise subject Red. Professor Oak obliged, and chose to raise subject ""Blue"" as his own grandson.

**How Pokeballs work:**

A Pokeball leaks radiation proportional to the mass of the Pokemon contained within, and the amount of radiation that the human trainer can safely withstand is proportional to their own body mass. This is why many young trainers like Youngsters and Lasses have lightweight Pokemon like Rattata and Jigglypuff, while heavy Pokemon like Geodude and Onix are always carried by a large and muscular Hikers. Of course, the radiation of those balls adds up, so most people are only capable of carrying three or four Pokeballs at a time, if that many. Gym leaders, being in a static location, don't have to carry their Pokemon on their person, and not being in constant close proximity to their Pokeballs, they can usually get away with using up to five. Red and Blue, being genetically engineered superhumans, have the strength to carry up to six Pokeballs at a time.

**""Leveling up""**

When Pokemon participate in battle, an adrenaline-like response kicks in, allowing the use of combat abilities like summoning lightning or breathing fire.  As this happens, Pokemon exude large amounts of radiation.  Their adrenal response also leaves them susceptible to radiation exuded by opposing Pokemon during combat.  This radiation causes Pokemon to mutate, and the extent of these mutations is proportional to the strength of the opponent.  Face a terrifyingly-strong opponent, and high radiation levels and increased susceptibility will lead to rampant mutations.  Weaker foes, conversely, will have little impact on a Pokemon's physique.

These mutations cumulatively add to a Pokemon's strength, and sometimes manifest themselves in the form of increased abilities or appendages.  For example, Bulbasaur might sprout some vines, allowing it to use the move Vine Whip.  Other times, the mutation is more drastic, causing a Pokemon to mutate into an entirely new form.  (Also known as evolution)

Although ""leveling up"" is the usual way for Pokemon to evolve or learn new skills, there are also artificial stimulants that can be used to enhance a Pokemon's combat abilities. You can call them ""performance enhancing drugs"" if you like, but ""Technical Machine"" also works. Evolution stones are just high concentrations of chemicals that cause certain Pokemon to mutate.

**What is the Pokemon League?**

The Kanto region is controlled by four elite emperors, otherwise known as the Elite Four. Kanto is governed under what is essentially a feudal system, with local rulers residing in ""Gyms,"" surrounded by loyal followers/apprentices. The Elite Four is aware of the possibility of a trainer raising Pokemon even more powerful than their own. To prevent such an individual from attempting to stage a violent revolution, the Elite Four has extended a generous offer: anyone who is able to beat them is allowed to join their ranks. Many trainers dream of becoming rulers of the world, but few possess the skill needed to make it even past the first few gyms.

**The Epilogue:**

After conquering the Elite Four, Red became its leader. However, lacking understanding of things like human emotion, he was horribly unfit for the role of leader. Red became known as a despot, inspiring the hatred of all of Kanto. Under his leadership, the skills of the Elite Four atrophied. Red was blind to the rumblings of rebellion throughout Kanto, but was not blind to the fact that his skills as a trainer were growing dull. To rectify this, he planned a hiatus during which he could train alone on Mount Silver.

At the time that the Elite Four's skills were atrophying, the Kanto gym leaders continued to gain strength. Eventually, Red was the only member of the Elite Four who was stronger than any of the Kanto gym leaders, and when Red left for Mount Silver, the Kanto Gym leaders staged a rebellion. Lorelei and Agatha were either killed or fled into hiding. Bruno, being among the more benevolent rulers of the Elite Four, was allowed to stay. The Kanto gym leaders were not able to defeat Lance's powerful dragons, but after seeing Agatha and Lorelei disappear/get killed, Lance admitted that he had no desire to see the current system continue. The Kanto gym leaders allowed Lance to stay as league champion, and stationed one of their own, Koga, on the new Elite Four. (Koga's daughter, Jasmine, replaced him in the Fuchsia City gym.) Red, meanwhile, continued his training atop Mount Silver. He remained in total isolation until three years later, when he received his first human visitor: a young boy named Gold.

More speculation in response to [this tidbit](http://i.imgur.com/jVf56.png):

The Mewtwo project was an attempt at creating a doomsday weapon to end the war. Lt. Surge's words suggest that the war was fought primarily with Pokemon, so it would make sense that the ""ultimate weapon"" in such a war would be a genetically engineered super-Pokemon.

This is why everyone in Red and Blue's world has Pokemon, including small children. They're seen as a vital means of self-protection in the event of a conflict. (Somewhere, there is a Bill of Rights with a statement reading, ""A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and train Pokemon shall not be infringed."")

The war was fought between Kanto and Johto. In the events of the gen 1 games, the wounds of this war have not yet healed, and the two remain widely separated. Between the events of the gen 1 games and gen 2 games, this relationship changes, and people are given more freedom to travel between Kanto and Johto.  Johto has substantial infrastructure that obviously didn't just spring up in the three years between RBY and GSC; many areas of Johto seem to have a rich cultural heritage (Mahogany comes to mind).  However, people in Kanto seem to be relatively ignorant of the land to the west in gen 1, largely due to the rift caused by the war between the two regions.  By the time gen 2 rolls around, everyone in Kanto freely acknowledges their neighbors in Johto, with scientists like Bill traveling freely between the two regions.

Mewtwo succeeded in ending the war, though not in the way that Kanto hoped. The Mewtwo project backfired, but the disaster was so widespread that it affected both sides.  While Cinnabar (the site for the Mewtwo project) is pretty far east in Kanto, Bark Town was largely obliterated by the Mewtwo disaster, and it wasn't until years later that ""New Bark Town"" was founded on its remains.  Both sides of the conflict suffered heavy casualties and were forced to unite in order to subdue Mewtwo, putting an end to their conflict.

**Other musings and topics for discussion:**

* Daisy, Blue's sister, clearly warrants explanation. Who is she? Is she related to Professor Oak or Blue in any way? Possible answers: Daisy was the source of the DNA that Oak used in his experiments, Daisy was the result of one of his earlier experiments, Daisy was the daughter of a researcher who died when working on the Mewtwo project...
* How does the Pokemon storage system work? Possible explanation: it is possible to convert Pokemon entirely into data that can be stored electronically and retrieved later, but the compression algorithm must be run on the Pokemon storage system's cloud computing and as such can be performed only from a PC terminal, making it unsuitable for field use. Pokeballs use a simpler compression method, making it possible for Pokemon to pop in and out of them at the blink of an eye.
* For the entire game, it seems like Blue is one step ahead of Red. Blue is the first of the two to visit Bill, he beats Red to Lavander, and he reaches the Elite Four first. I think that he also beats Red to each of the Gyms. (His name, if I recall correctly, is always posted on the ""list of winners at this gym"" that Red sees whenever he walks into a Gym.) This brings up many questions, such as: how did Blue manage to get to Fuchsia before Red if he didn't have the Pokeflute? Moreover, how did he get all of the HMs he needed to do things like Surf to Cinnabar?
* It seems to be common etiquette that in any Pokemon battle between two trainers, the loser forfeits 50% of the money they are carrying. I had originally wanted to play this one by having Red mug trainers after he defeated all of their Pokemon, but it seems to be standard procedure in all directions, as Red loses 50% of his money whenever he loses a battle, and there's also a trainer (a Cue Ball on the biker's path west of Celadon) who says something like ""Be ready to fork over cash when you lose!""
* Schools are an interesting point. In all of first gen, only two trainers make references to school, and both of them are Super Nerds. It's worth noting that Super Nerds in general tend to carry more cash than other juvenile trainers, suggesting the possibility that education might be limited to the privileged and wealthy.  On the other hand, in gen 2 Johto seems to have more trainers which attend school (there is a new trainer class called ""schoolboy""), consistent with the general trend that Johto seems to have better-developed social infrastructure than Kanto.
* The world of Pokemon is absolutely littered with random items. Even areas that are relatively far off the beaten path (like the Seafoam Islands and Unknown Dungeon) have items. In fact, the less-trafficked locations oftentimes have a *higher* density of items than high-traffic areas. This is because when a trainer walks into a dungeon like the Cerulean Cave or Seafoam Islands, the Pokemon there are savage, having had little exposure to humans. When/if all of his Pokemon faint, the feral Pokemon kill and feast upon the defenseless trainer. Eventually, their remains decay, leaving only a collection of items behind. These items become strewn about over time.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,1348576101.0,,,True,t3_10ff4g,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/10ff4g/an_deconstruction_of_the_firstgeneration_pokemon/,

The first time we see this interaction is on the scare floor. The scarers spend all morning working on a single time zone, scaring hundreds of children in a relatively short amount of time. The single hour on earth passes while 3-4 hours pass in Mostropolis. It is difficult to justify more time passing on earth, with parents staying up late and getting up early (which constricts the amount of time they could work on a single time zone) and the need for screams pressing the company to not waste precious hours of night on earth.

[SPOLIERS AHEAD]
The other examples of the time difference occur during the banishment and the chase scene. The few minutes that Mike and Sully are in the human world fill the amount of time it would reasonably take to transport an undisguised human child across a CDA-infested factory to the scream extractor. During the chase scene, Mike and sully enter the human world and run from one closet to another, often in the same house. These quick journeys cover a decent amount of time in the Monster world, based on Randall's position between doors, and the time passing outside the factory.

This has some serious consequences for the Monsters. Banishment, with its slower time flow, is a much more serious punishment. The abominable snowman, banished for decades, might return to find centuries have passed. Also, monsters who work the scare floor likely have shorter life expectancies than others.

The storytelling style of the show supports this theory as all the episodes are told like a storybook by one singular narrator, often in the third person. The child is literally telling a story with his trains.

This theory could also explain why all the surroundings appear realistic but the trains are bright and colourful with big numbers, because the child is imagining his colourful toy trains in a real world scenario.

For a show about an espionage against communist Russia, the nuclear bomb &amp; the threat of mutually assured destruction (M.A.D.) sees little to no recognition. Apart from the apparent radiation threat that provoked Sterling's breast cancer, the technological applications of the atom are rarely recognized. 

In the universe of Archer, the U.S. Government never used the atom bomb on the Pacific Front. The Manhattan Project simply never happened. World War II and the defeat of Japan was won via conventional manpower, leaving the United States of America a somewhat deprived military superpower in the coming years.

Onto the Cold War: the United States, sufferering from heavy military losses in the war, resorts to even more outlandish solutions in the now-balanced economic war with Russia, eventualy resulting in the ""loss"" of the Cold War. The U.S.S.R does not dissolve, convincing the world of the effectiveness of communism and the ineffectiveness of the U.S.  
The conflict of Vietnam simply does not occur as we would recognize it. 

The citizens of the U.S., dissolusioned with the effectiveness of the CIA and FBI, turn to civilian companies offering a new approach to the ""Red Threat""- privatised espionage agencies seeking the advancement of American politics versus the tide of Russia 

Thus are agencies such as I.S.I.S and O.D.I.N are born. (These two agencies are not alone in this market) The interest of priviate citizens reinforced by fiscal power, allowing the ongoing fears of the Red Scare persist into the Digital Age. 

Thus to agent such as Sterling Archer and Lana Kane act with such wanton impunity to what we would recognize as law. The operations and actions they carry out are perfectly legal in their world.

This is some pretty sick stuff, so if you're squeamish, turn back now.

**Moxxi, the former wife of Jimbo Hodunk (and mother of his kids), is also his daughter.**

Lets start with the facts.

* Scooter is Moxxi's son (pretty well established in games 1 and 2).

* Ellie is Moxxi's daughter (pretty well established in game 2).

* Moxxi (and Scooter &amp; Ellie) were once members of the Hodunk Clan. {Ellie once says ""I haven't heard Jimbo that angry since the time Moxxi told him we were leaving his dumbass clan."" Scooter also wears a hat with the Hodunk family Emblem on it. Lastly, some of the Zadfords refer to Scooter as a former Hodunk.}

* Jimbo Hodunk is Scooter's dad (maybe Ellie's too, but that's irrelevant). {During Game 1, when you approach the Catch-A-Ride machines, Scooter will yell out an advertisement. One such advertisement goes: ""My daddy always said that wheels was better than heels... uh, he-he was paralyzed though..."" When we meet Jimbo Hodunk in Game 2, we find him in a wheelchair, apparently paralyzed from the waist down. (I suspect some people will disagree with this as Jimbo also appears to be missing his left leg, but we know from Sir Hammerlock and Captain Scarlett, that robotic/Fake limbs are common and completely usable on Pandora, so best bet is that Jimbo is paralyzed from the waist down.)}

* Scooter is inbred. {When you attempt to use the first Catch-A-Ride station in Game 2, Angel says of Scooter: ""He may be missing a few chromosomes, but he's a savant when it comes to vehicles."" Missing chromosomes are common in inbred individuals.}

* Tector Hodunk is Jimbo's son and also extremely dumb (mother unknown). {Tector refers to Jimbo as 'Paw' on several occasions.}

Now we have to theorize based on the following:

* The Hodunks are inbred. {Based on Angel's comment about Scooter missing chromosomes and also Mick Zadford says: ""If theres anything the Hodunks like more than getting to second base with their sisters...""}

**Moxxi is Jimbo's Daughter as well as former wife and mother of his children.**

* During the quest 'Swallowed Whole' in game 2, Scooter orders you to Kill some guy named Shorty, who vandalized a Catch-A-Ride machine (and nobody does that except Ladies Scooter wants bang and sometimes Scooter when he's drunk). When you get near Shorty you notice he has been swallowed by a Stalker (Lizard monster). At this point scooter says.

**""Shorty got ate? Ahh, he's still alive though, them Stakers got digestion tracts that work slower than my BROTHER-UNCLE'S brain.""**

This implies that Scooter has a 'relative' that is both his brother and his uncle.

Uncle-A sibling of one's parent.

Brother-Shares a parent.

We know that Scooter and Tector Hodunk have the same dad (Jimbo Hodunk), and that Tector is extremely stupid. He and Scooter are 'brothers' (and I use this term loosely). In order for Tector to also be Scooter's Uncle, he must be the sibling of one of Scooter's parents-Moxxi. This implies that Moxxi was not only Jimbo's wife, but his daughter as well.

1366403583.0,294,self.FanTheories,1cp4ln,THIS IS A LONG DRIVE FOR SOMEONE WITH NOTHING TO THINK ABOUT by Modest Mouse is about a man driven to suicide.,535,241,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1cp4ln/this_is_a_long_drive_for_someone_with_nothing_to/,"I've touched on this a couple times in /r/modest_mouse, and people replied saying that they had never thought of it this way before, so I figured I'd come here to shed some light on the story I pieced together from the songs.

The album starts with the protagonist (I'll call him Isaac, because Isaac Brock writes the lyrics) [""Traveling, swallowing *Dramamine*; Feeling spaced, breathing out Listerine""](http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/32522/). He's driving away after an argument with a girlfriend, which has left him with a bad taste in his mouth (hence the dramamine). Isaac's pissed off, and he has to keep himself from getting sick. The lyrics are agressive and cursing. ""Look at your face like you're killed in a dream,"" she's all but dead to him, because she refuses to listen to a word he says. He feels like she's using him (maybe she cheated?) ""You said what you need so you'll get more, if you could just milk it for everything. I've said what I said and you know what I mean, but I can't still focus on anything""

This leads us to the next song, *Breakthrough.* Isaac's alone, probably in a hotel room somewhere, possibly hungover. And he has to face the light of day for the first time. He's slept in to almost half past two, and a voice is whispering in his head telling him to [""Let it breakthrough,""](http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/32508/) in other words to move on because it's a new day and all he needs to do is open the window and let in some sky.

He decides to give up on that day, and the next song *Custom Concern* is the first ""Real"" day after losing his girlfriend. He's [""gotta go to work, gotta go to work, gotta have a job.""](http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/32960/) He just wants to lay in his bed and dream it all away, but that's not how the world works. He grows more cynical, and sees that we're losing touch as a society.

*Might* continues on that theme; Isaac notes that while [""I might, and you might...neither of us do.""](http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/15909/) We never take any action. The last lyrics talk about him breaking his jaw, but my interpretation is that he's been crying so hard that it feels sore; ""Thought so hard, it's the last thing I ever thought""

He goes to the *lounge* to try to cut loose, hooks up with a girl, but still feels the pain of loneliness. He strolls around the *beachside property*, feeling that the world's focused too much on material things when all he wants is an emotional connection that's no where to be found in the modern day. *Head South* continues this theme, with the idea that everyone's [""sold out for the shape of the palm tree scene.""](http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/32964/).

*Dog Paddle* is a personal reflection. He talks about how he can't cope with his problems himself, so he does what it takes to stay afloat; in many ways, he's no different than everyone else. He does drugs, he drinks, he dog paddles his way through life.

On *Novocain Stain*, Isaac's back to cursing at society, except now he's decided that he won't be a part of it anymore (he's done dog paddling). He hates society's need for more; to replace the minnow brooks and shady spaces with interchanges, plazas, malls and crowded chain restaurants. [""It all seems a little abrupt, no I don't like this change of pace.""](http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/15908/)

*Tundra/Desert* are the ramblings of a man clearly on the edge of insanity. It's clear that he's on a long drive to insanity, calling out anything he can: sick fickle fuckers, planned occupations, soon to be anchors, governor's mothers, science, kind-hearted bankers, and winning opinions (which he admits he's never had). *Ohio* is a more calm look at his new-found depression:

""Truly sorry, I see clearly   
Calmly crashing, I pace faster than anyone   
Hinges rusting, they swing louder than anything   
Truly lonely, this place is flatter than it seems

""I'm upset and I leave the doors open wide   
Our hearts are used up, cracked and dry   
Pulled the scabs off of regrets   
We haven't learned to eat our conscience yet

""Truly sorry, I see clearly

In *Exit Does Not Exist*, Isaac tries to find a way back to the way his life was; he sits staring at a photograph of him back during a happier time, but doesn't remember what it was like when that photo was taken. He doesn't even remember the girl he was with at the time, the one who sent him on his long drive.

In *Talking Shit About A Pretty Sunset*, Isaac resolves to kill himself, [""Oh, noose; tied myself in, tied myself too tight""]http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/32973/), but he can't find whatever it takes to go through with it. He realizes that he's always claimed he's not exited with his life anymore, so he blames the town, the job, his friends, when the truth is it's always been him. He's the kind of person who can't see beauty in anything, even a pretty sunset. At the end, he laments that he might still change his mind, because he can never trust it to tell the truth.

The climax of the album is two songs disguised as one, *Make Everyone Happy/Mechanical Birds.* The lyrics in the first part seem like he's talking to a therapist:

And I said, 'you shouldn't make facts out of opinions.' He said that I was right.    
'You're right, I knew that I was, and I'd hate to see anybody fail...but I'd like to see you fail seeing me fail though'

After the lyrics end, the guitar builds to a loud squeal of mechanical birds; like the screech of tires running off the road. Isaac never made it home from therapy, he decided to end it all on a whim.

The conclusion is in *Space Travel Is Boring,* where Isaac is dead and can see the world for what it truly is. That girl he left? She won herself a pass to seclusion (some far-off moon). She's just as lonely as he was; a sick irony that he regrets but can't do anything about.

Cleveland is as boring as it gets, the only real personality that he has is his group of friends that gets him involved in wacky antics. Without this group he's ridiculously bored, and takes every chance he can get to visit with his old friends. While with his friends they tell him about everything they've been up to and their ongoing wacky adventures. When they're done talking it's Cleveland's turn, but he has jack shit to say: he has a boring, normal life with his new family.

So when he's asked to talk about his life he begins as best as he can, describing his new neighbors: the loser that lives with his mom and the redneck. Then he gets to the point where he has to describe his russian neighbor but realizes that his friends are already bored and adds something cool: the russian is actually a bear. They're all amazed by his cool neighbor the bear! He feels great, but that's the end of it. In a little bit he goes home and spends his time inventing his new life, or rather what he wishes his life was.

Every time he meets up with his friends he weaves them tales of his fantastical life. He meets celebrities, he visits cool places, has crazy adventures, and while he tells them he is temporarily the Cleveland of the TV show, but when the tale ends he sinks back into who he really is. 

I like this mainly because it explains how radically different Cleveland is in his TV show, while when he's with his friends he reverts right back to his Straight Man character.

Most people know the story of LoTR and if you have read the books and watched the movies, one thing you or people might say is, 'WTH Gandalf, do something right for once, you're a wizard, get professional."" Too bad it's not that easy. Gandalf was bored, miserable, and just wanted to go home.

The wizards were Maiar, lesser spirits that served the Valar, which were like high-angels. Around the year 1050 5 wizards were sent to middle earth by the Valar to aide against Sauron (who was alike the Valar, an ancient deity).

Before being sent, the wizards lived in the undying lands. Each one served a higher spirit. Saurumon served Aule, and he learned craftsmanship. Radagast served Yavanna and learned to love things of nature. Gandalf served Lorien and was in touch with the visions of dreams of man. Gandalf lived with Lorien in a special garden that was said to be the most beautiful place in the world.

So, Gandalf gets sent to middle earth to try and inspire and guide the citizens against Sauron, but not do it for them. He wasn't allowed to kill Sauron, all he was allowed to do was try to convince the elves and men to do it for themselves. 

Well, the Wizards arrive and what do they do? Saruman goes to Isengrad, gets ownership of it and starts a period of years where he does nothing but make machines, etcs, and look for the ring (by trying to find where it is through Sauron, the spirit that wants it more than him).

Radagast goes into the woods and starts playing with bears and animals, eats honey and milk and generally chills. The blue wizards go off into the far east to presumably smoke pot and play with dolphins. Well, what happens to Gandalf? He is left all alone. None of the other wizards care at all.

Why should they care though, they get to do what they want in middle earth. However, Gandalf lived in a 'garden of eden' a heaven and paradise where all he did was sleep and dream and live in perfect peace. Of course he wanted to go back.

He has to do it all by himself though. For over two thousand years, Gandalf has to figure out how to get a bunch of stupid, apathetic creatures to fight against Sauron. 

He can't just fly an eagle to Mordor and pop a ring into a Volcano...he's not allowed. So what does he do? He realizes people and elves won't do anything until Middle Earth is ready to be burned and Sauron is as big as the sky. Gandalf knows it eventually will happen, he also knows that the 'one ring' is the key to his strength. 

Gandalf needs everything set up perfectly. Around the time of 'the hobbit' Gandalf starts his plan. He brings the idea up with Thorin and his dwarves to reclaim the Lonely Mountain and its treasure. Sure, he wants Smaug the dragon dead, but he needs 'The Ring' also. The path leads them over the misty mountains. From the year 2 T.A. (or about) until 2500, the 'one ring' sat at the bottom of the Gladden River until it came into the hands of what would become Gollum. 

The Hobbit started around 2941. Gandalf spent nearly 1900 years thinking about Sauron and the ring and how to get home. He was involved at Dol Guldur, when the 'necromancer' was growing in power. A wizard, a lesser angel that possessed knowledge of dreams and visions, why wouldn't he know Gollum had the ring. He couldn't go and take it though, he couldn't handle its power.

He needed a simple creature without ambition. So after convincing Thorin, he brought the Dwarves to the shire and enlisted Bilbo, as that simple hobbit that would end up holding the ring until Sauron rose to his full power. After the story of the Hobbit and the initial success of his plan (where he did nothing but save people and also lead them where he needed them to go) Gandalf goes off to be miserable and alone until the beginning of the Trilogy.

And so you have the story of LoTR which is a lot of walking and trying to convince people that don't want to fight, to fight against the evil that will eventually kill them, the while trying to get a bunch of little hobbits to go halfway across middle earth to destroy a ring. You have twenty plus situations where Gandalf does something strange, or odd, or unrealistic, making things overly complicated. He really didn't have any choice. After nearly two thousand years, he was just so tired. It's tough trying to make a plan come together.

And when everything did work out, Gandalf made sure he was on the first ship to the Undying lands.

1372422113.0,280,self.FanTheories,1h8scv,Preston's surprisingly deft sword fighting at the end of Equilibrium.,368,88,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1h8scv/prestons_surprisingly_deft_sword_fighting_at_the/,"**Spoilers below**

A lot of people were taken aback by Preston's sword fight with his partner Brandt at the end of Equilibrium. After being built up as a dangerous opponent for the whole film, Brandt is defaced in three quick slashes. What the hell?

Anyone who's seen the movie will be familiar with the idea of the gun katas: through a series of specially designed postures, the cleric puts his body out of the likely path of gunfire while dispatching assailants with return fire. In case a gun isn't handy, they can make do with other weapons: we see Preston fighting with the butts of his pistols and practicing swordplay. Since guns are so commonplace among resistance fighters, it's reasonable to assume that clerics are trained to swing melée weapons in the *same* bullet avoiding postures, since the other guy(s) might not be unarmed.

Why is this important? Early in the movie, Preston witnesses a long-time Grammaton Cleric (Sean Bean) defect to the other side. Afterward, despite having no emotions, he seems distant and preoccupied.

**Theorizing starts here**

Sean Bean's character Partridge didn't put up a fight, but Preston is troubled by the possibility of the next one fighting back. So he turns his mind to ways of killing renegade Clerics. Attempting to shoot someone who has spent their life learning how to dodge bullets isn't a very efficient effort, but what about something they'd be less comfortable against? What about a sword?

Preston sets about designing a new set of movements that use sword strokes specifically targeting the postures Grammaton Clerics have been trained to use while fighting. Movements that use a reverse sword grip. His intent is for them to be taught to trusted high-ranking Clerics in case of violent defectors in their own ranks.

When Brandt joins Preston's practice in the monastery, he is unknowingly interrupting the invention of the techniques that will undo him in the end. At the time his conventional Grammaton sword fighting is matched against Preston's brand new style.

Before the style is completed, Preston himself defects, a transition that makes his new techniques far more valuable to him. By the end of the film, he has perfected his new skill and demonstrates it by easily dispatching Brandt.

EDIT: Forgot to mention:

Dupont seems to have come to a similar conclusion regarding swords as anti-Cleric weapons: when Preston slaughters his way into his office, the guards confront him, not with guns but with swords.

EDIT 2: Compare:

My theory started when I saw an episode of American Dad where Rodger the alien had a pomegranate in his teeth, he saw a pomegranate fruit and said ""Wow! It looks like a women's baby cannon."" The rest of the characters then celebrate *American Dad's 1,000th vagina joke* the set is pulled back and you see a man in a fish suit in front of a green-screen acting as Klaus. Clearly showing American Dad as a TV show within a TV show.
Similar instances are in an episode with a short running-joke of a bus boy saying ""It's kinda funny""  and in the last instance of him saying this, he is out of cue and when running to Steve and Stan you see in front of them a camera man and a boom operator
And the last time something like this happens that I have seen/can remember, is when Stan and Francine have an idea of an add-on for mobile-phones and then don't get anywhere with it. Stan then complains that the scrip is odd, I can't remember exactly what.

I think three instances of this many episodes apart is good enough to consider this cannon.

Edit:
Id also like to tie in Family Guy and The Cleveland Show into it.
Stan and Deputy Director Bullock are featured in the family guy episode *Stewie kills Lois* and in Stan's top ten **fictional** dogs list, Brian Griffin is show along side Lassie, Old' Yeller and Spuds Mckenzie. 
Now lets hop over to the more closely related; Family Guy and Cleveland Show universes. At the end of the episode of Family Guy where Stewie has Cleveland and Quagmire shackled in the basement Cleveland says ""Did I tell you I'm getting a spin off, another joke like this is in a separate episode but I can't remember when/how. In the Episode where Peter has his former self revelled by the psychic, King Stewie complains about the promos for other (fake) shows appearing at the bottom of the screen. Another example is in the episode *The splendid source* when Peter says something about Cleveland's appearance being ruined in the promos. And finally a cut away of quagmire thinking he is the one getting a spin-off is shown.

For one, we know that Tony's dad worked with the cube so he might have been able to figure out how to make it but wasn't able during his time. Also, Tony uses the new element to power his heart thing and we know that the cube has unlimited energy.

These are basically recognized as ideal conditions to lead someone into substance abuse.  There's nothing he wants more than to find an escape from his life, and he does when Qui-Gon comes to Tatooine and introduces him to something new.  In essence, Qui-Gon Jinn gives Anakin his first taste of a new substance: ""The Force"".  Qui-Gon's gift provides him an escape from his life, and he is happy for the first time.

Now he's hanging out with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, who are two chill dudes that are also users.  Their stuff is good, gives a nice feeling, and it's safe.  They introduce Anakin to their buddy Yoda, who warns that Anakin may not be able to handle what they're trying to give him, but Qui-Gon doesn't listen.

When Anakin ""uses"" the force, it's amazing, and unlike anything he's ever felt before.  But because of his background and how he was rushed into things, he gets a desire for more, which is when he meets Palpatine.  Palpatine is a dealer that's got dangerous stuff.  It's stronger than what Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan have given him, but it also has some nasty side effects.

Now, by the time Anakin starts really hanging out with Palpatine, Qui-Gon is gone, he's become best friends with Obi-Wan and Anakin has a new girlfriend, Padme.  He loves Padme, but he also likes the way that Palpatine's stuff makes him feel.  The rest of his friends don't like it though.  Obi-Wan, Mace, Yoda, they all see the change taking place and they don't like it, but Padme loves him and refuses to see it.  

As time goes on, he gets more and more into what Palpatine is selling him, until finally he goes too far.  He does too much, and in his altered state he hurts Padme, which causes her death.  His friends turn on him, but Palpatine's connections are good and he stops them all, either killing them or sending them into hiding.  Unfortunately, addiction takes hold, and he finds that he cannot live without the drugs.

Years pass.  Palpatine is still feeding him the drugs, and Anakin is still hopelessly addicted.  But then something happens that causes a change.  His old friend Obi-Wan shows up, and with him is Anakin's son.  He knew that Padme had been pregnant, but he thought that his child had died with Padme.  He has another confrontation with Obi-Wan about his drug use, and after that Obi-Wan leaves.

He starts trying to connect with his son.  He hire's some people to find out more about the son he never knew, and the people he's hanging out with.  At the same time he realizes that maybe Obi-Wan was right, and he tries to get clean (in case you're not following at this point, his addiction is represented by the suit, and during Empire Strikes Back, he is seen briefly trying to survive without the suit)

Anakin finally gets some one on one time with Luke, but Luke rejects him because of the drugs he's hooked on.  Anakin is determined to make the connection with his son, and so he tries the only thing he knows to do, and takes him to Palpatine to get him hooked on the same stuff.  But when Luke refuses, Palpatine tries to kill him.  Anakin is given a choice, to stick with the drugs, or to save his son, and he chooses his son.  He kills Palpatine, and he leaves with his son.  He goes through a cleansing period, but finally he gets off the ""dark side"", and he finally goes back to his old friends, Obi-Wan and Yoda.

Her husband comes in and startles her, discovering that her famous ""homemade yummy scrumptious bars"" are in fact store bought pre-wrapped snacks. She nervously tries to explain herself while her husband sarcastically chides her. We know this much, but let’s look at the back story to find out what brought the couple to this point. 


Here is what I think happened: Sandra is a fundamentally unhappy person who has lost control of her life *and* believes she is missing out on the happiness she thinks all her friends enjoy. She sees their vacation and family photos on facebook and sulks about her own existence which didn’t pan out the way she thought it would it college. 


She did well in college but in her senior year she got pregnant by a guy she was only “sort of” dating. This is her current husband. They both came from a solidly middle class background and felt they had to marry. She agreed to marry but he is not an ideal husband. Although not abusive, he consumes too much alcohol, getting drunk at least three nights a week. He had to forgo grad school and job offers in other states because he needed to support their new child and both their parents (they went to college locally) were their only support network when starting out. He sees his old fraternity friends making partner at the firm and driving BMWs and he is resentful of it—he too could have this life if it wasn’t for the pregnancy. He blames Sandra for it. He sleeps on the couch not because she forces him, but because he secretively does not like to be around her. They end up having two more children. 


Sandra wanted to go into marketing but stayed home with the baby and never started her career. The birth of their other two children made it nearly impossible to start a career because of the schedule, the fact she doesn’t have a working resume after college, and that she would need to retool to compete with younger applicants. Her children are no longer babies and although they love her, they don’t need to be coddled by her. She takes this subconsciously as a form of rejection. She feels unneeded and unloved. She becomes deeper and deeper involved with her church to fill the void. 


Though the children no longer are breastfed or need diapers changed, she wants to maintain her role as a nurturer. She tries to get the family to eat better. They reject the lentils and tofu, opting instead for junk. One day at the grocery store she picks up some Fiber One bars and the family *loves* them. She got them to eat more fiber! They ask what brand they are and where Sandra got them. She sees this as an opportunity to “win back” her kids and the respect of her husband. This is her open door. Without thinking she says that she made them. Her family is impressed and ask what the recipe is. She quickly makes up a name; they are her ""yummy scrumptious bars,” which is super cheesy but it is believable. Plus it makes her to be a down-home-cookin’ mom like the one she grew up with. This is just one little white lie, what could it hurt?


Her kids tell her she should enter them into the church bake cook-off. People at the church place their baked goods out to try and there is a basket for money (donations) by each treat. The basket with the most money wins. Sandra wins. She wins again a few months later. Her children are in 4-H and she hears that at the county fair there is a cooking competition *anyone* can enter. She enters the Fiber One “scrumptious bars” and takes first place. 


She now feels appreciated. She has accomplished something. She now has something to be proud of. The bars are the thing she is known for around town and the church—her only support network, the only place she has social capital.  Her kids show renewed interest in her and she feels as though she is a nurturer once again. Plus, her family is getting more fiber!!! The only problem is that her success is built on a lie. One little lie that grew and now defines her. She can’t give this up. 


Like an addict she sneaks and plans on how to get more Fiber One Bars without her family finding the wrappers or box. She puts them on baking sheets, gets ingredients, wakes up early where she can work in secret—anything to keep up the illusion. The problem is that her husband is not happy for her. He resents her notoriety and recognition for doing nothing more than baking chewy cookies. No one recognizes him, he isn’t successful nor does he have any accolades or prizes to post on the mantel.   


One night he gets drunk and falls asleep at about 730pm. Sandra thinks he will sleep through the night and it is the perfect opportunity to make more ""award winning homemade yummy scrumptious bars."" Unfortunately for her, he wakes up at about 4:30am and goes to the kitchen to get some water. He is still slightly drunk. He finds her with the Fiber One bars and knows he has caught her; she is a fraud and a phony. Her success, which he took as an insult to him, is nothing more than a charade. She isn’t better than him. In fact, he thinks she is worse. Fraudulence. This is his chance to get revenge at the imagined slight she has done to him. She tries to cover her tracks—""eat healthy, that’s all I wanted for the family."" But really, it was more than just about eating healthy. It was about college, her marketing career, her imperfect marriage, the kids growing older, the loss of companionship, the loss of friends, the loss of control of her life. She isn’t where she wanted to be, it wasn’t supposed to be like this—“All I wanted was to be happy. Fiber one helped me do that.” This is the interaction we see in the commercial. 

That morning he tells their kids about the Fiber One bars. He tells people at church when they ask Sandra about her yummy treats. He patronizes her. The kids joke about it too, but not in a mean way. She takes it as her world is collapsing to the depression, solitude, and low self worth she felt before the ordeal--before the little lie that got out of control. She only wanted her family to eat more fiber, not she is in deep. 


She cant take it. Her husband is emotionally absent, the kids are old enough to function without her, she no longer has her prize that defined her. She starts to cut herself on the thigh (no one will notice). On the night of her anniversary she has her mom watch the kids at her mom's house while she and her husband go out. They get home and have a few cocktails and he goes to sleeps while she stays up to ""check her email and facebook"". She goes into the bathroom, eats a bottle of Tylenol, and cries while she slowly fades out.

He is left alone not once, but twice, by his family.   

After the first time, his mother and father and family are all glad to see him, apologize, etc.  But then they lose him again only a year or so later, in *New York City* no less.   It is at this moment that Kevin comes to believe that humanity is, at its base, corrupt and that no one, not even one's own mother, can truly be trusted to be ""good.""

Each time Kevin's abode (his real home, or the one he sets up in in New York) is invaded by the Wet Bandits, he sets up extensive, tortuous, and sometimes even lethal traps.   Rather than run and hide, Kevin prefers to stand his ground and even seems, at some points, to *revel* in the pain and torment of two men who are, essentially, non-violent and unarmed. 

Kevin's expertise in setting up death traps with a wide array of materials, quickly, and in myriad places becomes both his modus operandi and his signature as the Jigsaw killer.

Consider, as well, Jigsaw's taunt.   ""I want to play a game...""   The word he uses to describe possible death, ""game,"" is indicative of a stunted development from childhood into adulthood.   Kevin's double instances of abandonment has marred him and robbed him of his childhood, and while I wouldn't say he is completely a child, it is undeniable that Jigsaw has child-like impulses.  

As I mentioned, in the first film, you could of course argue that Kevin is merely protecting himself, and his house and neighbourhood.    He saves the day, the Wet Bandits are arrested, etc.   But in the second film, Kevin intervenes when the Bandits are robbing the thrift store, and leads them on a chase to his uncle's house, where there are a variety of death traps (including electrocution) that await them.

Jigsaw killed people who he felt were ""wasting their lives.""   The Wet Bandits seem to have served their time, but are back to old habits.  Kevin, in Home Alone 2, when we might say he is beginning to fully come into his Jigsaw identity, in essence ""punishes"" Harry and Marv for their recidivism.

Kevin's penchant for talking to himself at great length, his inability to connect with other children (his family sees him as ""weird"" and he doesn't interact with any other children in either movies for any significant length of time) also point to a damaged child who might, given particular circumstances, descend into madness and violence.

Consider, as well, Kevin's choice of film.   A 10 year old might check out softcore pornography or cartoons or South Park, but Kevin instead watches film noir, a genre that includes over the top violence, vulgarity, anti-heroes, and social deviants.  

Kevin's intellect is also bolstered by his charm, and many serial killers and sociopaths, real and in fiction, are charming (Bundy, Dexter Morgan, etc.)   ""But he seemed so normal!""   Kevin also embodies this, as demonstrated by his various interactions with adults.  He is able to con himself into a room at an expensive hotel in New York on *Christmas Eve* by committing credit card fraud.

The desk clerk, the concierge, the bellhop, Mr. Duncan the toyshop owner—these adults, when they confront Kevin, are made to doubt themselves. Kevin manipulates them offhandedly and unnecessarily, which demonstrates a grandiose ego and a startling lack of empathy for others.

On one level, sure.  He's scared, he's alone.  His lying is self-preservation, on some level.   But Kevin slides into the whole situation with a frightening ease.  He doesn't hide in the hotel and try to find his parents, he orders an entire pizza and rides in a limousine and eats sundaes.    He doesn't even really seem interested in finding them for most of the movie.

So, in summary (*tl;dr*), what we have in Home Alone &amp; Home Alone 2 is the descent of a troubled, but kind-hearted kid into psychopathy and violence.   The young man known as Kevin McCallister makes it his personal mission to torture or ""punish"" people for their transgressions, just as he did with the Wet Bandits in Home Alone 2.    He becomes the Jigsaw killer.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1axqsc,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1axqsc/kevin_mccallister_home_alone_home_alone_2_grows/,

Starfleet is concerned with exploration and scientific research.  The uniforms and basic jump suits. Some crew members, like Hoshi, aren't even that skilled with the basic hand weapon, just given a commission because they are the best at what they do.  The evidence of Starfleet's long term plans for the NX program being that the first two ships, Enterprise and Columbia, were also the names of the first two space shuttles.  Non-military science programs.  The ranks are mostly ceremonial, again, with Hoshi, given a basic commission so she can work on the Enterprise bridge where the captain will need someone with her skills.  The only one who seems to be expecting a military atmosphere is Lt. Reed, who is also the only one who seems to know how to work any of the weapons, even the basic phase pistol.

Post Xindi attack on Earth: Space Marines are posted to the Enterprise, a new military discipline mind set has taken over with the Starfleet personnel being trained in hand to hand combat by the Maco leadership.  After the Xindi threat is over with, the Macos remain on board.  In the finale to Enterprise, something that takes place years later, a new uniform is seen for the Starfleet personnel, something that looks more military.  Possible that the new uniform style was issued in what would have been Enterprise's fifth season.

TOS Era:

Politically, the galaxy has calmed down.  Given that there was a Romulan War and a Klingon War, the main powers might be in a period of reconstruction.  Starfleet has returned to exploration and a strong scientific research program.  The uniform is a solid color shirt and black slacks.  The ranks are again, just loose and largely unimportant since promotions are rare events.  

Star Trek TMP: The uniforms are awful looking jump suits, professionalism is at an all time low, resulting in a poorly constructed ship with non-working transporters and messed up warp engines.  Ranks still don't matter given that Decker's complaint about getting knocked down to Commander but that he lost command of the Enterprise.

TWOK: The Klingons have become more active following the destruction of three of their ships to V'Ger.  Starfleet, aware that war with the Klingons is quite likely, have return to a military theme.  The new uniforms are very military influenced, rank is now rather important, Starfleet academy is focusing on the military aspects of Starfleet.  

Star Treks 3-5: The Klingons have escalated in light of what they view is a Federation doomsday weapon that can wipe them out in one shot.  

Post Star Trek Generations and between 'Encounter at Farpoint': Peace with the Klingons have been achieved and the Romulans have gone back to their side of the Neutral Zone (Data explained in TNG ""The Neutral Zone"" that the Romulans had not made contact with the Federation in almost 80 years.  Even though the Enterprise C was destroyed 20 years before the first season of TNG, the Federation was unaware of the ship's fate.  Picard explains that the ship was lost and until he meets Tasha's half Romulan daughter he was still completely unaware of the Enterprise C's fate), another era of peace has hit.  We can see in flashbacks to before TNG's first season, such as 'Tapestry' where the uniform is changing, become more lax.  The turtle neck is gone and the jacket looks almost like a lower quality suit and when we see Jack Crusher in the episode ""Family"" the belt is now gone and the Starfleet insignia has been replaced with what we saw from TWOK and replaced with the oval back TNG communicator.  Once again, the military aspects has been phased out in favor of the science and exploration programs again.

TNG seasons 1-3: Focus on Science and exploration.  Ranking system is back to just a loose system where those who operate in key positions are placed there for being the best, not by rank (which is why LaForge is the Chief Engineer and how Worf is rather low in rank but the Tactical officer).  Even with the Romulans making their presence known, there is still some peace in the galaxy.  Starfleet is so dedicated to peaceful long term exploration and science that families are allowed on ship and ships are expected to be out on missions that last years until they return to Earth.

TNG season 4+: After Wolf 359 and the Federation's near assimilation by the Borg, Starfleet starts to indefinitely abandon their exploration program and the military program returns.  The Federation experiments with a new starship design, the Defiant, a pure combat vessel.  Ranks are no longer just ceremonial things, but now they once again matter.

DS9 season 3: Dominion threat is established, Defiant program, which was abandoned returns

Generations: The uniform variant seen in TNG season one is phased out for the uniform seen in DS9 and Voyager since it has a stronger military look over the TNG uniform. 

Star Trek: First Contact: More combat vessels are commissioned, such as the Sovereign, Akira, Steamrunner, Nova and Norway class ships.  Families are no longer allowed on ship.  Uniform has become the black and grey uniform, another military themed uniform.  All officers are better trained in both hand phasers and rifles.  

Insurrection: The needs of the military and the state allow the Federation to think nothing of forcefully removing the Ba'ku and destroying their planet.

25th century when Janeway returns to the past: Uniforms are less professional looking hinting that the Federation is at another period of peace.  ",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1jgsbx,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1jgsbx/star_trek_starfleet_uniform_changes_and_ranks_in/,
1370708141.0,271,self.FanTheories,1fxj9r,Futurama - Why Bender will lead the Robot Uprising and why Cubert can stop him,343,72,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1fxj9r/futurama_why_bender_will_lead_the_robot_uprising/,"(Before I begin, I do realize that this will be a wall of text, but please bare with me. Also: SPOILERS, be aware.)


Earlier, u/death_to_all_humans ignited [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1fum5l/futurama_did_bender_actually_manage_to_kill_all/) discussion about the robot uprising where he argued that the robots did terminate humans in the end. I've been thinking about this for a while (and since I was going to post this sooner or later, I might as well post it now when it's relevant), and I believe the robot-uprising will have a different ending. Here is what I believe is the cause of the uprising and how it will end:



In the episode ""Decision 3012"", we learn that in the near future (near the year 3012), the robots will make an uprising, lead by Bender, and take over Earth. One man, Senator Travers, finds the time-travel code and travels back in time to stop Nixon from being reelected and thus preventing the uprising, but this created a paradox which undid everything Travers had accomplished, which means that the uprising in inevitable.


As I mentioned, the uprising is lead by Bender. Why? Bender is just an average bending unit, and not a unique one either, so how could he become the leader of all robots? I believe he is chosen as a leader for the following reasons:


* He is the leader of The League of Robots. In the movie ""The Beast with a Billion Backs"", Bender's passion for killing humans is what eventually takes him to the top of The League of Robots. This position alone was enough for him to become the robot-leader once all humans left for the other universe. He was also able to organize a revenge and take the humans back to our universe.


* Bender is the only one who has a free-will unit, the only free-will unit. In the episode ""Free Will Hunting"", It's revealed that Farnsworth created a ""free-will unit"" that allows robots to gain true free will, which allows them to break their programmed behavior. 



having a free-will unit might not sound as impressive, but it's probably a lot more important than being a member of the League of Robots. If we look at the episode ""free-will hunting"", it's shown that the free-will device has some religious significance within the world of robots (robotology?). Given that Bender is the one with the device, his status will probably be raised to the level of a demigod. Since all robots are programmed to not being able to touch the free-will device (because Farnsworth made it so), it's technically impossible for a robot to steal the device from Bender. the only way Bender could get rid of it would be if he removed it himself, but then no one, Bender included, would be able to take it up again. The free will unit must stay in Benders head for them to have a chance.



Now when bender is in no need of his programming, he is no longer under human control. This means that he no longer has to take part when Mom calls for the robots to fight for her, and no programming can prevent him from harming her. Given that Bender possesses free will and is the leader of the League of Robots, I believe that it's likely that Bender kills mom to prevent her from taking over the robots, and then he uses his new status as leader of the league and free will demigod to rule his robot minions.



But the episode ""Free Will Hunting"" also revealed a lot about the programming of Robots. It's revealed that to prevent Mom to use the device to her evil will, Prof. Farnsworth hid the device and programmed all robots to not being able to pick it up (which I already discussed). He also programmed the robots to not being able to kill him. This might be because mom revealed her intentions to him, and thus he might have realized that a robot uprising is inevitable, so he protected himself and perhaps some others. If he had programmed them to not kill anyone, Mom would have found out and deleted that programming, but by making it less noticeable it would ensure some to be saved. This programming might be what eventually saves humanity. Depending on how exactly he programmed the robots to not kill him, it's likely that other people will also be immune to the robots' wrath. As I see it, there are three potential ways Farnsworth could have programmed the robots to identify whom they can't kill:


1. He could have programmed the robots to spare a few specific individuals. In this case, he chose those to be saved himself. These are probably very limited, and most likely only includes him, Mom, her children and a few more.

2. He could have programmed the robots to spare all related to those specific individuals. This would use DNA to identify relatives, which would be useful because it would protect those who are not identified as relatives and could save more lives. for example, this would save Fry even though the professor hadn't met him yet.

3. He only made himself immune. I find this unlikely because Mom probably have made herself immune as well, but we can't really say that this isn't the case.


This gives us a few individuals that are likely to be immune from being killed by robots. Some of them are certain, others depend on how he programmed the robots.


* **Prof. Farnsworth.** We have seen him being immune from being shot by Bender, so this needs no further evidence. However, he is probably about to go to the ""near death star"", so he might not be able to help during the uprising.


* **Mom.** It's almost certain that she ordered the professor to make her immune, and because they were in love, I don't see a reason for him to not do so.

* **Mom's children**. They are her servants and she has probably made them immune, partially because she needs them but also because it makes sense to protect your loved ones. They are protected no matter if the professor used option 1 or 2.


* **Philip J. Fry**. If the professor used option 2, Fry would be immune as well. On top of that, the Niblonians are likely to protect Fry (perhaps even abducting him for his safety) in case he is in danger.


However, this one I can almost promise you will be immune:


* **Cubert Farnsworth**. No matter if the robots identify by DNA or legal identity, Cubert will be identified as Prof. Farnsworth (like in the episode ""over-clockwise"" where the professor and Cubert got saved from a sentence by legally being the same person). Even if the professor chose to only make him immune, Cubert (which is both legally and genetically the same person) would be immune as well.


So in other words, Cubert can't be harmed by no robot...except for Bender. Bender, with the free-will unit, is the only one that can harm Cubert. On the other hand, Cubert is almost immune from all harm. Given that Cubert is considered a genius at the age of 12, he will probably play a great role in the human resistance. A standoff between Bender and Cubert is inevitable, and considering that Cubert (who will probably be between the ages 20 and 30 years old at the time) probably has the same ability of creating doomsday devices as his father, might save humanity.


If Cubert kills Bender, the free will unit is lost and he becomes immortal. So, in order to stop the robots, Cubert will either have to kill Bender or remove the free-will unit. If he succeed is so far unknown, but considering Cubert's intelligence, I would assume he does.



TL;DR:

Bender becomes the leader of the robot uprising by leading the League of Robots and possessing the free will unit. Cubert, who essentially is Hubert Farnsworth, will be immune from robots killing him and can only be killed by Bender. A standoff between the two is inevitable, but I assume Cubert will win with his superior intelligence and ability to create machines.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,1370711501.0,,,True,t3_1fxj9r,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1fxj9r/futurama_why_bender_will_lead_the_robot_uprising/,

- She owns a Dreamhouse, plenty of cars (most notably a Sports Car)

- She is very youthful in appearance, has a boyfriend and a little sister, so she is probably rather young.


So she has been able to take on careers as diverse as Surgeon to Astronaut, which would mean she has an MD, and most likely a PhD as well as years of military service, which she does. She's also a politician, in the form of a diplomat and even becoming President of the USA. She also excels in the arts and sports.

     A.  Both Namekians and Kai's have pointed ears. 

 Now, this could easily be attributed to the fact that there are probably thousands of species in the universe with pointed ears.  However, how many are actually portrayed, or pointed out as having them as the Kai's and Namekians are?  Especially in the Maajin Buu Saga.

     B. Both the lower level Kai's and Namekians have antennae.  
   Again, another physiological difference that could most likely be explained away.  And again, how many bipedal/ humanoid lifeforms are presented in the universe?

     C.  Both the Kai's and Namekians are able to detect events going on across incredible distances.  

Multiple episodes show King Kai using his antennae to discover what is happening across not only vast cosmic distances, but across the planes of life an death.  And multiple episodes show the Namekians detecting changes on planets extremely far away.  Not just special Namekians, either, but the entire population, can detect what is happening on Earth, despite the vast distance between our planets.

     D.  Every Guardian in the series has been Namekian.

Both Kame and Dende are Namekian, and Grand Elder Guru is the Guardian of Namek.  These beings are entrusted with the security of their planets, and also contain special powers that cannot be taught to anyone else.  

     E.  The Namekians are the only ones capable of creating and sustaining the Dragonballs.

Pretty self explanatory.  The Kai's are the only other race capable of sustaining/ unleashing a power like this

     F.  Both the Kai's and the Namekians are capable of materialization/ energy manipulation 

Both the Kai's and Namekians are able to create clothing, food, Crystal Balls, and other objects from nothing.  They are also the only races able to unleash unused/ unrealized energy from within an individual to reach a higher potential.

There are probably more reasons that I haven't thought of here, and more that I haven't seen.  But I think it is pretty self evident that the Kai's either created the Namekians to serve as their mortal overseers, or that the Namekians evolved from the Kai's somehow to become mortal and part of the Realm of the Living",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1h3kez,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1h3kez/dbz_universe_the_namekians_are_the_lowest_level/,

Whenever Link encounters Sheik, he teaches him an Ocarina melody then throws a Deku nut and disappears with a flash.

However, I think he doesn't immediately disappear. I think Link is actually stunned for several seconds, during which Sheik has plenty of time to leave normally; Link is just unaware of the passage of time because of the effects of the stun. It is how Deku nuts work against Link's enemies, after all.

Some supporting evidence for this, if you could call it that - watch the scene after Sheik teaches Link the Bolero of Fire. He creates a wall of fire to prevent Link from approaching him, then uses a Deku nut. The fire is suddenly gone after the flash. Usually other instances of ""magically created"" fire in the game at least spend a second or two shrinking before going out, rather than just suddenly being gone. This implies that the fire took a little while to disappear, and Link was unconscious for that time.

It seems the Oracle's words to Trinity were a lot more set in stone than what we see the Oracle tell Neo. Trinity is told that she will fall in love with the one. 

Enter Neo, who shows he is pretty skillful in the Matrix. I would put him at a level slightly above Morpheus, powerful enough to give one Agent Smith a good fight but by no means close to what he can do down the track. At this stage in the movie he is not the one.

So Neo is getting chased by the Smith and his cronies, he opens the door to what should lead to an exit. Smith is waiting on the other side and puts a handful of rounds into Neo, killing him right there. At this point in the real world, Neo's death causes Trinity to qualify her love for him. Because we know that Trinity will fall in love with the one, the fact that Neo is dead is a logical fallacy (Neo is Trinity's ""one"") and the Matrix then recovers and compensates by bringing Neo back to life. Neo is now able to ""do the things he does"".

I believe Trinity has the position of power over who the one is. I think that if Neo had died without Trinity choosing him, she would have eventually fallen for with someone else - giving that person the powers of the one. The Oracle's words to Neo by no means made him the one, but they set him on the path that allowed him to win Trinity's heart.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1hbuyg,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1hbuyg/trinity_made_neo_the_one/,

Reptar is, obviously, based on the classic Japanese monster Godzilla. Any film or Godzilla fan will tell you that the king of all monsters was created in response to nuclear war, especially since Japan had the atomic bombs dropped on them in WWII - not to mention the only country to have them used upon. Reptar is supposed to be the opposition of nuclear war because of the effects that it can have on human life.

The Dummy Bears, to put it bluntly, is basically a show of brainwashing governmental propaganda. Although they are loosely based on ""Carebears"" they are over bent on being ""happy"" as well as ignorant. For instance, take the Dummy Bears annoying jingle:

Lyrics: ""Sing a happy happy happy happy happy happy song! Sing a happy happy happy happy happy happy song! Sing a happy happy happy happy happy happy song! Sing a happy happy happy happy happy happy song! Sing a happy happy happy happy happy happy song! Sing a happy happy happy happy happy happy song! Sing a happy happy happy happy happy happy song! Sing a happy happy happy happy happy happy song! Sing a happy happy happy happy happy happy song! Sing a happy happy happy happy happy happy song! Sing a happy happy happy happy happy happy song!""

When I heard the song in Rugrats, I thought back to the episode where the Rugrats go to the bowling alley and the baby sitter puts on the Dummy Bears to distract them. Their song hypnotizes many of the babies and takes a lot of force to snap them out of it. However, by the end of the episode, Angelica does not snap out of it. 

Angelica also represents governmental propaganda because she is always telling the babies what to do. She tries to invoke them with fear for her own benefit and tries to control them from it. However, she is always foiled by the babies because they are creative and innovative thinkers. This of which, Angelica does not approve of. 

For example: in the episode of Angelica's Secret Club, she only wants to associate with Tommy and compares Chucky to Sadam Hussein. There are many examples of Angelica trying to control the babies and disapproving of when they think for themselves.

I think I covered the rebuttals, shoot me a [PM](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=crazybay46913) if you think I should add something. Thanks for the thoughtful discussion, everyone!*

In the [introduction](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x17r-EDM98) of Disney's Beauty and the Beast, we are told that the beast was cursed for being spoiled, selfish, and unkind. This is exemplified in his unwillingness to allow the old woman to stay in his castle in exchange for a rose.

The beast was being perfectly reasonable to deny her, and it becomes obvious when we examine the situation.

* The Beast is 10 years old. 
    
    -&gt;The curse is supposed to end when he turns twenty one, meaning that he is 20 for the bulk of the movie.
    
    -&gt;Lumiare claims that they have been cursed for [10 years](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plA2pllRWR4&amp;t=1m55s).

       ~~~Rebuttal: Everyone's aging process froze for the 10 years they were cursed ([credit](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/16sgqs/disneys_beauty_the_beast_the_enchantress_that/c7yz2ka) and [credit](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/16sgqs/disneys_beauty_the_beast_the_enchantress_that/c7z09h0)).

* The beast was an orphan. 

    -&gt;Assuming he lives alone with his servants and with out parents is reasonable because they are never mentioned throughout the production. 

       ~~~Rebuttal: Not rebutted or regarded as relevant to the discussion by all commenters (oops).

* No one actually asks their national leader (prince) if they can sleepover.

    -&gt;Imagine if a hobo were to ask permission to sleep in the white house. Imagine if Obama was the one actually answered the door! That doesn't happen. I bet even the mayor of most towns wouldn't do it. Hell, *I* wouldn't let a strange homeless person sleep in my house, and I don't have a 10 year old kid!

       ~~~Rebuttal: Standards were different back then. No one was worried that people were out to do evil to kids. [Credit](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/16sgqs/disneys_beauty_the_beast_the_enchantress_that/c7yxom5) (the whole thread). The boy rejected the old woman, not because he was afraid, but because he thought that he was too good to be talking to her, to a greater extreme she was unfit to sleep on his personal propertiy ([credit](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/16sgqs/disneys_beauty_the_beast_the_enchantress_that/c7yypl6)). 

The Beast did what any 10 year old kid would be advised to do and told the lady (who turned out to be evil) that she couldn't sleep in his castle. He grows up resenting the fact that he tried to do the right thing and develops a mean personality. 

I realize that this is more of an observation than a fan theory, but I wanted to share it with someone.

This is part of an evolutionary track towards ""highly advanced reality warping energy beings"" that you often see in sci-fi.

This is the basic ability of Scarlet Witch- to alter reality with her mind.  Seems a bit overpowered compared to other mutants, no?  And then you have mutants like Ice Man who can do anything with ice- but don't seem particularly bothered by the laws of thermodynamics.  In fact, the only real limitation seems to be that powers match personality.

From this, we get the reason for all these conveniently themed characters: Why Pyro is, well, a pyro and Sabretooth is the wild beast he is.  The powers are in fact an extension of personality.  Magneto's power tends to fluctuate with his understanding of electromagnetism because understanding how reality ""normally"" works makes him that much better at convincing it to bend towards his will.  

This is also why Wolverine will pretty much always be plagued by amnesia- his mutation (nigh-impossible healing factor) basically tells reality, ""I exist, I live, all the time.""  Reality complies as best it can; however, time in the Marvel Universe isn't exactly concrete.  The past is often in as much flux as the future; for Wolvie to have *always* existed, he must always, in-universe, be retconned into ""having been there.""  Hence the amnesia- Logan can't remember his past because the universe itself isn't sure what happened.  

(Amusingly, Deadpool's mutation is a variant- rather than ""I live, always,"" he tells reality, ""I'm like Logan,"" and as a result we get the lovable court-jester popularity whore we know today.  This makes a fair bit of sense when you remember that he got his mutation through a blood transplant- he and Wolverine are literally cut from the same cloth.)

This is also how X-Men, Magneto, and other mutants manage to be so improbably long-lived.  By constantly training, fighting, and refining their mutant abilities, they develop a sort of iron will, a minor variant of Wolverine's power by which they refuse to die.

So Mirror's Edge takes place in a version of Assassin's Creed where the Templars have largely won. The assassins are all but extinct, with their creed and their methods existing only in a watered down version (the Runners). Faith, a descendant of Altair, is one of the most gifted of the runner's, and her heritage also explains why the Security firm, which is another front for the Templars, takes special interest in her and her sister.

Aside from the obvious ""they both do parkour"" junk, there are several parallels between the two game. 

First, both games center around nearly superhuman characters doing impossible things.

like Abstergo in the AC, in mirror's edge the antagonist is a mysterious corporation whose main goal seems to be the total control of society.

The runners, like the assassins, work in the fringes of society, doing what they can to prevent the total control of society
smaller society fighting against control.

Mirror's Edge ends without a clear denouncement, possibly hinting to a deeper plot (the Templars) to be discovered.

Both were men who were on the brink of self-destruction (RDJ) or death (Stark) and came back to the world stronger than ever, with a weapon no one saw coming (RDJ had the Iron Man movie, Stark had the suit). RDJ/Stark have enjoyed the vast success that the weapon has given them, but after The Avengers, both feel as if it's preventing them from being who they want to be. RDJ feels typecast, while Stark feels like he's nothing without the armor. 

The movie is set during Christmas, which represents a birth (or rebirth, if you will). The movie is directed by Shane Black, the man who gave RDJ a path back into Hollywood (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, for reference).

Both men fear that they can only recreate their one success: RDJ is afraid that all he'll ever be able to do is make the Iron Man movie over and over again, with only slight differences; while Stark is living in fear, and all he can do is recreate the same machine over and over again, with only slight differences. The movie ends with Stark removing the symbol of his rebirth and throwing it away. I think the line about how he'll always be Iron Man is from RDJ, not Stark.

Even the Mandarin ties into this: a complete badass who is just an actor, who only wanted to prove to the world he could act, so he immersed himself in the only role he could get (or in RDJ's case, the role that he was born for).

**edit:** glad you guys are diggin' this. My feelings (and Gary Jr's) about IM3 were pretty mixed, and this was the conversation that came out of it.

John McTiernan's 'Die Hard' (1988)

On the surface, Die Hard is a straightforward action flick in which our hero (complete with his own full hero's journey) John McClane, rescues his wife from terrorists that have taken over the Nakatomi Plaza. The terrorists ride in on Christmas eve, take the employees hostage, kill Takagi and Ellis, outsmart the cops and the feds, and do their best to get away with about 600 million in bonds, but are stopped by our modern day cowboy, the aforementioned John McClane.

As great as the film works in this straight up popcorn manner, no really good movie exists soley on the surface.

**SUBTEXTUAL LAYER #1:**

There is a lot going on in the first subtextual layer of this film. There are lots of themes in motion: religion (christmas), strong family values (save marriage), conservatives vs liberals (drugs, sexuality), east coast vs west coast ideals (new york vs california), homosexuality (man kissing John McClane, particular shots of the well built german terrorists, bromance between 'pal' and 'roy'), anti-establishment thoughts (cops and feds are idiots), etc. However, the one I want to focus on the most, and the one that ties into the title is the theme of anti-capitalism.

This theme of anti-capitalism in Die Hard has been talked about before. The movie doesn't try to hide it. It is satirical and cynical in its depiction of the Nakatomi businessmen. Typical 'classical' music is played the first time we see the Nakatomi party (satirically, I believe). Champagne is being passed around (our hero rejects this drink after one taste), a man comes and kisses John for no reason, Ellis is shown as being a cocksure drug addict, Takagi is shown as being very greedy (just look in that vault - who would hide such beautiful art away in a corner like that), and even Holly McClane, our heroes wife, has been slightly corrupted - she goes by Miss Gennaro now. John McClane must save his wife from being corrupted by capitalism. He has to save her from Nakatomi Plaza. Note that the ultimate payoff is the scene where Holly loses her gold rolex (capitalism symbol) and kills Hans in the process.

**SUBTEXTUAL LAYER #2:**

This is where things get interesting, and where I get to my point. When the terrorists take over Nakatomi Plaza, they are actually just subtextually or subconsciously replacing Takagi. Takagi is the real 'terrorist' of the story. And the terrorists (Hans, Karl, etc) are just Takagi in a different skin. They are a cinematic or narrative convention that allows the story to have an acceptable and exciting villain. 

However, the film goes to great lengths to show us that they do indeed represent Takagi. The reason they are able to kill him off so quickly is that they take his role. Let me try and explain through quotes from the script:

&gt;ELLIS:    
&gt;Hey, business is business. You use
&gt;a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's
&gt;the difference?

Ellis says this to the terrorists when he tries to befriend them. The line equates capitalists to terrorists. It plants the seed of the interchangeability between the 'eurotrash' terrorists and the businessmen of Nakatomi Plaza. 

&gt;HANS:    
&gt;Nice suit. John Philips...London?
&gt;I have two myself.
&gt;I'm told Arafat shops there too...

Hans says this to Takagi when he notices how nice Takagi's suit is. It again shows the similarities between the terrorists in our story and the businessmen. Notice the name drop of Arafat as well; another connection. 


Ok so those lines really only help plant the seed. Nothing of true consequence was said yet. Here comes the meat. 


&gt;TAKAGI:    
&gt;(defensively)
&gt;This is what this is about? Our
&gt;building project in Indonesia?
&gt;Contrary to what you people think,
&gt;we're going to develop that
&gt;region... not 'exploit' it.


Takagi says this as Hans notices and comments on his model of some highway/park plan. This scene sets up the idea that Takagi and his business are going into random places in the world and destroying the present infrastructure. Kind of like a terrorist would do.


&gt;TAKAGI:    
&gt;You want...money? What kind of
&gt;terrorists are you?

&gt;HANS:    
&gt;(amused)
&gt;Who said we were terrorists?

Takagi says this as he realizes the true motivations of Hans and his German wild bunch. Takagi himself realizes that the terrorists aren't even true terrorists, they just want some cash, like any respectable businessman does.

&gt;HOLLY:    
&gt;(to Hans, scornfully)
&gt;After all your posturing, all your
&gt;speeches...you're nothing but a
&gt;common thief.

Holly now realizes the same thing.

**GENERAL NOTES:**

* The employees turn into 'hostages' when the terrorists take over. But I think they were actually hostages all along. The switch from Takagi to Hans just made it more apparent. Same situation, new titles.
* John is the first one that does true damage to the building. He throws the chair bomb down the elevator shaft because he knows Nakatomi Plaza has to be destroyed. The true villain the whole time was Nakatomi/Takagi/Capitalism.
* During the 'ultimate payoff' scene where Holly loses her golden watch, note that her being stripped of that capitalism icon also kills Hans at the exact same time. That is because Hans isn't just a terrorist. He is Takagi. Letting go of the watch helps Holly let go of Ellis/Takagi/Money and return to John and her family. After this scene they are shown embracing each other and punching news anchors etc. Happy ending. 

**CONCLUSION**

So, based on the above ideas, if the film is viewed through the lens of subtext layer #2, it is actually a movie about a man helping his wife to quit a job that is ruining her and breaking up their family.

edit: So I could have picked a better title for sure. By saying that Takagi and Ellis were the real terrorists, what I mean is that there were no terrorists at all - everything in the story is just John McClane dealing with Takagi and his company/building (subtextually of course - I'm not saying it was a dream/hallucination).

Capcom has never explained what happened to classic Megaman in between the classic series and the X series, he's just gone and never really mentioned.

But you actually think about X and why would Light create him in the first place.
The special thing about X is that he's the first robot who can think for himself and make decisions not limited by programming, unlike the original Megaman who was still somewhat bound by programming in terms of personality.

So X was suppose to be a revolutionary break though in robotics that blurred the lines between human and robot, but why would Light give him advance weaponry? If you were going to make a new robot capable of human thought and emotion, why would you also give it lethal weapons? Wouldn't you give it human limitations to better blend into society and accepted by the populace?

The only reason Light upgraded Rock into Megaman was to defeat Dr. Wily and the reprogrammed robot masters, and he was damn good at doing it. So why would he make a new upgraded Megaman? Especially considering Rock was practically his son I don't see him flat out replacing him, so something had to happen to the original Megaman.

Now if Rock WAS still around, Light wouldn't have need to make this revolutionary robot into a weapon, and if Rock was simply defeated by an enemy wouldn't it make sense to just make another Megaman instead of making X which wouldn't even be complete for 30+ years?

Light must of had a specific reason to make X what he was, a weapon with a conscious, but why?

If you look back to Megaman 7s ending you can see a rather darker side of Megaman http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAvnq_7LKbo
In earlier games he very trusting and forgiving, but over time he grows such a resentment to Wily he is driven to nearly killing him, when at other times before he hated fighting and only wanted peace.

So my theory is that eventually Megaman DID end up killing Wily after so many attempts at world domination, that was the turning point that  changed him. As evident in that video link above Megaman says he should have killed Wily years ago, so it's plausible to believe that he's be untrusting and unforgiving to any new criminals that might show up,  
ending it before it got out of hand like Wily.
Megaman is a robot above all else, he follows his programming and that's it. He's suppose to be a peace keeper, a protector and vigilante that does whatever it takes to protect the world. So after being pushed to edge so many times he learns to not trust these criminals less they trick him and cause more bloodshed.

So eventually someone would have to step in and take care of the Megaman problem, either have him deactivated or destroyed.

So now Megaman is gone but the world still needs a protector, but not wanting to repeat another Megaman incident he decides to to make a new robot, one that isn't bound by programming.

Megamans descent into a ruthless vigilante that takes the law into his own hands was from his warped idea what it took to protect people, his programming directive.

X wouldn't have this problem because he'd have empathy, he'd know what's too much and what's the moral thing to do.

So Megaman X was created because the original Megaman was a failure with a major design flaw, a lack of empathy.

Apologies for lack of citations. I'm going off memory here. To be fair I've seen every episode dozens of times thanks to my 13 year-old self's strange obsession.

---

**Facts first:**  

* All Irkens wear a ""PAK"", which appears to be a general-purpose life support system and multi-tool device. It is attached to infant Irkens seconds after birth and (according to an unproduced episode script) may even house their consciousness to an extent.
* Zim appears to be a complete imbecile. He's loud, annoying, has zero common sense and comes up with absolutely insane solutions for simple problems. He fails time and time again to follow basic orders and is so inept at his job that his direct superiors wish to kill him.
* Despite all this, *Zim never dies*. In fact he comes incredibly close to succeeding in several attempts to conquer the Earth, *even though he was assigned that planet as a suicide mission.* Even the Tallest frequently express surprise that he's still alive. Zim is, in spite of all evidence to the contrary, an immensely resourceful and skilled individual. And judging by his ability to cobble together complex machines out of essentially nothing, run successful bio-engineering experiments, and make effective use of a robot which runs on literal paperclips one might even go so far as to call him a genius.

**The theory:**

So if Zim is a genius, how did he end up so undeniably crazy? The answer is his PAK. We have no idea what the PAKs really are or where they come from, only that they're essential to modern Irken life and are controlled by a central artificial intelligence. (As seen when Zim is reassigned to the role of frycook.) Were these systems made by the Irkens? Or were they introduced by some other race? Perhaps they started out as a sort of simple body enhancement, but gradually added features until the devices became the all-encompassing network we see in the show. This would explain why the Irken elite seem to be so incredibly stupid yet still manage to run an empire. *They* aren't actually conquering anything - it's their PAKs, and by extension their supercomputers, which do all the work. Whoever built the original technology seems to have done so with the intention of creating a race of mindless slaves with which to rule the galaxy.

Now what happens when an incredibly intelligent individual is fitted with what is essentially a mind-control device? Do they ever rebel? Does the technology force them into subservience somehow? Could this lead to madness? Of course we could argue that Zim's PAK is simply a malfunctioning model, rendering him insane through some techno-glitch, but that's too easy. Because while that is a definite possibility, there's also Tak to consider.

Tak is, in every way we can see, on an equal or near-equal level to Zim intellectually. She manages to survive as a renegade, takes control of a weenie empire without anyone noticing, and nearly conquers the Earth. However she is also just as mentally unstable as Zim is. She's sadistic, revenge-driven and psychotically melodramatic (as, granted, nearly everyone is in this show but whatever). Beyond her we can look at other Irkens and see roughly this same pattern. Red and Purple seem intelligent enough, yet they devolve into childish antics and obsess over snacks when they aren't busy being ruthless psychopathic tyrants. The Invader army seems more concerned with nachos than actually getting anything done. Skoodge follows orders to his death, continually forgiving his superiors for getting him killed, and even willingly defers to Zim... and yet of all the named Irkens we see he seems to be the happiest and most well-adjusted. Is that because he's an idiot?

For unnamed Irkens we have the ones on Foodcourtia to look at. The grunts and fast-food workers. All of whom, somehow, seem halfway sensible and normal. It's only the high-ranking or very clever Irkens who behave like complete nutjobs. Why?

One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that, due to the influence of the Irken PAKs, the more intelligent an individual is the more insane they'll be driven. This may even be a gradual process - we learn in Tak's debut episode that Zim once held a position in weapons development. In the Foodcourtia episode he was reassigned from the role of Invader to Frycook *only after* exploding half the Irken army. Why was he given so much responsibility in the first place, if he's always been insane? Was he once a rational, perhaps even a highly-competent individual? Was he once *normal*?

We're led to the possibility that Zim may have been slowly losing his mind throughout his entire life. He speaks of having been flying ships since before Dib was born. This would make him at least 25-30 years old, possibly much older. (I vaguely recall reading an explanation of Irken timescales that put him in his 50s by Earth standards.) This isn't simply a show about a crazy alien goofball. It's about a broken supergenius. Zim is a man who's spent decades having his sanity eroded piece by piece while losing none of his intellect in the process. And once he'd finally cracked to the point of no longer being useful he was cast away into the depths of space by his own people to die.

But even then he doesn't give up. He just keeps on trying to impress his superiors, keeps failing, and fights epic space battles with a young child. (Who, by the way, he *never* kills. He has multiple opportunities to destroy Dib with little effort yet never does. A scrap of mercy left untouched by madness, perhaps? Does he see a bit of himself in Dib? Or does he just value having a worthy adversary?) Suddenly instead of an insane, unsympathetic monstrous imp Zim becomes a rather surprisingly tragic figure. Losing himself to the technology he's forced to rely on to live while never abandoning the only goal that gives him purpose.

---

**Gratuitously dramatic alternate theory:**

Zim and Tak were both rebel fighters in a movement attempting to overthrow the tyranny of the height-based class system and imperial military complex of Irk. Unable to win a losing battle against the might of the Irken army they eventually chose to sacrifice themselves for the greater good of the galaxy. They allowed themselves to be captured and their PAKs re-integrated into the larger system for reprogramming.

Unbeknownst to the Irken elite, however, the rebel forces had secretly infected their own PAKs with a devastating, sanity-destroying virus. It spread through the network, targeting military leaders first while sparing the lower-level grunts. By the time of the show nearly every high-ranking Irken soldier has been subjected to the effects of this virus. Zim, being the first carrier, is the furthest gone. Tak is close behind. Eventually the entire Irken race will be driven mad enough to destroy themselves through ineptitude, saving the galaxy from total conquest. Zim is secretly a hero to all free races.

We see this in the episode in which Dwight tries pitching an idea to Robert California, and Gabe puts him down with relish, because at last he is the one in the position of power. But at other times, when he is particularly weak, the murders are a way for him to get that rush, that utter control over someone else's life. (I think the fact he strangles his victims also relates to this: it's a very deliberate action in which he decides exactly when his victim dies, as opposed to, say, shooting them.)

-True, the Strangler was caught and executed, but Toby revealed that he had misgivings about the man's guilt after the trial.

Just wanted to see if I could get any feedback.

Before reading this realize that the movie Inglorious Bastards takes place in the Spring of 1944, before the Invasion of Normandy...

The decapitation of the Nazi regime shown in Inglorious Bastards throws Europe in to chaos as a civil war starts between the SS, the Wehrmacht, and all the resistance groups. It starts when the conspirators of the 20 July plot (Operation Valkyrie) leap in to action and seize power in Germany and France under the leadership of Rommel and von Stauffenberg. SS troops are arrested across the Reich, but there are enough of them that it turns into a civil war. 

The new German government surrenders unconditionally to the US and Britain, ordering all troops to return to the pre-War borders. This emboldens resistance groups across Europe. A mass uprising occurs as German officials are gunned down in occupied territories. Concentration camps and slave labor factories are liberated by resistance fighters and everyone strong enough to carry a gun is armed and joins the fight. The Nuremberg trials don't happen because nearly all the surviving Nazi officials and camp guards are hunted down and killed by roving bands of revenge seekers.

In Warsaw the Polish Resistance starts Operation Tempest early and seizes the city. In the face of this mass uprising Stalin hesitates. In our world the Soviet's halt their advance outside Warsaw and the Resistance is crushed by the Germans. In Tarantino's world the Red Army is still far enough away from Warsaw that the Germans have not begun to prepare to defend the city against the Soviets. The Resistance is able to crush the occupying forces - the SS has no upper leadership to coordinate reinforcements and the regular Wehrmacht troops have been recalled to Germany by the new regime. Warsaw is secured and the Polish Resistance forms a new government, declaring a Free Poland. France, Yugoslavia and Greece quickly do the same and soon resistance groups across Europe are forming new governments.

As a result of this the Red Army's Summer 1944 offenses never happened and the USSR's post-War sphere of influence was greatly reduced. Instead of a Cold War alliance of Soviet puppet states, the Warsaw pact becomes a Confederation of Eastern European States. Having just thrown off the Nazi chains no one wants them replaced with Soviet chains. When the Yalta Conference is held Stalin has very little to bargain with in Europe. 

Desperate to increase Soviet influence somewhere, Stalin declares war on Japan in late 1944 and invades Manchuria in early 1945. By the time the Atomic bombs are dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki the post-War division of East Asia has begun. Instead of Europe, the Cold War will play out in a divided China, a Manchurian Soviet puppet state, a fully communist Korea, and a Japan occupied by the US. The focus of the Cold War in Asia means spy thrillers feature ninjas and Shaolin monks instead of East German border guards.

B:  Agent Neo dies trying, solving the anomaly for another few generations.

Why would the machines need to bug someone who was plugged in?  During the chase scene at the end, they turn random old ladies into Agents.  They seemed to know where Erma was, why would they need to bug Neo to track him?

* They **always** knew where Zion was.  And Zion was literally, right beneath the machines' base.

So they explain that they use the old sewers and subways and tunnels, right?  Well how vast do you think the underground network is?  It literally can only expand **beneath one city**.  Unless you think the Baltimore sewers extend to Miami...

Oh, also **THEY PLANNED TO LET TWO DOZEN HUMANS SURVIVE THE MASSACRE**.  What- are they just going to cover their robot-eyes with their pincers as the humans run away?  There is absolutely no way the humans can even survive with that small of a tribe without mechanical help.  

* This means all the technology humans have is whatever the machines allow them to have.

Unless they remembered to not-massacre any engineers or doctors or scientists.  Though from the look of the huddled masses of Zion, I'm sure they're so rare they'd miss them anyway.

* They don't need Morpheus alive because they never ""needed the codes"" to unlock the gates of Zion because **THEY HAVE CYCLOPEAN DRILLING ROBOTS**.

* Know what's a better use of those million squid-bots?  Capturing the Nebuchadnezzar without killing anyone important.  But, ya know... send like... 5.  I'm sure that's fine too.

What kind of terrible secrets could Wonka be hiding in the factory? This theorist believes that Wonka's various candies are made from children.

Wonka is not neseccarily evil; he just has a very messed up scale of morality where he designs his tour to try and tempt each children with a karmic fate to evalute if they are worthy of living or not by setting up traps or gambits which kills them. Augustus Gloop can't control his gluttony when he gets to the Chocolate Room and falls into the chocolate river, and is sucked up a large pipe. That's a fairly large pipe. Large enough for a Human being. Why would you make it that big for the chocolate river? Wonka set it up so that children are easily transported throughout the factory through these pipes to the various rooms. We see a similar mechanic again with the Nut Room, where there is another Human-sized tube that connects to an incinerator. The Nut Room has a bunch of squirrels testing walnut out to see if they are a ""bad nut"". Veruca Salt wants to have one of the squirrels, but Wonka denies her the request, so she tries to take one for herself. Wonka hardly tries to hide his murderous intents with this one and Veruca is thrown into the chute by the entire squirrel squad. The squirrels are trained to work together for dragging people into the chutes, apparently.

Before this, the group travels to the Inventing Room where Wonka shows off the ""Three-Course Dinner Chewing Gum"", a dangerous, experimental candy which has the side-effect of turning people into blueberries. Violet, boasting she can consume it and being prideful, grabs the gum and turns into a giant blueberry (she remains a Human but she has become large, blue, and juicy). Wonka has some Oompa Loompas take her to the Juicing Room to get back to normal. Turning into a fruit is a pretty big effect and doesn't seem like some kind of mistake and showing it off to a bunch of careless, candy-loving kids is not a smart idea. When Wonka captured children, originally, in order to make a child even more useful, he fed them these dinner gums so they can become different fruits and taken to the juicing room to get an endless supply of ""natural"" flavors. The Television Room's original use may be obvious: turning kids bite-sized in order to harness all of their flavors for a candy. The shrunken kids could of also been used for manufacturing tiny aspects of small candies, like molding them.

Still think this idea is crazy? Well, in the original version of the novel, there was an omitted chapter and sixth child named Miranda Piker, who seemingly falls down the ""Spotty Powder Mixer"" to be chopped to death, screaming. The screams turn into laughter as Miranda survives. Why would a mixer, which seems to be easily tranversed and below a large area, be neseccary? Mrs. Piker calls Wonka a murderer, ""I know your tricks! You're grinding them into powder! In two minutes my darling Miranda will come pouring out of one of those dreadful pipes."" Guess what Wonka replies. ""Of course, that's part of the recipe!"" Wonka notices that Miranda is still alive and is joking around with Mrs. Piker. Sure, its like Wonka to joke around, but this is a bit messed up.

And what about the Oompa Loompas? Not only are they fine with helping Wonka out with these murders, but they take joy in it, singing and dancing. Well, I'm not trying to sound racist here, but cannibalism in Africa isn't the rarest of things.

The 2005 film adaptation cranks Wonka's creep factor up to eleven. In this version, Wonka has a personal reason to hate people, as they bullied him for wearing a large mouth brace, his father prevented his creative freedom, and, like the other versions, the other candy companies were greedy and attacked Wonka's factory.

Taken from [neverbinkles](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ubaqq/what_fan_theories_have_blown_your_mind_with_their/c4u65ga), *""Willy Wonka knew those children would die in his factory. After Augustus gets sucked up the shoot, they all hop on board the boat through the tunnel of doom. The boat doesn't have two extra vacant seats though. It was designed with prior knowledge that they would lose two participants before that point. Later they drive a cream spewing car with only four seats. Did they have another car waiting in the garage in case the others made it? Of course not. Willy Wonka uses children to make candy.""*

However, I don't believe V is gay because of his obvious attraction to Evey, and the brother situation seems to easy. Gordon never mentions lost or captured siblings, and if he had them it would make sense for him to bring it up when he was showing Evey all of his banned shit.

But then I thought, Deitrich bought that banned art, who did he buy it from? Well, we all know one guy who has a bunch of banned art, someone who might also need cash for his revolution budget (i.e. buying and shipping thousands of Guy Fawkes masks). Deitrich's aggressive satire of the Chancellor also seems to be too outlandish a stunt for someone who wants higher ratings. His rebelliousness may point to him being in cahoots with V.

Every other toy in the movies is aware of the fact that they are, in Woody's words, ""a child's plaything."" They all know where they were ""made"" (by Mattel, in China, etc.) and they know they aren't ""real."" But Buzz (and I guess technically Emperor Zurg) are both unaware of this fact; Buzz thinks he's a real spaceman who needs to save the galaxy.

The boyfriend and I think it might have to do with the fact that Buzz is so ""realistic,"" at least in comparison to the other toys (a slinky dog doesn't really exist, for example). He's a spaceman, so you would expect him to have the personality of a spaceman. His lack of identity as a toy could also be a commentary on the diminishing imagination of contemporary kids. He doesn't THINK he's a toy because he's not really TREATED like (a ""traditional"") one. When Andy plays with his other toys, he has the ability to ""make"" them into something they're not (such as a piggy bank into an evil villain). Since the other toys are expected to play these different ""roles,"" they can't have a single role pre-programmed. But Buzz is so realistic, he can only really be one thing. He IS a spaceman, and there's no way for him to be anything else.

This also brings up ideas of post-modernity, and what is the ""original"" versus being a ""copy""--the Buzz aisle at Al's Toy Barn is a good example of this conflict. Although Buzz has accepted that he's a toy, he is still somewhat shocked at seeing so many versions of himself. This truly is the thing that drives home his toy-identity.

This also brings up other questions, like how, when toys are manufactured, they are given an identity. Is there something special about the way Buzz was manufactured that didn't provide him with this identity as a toy? Or who knows, maybe all toys really DO have to go through this phase of acceptance that they're toys, and they have to go through this once they're ""opened.""

At first, Indy's main mission is to restore the sacred stone back to that Indian village. But, as the movie goes on, this becomes his secondary mission. His primary mission is restoring the hundreds of children back to their families, which itself will be done by recovering the stone. So the key issue is showing the importance of the family. 

The Thuggee cult represents the corruption of the family, due to its cruel treatment of children and lack of any mother figure. So when Indy comes to rescue them, he comes not by himself, but with Willy and Shortround, representing the ideal and real family of father, mother, and son. As a bonus, Shortround is like an adopted son, to further contrast with the Thuggee's by showing that there is a right and peaceful way to take on a child that is not yours biologically. 

That is why it was necessary to include Willy and Shortround. Their presence showed/defeated the corruption of the motherlessness and child-abduction of the Thuggee's.

META THEORY (i.e. Real life events/not in-universe)

While re-reading Prisoner of Azkaban (After many years) and knowing the plot beforehand, i started noticing a few odd ends in the plot

At one point we're told the story of the night Lily and James Potter died from the witnesses POV, leaving us readers convinced
Sirius Black was the murderer. Later we all find out he wasn't - Wormtail manipulated every ""evidence"" presented **EXCEPT FOR ONE**

* **Explosion that killed twelve innocent muggles?**
 - *A hole to scape through the sewers*
* **Exposing Sirius a murderer in public?**
 - *Just blatant lies to frame him*
* **His finger being his only remains?**
 	- *Cut by himself to fake his death*
* **Sirius laughing manically**
	- *????*

When asked about this last point in interviews, Rowling has stated that Sirius was laughing because he was in shock and had some kind of mental breakdown (Laughing mad) because of the death of his friends, and Wormtail's betrayal ; this seems fitting with the character, and it's all good, but why not including the explanation in the book, when back then, and unlike the last books, not many 
questions were accidentally left unanswered?

 
We also know Rowling has a habit of making up Canon answers on the spot (sometimes she manages to pull this off, though).

So we're supposed to accept her Canon answer as true; and then later in the book, we stumble upon another loose end: **Flitwick teaches
Harry, Ron and Hermione the Cheering Charm.**

*Keep in mind: Early on, JKR Followed consistently [the rule of conservation of detail: every detail written in the books, served a clear purpose](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail); either as a [false clue](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring) (or simple background event) or as [foreshadowing/Symbolism](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun).*

This Cheering Charm is mentioned quite a few times during the book. It's even on the final exams and we see the trio practicing. A  point is even made to show that Overdoing this spell could result in hysterical laughter. So it holds a bigger significance than just a background event, yet *it offers no payoff: no mention of the exam, the OD, not revealed as fake clue and brings nothing to the plot.* 

* So why making it such a big deal and why mentioning the laughing side-effects?


So my theory and TL;DR is this: **Sirius Black manical laughter at his capture scene was originally going to be revealed to be a result 
of Wormtail overdosing him with the cheering charm (preventing Sirius from accusing or chasing him), but at one point JKR forgot to  (or decided against) tie these 2 plot points together, leaving them both unexplained. Years later, in interviews, she made up the ""grief laugh explanation"" on the spot.**

This wouldn't be the first time, IIRC Rowling once said that she almost published book 4 with a massive plot hole, due a certain event she forgot to resolve, and had to rewrite a lot of the book, but as of now hasn't revealed what this event was.

I don't think this is one of those farfetched theories at all, the evidence is somewhat solid and her writing vices are hardly a secret. I'm not asking you to imagine things that aren't there, just to see the evidence and discuss.

**So what do you think?**

[Skyrim, heavy spoilers ahead.]",288,61,149,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1jeq3k/parthurnaaxs_true_motives_skyrim_heavy_spoilers/,"Alright, I'm going to explain this under the assumption that you have played and completed the main quest line in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, and have a working knowledge of the game's plot and lore. If this is not the case, stop reading right now, or risk having what many consider the best RPG released in years spoiled for you.

It is my belief, that despite his benign demeanor, Parthurnaax is simply using the Dragonborn as a pawn in an attempt to take over Tamriel in Alduin's place. It is often stated in ES lore that dragon's are by nature, both very cunning and very ambitious by their very nature, and there is no reason to assume Parthurnaax is any different. Jealous of Alduin's power, but incapable of defeating him, Parthurnaax aided the enslaved humans in an attempt to destroy Alduin. However, they failed, and sent Alduin forward in time. 

Rather than seize power, only to have it taken from him when Alduin returned, Parthurnaax hid away atop the Throat of the World and bided his time. In time, the Grey Beards formed and began to look to him as their leader. Their worship for Parthurnaax is plain to see in the game, and there are strong parallels between the Grey Beards and the Dragon Priests of old. And of course, it would benefit Parthurnaax immensely to have mortals who could keep an eye on the world for him while he stayed in hiding atop the mountain. Then, as Alduin makes his return, the Dragonborn is brought to Parthurnaax's attention. Who better to destroy Alduin? So naturally, the Grey Beard's summon the Dragonborn, and assist him in growing to be more powerful and capable of defeating Alduin. 

Unfortunately for him, by the time the Dragonborn is powerful enough to defeat Alduin, he is also powerful enough to defeat Parturnaax himself. Therefore, he settles for convincing the Dragonborn that he is not a threat to man, despite the fact that he had been an active participant in a widespread genocide against mankind. With Alduin truly defeated and the Dragonborn decieved, the immortal Parthurnaax simply has to wait for the Dragonborn to die of old age, then he can take Alduin's place in leading the dragons against mankind. 

Even the meaning of his name supports this theory, which in the dragon tongue translates to ""Ambition Overlord Cruelty"". And as big of a selling point as dragons were in Skyrim, I can't imagine them not making an appearance in the next ES game. And if this theory is true, they certainly will.

Plankton, who ""WENT TO COLLEGE!!!"", wants to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula in hopes that more fish will go to his restaurant. This has two glaring holes:

1. Chum is made of the parts of fish and their blood, and fishermen use it to attract carnivorous creatures like sharks. This makes sense in a regular environment with a normal food chain, but since Bikini Bottom is a society where all fish treat each other equally, it's no wonder that everyone is so revolted by it. The Chum Bucket is a cannibalistic restaurant!
2. If he ever did succeed in getting the recipe to make Krabby Patties, there would be two restaurants on opposite sides of the street selling the same food. Mr. College-Educated Business Manager here should have a basic understanding of economics, so he should figure that he would be crushed by the competition regardless.

The obvious joke is that Plankton, who, as he reminded us often at the start of the show, went to college, is too dumb to notice these things. But what if there's more to this whole thing than we think?

In ""Plankton's Army,"" we hear him talk about how the plankton family has been stepped on for years. Plankton has apparently experienced this feeling of being stepped on both literally AND metaphorically. This could have given him incentive at a young age to attend college, so he could break away from the image that the rest of his brethren, depicted as hillbillies, give of their species.

Plankton are on the lowest level of the food chain. Just as plants form the base for basically every food chain of ecosystems on land, plankton serve the same role for marine environments. Sheldon has probably dealt with some angst from this in the past, only fueling his already crazy-high level of rage. So this brilliant psycho decided to take some sick revenge on the fish who feed on and belittle his kind.

This is his secret incentive for his insistence on serving chum. Unfortunately, it wasn't very subtle and they didn't bite (no pun intended). So why would he want to steal the Krabby Patty? Besides its insane level of success and prestige ... well, what IS the meat in Krabby Patties made out of? This is a question better left unanswered due to the potentially gruesome implications, but it is these implications that attracts Sheldon to the meal. If his suspicions are correct and it is made of fish, then he will gladly add it to his menu and really get the citizens of Bikini Bottom to unknowingly eat their own kind.

One last note: remember that bit about plankton being at the bottom of the food chain? Sheldon established his laboratory and restaurant inside something created by the creatures at the very top of the food chain: humans.

**TL;DR: Plankton hated being at the bottom of the food chain, so he decided to sell food in a way that the fish who belittled his species would commit cannibalism. This is why he went to college, tries to steal the formula, and even bases his operations in a bucket.**",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1cd4fa,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1cd4fa/spongebob_squarepants_planktons_hidden_motives/,

In the comic ""Year One,"" Commissioner Gordon's son, James Gordon Jr., is born roughly around the same time that Batman appeared in Gotham City. Mobster Carmine Falcone's nephew kidnapped the baby, and in the struggle between him and Gordon, the baby was thrown off of a bridge. Fortunately, a disguised Batman managed to catch the child, but the Black Mirror storyline revealed that the fall likely caused head trauma that led to psychopathic behavior later in life.

The last page implies that he succeeded.](#spoiler) However, he tells Batman that they'll never know if he succeeded until about ten or twenty years later.

""The Dark Knight Returns"" takes placed in the fairly distant future. Batman is at least twenty years older, and Gotham City is overrun by a deranged gang known as the Mutants. It's noted several times throughout the story that the Mutants are much more psychotic than the common criminals that Batman fought in his prime. The place in the timeline fits, and the behavior of the Mutants is very similar to that of James Gordon Jr. In addition, ""The Black Mirror"" heavily referenced ""Year One,"" which was written by Frank Miller, who also wrote ""The Dark Knight Returns.""

This is why Andy still has his toy box in his room when he is 18 years old, something that isn’t common for people his age.  While he doesn’t play with his toys he doesn’t have the heart to give away the ones he cares for the most, unlike his little sister Molly who never knew her father and doesn’t have as strong of an attachment to her toys, which is why she is able to give hers away so easily.   When Andy is getting ready to go off to college he has matured and is trying to let go of the pain of losing his father, one very important step in this process is giving away his favorite toys.  He decides to let them go to Bonnie, who reminds him of himself as a child because of the way she loves and plays with her toys.  The hardest toy to let go is of course Woody, who has been with him since his father died and is the last physical memory of his father he has.  In the last scene in Toy Story 3 when Andy is leaving Bonnie’s house Bonnie waves to Andy with Woody and Andy gasps and looks away.  Andy remembers the last time he saw his father and how he waved goodbye to him the same way Bonnie waved with Woody.

In the season 2 episode Pipeline Fever we learn that Archer's three biggest fears are alligators, crocodiles and brain aneurysms. But we are not given a reason for his mostly irrational fear of any of these things (except for maybe aneurysms because they can happen anywhere). 

In the fourth season episode Once Bitten Archer relives a memory he had as a child where he met a man who claimed to be his father. The man gave him an alligator stuffed animal which the lonely child Archer seems to immediately take to. 

But if Archer had met his father why can he not remember who he is and why is he deathly afraid of alligators? My theory is that while Mallory was away Archer's father had visited him multiple times as a child. But the last time he visited he took Archer to a zoo and while at the alligator exhibit (I imagine they were Archer's favorite animal) he suffered a brain aneurysm. The Aneurysm killed Archer's father right in front of him. The experience was so shocking that Archer had blocked from his memory but still associated alligators/crocodiles and aneurysms with an extremely traumatic death.

Firstly this is one of the only times we see Batman seeming to have a proper relationship with a woman, they've clearly been together for a while in the film, suggesting that Batman hasn't had much work to do so Bruce Wayne is spending more time out in public instead of brooding. This also explains Robins rebellious nature in the film, he's sick of doing nothing since theres little crime to fight, so instead he goes out street racing for his adrenalin fix.

Due to the increasing boredom of their lives, Bruce Wayne funds a giant telescope in the middle of the city. An unusual site for a telescope due to the massive light pollution, but the rest of the city is full of strange architectural choices too thanks to Bruce buying up land and using them to satisfy his boredom, examples being the strange giant statues of men the size of skyscrapers.

Next, Bruce needs a villain to take advantage of this telescope, since the only reason to build it in the centre of a city is for a villain to threaten them with turning it into a weapon. He pays an actor named Victor Fries to act as a pantomime villain, just as he and Robin act like the heroes, all of them hamming up the lines with ridiculous puns and phrases. Fries goes along with this as he needs money to fund his research into his wifes condition, what better way to get it than befriending a billionaire?

Unfortunately, Bruces architectural playground has been devastating the local wildlife. Pollution is terrible in Gotham because nothing has been planned with the environmental impact in mind, Poison Ivy is portrayed as a supervillain but realistically she's an anti-hero. Her introduction is herself being ""killed"" by a mad scientist, she goes on to kill this mad scientist who is attempting to sell dangerous chemicals to rogue terrorists and states around the world. The nature of her powers now being plant based, she can sense the rampant destruction of the enviroment around Gotham and its effect on the world in terms of pollution, and aims to stop it by taking out Bruce Wayne to halt the building work in the city.

Ivy sides with Fries, unaware of the game being played between ""Mr Freeze"" and Batman, but eventually figures it out and so decides to try and kill Fries' wife to demoralise him and blame it on Batman, ending the game so she can turn him to her cause of protecting the enviroment using the telescope to end pollution coming from Gotham, turning from anti-hero to full villain.

Ivy didn't expect Batman to hire a ""long lost niece"" of Alred to bring in as a third partner in a dramatic reveal worthy of a great play, and so Batman and co. eventually win.

As a final revenge for breaking up the game, Batman arrainges Mr Freeze to be locked in the same cell as Ivy for a dramatic ending to his game.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1f4tp8,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1f4tp8/batman_robin_its_all_an_act/,

I thought it would have been perfect because it was what I thought was actually happening for a second. Obvious spoiler warning goes here.

When Truman said his final line in the movie, ""Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!"", what if that sentence was actually Truman creating the greatest trick the world has ever seen? What if at that moment he **started pretending like he was an actor?** He would have single-handedly (albeit falsely) made a fool out of the entire planet.

What makes the concept of The Truman Show so good in the world of the movie? The director said it himself: ""You were real. That's what made you so good to watch."" The ultimate slap in the face to the viewers, and the ultimate revenge against everyone involved in the show wouldn't be for Truman to just walk off like he did. It would be for him to **completely destroy the validity of the show** by turning it around and pretending to be an actor.

Imagine the outrage from the millions/billions of viewers that have dedicated the last 30 years of their lives to watching a show that turns out to be false! The showrunners would have a planet-wide outrage at the realisation that the entire show was a lie. It would be the greatest revenge against the director, who after 30 years of basically raising Truman and playing god, would have the monumental achievement of his entire life's work pulled out from underneath him.
I realise it wouldn't satisfy the thematic ideas/questions of subjective reality, but I think it would have been a VERY smart/satisfying ending to the movie. (IMO)

Summarized in internet-talk: **Truman would be the world's biggest troll.**

There are, of course, certain plots that were designed around us thinking that the entire thing takes place in someone's head. When everything fits perfectly and you don't have to make changes based on what character you're discussing or what episode it is. The key problem I have with these theories is simple: It can be applied to any movie, TV show, or book ever written, I have included a list of examples.

How I Met Your Mother could be inside Barney's head, or all made up on the spot by Ted, Ed, Edd, and Eddie is a purgatory made up for Eddie as he struggles with his humanity after death, Garfield is in Garfield's head as he starves to death (that one is actually true though) Lost is all a delusional dream as Jack bleeds to death after the crash, Breaking Bad is an alternate reality in which coma-stricken Walt thinks about how he could have tried differently (he's dying of cancer because he can't afford treatment) The Big Bang Theory is in Leonard's head as he slowly chokes to death (the entire thing being his mind or some ghostly entity trying to show him that life is worth living and that anything can happen), Family Matters is all in Urkel's head as he dies due to complications involving his health and poor living conditions, The Fresh Prince of Bell Air is a story that Will's mom is telling him as he lies dying in the hospital (shot during the 'little fight') a promise that if he pulls through life will be better.

TL;DR: Any movie or TV show can be made into a dream sequence. If you really, really, really, really believe that a TV show or movie is in the main character's head then you should flesh out your theory and make sure it fits, rather than slapping together a half-thought out and unimpressive 'it's all in his head' scenario.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_yd426,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/yd426/why_using_its_all_a_dream_or_hes_dying_and/,

My theory is that **throughout the whole movie Tony is being mentally attacked by the Mandarin and his Mento-Intensifier ring because the Mandarin wants to take control of Iron Man and use him as a weapon.** This theory relies heavily on the belief that the Mandarin actually has all ten of his rings and is simply playing possum throughout the film as theorized [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1dxzzx/iron_man_3_mandarin_theory_spoilers/)


*Tony Stark is an alcoholic. However, in Iron Man 3 he is only shown drinking in flashbacks. I believe the Mandarin made Tony forget that he drinks and is using Tony's body's withdrawal symptoms to aid in causing the panic attacks and compromising him mentally.

*In the scene where Tony's armor is summoned during his sleep Tony remarks that the armor shouldn't be able to do that. That's hint #1 that the armor has been compromised.

*In the scene where the armor flies him to Tennessee Tony asks Jarvis why he did that to which Jarvis does not know and then promptly crashes. That's hint #2 that the armor has been compromised.

I believe that the movie version of the Mandarin actually is Ho Yinsen's son. He wasn't killed by the terrorist organization the Ten Rings of the Mandarin as Ho Yinsen believed, he was just taken captive and brainwashed. Yinsen's son then rose through the ranks until he took over as the new leader of the organization and inherited the rings. He found out that Tony was responsible for his father's death however indirectly that was, and he used Killian as a front to amass power as he bided his time slowly taking apart Tony Stark's greatest weapon, his mind. As much as I hate ""the ending was all in his mind"" theories, it just fits Iron Man 3 too perfectly. After being chipped apart a little bit at a time, each panic attack weakening him mentally a little more until Tony finally sees Pepper fall to her ""death."" That was the final straw to break Tony mentally. Everything that happens after that happens as Tony would expect it to happen, not as it actually would have happened.

*Before the final battle every fight Tony gets in against extremis enhanced enemies goes poorly, but he is somehow able to overcome the most powerful of the extremis soldiers (Killian) using one of his weakest suits (Mark 42).

*Killian never uses his fire breath in that battle even though it would have saved him multiple times while grappling with Tony. Why? Because Tony had never seen Killian use the fire breath, so it wasn't something that would happen in his fantasy.

*After Tony ""wins"" all of Killian's henchmen get arrested including the Mandarin, because as far as Tony knows the Mandarin is just some foolish actor.

*Finally Tony is able to fix the extremis formula and remove the shrapnel from his heart almost as an afterthought. Why is it suddenly so easy to fix the problems he's been working on since the very first movie?

Tony never wins the battle against Killian. The Mandarin now has all the power he needs to step out of the shadows. He has his extremis army and a mind controlled Tony Stark along with all 42 versions of his armor.

That is a very long time, in our world that's practically the difference between the end of the Renaissance and the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, a *huge* period of time.

Then why is it that technology of Skyrim in the 4th Era is no better, or even worse than, the technology seen in Cyrodil at the end of the 3rd? Given the clothing styles, naming conventions, language and trade of foreigners seen in Skyrim at the time, it can only be assumed that it's much the same in other parts of Tamriel.

A few theories on why or how this could have happened:

**The Aedra/Divines are *deliberately* keeping Tamriel suppressed**. Looking at today's world, advances in technology and knowledge have lead to huge increases in atheism, and perhaps the divines of Tamriel are fearing the same. In many mythologies, Gods are de-powered or fail to continue existing without worship, praise and belief, so the Aedra ultimately work against any major booms in technology.

**The *Empire* is holding the continent back**. With such huge improvements in technology and modern thinking, many people come to realize that they do not need nor want to be kept under a monarchy or   empire, bringing about uprisings and establishing democracies and republic states. This is very evident in things like our world's French Revolution, which was given another go in the mid-1800's (re: *Les Miserables*). The Empire, in the interests of preserving their rule, deliberately keep any major technological advances under lock and key, possibly imprisoning key thinkers, paying off their contemporaries to ""disprove"" new ideas to the public and releasing propaganda to keep Tamriel from rising up against them.

**It's the *Daedra's* fault**. Most (if not all) of the Daedric Princes operate in domains of terror and fear of mortal races. What better way to perpetuate this than to keep the mortals in a dark age of uncertainty?

You could say that technology moves slower in this world, but keep in mind that most mortal races are living in an area seemingly about the size of Asia (correct me if I'm wrong), most of which is *known*, e.g. there has never been a ""New World"", Age of Exploration or Imperialism. With such a small area and not a whole lot of uncertainty to hinder the travel of idea, you'd imagine it would be actually *faster*.

**TL;DR:** Tamriel is being deliberately kept from a Renaissance/Industrial Revolution, possibly due to Aedric/Daedric intervention or government suppression.

This is the furthest ive gotten:

During their morning shift they scare kids from the US east coast, it should be around 10-12 am in monsters world when it is 6-8 pm on the East Coast. 

Mike tells his Girlfriend he will see her at 5, and shortly after he meets her after his shift Sully finds Boo. This should mean that it is about 3 am on the East Coast at that moment.

Assuming Boo has a reasonable bedtime between 6 and 8 pm, its is 8 to 9 hours earlier where she lives in comparison with the East Coast. If we look at a timezone map that should mean Boo lives in Japan, Korea, Russia, Australia or Indonesia.

Does anyone have additional proof or counter arguments for this theory?

Edit: Found another thing backing up this theory: when Mike and Sully are sent to exile in the Himalaya, it is late in the afternoon there, suggesting it is a bit later than that where Boo lives, as she is returned to bed around the same time. The area where it is a bit later than it is in the Himalaya would be East-Asia and Oceania.

Edit2: Changed her bedtime to 6-8 pm, so that it matches the bedtime used for the east coast. Remember that this bedtime is only a reference point, i could have used 3 am as long as the eastcoast and Boo have the same time. Changing it to 6-8 means that the possibilities of her living in New Zealand or on a Pacific island are now open.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,1353315596.0,,,True,t3_13eryy,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/13eryy/where_does_boo_from_monsters_inc_live/,

That he had no control over it the plane crash and thus the eye is no in anyone's possession.  When Walter gets a hold of the eye, he begins to take more control over situations.  

When Skyler looks at the eye, she has Lavell Crawford(who IMO are vastly underusing as he is FUCKING HILARIOUS) and that other guy(cant remember his name right now) go to Beneke's house and force him to pay the IRS.

When Gus kills Don Eladonadio(spelling) he takes his necklace which looks like it has an eye pendant.  Then gus dodges the bomb Walter planted for him in his car.  Gus then gives the necklace to Tio(? the gangster in the wheelchair with the bell) And as well all know, there is a shot of the necklace in his room before he kills Gus and himself.

Also, I was wondering if anyone had any theories on how the teddy bear with one that was shown in color while everything else was in black and white had anything to do with Gus's death?

There are a number of relics of the past that survive.

It, like every other plot point of the show, has to do with the fact that each member of Dethklok has a supernatural ability. Let's start with a rundown:


-Nathan Explosion is the magical dictator. The success of the band and the tragedies at their concerts are caused by his innate ability to manifest reality. What he says happens, what he commands is obeyed.


-Skwisgaar Skwigelf is, as shown, a Norse demigod. His father is likely Baldur, whose divine gift allows Skwigelf to charm everyone he meets with his physical and artistic beauty.


-Pickles the Drummer actually has two key abilities. He is a natural drunken master, and has the power to transmute pain into art. The show explains his financial success as being attributed to his striving to please his mother, but I believe it has more to do with the pain of abandonment (father, mother, brother all abandon him physically or emotionally). The purest example of this is the scene of him screaming in pain while recording drum tracks for the third album.


-Toki Wartooth also has two spells surrounding him. The first that the show reveals is that everything Toki loves dies a horrible death. In addition to this, he has a summon: The Clown.


Which leaves us with Murderface. What is the nature of his magic? Why is he in this band? Why is such an incorrigible shitmonger one of the chosen ones? Here's what I think:


Whatever gods of brutality are guiding the boys plan on separating Murderface from the group. He is the only band member who doesn't have an active ability. He can't really do anything, and this is the key. Forever in the background, William has shown his jealousy many times. What else has he repeatedly shown? A penchant for failure, but more specifically failure which doesn't really cause him harm. Evidence of such is found in his NASCAR type multi-media event, his Christmas special, his attempt to join the Special Persons Invite Club, the failed lawsuit, etc.


So what it all boils down to is this: In a desperate attempt at prominence, Murderface will go turncoat and join the dark cabal led by the Half-Man. With Toki captured and Murderface on their side, the cabal will assume victory is at hand and launch Falconback. Toki will summon Rockso, who will kill Magnus Hammersmith and throw the whole organisation into chaos. While dealing with this situation, they will fail to notice Murderface making a power grab and commanding Falconback resources. In his attempt to bring about destruction (if he can't have fame and happiness, no one can!), he will undoubtedly fail. The counter-attack from the Church of the Black Clock will thus be allowed to succeed, and the band will take Murderface back into the fold because, hey, he just saved the fuckin' world.

In Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Willy Wonka runs a competition allowing five children each accompanied by an adult to see round the Chocolate Factory. Now as we know, each child ends up disposing of themselves in various ways. This was Wonka's/The Grand High Witch's personal experiment and Saw-esque entertainment. You can't go killing off the kids who the world knows have entered your factory, but you can find out likely weaknesses and watch as they fuck themselves up in amusing ways. After seeing how dumb kids are in general, Wonka/The Grand High Witch decides that a straight out poisoning of chocolate bars is the way forward, laces the chocolate with turning-in-to-mouse formula, then hands the factory over to some putz (Charlie) who will take the rap should anyone figure out what has happened.

If you remember from The Witches, the boy (we never find out his name) when hearing that witches think children smell like dog shit says something like (and Ive lost my precious Dahl books so this is not verbatim) ""well I'm going to wash myself every day day so I smell like strawberries and cream"" his grandma says "" no, the cleaner you are the worse you smell to them, it's the smell of child they hate. If you want a witch to not be able to smell you, then don't ever have a bath.""  Well who is the child who Wonka/Grand High Witch can most tolerate? Charlie, the poor kid, who probably had less opportunities for keeping clean than the other kids.

That the kids also smell of shit to Wonka/Grand High Witch also explains his behaviour. In the Witches we learn that the Grand High Witch out of all the witches can most hide her disdain for how children smell, but she still keeps them at arms length and looks slightly nauseated when she is near them. Same as Wonka!

Witches must always wear gloves to hide their claws. Wonka always wears gloves. Witches have no toes and wear painful shoes. Wonka always walks with a cane. Wonka rhymes and bursts in to song and so do his underlings, so does the Grand High Witch ""A witch who likes to answer back will burn until her bones are black"".

This could imply that Andy is missing a father figure in his life and this is why they are his favourite two toys.

1371750625.0,210,self.FanTheories,1gqnoq,DREAMING WITH DAVID - THE CREW OF PROMETHEUS WAS RE-PROGRAMMED IN CRYO-SLEEP.... WITH GIFS! (and spoilers obv.),282,72,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1gqnoq/dreaming_with_david_the_crew_of_prometheus_was/,"Since first experiencing Alien as a five year old peeking over the back of the couch I’ve always had a xenomorph curled up in the ducting somewhere.

But like Prometheus, none of the following has anything to do with Alien or Aliens..

I’m not gonna theorise through the plot holes, magical DNA or demon barber surgical procedures of Prometheus. I’m really not interested in the who, what, where and when of the Engineers. What baffled and annoyed the most were the whiplash character shifts of the crew of Prometheus. Decisions and actions that made no sense for how they had been established.

Elisabeth Shaw is presented as a woman of science - yet not alone is she a shitty scientist, she’s driven by faith in her theories beyond all reasonable doubt.

Holloway has reached the culmination of a lifetime searching for the Engineers - but not alone does he recklessly contaminate their discovery by taking off his helmet, [he sulks and mopes when all they find is an alien planet, an alien spaceship, 3D recordings of real actual aliens, and a great big exploding alien head.](http://i.imgur.com/RuZl3Qz.gif)

The guy in charge of mapping gets lost. The biologist runs away from the first sample of dead alien fauna ever discovered, yet falls in love with a slimy hissing snake monster. The flight crew don’t give a shit about nothin’ right up to the point they go kamikaze. I could go on and on. Illogical decisions compounded by blatant contradictions.

So I’ve come up with something that might explain their behaviour. It doesn’t cover all the problems in the movie, just the human ones.

David is following Weyland’s orders. He’s the fly in the ointment who is aware of what he’s doing, but knows the trick is “not to mind that it hurts”. Without knowing exactly what he’s up to, it’s still obvious he’s been programmed to behave this way.

What if most of the crew have also been programmed?

What was David doing all that time on the journey? Boning up on Shaw and Holloway’s “thesis” on how to communicate with the Engineers... But it makes no sense that their theories would be that advanced. How did they know this stuff from cave paintings and carvings?

They didn’t. It’s not their research.

David told Shaw he peeked in on her dreams as she was in cryosleep. Clunky expositional dreams that fill us in on who she was and why her faith is so important to her, and why she choses to believe. [A dream which is conveniently un-dream like.](http://i.imgur.com/0K6xW19.gif)

The entire crew has spent two and half years wrapped up and strapped down and wired up to some of the most sophisticated brain monitoring equipment of the late 21st century. What if they weren’t dreams David was watching? But rather monitoring the progress of new memories being implanted into her consciousness? If the technology existed, wouldn’t that be the perfect time to push some new software and programming into the mind? If she’s not being influenced by anything external, why is David in Shaw’s dream? [Unless it’s not her own memory. ](http://i.imgur.com/NjKDsMT.gif)

The crew's muted response to momentous events in the history of human exploration are the aftereffects of damaged minds battered and bruised by a forced re-boot. A program that breaks doubt and motivation to its most basic components. That tells this elite hand-picked crew that they are only in it for the money, not complicated things like adventure, discovery or the wonder..

What kind of loon signs up for an unknown five year mission anyway? [ The kind whose mind has been wiped to a point that the mission must be explained to them again just so everyone’s on the same page. ](http://i.imgur.com/EPAj0oG.gif)

Most every member of the crew has to some degree been manipulated while in cryosleep. Keep it basic with the flight crew - it’s dangerous to fiddle too much with them. Make them lazy and unconcerned when lifeforms just pop up on the scans in favour of getting some with Charlize Theron. (Though that doesn’t require brainwashing). [ But all too willing to sacrifice themselves once Weyland is dead.](http://i.imgur.com/aS7pvOU.gif)

The grunt scientists you can be hard on. They could have picked those fuckers up off the streets and programmed the notion they were biologists and geologists into them, not like they ever get around to demonstrating any expertise...

And Shaw and Holland... These two incompetents who somehow persuaded Weyland to organise a trillion dollar mission of the vaguest probability on the basis that it’s just what they believe. Who insist there are no straight lines in nature yet minutes later want to double check the temple is constructed? Who discover a perfectly preserved alien head but can’t think of anything better to do than electrocute it till it explodes?

I have no doubt they were archeologists who discovered all the cave paintings and brought their discovery to Weyland. But no way they knew all that about engineering DNA, or creating us from the primordial soup, or working out how to communicate with an advanced godlike alien race from hieroglyphs and stone carving.

So how to best reconcile these two with the impossibility of knowing all the things they think they know? By allowing them to hand-wave their certainty as faith. Fuck cross-referencing, double-checking hypothesis and confirming conclusions... Shaw chooses to believe. The crew with reasonable questions for why they’re all they way out there on this goose chase, don’t call bullshit on any of this. [Because they’ve been programmed not to.](http://i.imgur.com/yYPzOPv.gif)

With the exception of Weyland, Vickers and David, none of the characters are their true selves.

Vickers? [ Yeah.](http://i.imgur.com/9h48dUG.gif)

 
So what’s the point? Fuck knows. Maybe they’re canaries in a coal mine. Sent ahead like driving pigs through a minefield, triggering all the traps before Weyland, with little time to fuck around, makes his play for immortality. Maybe Weyland had prior knowledge of the Engineers, how to communicate with them and where they were. But that’s all speculation. There’s scant corroboration provided within the the movie.

That’s for another post, this is long enough as it is.

Besides. It’s thin. The notion that Minority Report’s final act is all a dream has more weight. All we have to go on is Shaw’s dream. Shaw’s suspiciously succinct dream.
But the main problem with this is that it doesn't make the movie better. It makes it worse. Hiding a fundamental point from the audience betrays the compact between the filmmakers and the audience. But revealing most every character as an artificial construct would be a shitty twist anyway. If there was any merit to this you'd think there'd be something here on [Shaw's cryo-screens to back up the claim. But there isn’t.](http://i.imgur.com/SizMRis.jpg) So there's no way to know.

[But it’s what I choose to believe.](http://i.imgur.com/dzoXgDY.gif)

. . .

While I’m here - Shaw managed to run sideways from that rolling spaceship and the fuckin’ thing nearly crushed her anyway.

The movie is a very happy story with a very happy ending. Through teamwork and ingenuity, the ants and their circus friends fend off the grasshopper threat. 

The thing is, the grasshoppers were pretty much the only population control these ants had. They took a large portion of the ants food every season and kept the ants contained on the island. There were no other predators like anteaters or other animals to keep the ants in check. What happens now that the grasshoppers are gone? 

The ants have free reign of the small island and all its resources. They grow quickly as they are able to harvest efficiently now that they have accepted Flik's inventions. They soon grow too large to be confined to their small island. Because Flik basically went on a scouting mission and probably told his people stories about his adventures off the island, they know what is out there and what to expect. They start to expand, and because they are so technologically advanced they are able to modify Flik's inventions for conquest and overrun any opposition. Sure, there may be some ants who oppose their new lifestyle, but times have changed since the oppression of the grasshoppers, and the peace seekers are largely ruled out to focus on the need for expansion. The ants become the bug version Genghis Khan and spread over the land.

I absolutely loved it. But of all the things this movie had been praised for I couldn't find any mention of the fact that *Cabin in the Woods* completely turned my preconceived notions about these archetypes on its head!


**SPOILERS INCOMING**


It's been a while since the movie so let me catch you up. *Cabin in the Woods* posits that there are 5 archetypes represented in the horror movie genre. If the narrative is to be believed then the characters and their coinciding roles are as follows:

Dana = The Virgin

Holden = The Scholar

Curt = The Athlete

Jules = The Whore

Marty = The Fool

With this information in mind, completely disregard that list because its wrong and I believe the creators of this movie know that.


**The Evidence**


* From the very beginning of the movie, we know that Dana is not a virgin. She slept with her teacher and it's even confirmed at the end of the movie by Sigourney Weaver's character. Dana may be *virginal* but she is certainly not a virgin. It's odd then that the fate of humanity hinged solely on this kind-of-but-not-really-a-virgin making it to the end.  Aside from that, when's the last time you made a Virgin Sacrifice Cake that was 100% Virgin-Free?

* It makes more sense that Dana would be **The Scholar**. Case in point: In the very opening scene she is hardcore into studying. She could've just taken some regular ol' books on vacation with her and had a good read, but instead they make it a point to establish that the only thing she's going to be boning up on is ""Soviet Economic Structures"". Within seconds of this information, her friend literally says, ""No more learning!"".

* So then, if Dana is **The Scholar**, which archetype is Holden? He very easily defaults to **The Athlete**. If you remember from his fairly forgettable backstory that he's a transfer student and like Curt is also on the varsity team. In fact we know less about Curt's reputation as an athlete and more about Holden's. Don't be fooled by Thor's rakishly good looks. Holden holds the title of ""best hands on the team"".

* Curt is undeniably athletic. His special attacks consist entirely of clotheslines! But lest we forget his girlfriend is dead because he and **The Whore** decided to get drunk and frolic through the woods in the middle of the goddamn night. He is hands down the drunkest person in the cabin and the symbol for **The Fool** is a dude drinking/dancing himself stupid. If he was simply **The Athlete** he could have just been portrayed as a horny jock with a penchant for body slamming the undead. There is no doubt in my mind that Curt is none other than **The Fool**. Also, ""we should split up"" and ""I'm gonna jump it!"" are factually the best ways to become a corpse in a horror movie.

* In Jules' case, the humans got this one right. She's still **The Whore**

* It's originally implied that **The Fool** is the stoner in the group but Marty proves to be the *least* foolish character in the movie. Every decision and whim he has is the right one. By the end of the film, he is the one being directly confronted by The Director. His prominence at this point in the movie has escalated to lead protagonist; a role often reserved for **The Virgin** archetype. I haven't seen every horror movie but I can't recall the hero pulling a gun on a friend with his back turned, even if it *is* to save the world.

* One final clue that Marty is indeed **The Virgin**: Once Marty has been checked off the list of sacrifices, the *very next scene* is the one and only time that the gods react to anything before the end of the movie. They sure would have been pissed had Marty actually been slain in that moment.


So sure, none of this effects the final outcome of the movie, but it very well COULD HAVE. If at any point Marty died (and he very nearly does) the movie would have been over, resulting in a premature ending and screwing up the whole movie. If Dana would have died in the final 8 minutes by the hands of the werewolf or even before at the lake, humanity would have continued, being none the wiser. Don't get me wrong; I loved the ending but there aren't too many endings where everyone dies and it *did* take about 2 years for this movie to be released so its not hard to imagine that in writing this movie, they must at least toyed with the idea of the ""good"" ending (good being relative).



**TL:DR Version**


Go back and watch the movie with this revised list in mind:

Dana = The Scholar

Holden = The Athlete

Curt = The Fool

Jules = The Whore

Marty = The Virgin


All-in-all I feel this information is important because as a movie that is entirely a commentary on the horror genre, it would have been crazy to have this theory confirmed in the end, blindsiding modern horror conventions in the process. I mean, how insane is it that they stuck to the typical horror tropes while simultaneously subverting them?

I just saw this this morning at various places while zoning out during class and thought I would summarize all the relevant evidence. Which in the end seems overwhelming, so much so that I don't know how I missed it.

The theory is that he is gay but because he is both a police officer and a gangster, social contexts which are highly homophobic, he is the classis super-homophobic guy who is actually a closeted gay man.

* He repeatedly accuses others of homosexuality and uses homophobic slurs throughout the movie from the beginning, notably when he loses the game to the firefighters. 

* Relationship with Jack Nicholson: Jack was accused of being gay as well by both his girlfriend and Matt Damon, and he also seems to have a rather flamboyant wardrobe. The character that Jack Nicholson was based on was rumored to have been closeted although it was never confirmed. And in fact Jack Nicholson suggests that Damon is gay by shoving the dildo in his face and saying ""see anything you like?"" They would recognize each other as closeted because as the stereotype that closeted gay guys ""just know"" when they meet another one. There is also the theory that Nicholson is simply a ""pan-sexual psychopathic predator"" who will have sex with anyone regardless of gender or age because it makes him feel powerful, and he may have had an inappropriate relationship with Damon as a child.

* Responds especially angrily when he is a called a ""two faced faggot"" by Leonardo DiCaprio.

* He hits on other women conspicuously in front of other police officers. He whistles at the woman in the hallway. He gives looks to the woman at the police conference table. He hits on the psychiatrist in the elevator. 

* Ends up dating and marrying the psychiatrist who is works in the same building as all his colleagues, but note this exchange with Alec Baldwin: 

     Ellerby: How is your wedding coming along? 

     Colin Sullivan: Great, great; she's a doctor. 

     Ellerby: That's outstanding. 

     Colin Sullivan: Yeah. 

     Ellerby: Marriage is an important part of getting ahead: lets people know you're not a homo; married guy seems more stable; people see the ring, they think at least somebody can stand the son of a bitch; ladies see the ring, they know immediately you must have some cash or your cock must work. [laughs] 

    Colin Sullivan: [laughing] Yeah, it's working... Overtime! 

    Ellerby: I'm glad to hear that. 

    Colin Sullivan: Yeah... Thank you. 

Ellerby might suspect and is testing Damon, in any case, Damon felt he needed to say that his cock was working ""overtime.""

* He said his cock was working overtime, but actually it was not working at all, because he had erectile dysfunction. In fact, his wife got pregnant by Leonardo DiCaprio, and Damon is surprised that she got pregnant at all. 

* Realtor selling him an apartment asks about whether he has a wife or girlfriend and when he is not totally forthcoming the realtor says, ""Oh, I get it, you *tend to have a houseguest*"", implying that he is gay, and Matt Damon reacts by immediately buying the place as though he has something to prove.

*  Many references to the Catholic Church and abuse by priests/father figures - which may indicate that the reason Jack took an interest in Damon as a child was because Damon was a choirboy (Jack doesn't like the church or priests) and wanted to protect him from abuse by keeping him away from the church since he recognized that he might have been targeted as a gay youth (kind of like in the movie Doubt).

* Matt Damon extremely uncomfortable watching women have sex in the porn theatre, but this could be because porn theatres are just creepy places in general. 

* Working class Boston, organized crime, the police, and the United States in general are all contexts in which homophobia is prominent.

* Closeted homosexual as a metaphor for living a double life generally, which is what both Leo and Damon are doing, and possibly Jack Nicholson.

* At the end, there is the spilled milk, which Jack Nicholson bought for him in the beginning - reference to Jack Nicholson's corrupting influence on him through what initially seemed like benevolence, hinting at abusive relationship?

In Marty, this may have resulted in his being raised to have more self-confidence, resulting in a complex where he just cannot stand being called a coward.

When Doc travels to 2015, he sees an unexpected future, one that he could not have possibly fathomed: Marty is now injured, thanks to his new personality quirk, resulting (perhaps indirectly) in his children being clueless and easily swayed (especially Marty Jr.). This troubles Doc, and we basically have Parts II and III.

So, everyone who knows about the show is probably familiar with it's premise: Arnold, a oblong-shaped headed boy, lives with his grandparents and other crazy tenants in a boarding house. He attends school at PS 118 with his best friend, Gerald; a bully who is secretly in love with him, Helga; and his other classmates--perfect for a kids show, right? Well, let's look at it a little deeper with what makes Helga ""tick.""

Helga Pataki appears to be a schoolyard bully, however, it has been shown that her family is the root cause of her character. Her father, Bob Pataki is a competitive blowhard. He expects nothing but perfection from his family, whether it comes to grades, competitions, or even the family's structure. He is a greedy asshole and anything he says, goes.

And there's Miriam, Helga's mom. She is a stay-at-home mom and an alcoholic. She has an attachment to her blender and is seen constantly drinking smoothies, unless she is passed out, of course. In a few episodes, she has been revealed to be an Olympic class swimmer and a bull-riding queen, but she dropped out of college to marry Bob and has been miserable since. She views her marriage to be one of her greatest mistakes and is clearly held back by it(as well as unemployment), as seen in the episode where she fills in for her husband at work. 

Olga. She's perfect, right? She was a concert pianist at fifteen and class valedictorian. She has won every spelling bee in her area, as well as other awards. But, her flaw is that she ignores the problems within her family. Her parents obviously neglect Helga, and Olga is no different. In an episode, she reveals to Helga that she gets tired of always having to perform for her parents and she wishes she was ignored like Helga.

Helga is actually an unwanted ""accident,"" seeing as she is 12 years younger than her sister and neglected. Her parents always prefer Olga because she is the ""perfect"" daughter. Bob sees Olga as someone he can be proud of. Miriam sees her as her second chance at life; she sees herself in Olga, which is why she pushes her to live the life she couldn't because of her marriage. Helga, however, is nothing but their daughter, and her parents couldn't care less where she is most of the time. Helga's parents and sister view her as the family's major flaw and feel that she holds them back from being that ""perfect"" family.

However, Helga is actually pretty smart and talented for her age. She received a perfect score in a standardized test her class took(which hadn't happened since her perfect sister took it). She receives perfect scores on some of her exams, and is praised and acknowledged for her literary work. She can recognize the works of Edward Hopper and form opinions about them. She has made a reference to George Orwell's 1984. She is very creative and a gifted poet. Of course, no one really thinks of Helga as someone who is ""smart"" or ""talented""; they only see her as a bully. She doesn't brag about her achievements to her parents because she doesn't want to be like Olga and she couldn't care less about her academics.

But why is she a bully? Well, when she was in preschool, she met someone who gave her attention and complimented her for the first time--Arnold. He said he liked her pink bow because it matched her clothes. Helga fell head over heels in love with him for making her feel special for the first time, which is why she still wears her pink bow as a nine-year-old. However, she was caught making googly-eyes at Arnold by her classmates, who made fun of her for it. To protect herself, she became a bully, so no one would mess with her. But in actually, she doesn't beat anyone up(except for an occasional sock to Brainy).  She picks on Arnold the most though, because she doesn't want anyone suspecting her of liking him. She is afraid of telling Arnold her feelings because she doesn't want him to reject her the way her family has.

1342285560.0,207,self.FanTheories,wjzev,What is really happening in Agrabah? [Aladdin theory],242,35,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/wjzev/what_is_really_happening_in_agrabah_aladdin_theory/,"I liked the [Aladdin is set in the future theory](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/uc247/aladdin_is_set_in_the_future/), but here's a different theory for the movie (The animated Disney movie, Aladdin, from 1992).  For my theory, Aladdin is set in the past, and the genie is just making jokes that go over the heads of all the non-supernatural characters. Period.

First, the motives for power that Jafar have are very unclear in the movie.  It is a Disney movie, so he's just evil for evil's sake, but if you think about it, he has no reason to complain in his position.  He has complete influence over the Sultan with his hypnostick, so he can do whatever he wants. He has his own guard that answers only to him, so he's protected. And even if something he suggests to the Sultan doesn't turn out right, he's not in charge, so he doesn't have to take the fall.  In a stable Agrabah, it would be better for him to be the advisor for life and have a lot of freedom, than be sultan and have the same freedom but also be in the public eye.

Which leads to the question of whether or not Agrabah is really all that stable.  Aladdin is a young man in the prime of his life, and he can't get a job, so he resorts to being a thief.  There are people with jobs, but they seem to be merchants or family businesses only.  Inherited jobs are indicative of a society with very little social mobility.  Aladdin is stuck, he doesn't have any aspirations to do anything with his life (no school, no military, nothing).  There is an economy, where people use money to pay for things, but it is very cutthroat.  Any perceived violation is met with swift street justice, (the owner attempts to cut off Jasmine's hand), and the only ""police"" in this society serve the aristocrats.  Living in this kind of place would be brutal for anyone who was not an aristocrat or connected somehow, and everyday those people would be reminded of their status by being forced to look at a gaudy and audacious palace.  This is exactly how you breed resentment in a population.

The palace itself is massive and always seen as almost deserted.  There are very few servants, or even bodyguards around.  The sultan is absolutely disconnected from the people he ""rules"" and spends his time playing with his little toys.  His main concern is to get Jasmine married to a prince, most likely to form an alliance with a neighboring kingdom, which could be very useful if a civil war (or worse) were to break out.  As for the ""law"" that a princess has to marry a prince, that may be a lie they tell the general population to keep them from thinking above their station.  When Jafar tries to get the sultan to give him Jasmine, his response is not about the law, but instead that he's ""too old.""  The sultan is obsessed with getting Jasmine married off, and only a marriage that would stregthen his kingdom will do.  The sultan knows his kingdom is a house of cards, and he's doing the best he knows to avoid the inevitable collapse.  But even the sultan doesn't know everything about Agrabah.

Jafar carefully reads up on the old teachings and writings of Agrabah, and learns that Agrabah as he sees it, is a city that should never have existed.  It has no infrastructure, resources, military, or anything that makes a society successful.  Think about it as Las Vegas, but without all the technology or support that makes modern Las Vegas possible.  The palace was created in the middle of nowhere, in the desert, all at once by a genie.  The founder of Agrabah wished for his dream palace (first wish), and for all the people that would make his dream palace a nice place to live (second wish).  This doesn't violate the rules the genie has for wishes, he's creating new people, not bringing people back from the dead, killing, or making anyone fall in love.  

The founder's third wish came at the end of his life, as he lay dying.  It was a vague wish to make him live forever and keep him and all his possessions safe.  The genie did the best he could, turning him into something a bit more durable than a deterioating human body, an indestructible flying carpet.  The genie kept him safe by locking himself away in the magic cave, with the carpet, ensuring that nobody would wish Agrabah or the founder away.  

Meanwhile, ten thousand years later, we see the dream palace has been deserted.  The decendants of the original second-wish-created people gradually figured out that the palace was not how the rest of the world is, and that it was impossible to rebel against the sultan in the palace, or do anything to destroy the dream palace (protected by magic). They all just left, creating an ad hoc city that surrounds the palace, while they figure out how to take the sultan down.  Eventually, that plan was forgotten about, and a very formal social structure was formed.  But even that is on the verge of collapse now, and this is why Jafar needs the lamp and power.

An outside army would simply pillage the surrounding city, if they ever found out how impotent the dream palace was.  With a city picked clean, Jafar, the Sultan and Jasmine would be forced to simply live out their lives abandoned and alone in a prison of their ancestor's making.

He also says that he wants to live alone and that he doesn't need anybody else.  At the same time he's making these wishes, Harry shows up for the first time.  Harry and Marv spend the rest of the film going after Kevin, who is smart enough and capable enough to defend his home against them, but in the end is only saved when he is willing to accept the friendship of the snow shoveler.  He knows that he needs other people in his life, and that his family is more important than he had realized before.  Harry and Marv disappear right before his family manages to make it back to him for a warm loving Christmas.

Now skip ahead a year.  Kevin loves his family and doesn't want to be away from them, but the Kevin who survived using Buzz's limited savings and coupons and who made ornaments with his father's fish hooks and a glue gun is replaced by a Kevin with flashy toys and a somewhat greedy nature.  When he becomes separated from his family, instead of trying to find them or go to the police he makes his way to the fanciest hotel in the city, where he charges an extravagant amount of things to his father's credit card.  At this point Harry and Marv return to his life, this time not threatening his home, but money that's to be given to a children's hospital (I think.  That's the one detail I can't remember).  After Kevin is forced out of the hotel and learns of Harry and Marv's plans he goes after them to help those less fortunate than him.  After this he gives up his presents and goes to see the bird lady to give her a gift because he now understands that it is better to give than to receive.

With Harry and Marv being Christmas spirits it explains how they are able to do so much.  They are supernatural entities, which explains how they are able to quickly recover from injuries that would either permanently cripple or kill regular men.  They also manage to escape from prison and find Kevin hundreds of miles from where he lived in a city of several million people.

The snow shoveler and bird lady might also count as spirits sent to help Kevin, as they both represent a kind of foil to Kevin.  The snow shoveler is an old man who desperately wants to be with his family but they don't want him around, which is the opposite of Kevin's wish.  The bird lady is a poor homeless woman while Kevin is a spoiled rich kid.

After Home Alone 2, Kevin has learned his lesson, and no longer needs the Help of Harry and Marv.  This is why they were never seen again and why there were no more Home Alone movies.

1371098901.0,205,self.FanTheories,1g8z1e,"Willy Wonka is a modern slave owner--William Candie, the distant descendant of none other than the infamous Calvin Candie.",262,57,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1g8z1e/willy_wonka_is_a_modern_slave_ownerwilliam_candie/,"I have had a revelation. I've always believed that Willy Wonka is a slave owner. I mean, look at the oompa loompas. They are trapped in the factory, picking Willy Wonka's candied cotton, and getting paid nothing but food and shelter. I didn't have all the pieces to prove it though. Now I do.

Willy Wonka is actually none other than William Candie, the descendant of infamous slave owner Calvin Candie. William leaves the US after the end of the sharecropping era of American history to the UK in order to recreate ""Candyland""--the ultimate plantation. 

To build a plantation, you need enslaved labor. He decides to do this by kidnapping/tricking the oompa loompas into working in his modern plantation for food and sustenance. Interestingly, the original editions of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory portrayed the oompas loompas as ""African pygmies"" (I couldn't even make this up). Wonka says he's saving the oompa loompas from being preyed upon or attacked by ""Whangdoodles, Hornswogglers and Snozzwangers""--whatever the fuck those are. He's obviously full of shit. I mean, he's not really a reliable narrator, is he? Any slave owner would immediately say he was acting in the best interest of the enslaved to justify his position (see [Uncle Ruckus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CcMEuCu8To#t=4m44s) ), Meanwhile, the oompa loompas have turned orange due to jaundice from a lack of vitamin C. They sing songs as they go about their slave work--much like the slave folk tunes that Candie--excuse me ""Wonka""--wants to hear as he goes about his day. They're one step away from singing zippity do da. 

Let's go back to the direct link between ""Wonka"" and Calvin Candie. Notice the elaborate style of dress that's so reminiscent of the antebellum South. I mean, the cane, the top hat, the waistcoat. It's clearly a deliberate stylistic choice. Notice the short tempers and angry outbursts that are hallmarks of the Candie family (e.g. [“YOU GET NOTHING!”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5QGkOGZubQ)  [“SOLD!”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEofBHTrwzQ) ). Also, why does Mr. ""Wonka"" have an American accent when the plant is based in the United Kingdom? Clearly, he's not from the UK, but American in origin. We can also look at the way he has laid out the ""chocolate factory"". When we first enter the plantation, do we see large industrial machinery? No. It's an elaborate agricultural display of various cash crops that help Wonka complete his sick need to recreate a modern plantation paradise. Also--Candyland?! A chocolate factory?! Really?!

Finally, there's the suspicious deal with the global golden ticket competition. How is it that there isn't a single minority golden ticket winner? Statistically, that makes absolutely no sense. With a billion Chinese people and a billion Indian people, you would think that the chances of a non-white participant getting a golden ticket would be at least be closer to 1 out of 3 (This doesn't take into account age demographics. Obviously, older folks and babies would not be represented in this calculation, but considering the wide popularity of Wonka products, e.g. Uncle Joe, it's not a stretch to say everyone enjoys a Wonka bar. Add in folks from Africa and Latin America and 1 out of 3 seems like a fair bet). 

There are two clear reasons why Willy Wonka avoids having any non-white contestants. 1) He's a slave owning racist. 2) He doesn't want the oompa loompas to see a minority leave the factory of their own free will. This would create cognitive dissonance and raise the possibility of oompa loompas seeking emancipation. By only having white guests, Willy Wonka avoids the possibility of a Django-esque figure from stepping in and freeing his enslaved workers. 

And a chocolatier—what an amazing cover! Beloved by nearly everyone on the face of the goddamn planet and free to do whatever he damn well pleases because people love his candy.

In S3E13-14, Troy and Abed work on constructing a fort made entirely of pillows, until Troy decides he would rather break the Guinness Record and starts using blankts.

[SPOILERS],248,48,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/16nui5/looper_theory_why_do_they_bother_to_close_the/,"One question about Looper that bothers me:  What's the point of ""closing a loop""?  Why execute the Loopers at all, why have them do it themselves, and why give them a ""golden payday"" to do it?

**Theory:** The Loopers know too much about the bad guys and must be killed to protect their secrets (i.e., we use illegal time machines to hide executions.)

The issue with this is that the Loopers don't *know* anything about the operations in the future.  They could tell the authorities that someone is using time travel to hide murders, but they don't know who or where or why. Even assuming that killing them is good sense, there's no reason to wait thirty years if you could kill them before it becomes impossible to hide bodies. Even if you have to wait thirty years and send them back, why suicide? Why a golden payday? Protecting secrets doesn't explain it.

**Theory:** It's the nature of time travel that Loopers have to kill themselves.

The issue with this is that Loopers aren't time travelers. There's nothing special about Loopers, the same job could be handled by a well-timed garbage truck or a deep body of water. Unless someone decides to ""close the loop"", they *never* time-travel. There's nothing that separates them from the Gatmen, so why are they obliged to ""close the loop""?

**Theory:** The reason for closing the loop isn't in the future at all.

The whole operation running the Loopers seems strange. Why are these guys treated like rockstars? Couldn't any doofus with a shotgun do the job for a fraction of the payout?

...because the executions are just a convenient excuse.  The reason that the Looper organization exists is to destroy the enemies of the organization in the future by ruining their lives in the present - *by recruiting them as Loopers.*. The Loopers get money, drugs, girls, cars, fancy clothes.  Abe said it himself - he saw Joe, put a gun in his hand, and changed his life.  What if Joe's life was supposed to be something different - a cop, or a politician, or some other righteous thorn in the Mob's side? Send someone back with the info, track him down as a kid, and make him into a murdering addict. It's the Terminator strategy, except instead of sending a killer robot, they just hand the kid drug money.

This is why they make a big deal out of ""closing the loop"".  Just in case you start to think that you're going to live forever and you should try and fight to make the world a better place...they make sure you know that you won't, and you can't.  I'm not going to save the world and live happily ever after - I shoot myself in a cornfield. For money.

His wings even pop out at random moments. He's a masculine caricature, virile, controlling and demanding of everyone.

1369330848.0,196,self.FanTheories,1ewys2,[Doctor Who] The Doctor lied to Amy in The Angels Take Manhattan so that she and Rory could live a normal life together,280,84,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1ewys2/doctor_who_the_doctor_lied_to_amy_in_the_angels/,"Ok so this is a little late considering when the episode came out, but I was catching up on the last half season of DW with Amy and Rory. One thing that particularly bugged me was the ending of [The Angels Take Manhattan](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xu4eja_doctor-who-2005-s07e05-the-angels-take-manhattan-internal-hdtv-xvid-afg_shortfilms) (skip to 36:00 in).

This is my first post here, so sorry if I make a mistake or something.

Ok anyways, Rory gets sent back 50 years before he was born, and Amy makes the emotional decision to join him even though the doctor says he can pretty much never see them again because of ""too many paradoxes"" caused by the angels.

Now we could take this *explanation* at face value, but considering everything that happened I disagree with the Doctor's reasoning for not going back. I think he lied to Amy in order to get her to go back in time and live a normal happy life with Rory. Without the *threat* of the dr randomly showing up, they can finally get along with leading their normal life, settle down, and start a family (they adopt a boy in P.S. in 1946 named Anthony Brian Williams).

Here's my reasoning for thinking the dr purposefully lied to Amy so she could live a happy life without him.


* One of the ""rules"" for the Matt Smith version of the Doctor is ""the doctor lies"". We can't really take anything he says as the truth because of that rule. He could've been telling the truth about the paradoxes, but only he and river actually understood how it worked. River was in on the lie in order to let her parents live a normal life. The audience, and Amy has to take their word for why the TARDIS cannot just go back and pick rory up


* During the episode of the angels take manhattan River says to amy and Rory ""never let him see you age"". Now why would she say that if it never comes up as a plot point after that moment. The Doctor never gets a chance to see them age anyways. It adds to a theme we've seen throughout series 6 and 7 where Amy and rory are getting older, and it's about time to settle down. Every time they do start to settle, the dr shows up for another adventure.

* Amelia Pond was and will always be the ""girl who waited"". As long as there is a chance of the dr showing up again she is always going to hold out a little bit of hope that he'll come back for a new adventure. She'd be less inclined to start a real family and settle down if shes holding out hope and waiting on the dr. By telling her he can never see her again if she goes back in time, the dr pretty much gets rid of any hope Amy could have of the dr showing up for another adventure. There's no point waiting on the dr, time for real life to start.

* at the end of TATM the dr hugs both amy and rory. When he hugs them he closes his eyes for seemingly no reason (36:44 in the video). One explanation for why he could've closed his eyes is he saw the angel in the graveyard, and he was letting it move into place so it could ""zap"" either amy or rory fairly quickly without being frozen from being seen. He kisses both of them on the head because he knows what he has done, and he most likely will never get to say goodbye to whoever the angel chooses to take first. Now the opening shot for the graveyard scene shows an angel statue (36:00) it is supposed to be implied that that is the angel that zapped rory, but about a minute later (37:18 to be exact) post-hug the camera does another wide shot and that statue hasn't moved. So the audience thinks the angel didn't move during his eye closing hug. Well the statue we see isn't the real weeping angel. It's just a statue. The wide shots are meant to throw the audience off. The wide shot statue has longer hair and a softer face than the weeping angel that zapped rory. The statue we saw wasn't a weeping angel, so that's why we don't see it move after the dr gives his hug.

* The dr knows that continued travels with him usually lead to heartache, pain, and even sometimes death. River warns them their travels eventually won't have a happy ending multiple times during the series. Amy &amp; Rory truely love each other, but they also love the dr and river so of course they'll almost always agree to going on a new adventure. If the dr decides to just leave them and never show up again, he knows that they'll feel like he abandoned them. He needed to find a way to let Rory and Amy off easily so they could be happy, without upsetting them and making them hate the dr. Sending one back through an angel, and then lying to the other telling them he can't ever go back because of paradoxes was his way of letting rory and amy go. He has seen throughout the series both Rory and Amy will do crazy things to be together (rory waiting as the centurion for example) so he knows that if one goes back then the other will follow.


* Amy lived ~65 years after she went back through the angel. They were sent back ~50 years before their birth so they'd be about between 1938-1940. Amy would've lived until about 2003-2006. I haven't finished the Clara Oswin Oswald parts of this last season, but if the dr is telling amy the truth that ""he can never see her again"" then that puts a huge limit on where the dr can travel. If he can't see her again, then that would mean he can't go back to a year where amy was alive otherwise his supposed paradox will tear new york apart. Unless of course he was lying about the paradox being like it is, and he can still go back to any time he wants as long as he avoids amy. (side note: The dr knows he's sending them back to wwii, but he is okay with that. He has seen that Rory survives into his 80s, and amy could not be a soldier during the conflict since she was a girl. Amy is perfectly safe in New York during the war. The doctor knows they come out of it okay)


* when rory gets sent back (at about 37:25) they are all piling into the TARDIS. The dr and river go in, but they basically shut the door in amy's face. As amy is opening the door to go inside, that's when rory calls her back to look at the gravestone. Why would the dr shut the door on amy knowing she was coming in right behind him? Three reasons. First so the dr can tell river to go along with his plan and agree with his ""paradox"" explanation (river has already acknowledged that traveling with the dr isn't good for the couple. So he knows she'll agree with the dr's explanation in order to help make the lie more believable. She knows it really is what is best for both Rory and Amy.). Second, is so there are less eyes around in the graveyard to freeze the angel, it's only rory and amy there to freeze it and they don't know it's there. Third is so he can protect river and himself from being zapped by the angel, and being the ones sent back in time. If the doctor, or river is sent back, then they would pretty much have to use the tardis and go back and get them. His whole plan of lying about not being able to go back would unravel.


* I'm sure there are other things throughout the season to help me justify why the dr would lie to amy and rory for their own good, but I haven't been able to really analyze it all except for TATM episode. Something just didn't sit quite right with the ending to me.


**tl;dr** The Doctor lies to Amy about not being able to go get Rory because of a *paradox*. IMO something just didn't seem quite right about that whole ending sequence. He lies so they can move on, settle down, and live a normal happy life together. When he saw the angel in the graveyard, he formulated a plan right then and there to let rory and amy off easy from their adventures so they wouldn't feel abandoned by the doctor. The dr meant for one of the two to get sent back because he knows the other one would decide to go back in order to be with him.

I decided to “borrow” some materials in my brother’s lab.  He’s so preoccupied with his work he won’t notice a few yellow rocks or some orange juice stuff missing.  Hopefully some of this trash can give me the edge I need.

In Iron Man 3, Happy Hogan, Stark's former bodyguard and new head of security for Stark Industries ends up being severely injured and hospitalized. Happy, earlier in the film is very protective towards Pepper Potts, which is what he should be in this job but it seems like he has an emotional bond with her. When Happy is hospitalized and in a coma, Tony Stark tells a nurse to leave the television on for Downton Abbey, as it is a show that Happy loves.  
The clip of Downton Abbey that was featured in Iron Man 3 was of Branson and Lady Sybil. Branson is her driver, a servant to this elegant upper class lady. Branson loves Sybil, despite her being very much above him and out of her reach.
Happy Hogan loves this show because he relates to Branson in Downton Abbey because he is in a very similar situation himself as he also loves Pepper Potts but knows he can never be with her. Happy watches Downton because he knows that Sybil and Branson will eventually be together and he fantasies that he will find love in the same way.
So Happy isn't happy. 

**EDIT:** 
The director (Shane Black) and writer (Drew Pearce) have revealed that in a previous draft of the script, Happy did love Pepper.

Off the top of my head here are the biggest similarities:

1. They both have a rich dad who finances their business.
2. They were both fat, became thin and are obsessed with exercise.White Goodman was fat as an adult and Tony Perkis was a former fat kid.


My theory is that after the events of Heavyweights Tony Perkis suffered a nervous breakdown and began to gorge on food as a way to comfort himself which ended up with him becoming fat again. He manages to become thin again and regains his passion for fitness and wants to try once again to get people into shape. There's only one problem-his reputation as a fitness guru is tarnished beyond repair in the area where Heavyweights took place-and his father doesn't trust him enough to try to help.

His only chance at a new beginning and redeeming himself in his father's eyes is to start over somewhere new. So he changes his name to White Goodman and moves across the country to where Dodgeball takes place. His father gives him another shot and invests in what will become Globo-Gym. Through a new found drive White/Tony is able to turn Globo-Gym into the hugely successful business we see at the start of the movie. There's only one problem:Peter LaFleur

Peter, with his slacker attitude and emphasis on making the members of his gym feel good instead of fit, reminds Tony of that fat camp counselor who ruined his life. The average joes members remind of those damn kids. It doesn't help that like the fat camp counselor the girl Tony is more interested in Peter. Average Joe's has to burn. We all know how the rest of the movie goes and how it ends. Speaking of endings, what do we last see Tony/White doing? Gorging himself on food.

tl;dr Tony Perkins went cray for a while, got fat, got thin, moved across the country and changed his name to White Goodman.

But what's he really doing? Linguistically, he's pluralizing things, right? Now why's he doing that? Smeagol struggles with a dual identity -- his own self and his old companion Deagol whom he strangled to gain exclusive ownership of the One Ring. Therein lies the answer. He projects his dualistic nature upon everything he interacts with, assuming all things to grapple with a duplicitous existence as he himself does.

Indeed, the One Ring is called by a curiously singular name, the ""precious"" (thanks to HeroinJesus for bringing this up). For Smeagol, the ring is a totem of his past life when his mind was his and his alone, or perhaps he is simply drawn to the autonomy of the single ring that holds such a ubiquitous dominion -- it gives him hope that as Smeagol the individual, he may reclaim his mind yet.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,1364065554.0,,,True,t3_1aueqa,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1aueqa/lotr_the_secret_of_smeagols_speech/,

He gets on the train and immediately finds a spot. The train was quiet and clean. Everyone was minding their own business. He falls to sleep and remains undisturbed. Jerry can sleep on a public train without a problem much like how he can be himself in public without worrying about other people's opinions.

Much like his real life in which everyone around him is constantly finding themselves in jams while Jerry always stays the same, like how he always ""breaks even"" playing poker.


Elaine:
Elaine attempts to connect with a fellow woman and it never really hits off greatly. It ends up just being mild small talk and just when Elaine feels like she's doing well, she remarks on how she's going to a ""Lesbian Wedding"" and the woman realizes how abnormal Elaine is. Just like how Kramer once remarked that Elaine is a ""Girl with guy friends"" when Elaine attempted to bond with George's fiance Susan. Elaine then finds herself in trouble and instead of finding a solution, she gets angry until the solution resolves itself and she ends up angry and bitter.


George:
George finds himself in a lucky spot next to a beautiful woman, just like how he often finds himself dating beautiful women yet still believes women do not fancy him. The women begins to chat him up and he proceeds to feel more confident with himself. He then risks a job interview to chase this woman, much like his real life in which he often lists women-chasing higher on the list of priorates than following his ambitions. George then thinks everything is going well and starts to wonder if he's a real adult when he muses on how being in a hotel room with this woman is like being a classic male lead in an old movie (the William Holden remark). The woman then ignores him by using him just to make money (IE feeling better about herself much like how most women who date George are just trying to feel better or going through a ""phase""). Much like George's life, things never work out.


Kramer:
Kramer's experience is hectic and crazy. He immediately cant find a seat and just like real life, he's always worried someone's out to get him. (people taking the spots). (Fat kid he sits next to looks a bit like Newman). Kramer then overcomes common sense and overhears two guys talking about making money on horses. So much like his daily life, he spends time and effort on risky and probably wasteful things yet he still wins big. Kramer then finds himself in a jam with a guy chasing him and is saved by a homeless undercover cop who Kramer did not realize was there, the same way he often gets saved from things yet he doesn't realize it. And much like Kramer's life, he always comes out alright or having gained something (in this case, cash).

Clearly, that was his intention.  I'm saying he didn't actually land the killing blow.  Rather, the whole thing was staged to look that way for a very deliberate reason.

Look at Obi-Wan in the moment before Vader strikes - he sees Luke watching, he gets a devious, knowing smile on his face, and then he enters a standing meditative posture.  We already know that Obi-Wan's a deceitful little bastard with the way he constantly twists facts, be it something large like lying to Luke about his parentage or even something small like talking about how ""*we* fell into that nest of gundarks"" when it was really just him that fell in.  He knew two things going into the Death Star mission:  that he was likely to die at Vader's hand, and that he had to stick around as a Force ghost to aid Luke (which is what he was referring to as ""becoming more powerful than Vader could possibly imagine"").

As we see in Episode VI, Yoda dies in his bed and then fades into nothingness.  In Episode I, Qui-Gon is killed in battle against Darth Maul (though he wasn't biologically dead until some minutes later, he damn sure didn't die peacefully).  Thus, we can infer that a body disappearing means that the person wasn't killed violently and/or by someone else.  Now, [watch the moment where Vader strikes](http://youtu.be/8kpHK4YIwY4?t=1m54s) at the end of the duel with Obi-Wan.  The cloak is empty and begins to fall *before* the killing blow is landed.  That means that when Vader was in mid-swing, Obi-Wan was already dead.  My conclusion?  Obi-Wan wasn't just centering himself in the manner necessary to turn into a ghost upon death - he was also using the Force to *kill himself* at the last possible second, thus framing Vader for his murder &amp; turning Luke against his father.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,1373132330.0,,,True,t3_1hr97z,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1hr97z/star_wars_darth_vader_didnt_kill_obiwan_kenobi/,

What part of my computer requires the agonizing death of programs as they fight for my grim amusement? Is this what really happens when I switch tabs in Firefox? Of course not. I also don't think it's the pixels on the monitor brutally murdering each other every time the screen refreshes, though that is a pretty funny notion.

Where are they? They are inside a computer, but they can't use the internet?  I think not. They are in some hellish nightscape where there is no food and all people do is kill each other and pretend to have sex with their jumpsuits on. Tron: Legacy makes the whole thing unremittingly worse by reminding you that the programs feel grief when their friends die. Legacy also strongly implies that this is their entire world -- that there is nothing else, because in the second movie they really *never* go anywhere that they didn't go in the first movie.

The real reason for this, of course, is that both movies were made in the exact same way. There was a writer's strike, and Disney executives wanted a project that didn't require writers. Bam, Tron, both times. Both Tron movies represent the state of the art at the time of their creation; they represent the best movie you can possibly make without a writer.  The first time it was a little goofy and formulaic, they hadn't quite gotten the Star Wars adventure story down pat yet. The second time around the Hero's Journey was so deeply ingrained into our collective consciousness that the creators of the film, who were all intelligent people but definitely not writers, could navigate it as blindly as a rat in a maze. Tron: Legacy is the hero's journey reduced to a computer program, as in 10 GOTO OLD MAN.

This leads to a fascinating situation in Legacy, where nobody has anything to say! This is the first film where nobody has a cell phone because nobody has anything to say. What would be the point of calling anyone? ""Hi, it's dark, I'm playing frisbee, soon we all die."" But it's such an extremely well-made film that this actually becomes an artistic strength!

Tron: Legacy is a strange and beautiful film about people who just can't find the words to say how they feel inside. A father meets his son for this first time in twenty years and what he says is, "".........I guess I'll see ya for dinner."" People either describe what they're doing or they look at each other, lost. The most memorable line is ""You're really messing with my zen thing."" The silence in the spaces between people in Tron: Legacy is every bit as terrifying as any shoegazer film about a profoundly chilly divorce.

The mass effect of all this cool-video-game-action and awesome endless-city-at-night and global pandemic of cat-got-your-tongue means that they are, effectively, in hell. The Tron world is the worst place ever, with all the nightmares of our dead past and none of the benefits of future. People are killing each other with frisbees for the entertainment of those who are the next to die. Although the Programs feel subhuman, and are lead to believe that they are a slave species, they clearly have the ability to feel pain, grief, fear, and sorrow.  They can regret their condition.  They can betray each other.  But when Tron meets the woman he loves in the first film, it takes a minute for her to recognize him.

The first conclusion is that they are literally in hell, but I don't think so, because the programs are shown to be totally different from the Users, and obey different laws (I speculate that Programs may respawn after they die, but that dying is so traumatic that it wipes their memories away). So they are not in a place of karmic punishment because of their sins, they are just in A Place. A place with its own rules, laws, and physics.

Falling is clearly fatal in Tron. Gravity is the only constant of their universe (conservation of energy and matter seems to be rather casually violated, especially in the first film). There is no food (note the bizarre feast Flynn sets for Sam, where Sam is the only one that eats) -- they exist on Source, or water/energy/whatever. Time goes infinitely slower there (Flynn has been in there for centuries, that's why he forgot how food is supposed to taste).

Everything is closed, lost, hidden, dark, forgotten, obscured, and guarded by bright red sonderkommandoes. The funniest thing in the whole Tron universe is a byte that says ""Yes"" and ""No"" at inappropriate times.

I submit that Tron is about the modern world of the fey. This is what technology has done to the faeries. The world of Titiana and Oberon is gone, paved over, and utterly forgotten. Tron is the world of what our pastoral imagination has become.

Link only ever battled Ganon and saved Zelda once long ago, and each game was just that one story being passed down and retold throughout time with each different storyteller adding their own embellishments.

While this theory no longer officially works for the Zelda franchise, it can be used to explain the shared elements of the Mario and Zelda universes (Chain Chomps, Octoroks).  *Super Mario Bros.* never happened.  It is a retelling of the Heroes' of Time stories that is so far removed it is now radically different and merges events from the different Links' journeys into one tale.  The pig monster Ganon has become a fire breathing reptile.  The 8 dungeons Link had to search out and complete on his quest have evolved into 8 worlds with a death trap filled castle at the end of each.  The hero no longer starts out in green garb and replaces it with magical red clothing later, he is now two twin brothers: one who wears green and one who wears red. This detail might have been borrowed from the *Four Swords* Link, or from the fact that the story says there were multiple Heroes Of Time who all looked similar and had the same name (the *Mario* brothers).  In fact, all of Link's weapons and items have evolved into Mario's bizarre arsenal of power-ups.  Furthermore, the society that is now retelling this story has lost so much of the original history that they no longer know the names of the kingdom it took place in or of any of the major characters.  Thus Hyrule becomes the Mushroom Kingdom, Zelda becomes Toadstool/Peach, Ganon becomes Koopa/Bowser.  The other Mario games are further corruptions of the legend of Zelda as it is continually retold.

This theory explains why Mario games' plots are so repetitive (including how one man could be unlucky enough to have 2 different girlfriends kidnapped by a gorilla and a dragon-turtle) and why they're so weird (they're retellings of events that happened so far in the past that modern people no longer understand the society they took place in).  

I've even come up with a second theory to explain certain Mario easter eggs in Zelda games, like the portraits in *Ocarina* or the Mario mask in *Majora's Mask*.  Perhaps a man who looked like Mario was an important figure or popular folk character in ancient Hyrule.  Some of his likenesses that we saw in the Zelda games survived, and influenced modern day people's interpretation of what Hyrulians/Mushroom Kingdomers looked like.

tl;dr: The Zelda games aren't retellings of the same story, they're all parts of one long multi-generational saga from history.  The Mario games, however, are retellings of that story so many years later in time that they are now extremely bizarre much like some of our own fairy tales.  Therefore, Mario games are the actual legend of Zelda that is passed down.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1a9dgy,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1a9dgy/mario_is_a_retelling_of_zelda/,

Also the other Australian character was played by John Jarrett who featured in the outback horror film Wolf Creek,  a film which Tarantino is said to be a fan. There is also a scene in Death Proof which the car crashes through a billboard with Wolf Creek advertised. Tarantino is also a fan of the D grade Aussie film Houseboat Horror, similar in a way to Wolf Creek.

Wikipedia breaks down its characteristics into four categories.

1. Social Interaction
2. Restricted and repetitive interests and behavior
3. Speech and language
4. Motor and sensory perception

So let's do it piece by piece

One. Social Interaction

Perhaps the biggest characteristic of Asperger's Syndrome is social interaction. People with Asperger's tend to not pick up on non-verbal social cues. As Wikipedia puts it....

People with AS may not be as withdrawn around others compared to those with other, more debilitating, forms of autism; they approach others, even if awkwardly. For example, a person with AS may engage in a one-sided, long-winded speech about a favorite topic, while misunderstanding or not recognizing the listener's feelings or reactions, such as a wish to change the topic of talk or end the interaction. This social awkwardness has been called ""active but odd"". This failure to react appropriately to social interaction may appear as disregard for other people's feelings, and may come across as insensitive.

This pretty much describes Spongebob doesn't it? He obviously annoys Squidward, Mrs. Puff, Mr. Krabs, and others. But he doesn't seem to catch on. Because they usually don't explicitly tell him that he is irritating, he doesn't realize it. He is immune to deciphering social cues. Children with AS appear to have particular weaknesses in areas of nonliteral language that include humor, irony, teasing, and sarcasm. Although individuals with AS usually understand the cognitive basis of humor, they seem to lack understanding of the intent of humor to share enjoyment with others. That is Spongebob in a nutshell.

Two. Restricted and repetitive interests and behavior

Spongebob's obsessions with what would seem to us as trivial things are a pointer. This would explain his unhealthy obsession with Krabby Patties, jellyfishing, and ka-rah-tay with Sandy.

Three. Speech and Language

Speech abnormalities for people with AS include verbosity, abrupt transitions, literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuance, use of metaphor meaningful to only the speaker, auditory perception deficits, unusually pedantic, formal or idiosyncratic speech, and oddities in loudness, pitch, intonation, prosody, and rhythm. Sounds like Spongebob doesn't it? He is constantly shifting in tone and volume. His sentences range from yelling to whispering at the drop of a hat.

Four. Motor and sensory perception

This would explain many things such as his unusual weakness and his inability to get his boating license.

I know that Anakin has been called ""The Poster Child"" of the Clone Wars do to his heroics in the war, but I don't think most of his heroics would be published in such a way that most people would find out out about it. Therefore, I think the ""Clone Wars"" exists as a form of entertainment/propaganda (Not necessarily television, but the Star Wars equivalent to that) in attempt to gain support for the Republic by glorifying the exploits of Anakin and the rest of the Jedi order. 

Nothing that specifically occurs during the Clone Wars is explicitly mentioned in Ep. III and I think some of the things that happened to the boys would be at least mentioned. Things like fighting multiple Sith, Grievous etc. The first time Obi-Wan and Anakin meet Grievous on ""The Invisible Hand"" in Ep. III, they seem surprised as to his appearance, Anakin even commenting on his height. 

I'm sure these events happened in some capacity during the war, but the series exists to glorify, embellish and and put a positive spin on the actions of the Republic during the war. 

And ""The Clone Wars"" doesn't strike me as being as ""serious"" as the actual movies. Maybe that's because it's a cartoon, but that's just the vibe I get from watching it, it just doesn't seem like it's in the same stream as a lot of the other EU stuff.

The WW2 Savage then uses this knowledge to overthrow Hitler as Fuhrer and arm the Nazis with War Wheels and other advanced weapons, thereby turning the tide of the war against the Allies and making himself immortal Nazi ruler of the world. 

The Justice League (still in the present, but shielded from the effects of the time change by Green Lantern), see the world change to reflect this new rule, including a Batman who now leads an underground resistance against Savage's regime. They travel back through time to World War II, where they help the Allies fight back against Savage, eventually defeating him. After Savage's defeat, the Germans put Hitler back in charge, and eventually lose the war. Returning to their own time, the League sees that the world has returned to normal.

There's just one huge problem with all of this: When Savage's high-tech Nazi forces were defeated, that wouldn't undo all the damage to the timeline that he had already caused. He left entire factories around, and would have drastically advanced scientific research in multiple areas, to say nothing of all of the battles that would have taken place differently from their original track. When the Justice League returns to their present, though, everything seems to have returned to normal, and nothing seems out of place to them.

This is because the DC Animated Universe takes place in a stable time loop in which Vandal Savage had *always* traveled back in time and disrupted World War II. This can be seen as early as Batman: The Animated Series, where advanced computers and self-aware robots exist at the same time as police zeppelins and popularly-used Tommy guns. The rest of the DCAU reflects this: although it ostensibly takes place sometime from the 1990s to the early 2000s, its technology is vastly more advanced than that of our universe. They have manned missions to Mars, weaponized lasers, powered exoskeletons, and any number of high-tech devices that seem out of place, all as a result of Vandal Savage's giving technology a major boost back in the 1940s.

In fact, if the Justice League had had a history buff in their group, they would have been able to tell them all about the madman who overthrew Hitler for some time back during WW2. History books in the DC Animated universe would have recorded all of the events of the episode *before* we saw the League travel back in time. The specifics would have been lost: perhaps the Allies would have hushed up the fact that they came *that* close to losing the war, and were only saved by the intervention of a group of costumed heroes who disappeared immediately afterward. But nevertheless, the DC Animated Universe always took place in a universe of super science, all of which would have originated with the time incursion back in the 1940s.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,1358133686.0,,,True,t3_16j28n,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/16j28n/the_animated_justice_league_was_taking_place_in/,

In *Ocean of Fear*, we can see that Finn is clearly afraid of the ocean. Why? He seems like a fairly courageous young man, and as he mentions, he has never been afraid of other types of water. I postulate this: Finn's birth mother died drowning in the ocean, and although he remembers it he attempts to repress this fact. A few points to support this:

* In the episode *The Creeps*, we see the ghost lady appear out the wall in the mansion. I believe this is the ghost of Finn's mother. To this end, she has long, seaweed colored hair, and her skin is blue and looks very watery, almost as if her appearance reflected her death: drowning at sea. She also looks very happy in this scene, and who can blame her? She has been given a chance to see her child again. Shortly after this, Finn runs to the window to see huge waves crashing up against the walls of the mansion, another reference to his mothers death. Despite having been exposed to a number of other ghosts in his life, it is the particular incident that Finn chooses to block out by putting the memory in ""the vault"" and forgetting about it.

* In the Farmworld timeline, Finn's mother strongly resembles the ghost lady seen in the mansion. This point is less relevant, as ghosts (as I understand it) resemble their mortal selves in some way, and Finn's biological mother would look rather different in the original timeline.

* When the King Worm hypnotizes him, the ghost lady appears again, along with other memories that were (presumably) in ""the vault"". Not only that, but a great deal of water begins to pour from his bellybutton, immediately before the ghost lady appears, again showing her connection to the ocean and his own fear. He is manifesting his fears, and drowning, being his chief fear, is shown by the appearance of his mothers ghost in the water.

* In every manifestation of the ghost lady, she appears oddly bloated, unlike most ghosts. This is another reference to her death - she became swollen due to her death at sea, causing her to become bloated with seawater.

Finn knows how his mother died, at least on some level. He represses this fact though, and it only emerges when he is truly scared. hat's it. Comments and criticisms always appreciated.

Then, browsing regular old Fan Theories I saw a post claiming Monsters, Inc. is a prequel or a sequel to Foster's Home for Imaginary friends, and figured if that can be here, then dammit, so can my theory. So, here we go...

Willy Wonka (1971 Gene Wilder version) and The Joker (2008 Heath Ledger version) look somewhat similar, and both wear purple suits. I say, this is because The Joker IS Willy Wonka. See, Will had this big, one-time-only factory tour, and it went to hell. Kids got injured, he lost his fucking mind there for a second in the tunnel scene, and he gave away some of his greatest secrets to ungrateful brats. As shown in the aforementioned tunnel scene, Wonka was already close to the edge. This factory fiasco just pushed him over it. After giving his empire to a suitable heir, Willy flies away in his glass elevator, looking for a place to hide from the world. But, over the crime-ridden streets of Gotham City, his machine malfunctions. It crashes to the ground. Amazingly, Wonka survives with few injuries, getting the worst of it on the corners of his mouth. Insane from his life experiences, factory incident, and near-death experience, he turns to a life of crime. He works his way up through the ranks of Gotham's organized crime syndication until he himself is running a pretty tight crew (The best example of which is in the opening scene to The Dark Knight, the bank robbery). His managerial skills are impressive, as his underlings do not trust him at all and yet are fatally loyal to his commands. I conjecture he gained these skills as the founder and CEO of Wonka Chocolates. There, he was in charge of the Oompa Loompas, similarly faithful near-slaves. This wanton disregard for worker's rights interestingly enough indicates Wonka was always dangerous, and simply snapped, thus becoming The Joker. 

Again, this only applies to these specific portrayals of these two characters. Any evidence for or against these claims is appreciated.

To begin with, Batman represents the U.S. Wealthy, technologically advanced, violent (and in denial about it), self-righteous, and highly presumptuous of their role in the world - namely self-proclaimed ""police"" and enforcer of ""order"". He's a conservative version at that. Some have even said he's pretty much a fascist. The folks at Cracked have explored this issue (http://www.cracked.com/video_18175_why-batman-secretly-terrible-gotham.html). I think Nolan pretty much has set-up his Batman as an allegorical device for the U.S. 

Now, the trifecta of villains in the trilogy don't necessarily follow their order of appearance in U.S. history and some may actually embody more than one tendency, all 3 do represent a historical if not current rival. They are composites in a few cases.

Ras Al-Ghul and the League of Assassins basically represent Fascism. Namely of the more eugenics/Nazi kind. The propose nothing short of Social Darwinism helped along with some genocide and of the 3 represent the one tendency most seductive for Wayne since they appeal to his upbringing and background - the 1%. Of course Ras Al-Ghul considers Batman to be a potential ally - they have so much in common. In the end Batman rejects Ras Al-Ghuls heavy handedness just as the US rejects Germany's 

The Joker basically represents the anarchist threat (1900s) intertwined with the current ""terrorist"" threat post-9/11. I'm not the first to say this either (http://theboard.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/21/batman-and-the-war-on-terror/). Dark Knight was basically a commentary on the War on Terror. All Joker cares about is havoc. A perfect counter to the order obsessed Batman/US. 

Now, the third film. Based on what I have seen in the trailers I am going to argue that Bane represents Communism, and as such represents the most serious existential threat to Batman. Catwoman figures into this commentary on class and inequality as the common criminal/Mafia - the one that breaks the law to get ahead but push comes to shove will cheer on the 1% because in the end they would love to be one. Bane however is a revolutionary from a fictional Latin island nation in the Caribbean (hmmmm....?). This film is going to be about social class and inequality and the villain is obviously a ""Robin Hood"" figure coming to take from Wayne &amp; friends and give out to Gotham's wretched. Oh look, someone's said something about this angle too: http://douglasernstblog.com/2012/05/01/dark-knight-rises-trailer-drops-for-may-day-occupy-gotham/

That in a nutshell completes the circle in Nolan's films. Batman is the US and how the US faced down and eventually defeated its three most dangerous threats of the last century or so: Fascism, Terrorism, and Communism.

Apollo was a proud man whose entire persona was based on his champion boxing legacy.  When he's beaten by Rocky and subsequently retires, he tries to remain in the boxing community, first as a commentator, then as Rocky's trainer.  But Apollo is unable to accept a post-boxing lifestyle, and repeatedly mentions how much it hurts him to get old and unable to compete in the ring.  After helping Rocky defeat Clubber Lang, he calls in a favor which is to get a rematch with Rocky, away from the cameras and spotlight.  I'm not sure if his motivation is to see if he still has it, or maybe because he thinks he can fulfill his desire to compete in the boxing ring.

I'm guessing he lost to Rocky, causing him to sink further into post-boxing depression.  In Rocky IV, he sees Drago as a chance to get back in the spotlight against an amateur he probably thinks he can beat, thinking that he will be hailed as a hero for beating the Soviet's best fighter.

So he gets to the fight and in the first round gets pulverized and is barely conscious as he rests between rounds.  I think at this point he knows that this is it, and that he's probably going to die in the ring.  He pleads with Rocky to not throw in the towel anyways, as he cannot accept the fact that he's done as a boxer.  Even as he continues to take a beating he glares at Rocky as he holds the towel in his hands.  Eventually Drago finishes him off and he succumbs to the beating.

1371488078.0,184,self.FanTheories,1giwm0,Geography of Avatar the Last Airbender: Size of the planet [x-post from r/thelastairbender],237,53,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1giwm0/geography_of_avatar_the_last_airbender_size_of/,"So one thing that's always bothered/interested me in Avatar is the size of the planet they're on. Obviously it's not our Earth so the size could be anything. (Side note: They should really name the planet in Avatar.) The best way to estimate distance can come from two different episodes, Winter Solstice 1 &amp; 2 and the series finale. For the sake of simplicity, I will be using The winter solstice because I can estimate time better and the path traveled is along the equator. In these episodes they travel great distances that can be visibly measured on a world map.

The first major obstacle is estimating the speed of Appa. Appa is at least as fast as a fire navy ship because they are ahead of Zuko most of the way to Roku's Island. Based on my estimates (Wikipedia) Zuko's ship is similar to a Pre-dreadnought battleship in our world, which are steam powered. The average top speed is 16-18 knots which is about 21 mph (33 km/h). Based off this Appa can fly about 21 mph.

The next obstacle is figuring about how long it took the gaang to get from Senlin Village (village in Winter Solstice Part 1) to Roku's Temple. Aang solved the problem in Senlin Village at sunset on the day before the Winter Solstice. The time of sunset on the winter solstice varies every year. Times between the sunsets of the day before the solstice and the solstice barely differ, but either way it's going to be about 24 hours if they leave immediately. But what we also have to take into account is that they may have crossed several time zones and they're going westward and may have gained a few hours. Since we have no idea how big the planet is, I couldn't tell you how many time zones they crossed. But just by eyeing the map I don't think they crossed any.

So assuming that they traveled at 21 mph for 24 hours and Appa is a machine and didn't have to stop. We can estimate that Roku's temple is 504 miles away from Senlin Village. If I measure with a ruler on the map I'm using, 504 miles is approximately 1/2in. Or in other words 1 in=1008. Using this scale and measuring the entire map along the equator is 9 3/8 in. (you have to take into account the border they add on the map) 9 3/8 in would translate around to 9,450 miles along the equator. In comparison, the circumference of the Earth's equator is 24,901 miles. This means that the planet in Avatar is 38% the size of our Earth. These are all approximations of course. Feel free to improve this if you can.

Based off the sized measured above I can come to 4 completely different conclusions and/or theories.

1.  There is a lot more water on the planet in Avatar that isn't shown on the map. This would explain why the Fire Nation never attacks the Earth Kingdom from the east by going around the world, they would die because they ran out of supplies before they get to the Earth Kingdom.

2.  There is undiscovered land on the planet of Avatar on the other side of the world. This would lead to cool future stories but the problem is that the Avatar is the world's spirit and is failing his duty to about half the planet.

3.  The planet in Avatar is really small and has a small gravity. This would explain why non-benders can seem to jump so high. The problem with this is I'm not sure if it could hold an environment. The circumference of Titan, (Saturn's largest moon where Sci Fi movies all say we live after Earth) is about 10,000 miles which is close to the planet in Avatar.

4.  The planet in Avatar is flat similar to Narnia as mentioned in ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"". This also explains why the Fire Nation doesn't attack the Earth Kingdom from the East also. But Narnia is way more magical and Avatar seems more scientific in a sense.

Problems with my overall theory is that the distances in the series finale don't appear to match up but I have no way of knowing that for sure. Many of the measurements are approximations.

&gt; Why are there so many //

A simple tune, discussing the strange nature of humans getting interested by rainbows. Whimsical. *Innocent.*


We skip ahead.

Oh, that's nice. The lovers and the *dreamers*. Well, I mean, Cthulu is often called ""The Dreamer"", as he lies dreaming in r'lyeh, but that's pretty flimsy. 


&gt;Who said that every wish // 
Would be heard and answered // 
When wished on the morning star? 


Huh, that's a little gloomy for a kids song. Also, you're bringing up the Morning Star? strange. 


No, the song doesn't really kick in until the third verse. Then it betrays itself.

It's? So we're personifying the magical power of rainbows? Absolutely not. 


&gt;Have you been half asleep // 
And have you heard voices // 
I've heard them calling my name 


Holy shit. The members of the Cult of Cthulhu were ""summoned to him in their dreams"". And it's calling you by name? Jesus fuck! That's terrifying!

Oh god, Now Sailors? You mean like the leagues of sailors drowned over R'lyeh, called out to sea by their tyrant elder god? This is the *same* voice that calls you in the middle of the night? 


&gt;I've heard it too many times to ignore it // There's something that I'm supposed to be


Madness is setting in. The singer can no longer ignore it. There's something that he's supposed to be - namely, Cthulhu. That's right kids; the singer of the song is praying to be consumed (""May we be eaten first"" is a common Cthulhu cult chant.) 


So, maybe you agree with me, maybe you don't. But, see, I've got a trump card. Something you maybe didn't think about. Who made this song popular? Who introduced this song to billions?

I base this on the similarities between the common monster (The Thing, The Flood and Necromorphs).
Not only are these creatures incredibly similar in appearance but they seem to have an uncannily similar method of infecting hosts. The timelines also match roughly between The Forerunners discovering earth (Halo) and the estimated date of the crashed alien shipwreck which contained the thing, which is ""about"" 100,000 years ago.
Now this is where it gets interesting, the last time the rings (used to wipeout the flood in the event of an outbreak) were said to have been activated is also approximately 100,000 years ago, around the same time that the infected alien spacecraft crash-landed on earth, a forerunner inhabited planet. The alien in The Thing incident was, however, frozen and would not have starved, which is the method in which the rings destroy the flood and is awakened in 1982.
The events in Dead Space take place 18 years before the war with The Covenant began, by this time people had been colonizing and mining planets all over the galaxy. Planets such as Harvest and Reach could be counted among these planets. The events in Dead Space and the thing are both isolated incidents and it would be possible for the flood to remain largely a mystery by the time they are re-discovered in 2552, which is when Halo:CE takes place.

I own three of the golden collections and I've given every derivative of the classic cartoon series over the years at least one watch, and of course I HAD to watch ""The Looney Tunes Show"" when it first aired on Cartoon Network.

I am going to add a spoiler warning here, just in case.

I realized this just watching TV today, when a commercial for ""The Looney Tunes Show"" came on. It was prominently about Daffy, and the voice-over remarking on how much Daffy seems to steal the spotlight. He's got second billing in the credits, but first go at the laughs. 

Now, of course, since Mel Blanc's death, the voices have never been the same. However, these are ""reasonable facsimiles"" staying true to the characters but still creating new, unique traits to the performances. And I have got to say, the show's great. It's funny, witty, antic-laden and still holding a great continuity. All those things Bugs did in his golden days? All still thing's he's done, in canon, in his youth. This was highlighted in an episode about Daffy's high school reunion. Bugs didn't go to high school because he was busy being an Olympic athlete, fighting in the War, and even being the president of Mexico (among more).

And Daffy's fate? He's as absolutely self-centered and narcissistic as Chuck Jones often showed him to be, but he's also still batshit insane, adopting personalities and weird costumes at the drop of a hat. Daffy's embraced himself as he always was, and Bugs is really keeping the rest of the world safe from him. I still love Bugs, and I love his storylines, but Daffy's antics are often driving the conflict, and Bugs is following *him*. When was the last time you saw Bugs do that? 

Our favorite rabbit gets his share of screen time, and he's still got the charm and the calm ineffability he always had. He takes revenge when revenge is due, but he also takes a few licks for the humor of the viewer. An episode that starts with Bugs winning a Nobel prize in his spare time ends with him having destroyed his house through a series of poor home repair choices made in an effort to put up a shelf. In the end, the home repair was accomplished by Daffy's girlfriend Tina (an amazing character who I will describe later). However, this entire plotline for Bugs was spawned by a single action of Daffy's, when he refused to move a trophy that wasn't even his off a shelf in Bugs' house.

Daffy is pretty much a chaotic deity condensed into a little black duck. I'm going to quote Delirium of the Endless here: ""His madness keeps him sane."" Daffy's complete craziness is driven by some ridiculous combination of luck and self-absorption, and sometimes he actually comes out a hero in spite of himself. Bugs tamps him down and keeps him from causing too much destruction. This was shown in an episode where Bugs finally has enough of Daffy's lazy freeloading, and tries to put him to work. Daffy goes from pushing a muffin cart to getting posted the CEO's personal assistant on his first day (Foghorn Leghorn as a rich southern gentleman adventurer type). For mouthing off to the rooster and not being a spineless yesman, Daffy goes from nobody to CEO over the course of the plot, and- drumroll, please- completely bankrupts the company. At the end of the episode Bugs realizes that he really can't let Daffy out of his sight, and enabling Daffy's laziness causes less collateral damage.

He steals the plots of many an episode and runs with it, he generates wacky antics, and he might potentially destroy the world, but he's somehow still loveable, and I would say that Tina Russo, Daffy's Jersey-talkin' and totally badass girlfriend, contributes a lot to the betterment of Daffy. She's smart, she's got a tough mouth and she's driven and motivated. And she evens out Daffy by pulling him slightly out of the mess in his head. In one episode Daffy discovers his talent as a hairdresser when Tina enrolls in beauty school and finds it's not for her. If she and Daffy get married, he'd be the stay-at-home-mom. But before you laugh, Daffy took care of Tina's infant nephew and became a supermom in one episode, and he seems to be a little more in touch with his feminine side than even Bugs (who, yes, has cross-dressed already several times). Daffy wears his grandmother's pearls around his neck, and thinks nothing of going to the movies in a schoolgirl outfit with Bugs. I think Tina helps tap into a sweeter side of him because she's strong and authoritative (like Bugs) but also fun and caring.

Bugs ""second-fiddle role"" is also slyly hinted at through his girlfriend, Lola, who is indeed brought from ""Spacejam"" but given her own flavor of crazy. If Daffy's chaotic neutral, Lola's chaotic good. She has a good heart but she's a hurricane on her own, perhaps a little more functional and self-reliant than Daffy. But Bugs seems to like the excitement, and he does like Lola, just like he actually likes Daffy, even though they're both crazy and annoying sometimes. Bugs and Daffy have found versions of each other in girlfriends, and as weird that might seem, it's more about one character acting as the ""rock"" and the other being anchored by that rock. But it goes to show how Bugs relates to Daffy, and Lola. He takes a place behind, to receive and shield the blow of the unpredictable characters.

Overall, I look at this setting as what Bugs and Daffy have ""retired"" to after their more youthful adventures, and Daffy now has no pressures to be the star. Nor is Bugs interested in keeping up all that pretense, they're friends, and he wants a nice life. He's rich and accomplished. So Daffy finds his niche is sitcom life, and at the end of each season, it's really Daffy coming through, generating laughs in every episode, and stealing hearts in unlikely places all the time. 

There hasn't been an incredible amount of self-awareness to this show, as was practically a trademark of the original cartoons. Among the characters, there are a few marked differences in the relationships as well- perhaps leaving the cartoons as mere films in the mutual cast's past- these are their ""real life"" selves in the universe. Elmer Fudd has not yet been featured as a character interacting with any of the mains, he's the news anchor. The Tasmanian devil is in there, but Bugs has domesticated him as a pet and named him Poochy, thinking he was a dog in his introduction episode. We've got Marvin Martian as an exchange student from Mars, and Pete Puma as sort of the village idiot.

Much of the standard cartoon physics you might recall from the classic toons still apply here, and that adds a lot of flavor to the show. Bugs puts on a wig and smock and accidentally has Speedy (who lives in a mousehole in Bugs' house and owns a successful pizza restaurant) fall in love with him as ""Cathy"". In another episode, Bugs loses his gloves and replaces them with a pair of black fingerless biker gloves, then becomes a biker. (Both those plots were also Daffy's fault, might I add.) In the same vein, Daffy changed his name to Professor in that episode and went on to thinking he was one, teaching a class and eventually trying to put an end to Bugs' biker ways with trust. 

Porky ended the insanity by at last removing the costumes. Porky is a very sensible character throughout all the insanity, but he of course winds up on the end of being taken by Daffy's schemes and pulled into the chaos. Porky is a simple guy, normal and stuffy, and his struggles to get a girlfriend are consistently lampooned (although Petunia will be introduced at some point). Porky's moments to shine are few and far between, but he remains a good sport and a plucky character, despite his pitfalls and foibles.

Much of the time, Daffy is also a target to the rest of the neighborhood, which includes Granny, complete with Tweety and Sylvester, Yosemite Sam, Witch Lezah and Gossamer, Porky, and the goofy gophers Mac and Tosh. It really all comes down to Daffy, who shakes things up often, attracting more animosity and attention, though Bugs and Yosemite Sam have kept up a good rivalry, and Daffy now gets on Witch Lezah's nerves more. Since the show doesn't break the fourth wall much, and Daffy's too self-centered, he doesn't see he's done it at last.

You did it Daffy. You're the star. I can't wait for more.

**TL:DR;** In ""The Looney Tunes Show"" Daffy is Kramer.

Here we go

1: Jenny Was a Friend of Mine

This song is after the events of the album Its Brandon's interrogation tape. you can hear the audio warping effects at the beginning of the song, I will also assume that this was a huge and televised event. You can tell this is an interrogation for a murder by the lines “There ain't no motive for this crime.” and “Jenny WAS a friend of mine.”

2: Mr.Brightside

Mr.Brightside is when Brandon is telling the story from the beginning when he started feeling for Jenny. i support this because the whole song is about watching the girl of your dreams get treated like crap by her jock boyfriend. If Brandon never felt any attachment she just would have been another girl at a party...

3: Smile Like You Mean It

This is Brandon consoling Jenny after her boyfriend broke up with her. The title gives it a way a little. “Smile Like You Mean It” to paraphrase Its saying “Don't be sad I’m here for you the least you can do is try to cheer up.” 

4:Somebody Told Me

This is set a little after “Smile Like You Mean It”. Its about Jenny’s Ex Coming after Brandon for stealing his “Girl” He's intimidating Brandon by calling him gay “You had a BOYFRIEND who looked like a GIRLFRIEND that I had on february of last year.”

5: “All These Things That I've Done”

1369215271.0,180,self.FanTheories,1etpts,My thoughts on if Chell will be appearing in Portal 3 [SPOILERS] (x-post /r/portal),228,48,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1etpts/my_thoughts_on_if_chell_will_be_appearing_in/,"Credit to /u/The_AshleemeE

So I've heard a lot of theories about the end of Portal 2, and it seems to me that one of the most common of these is that Chell died in the end at the hands of the turrets, GLaDOS, or even space. The elevator scene with the singing turrets is perceived to be a metaphor by Valve showing Chell's ascension to 'paradise' (The open field, with her best friend the companion cube).

Now, I'm unsure of whether or not I'm buying this theory. However, regardless of if it's true or not, I do have my own theory which to me seems pretty solid that I haven't seen anywhere else. Why I believe Chell will not make an appearance in Portal 3 (If it's ever made, I'm sure we're all aware of Valve's inability to make a trilogy). And if she does make an appearance, she will be sick and dying.

As we all should know, Cave Johnson, CEO of aperture science before GLaDOS took over, got into a lot of debt. The last thing his scientists made, however, was conversion gel, with one of the primary ingredients being ground-up moon rocks. These moon-rocks ultimately led to the demise of Johnson, leaving him terminally ill.

&gt;    And guess what, ground up moon rocks are pure poison! I am deathly ill. - Cave Johnson

What nobody considers is that Chell practically bathes in the conversion gel while in the test chambers. People may argue that players can avoid being smothered in it during gameplay, but it seems that Valve pretty much forces Chell to be splashed with it at least once  [in the beginning of ""The Part Where He Kills You"" to escape Wheatly's spike crushers.](http://www.gamerguides.com/images/library/23/1921-ggportal2chp9chamber00-1png.jpg)  Valve seemed to have very discreetly poisoned Chell, without even mentioning it. I get the feeling that this planned, not just a coincidence. I find it hard to believe that Valve didn't know what they were doing when they designed it.

I'm pretty much pointing out the obvious here, but I haven't seen anybody talking about this fact. Regardless of if Chell died at the hands of GLaDOS or the turrets, she will die soon after the ending of Portal 2. And this explains why GLaDOS let Chell go so easily after she deleted Caroline

&gt; The best solution to a problem is usually the easiest. And I'll be honest, killing you is hard - GLaDOS

This is why I believe that Chell won't be making a return in the Portal Universe - unless the clever individuals at Valve make Chell's illness and her need to seek out a cure a plot point that drives her back into the facility to seek GLaDOS's help.. Or there's some sort of prequel/flashback part of the game.

Dr. Schultz represents the population of the north in the 1850s. At the time the demographics of America were changing, and lots of new immigrants were coming in, especially German. Django Unchained shows the North's realization that there is no peaceful way to end the issue of slavery
At the beginning of the movie, Dr. Schultz is a well-intentioned bounty hunter trying to do good within the law's jurisdiction. In the opening scene he doesn't shoot the slave trader until he declares lethal intention, and writes up a bill of sale for the purchase of Django. This is analogous to the North attempting to regulate slavery legally in the 1850's with the Missouri Compromise and other laws that tried to keep the union together and still allow slavery. However as the movie progresses, Schultz realizes that it's impossible to do good fully within the unjust world of slavery, and that ""in [his] line of work, you have to get dirty."" Just as Uncle Tom's Cabin showed the north the true injustice of slavery and pushed the north and south towards war, it was the story of Brunhilda that motivated Dr. Schultz to help out Django and free Hildy. At the end of the movie Calvin Candie and Dr. Schultz have reached a tentative agreement to buy Hildy, but Schultz will not shake Candie's hand. This is similar to Lincoln's promise prior to his election in 1860 that he will allow slavery to be maintained in the South, but will not expand it to any new states. The South ultimately seceded and Lincoln was forced to war. Schultz realizes when thinking about the slave being torn apart by the dogs that there he cannot really free the slaves (Django and Hildy) without completely destroying the institution of slavery represented by Candyland, so he must shoot. In the very last scene of the movie as Django walks away Steven shouts at him from the ground, ""You'll never destroy Candyland; Candyland has been here for hundreds of years; there are a million white people who will stop you from destroying Candyland."" All of these are arguments that the South made for the necessity of slavery, but Django and Lincoln know that sometimes you gotta get dirty.

Not that there's a lot to spoil, but there could be potential spoilers in the following paragraph for Batman Forever (1995)

In a certain scene more than halfway through the movie, Dr. Edward Nygma throws a success party for his product ""The Box"", a product that puts the user into a state where they live out their wildest fantasies but also sucks the users brain of intelligence and usable knowledge (about that person), which has obtained the attendance of Bruce Wayne, whose company was just hit financially by the product. So they have a demonstration model of the Box present at the party, and of course Edward Nygma could not be happier to get his adversary Bruce Wayne himself to try it out. Wayne opts out, but then decides to inspect the far-fetched machine anyway. Nygma's female antagonist friend then proceeds to activate the machine while Bruce is still inside. This is where the theory begins. Bruce Wayne *never left the Box, and the rest of the movie is based on what Bruce Wayne wanted to happen.*

For instance, as soon as he enters the box, Edward Nygma's party is crashed by his own partner, Harvey two-face. Bruce has had quite a few scuffles with Nygma and had some loony theories about his device, and what else would make Bruce more elated than the crashed party of the smug person who just snubbed Bruce's company? Nothing else at that moment. Shortly after, the Batman goes to meet the love interest of the movie, (don't remember her name so I'll just refer to her as Nicole Kidman) and she politely rejects the Batman in favor of the sexy Bruce Wayne. In response to this, the Batman (being Bruce Wayne) lets out a cool smirk as he leaves Nicole Kidman's bedroom through the window, knowing that things had played out the way he desired. Before he entered the box, he was politely let down by Nicole Kidman because she was enamored by Batman. Why the change of heart? This idyllic scenario adds to the aggregate desires of Bruce Wayne in that he wins his love interest as the man he really wants to be rather than his cage of a persona, furthering the idea that this is truly a fantasy. Finally, the duo of the Riddler and Two-face kidnap Nicole Kidman, destroy Batman's batcave and leave Bruce Wayne alive, even though they had the very will to kill him at that moment. In a nutshell, Bruce Wayne as the Batman then saves everyone (with supposedly destroyed technology from his batcave) and resolves the entire plot in one hallucinogenic swoop, resolutions to the plot are found, two-face is dead and Nygma is going batshit in Arkham Asylum. 

Sounds too good to be true, right? This all seems like one big fantasy, right? That's because it was. The reality was Edward Nygma had won by gaining all of Bruce Wayne's intelligence and knowledge of his fears, weaknesses, and other quirks.
The true outcome of the movie off of the big screen would have been the death of the Batman, Bruce Wayne, Nicole Kidman and the soul of Gotham.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1go7df,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1go7df/a_batman_forever_theory/,
1362796412.0,176,self.FanTheories,19y8s5,"Jumanji (1995), Vietnam War, and soldiers suffering from PTSD",213,37,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/19y8s5/jumanji_1995_vietnam_war_and_soldiers_suffering/,"**tl;dr: When examined to an almost conspiracy-theorist scale, the movie Jumanji was an allegory about a Vietnam soldier returning home, and coping and readjusting to civilian life. Spoilers. Spoilers everywhere...**

Alan Parrish was the figurative soldier who was drafted and later returned from the Vietnam War. In the movie, there were many lines that referenced to the times Alan spent in the jungle of Jumanji. It reflected a lot of the symptoms and attitudes that can haunt most soldiers suffering from PTSD. 

&gt;**Judy Shepherd:** Alan, are you ready?
 
&gt;**Alan Parrish:** There is no ""ready"". 

Coming home was especially difficult for the character, as well as many soldiers. They had gotten used to a way of life after surviving the harshest conditions possible. ""Normal"" life was (or still is) alien and discomforting.

&gt;**Alan Parrish:** I grew up in this. It's out there that scares me.

One of the most prominent line was the response to Peter's ""reverse psychology"" scene:

&gt;**Alan Parrish:** You think that mosquito, monkeys, and lions are bad? That is just the beginning. I've seen things you've only seen in your nightmares. Things you can't even imagine. Things you can't even see. There are things that hunt you in the night. Then something screams. Then you hear them eating, and you hope to God that you're not dessert. Afraid? You don't even know what afraid is.

Here, Alan spoke of the nightmarish years spent in the terrifying jungle as a child, constantly dealing with the unknown without guidance or clear objectives. A parallel can be drawn to the young soldiers drafted into war, shifting from one skirmish to another while just barely surviving the horrendous environment that they were suddenly dropped into with little to no preparation.

Alan entered Jumanji in the same manner: A roll of the dice, a sudden departure from a world he's known all his life, and sucked into a dark and distant place unimaginable by normal conventions. He entered that life quickly without proper closure to his family and friends. Sarah Whittle, a close friend, could barely comprehend Alan's departure and had to seek counseling to figure it all out. 

&gt;**Sarah Whittle:** Alan, please, last time I played this game, it ruined my life.
 
&gt;**Alan Parrish:** It ruined your life? 

&gt;**Sarah Whittle:** I was a little girl, Alan. You disappeared[...]I was afraid. I'm sorry, Alan. No one believed me. I was all alone. 

&gt;**Alan Parrish:** So was I.

The dice can also be a cinematic device to emphasize that the conditions everyone went through (or soldiers and their familes) were out of their own control, and they needed to rely on each other to work though the pain.

&gt;**Sarah Whittle:** I thought I lost you again. 

&gt;**Alan Parrish:** Thanks for sticking around this time. 

No one recognized Alan when he returned. His parents were dead years before (tombstones said 1991, movie took place in 1995). His long-time acquaintance, Carl Bentley, needed to be told of Alan's existence. It fitted with the lore that Alan Parrish went missing so many years ago, but figuratively it demonstrated how soldiers can drastically morph into a whole other person, that upon return, were unrecognizable to anyone. In as a young, naive kid; out comes a man.

&gt;**Carl Bently:** Are you from around here? 

&gt;**Alan Parrish:** I was. But I've been in Jumanji. 

&gt;**Judy Shepherd:** Indonesia. He was in the Peace Corps. 

While it can be relevant to the Gulf War (1991...remember that number?), the movie chose *Indonesia*, a country in Southeast Asia. After WWII and being occupied by the Chinese, the French stepped in and established the colony of *Indochina*. It encompassed, among other countries, modern-day *Vietnam*. The theme of the French came up again at the end of the movie, where the Jumanji board washed ashore on a beach, where two young French-speaking girls were about to approach the game. These Easter Eggs, along with the fact that Jumanji is a dense jungle with death at every turn, are multiple inferences to the Vietnam War.

Lastly, the movie was based on the book by the same title. Alan was not a character in the book, nor are all the other adult characters. The movie could have just been two kids playing a game, with all these crazy scenarios without the arc of Alan Parrish (think Zathura).

Essentially, that true happiness is born of sexual experimentation. First let us look at every character that is either evil or shown to be a jerk. With the exception of Roxy, every character that is shown in a negative light is straight. Scott is an ass, the exes are evil, and young Neil starts acting like a jerk.

However, Roxy shows us that this isn't a case of anti-straight propaganda, but anti-single sex orientation. IIRC Roxy is disgusted at Romona being with a male. Like every evil character, she doesn't even consider trying to experiment.

One flaw in this argument could be the amount of homosexual characters that are good who aren't shown sleeping with the other sex. My theory is that every character that is gay has followed Stephen Stills' character development, and started trying girls before realizing they were attracted to guys. All of my best friend's boyfriends that I have talked to gave me a similar story, so if we assume this then the theory still holds. They experimented, and found true happiness.

This is why Scott can't get Ramona until the very end. Because he hasn't tried alternatives to know for sure that she is what he wants. He can only get her after he's tried everything else. Dating her and Knives was polygamy, we know he's had many casual encounters, he's definitely tried being alone, and I feel his joining with Nega-Scott and getting ""impaled by the power of love"" by Gideon were analogous to homosexual encounters. It is through Scott having these experiences, to which Ramona had similar ones, that they are able to know once and for all that what they prefer is each other.

Young Neil also has a happy ending set in motion after Scott introduces him to his sister and drops the Young part. Neil can then be considered matured, and has a chance of romance with Scott's sister. Who in volume one was shown to have trouble with Wallace Wells stealing her boyfriends. Neil is not the nicest person in the book, but he was nice enough to deserve being set on the path to happiness in the Scott pilgrim universe.

Finally, to hit the point home further we have Gideon who is so attached to a one woman and one man forever relationship model that even after being broken up with he can't let the girls go, yet can't keep them and move to another until they are out of the way. So he froze them.

In Toy Story 2 Andy's Mother says to the toy collector that Woody has been in the family for years, and indeed is based off a  (within the universe) 1950s TV show. Woody mentions, when he sees a record player, that he hasn't seen one in ages, indicating he is old.

If we go off that theory, then we have to ask, why doesn't Woody remember or speak of Andy's Dad?

In Toy Story 2 Jesse sings about being forgotten by her owner Emily. Lotso, Chuckle and Big Baby were left by Daisy at a rest stop. So we know toys have memories and attachments.

So why doesn't Woody ever speak of Andy's Dad? I don't think it can be explained by the ""Andy's Parents Are Divorced"" idea, since the other toys suffered worse cases of abandonment and remember.

First, let's look at ""the gang"" (interesting word choice, guys!) and the individual members' roles:

1. Fred is a handsome and charismatic leader type, all qualities that make him a fit icon and head for a cult. Also noteworthy is that he seems to enjoy pursuing ghost stories.
2. Daphne never does much in terms of helping solve the mystery (I'm going off the original cartoon from the late 1960s). Whenever Fred comes up with a plan, chances are he pairs Velma with Scooby and Shaggy while he ""goes investigating"" with Daphne. She's clearly his clueless, hot groupie, mindlessly following the gang and only serving as Fred's girl.
3.  Velma is a bookish type who does't fall into the societal standards of beauty, which could mean that she's not very popular with other teens. It seems obvious as to why someone as smart as her would want to follow Fred and Daphne around on wild ghost chases: it'd mean hanging with a pair of attractive teens, thus making her feel accepted. And isn't that what being in a cult is all about for plenty of people? She's also put to good use since her braininess means she could have a wide knowledge of legendary monsters and can solve mysteries (more on this later).
4. Shaggy can talk to a dog that certainly shares his personality. Everyone's heard the joke that he can understand Scooby's dog-speak because he's always blasted on drugs, but there may be something more sinister to it. As *The Venture Bros* pointed out, this is similar to the real-life serial killer known as ""The Son of Sam"", who claimed that canine demons ordered him to carry out his brutal murders. Maybe Shaggy is deranged along those lines, either because of a psychosis or being fed a whole lotta drugs by the gang in the psychedelic tour bus.

The gang consists of a bunch of teenagers dressed in more conservative, old-fashioned clothing, even though this is the late 1960s, when many youth were sporting colorful tie-dyes in rebellion against the old order. Mystery, Inc. might be trying to present themselves as better than the others (though why the hell they colored their van that way is anyone's guess). This is deceitful, as no one would suspect a bunch of homely-dressed kids to be a cult obsessed with the supernatural. This could also be the explanation for the seemingly-gratuitous inclusion of the term ""Incorporated"" at the end of the service's name.

So if they're hellbent on finding monsters as I believe, why do they always work so hard to unmask crooks in costumes? It's because they wanna make sure it's the genuine article. When they hear of a phantom scaring up a pier, they won't immediately believe it and try to gain power over it. Experience has taught them, time and again, that they have to take steps (solve mysteries) to ensure that this is a real paranormal creature they're dealing with and not just some phony.

Ultimately, their goal is to find a true monster or supernatural being and gain power over it. The world could only tremble at what comes next in their plot. The show *Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!*, which this theory is based on, lasted only 25 episodes from 1969 to 1971.

1356288580.0,173,self.FanTheories,15c31t,Avatar and Alien/Aliens are two views of the same event,228,55,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/15c31t/avatar_and_alienaliens_are_two_views_of_the_same/,"There's already been some (albeit humorous) [speculation](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/aliens_avatar) that Ridley Scott's Alien and James Cameron's Aliens take place in the same universe as Cameron's more recent film, Avatar. 

Many similarities are seen between films. Long range space harvesting of resources (unnamed in the Alien series, ""unobtainium"" in Avatar), long term cryo-sleep, and colonization of other worlds are seen in both films. The control tower in Avatar looks almost the exact same as the control area seen in Aliens. The dropship/shuttle looks the same. Shit, even the mech-loader/walker things are seen in both. 

Additionally, a large corporation (the Resources Development Administration in Avatar, an unnamed ""Company,"" revealed to be the Weyland-Yutani Corporation in Alien/s) is responsible for the resource harvesting/transport. 

My theory (adapted from [here](http://them0vieblog.com/2011/02/04/is-avatar-a-revisionist-take-on-aliens/)) is: not only do the Alien and Avatar stories take place in the same universe, but they are actually two different re-tellings of the same story, from two different sides. 

There are already a few examples in the cinematic world of this technique. *Flags of our Fathers* and *Letters from Iwo Jima*, give two differing points of view on the Battle of Iwo Jima, while *They Died With Their Boots On* and *Geronimo: An American Legend* give two different accounts of the U.S. - Native American wars.

Comparing the two movies, in the Alien series, the home planet of the Aliens (or wherever they crashlanded, regardless) is depicted as barren, scarred by weather, and totally inhospitable. If James Cameron hadn't shown us how beautiful Pandora was, and you had asked Col. Quaritch upon his return how Pandora looked, he might have given us a similar description: hostile air, hostile wildlife, and insurmountable terrain. 

Also consider the end results of each story. In Avatar, the humans are forced to leave after an assault which is eventually repelled by the aliens (Na'vi). In Aliens, the humans are forced to leave after an initial assault which is repelled by the aliens (mostly the Queen, but still). The only difference is that the thermonuclear explosion is only depicted in one story line. 

If they both are really re-tellings of the same story, then it would make sense for one side to omit embarrassing info, right? The Na'vi fought back valiantly and kicked the humans off, only to have their site [""nuke[ed] from orbit""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbfMkh940Q)

So, isn't it entirely possible that the two films are just two sides of the same coin? Perhaps some Na'vi sympathizers on Earth (cough cough James Cameron) made a film just as propaganda-filled as the one the Weyland-Yutani corporation sponsored?

Help me expand the evidence on this subject, the world must know.

**TL;DR Alien/s and Avatar are two biased sides of the same event**

* Franklin Richards is the most powerful being in the Marvel Universe.
* He can change, create, and destroy universes
* He is the reason why Marvel characters never age (or stop aging ex. Spider-man)
* He is the reason characters come back from the dead so often in Marvel comics.

*Many Marvel characters know this, but can't do anything about it so they just go on with their lives like everything is normal and try to humor him.

This is a cool theory.  It even has a creepy Billy Mumy Twilight Zone vibe going on about it.

No-one knows where they come from, what their origin is. Any trace of their history beyond a few thousand years in the past is completely inaccessible.

They're probably native to the Delta Quadrant, but no-one knows for sure. They might even be extragalactic in origin, or come from a different timeline or universe entirely.

We think that they organize themselves under Queens, but the details are not well known. For all we know the hive-mind could have been fucking with Picard and Data throughout First Contact. They are a truly inhuman intellect, with a ""body"" spread across thousands of star systems and millions of worlds.

No-one knows just how many Borg drones there are, but their absolute lower limit numbers in the trillions - probably many, many times that.

The only thing we know for certain is that their stated goal is to assimilate the biological and technological progress of other species to theirs.

Despite their undeniably powerful ships, they have never sent more than a few ships at a time to attack the Federation. A single Borg cube devastated the Federation fleet at Wolf 359, and another very nearly broke through the best defenses the Federation could muster to defend Earth.

In either case, had the Borg sent two cubes, or a dozen, or a hundred, humanity would have been overcome and assimilated. No question about it. In fact, the only species we've seen pose a significant threat to the Borg was the Undine - and they are the dominant race of what is essentially a pocket universe.

In short, if the Borg wanted to destroy the Federation, the KDF, every dominant race in the Alpha Quadrant, they could. If they wanted to assimilate every sentient being from Earth to Qonos, it would take them a matter of years on the outside, maybe as little as months or weeks if things went well.

This leads to the conclusion that the Borg do not want to destroy the Federation or its neighbors. They attack worlds and assimilate ships or colonies, but never seriously press an attack against Earth.

The Borg are not an implacable enemy, a foe reaching inward to snuff out the heart of Starfleet. They are a farmer harvesting a ripened crop. They ""threaten"" humanity, spurring cultural and technological development, and then reap the rewards every time they assimilate a Federation ship or acquire new drones.

Perhaps they've done this many times in the past, sending out a token force; if the force is not repelled, then the culture was obviously not strong enough to be worth nurturing, and will provide a useful source of drones. But if that expedition is forced back, token as it may be, then the Borg know that they have found a source of possible value, a seed that can grow into a worthy source of innovation.

***TL;DR: The Federation survives because the Borg want humanity to progress and grow, so new technologies and cultural concepts can be assimilated. The Borg are farming humanity.***",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_ydtqg,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/ydtqg/the_true_nature_of_the_borg_xpost_from_rstartrek/,

1372632771.0,167,self.FanTheories,1he25y,Majora's Mask: Happy Mask Salesman (MM AND SS SPOILERS),221,54,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1he25y/majoras_mask_happy_mask_salesman_mm_and_ss/,"The Happy Mask Salesman in Majora's Mask has always come across as somewhat creepy to most people who have played the game, and for good reason. The guy fucking smiles endlessly. No one should ever do that. Despite his creepiness, however, next to nothing is known about him, save the facts that he sells masks and the children in the moon look strikingly similar to him. Why?

Because he is one of them. Or, rather, he was. See, according to Skyward Sword and Ocarina of Time, the land of hyrule is protected by four deities: the three creation goddesses, Din, Nayru, and Farore, and the less powerful, highly protective deity, Hylia, who is believed to have been appointed by the original three goddesses. These goddesses are worshipped across the land by the Hylian race, and though she is not directly mentioned in OoT, Hylia, having given herself into mortality through her transformation into Zelda, is still a very prominent figure, as Princess Zelda is the only political figure mentioned by the Hylians in OoT (at least, the only one pertaining to the Kingdom of Hyrule specifically).

At the end of SS, It is revealed that Demise will reappear throughout time, in a seemingly endless loop, as Ganon (or Ganondorf), and Link and Princess Zelda must be reincarnated as well, in the hopes of defeating the evil Demise has unleashed upon the timeline of Hyrule.

At the end of Majora's Mask, when link enters the moon, he finds five children inside; four are running and playing around a large tree, while the fifth sits under the tree, looking bored (or even saddened) by the fact that the other four children ignore him. This fifth child wears Majora's Mask. One of the children running around the tree asks Link if he, too, will be ""a mask salesman."" This implies that the children not only know of the Happy Mask Salesman, but that they were somewhat familiar to him prior to his ""transformation"" into said salesman.

Now, the Happy Mask Salesman is quite obviously after Majora's Mask. He states that he has been following Link, and believes Link is the one that will help him on his own journey to destroy evil, but why? What made the Mask Salesman choose Link? Because he is Link.

The five moon children, along with Majora, are Termina's ""alternate"" versions of the goddesses and their hero. When Majora's Mask escaped it's ""prison"" at the hands of one of the children, he was sent to the mortal realm to retrieve it and bring it back safely. He was given a physical form at the time of greatest need, just as Link is reborn when a new incarnation of Ganon comes to power.

Majora, like Ganon, is kept within a sealed realm. This realm could very well be the moon, as it is supernatural, to say the least, when observed by mortals such as Link. At some point, Majora escaped this ""sacred realm"", much like Ganon escaped his, and in his stead, a hero arises in the form of the Mask Salesman. The salesman searches everywhere for Majora, and at some point manages to wander his way into Hyrule, where he encounters Link. Link is the only person the salesman has experienced thus far that he believes holds enough power to defeat Majora. The salesman follows Link, and soon after Skull Kid takes all of Link's things in the midst of the Lost Woods/Portal to Termina, the Salesman approaches him. He tells Link that Skull Kid has stolen the evil he has long sought out, and that Link is the one who must help him.

Skipping ahead to the end of the game, Majora's Mask, in control of the Skull Kid, flees into the moon when Link defeats Skull Kid atop the clocktower. Assuming the shape of the missing moon child, Majora is accepted back into the ""Sacred Realm"" as though the Salesman had arrived victorious. Because he is impersonating the salesman, who, by all reasoning up to this point, is Termina's version of Link, and, therefore, the protagonist, or ""good guy"", he tells Link, ""you're the bad guy. And when you're bad, you just run"", alluding to the fact that Majora fled the moon ""realm"" in the first place.


**tl;dr: The Happy Mask Salesman is Termina's version of Link (The Hero), the moon children are the four goddesses of hyrule(Din, Nayru, Farore, and Hylia/Zelda), Majora's Mask is Ganon/dorf, and the Mask Salesman's quest mirrors that of Link in OoT greatly.**",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1he25y,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1he25y/majoras_mask_happy_mask_salesman_mm_and_ss/,

How the we as a player are more Dragonborn than we realise. ,216,50,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/15xc02/the_elder_scrolls_v_skyrim_how_the_we_as_a_player/,"Skyrim was one of my most played games of last year. Having played hundreds of hours on Xbox and PC I tried to complete every main and side quest, explore every inch, keep as much of the land and it's people safe from harm, as well as amassing an incredible treasure trove of gold, weapons and unique items. 

I loved that Bethesda focused on Wyrms and cast the player into the role of a Dragonborn. Those with the blood (metaphorically) of a dragon, gifted by Akatosh. As the Dovahkiin we are supposedly imbued with all the personality traits of a Dova, their strength, courage, duty and great power. Having watched, and loved, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey I released that Bethesda also let the player explore another trait of Dragons. Their desire for wealth.

As a player we are used to collecting all manner of gold and items, especially in RPGs. Those of us so inclined do not drop all our old weapons and armour, do not throw away interesting items and keep those things with great value, both in game and sentimentally, if possible in our player houses, or nests we have made for ourselves. This is how Bethesda has made the player truly at home as a Dova, as by subtly reinforcing through game mechanics, and building from years of experience. They, through gameplay, make us feel more like a dragon than any Quest or Lore.

After so many games, collecting, storing and arranging our massive hordes we are able to feel as the Dragonborn at home with our given destiny. As we raid from Dragon Priest's Crypts, take from the chests of the Dragon's themselves and kill those NPCs who oppose us and take their named weapons, we amass our personnel gold pile. I assume that most players do not sell all their weapons for profit, and that most of the daedric artefacts, and unique gems cover their tables in their homes and are mounted on their walls.

It may be a little more organised, and a bit more twee. But we are still Great Dragons sitting on our piles of gold and treasure.

1) in the episode Tribe Called Girl, Dee Dee says to her friends ""oh no, he just has special needs."" When they say ""Dee, your bro is weird.""
2) how does his entire laboratory hide in his house's wall when the house is a set size from the outside? It's possible that he's ridiculed for being mentally challenged at school, so to make him feel better his parents told him he's a genius. So when he believed them he built a fantasy world in his imagination where he has a laboratory and builds revolutionary inventions.
3) when Dee Dee has her imaginary friend (that big magic hippo with the rainbow tail) Dexter is even able to perceive him as real and makes him fit into his fantasy world.
4) when Dexter is learning French he says he has a ""big test"" and makes it apparent that everybody is worried about the test, when he took the test all he had to know was ""omelette du fromage"". Now I don't know if you've seen the tests they give the kids with special needs but they're fucking easy, eerily similar to dexter's test.

Try watching a few episodes with this in mind and just see if it fits as well as I think it does.

I am replaying the trilogy and there was a little detail that bothered me at the beginning. It's a bit that's always bothered me, actually, and I'll start with the original reason. 

It's when Shepard is describing the vision after Eden Prime. No matter which over-dramatic option you pick, you get the same over-dramatic description of the events. There's no option for ""it's not important, it was just a dream"". I mean, it wouldn't have been hard to just add one optional line of Shepard expressing doubt and then go into the explanation after being poked more by Anderson.

In fact, it's never sat well with me that there's no option given for Shepard to doubt the veracity of the vision at any point. When Anderson wants you to tell the Council about the vision, the thing you can object to is ""why would they believe that?"" Well, in Shepard's position, I wouldn't believe it, either. It's a fucking dream. What's more, it was people being killed by robots in the aftermath of a bunch of robots killing a bunch of people. It's a totally understandable dream to have. But I brushed it aside because I figured, if Shepard doesn't believe this stuff then the story never happens, so Shepard just has to believe it.

So this has always been on my mind. This most recent playthough, though, I noticed that, during this long description of the dream, there is unintelligible whispering heard in the background. I mean I've always heard it but I never, like, *noticed* it. In fact, this is the only instance of that whispering sound in the game, and it's not a part of the background music since you hear the same tune at other points.

So I just thought I'd start taking note of sound effects that happen during dialog. Any sound effects at all. I found three of them, each completely unique, never used again. All before leaving the Citadel.

1. [Whispering during the description of the dream.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBODBMFAfGM&amp;t=1m14s)
2. [Sort of a low scraping noise when Shepard starts yelling at the Council for not believing in the existence of Reapers when presented with Saren's evidence.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW9_KB50pD4&amp;t=7m10s)
3. [A high-ish screechy kind of noise when Shepard replies to Udina's plea not to make his job any harder before boarding the Normandy with ""I'll do whatever it takes.""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrD28zUAJw0&amp;t=4m55s)

Each of these three options are the times where Shepard shows unreasonable investment in information s/he has no solid reason to believe.

And, just for kicks, here's a descriptions of some auditory hallucinations by Indoctrination victims from the first game.

* An indoctrinated salarian commando on Virmire speaks incessantly about how they never stop whispering to him.
* Matriarch Benezia describes Saren's Indoctrination in the back of her mind as sounding like ""metal on metal, screeching and reverberating"".

Whispering? Check. Metal on metal, screeching and reverberating? Check and check.

Shepard has unnatural thought processes accompanied by auditory hallucinations experienced by Indoctrination victims. However, this seeming Indoctrination pits Shepard squarely *against* the Reapers that cause Indoctrination.

The obvious conclusion is that the Protheans harnessed the power of Indoctrination to be used against the Reapers. Seems like a stretch, maybe, but look at your major story missions:

* Virmire, destroying a laboratory that is dedicated to the study of Indoctrination. 
* Feros, discovering Saren and the geth's interest in the Thorian, a plant with psychic abilities that allow it to control people's minds by punishing them with pain when they act against it.
* Noveria, where Saren is working with a corporation to revive the rachni, who are beasts controlled psychically by a queen (who is also able to psychically control people, which is its preferred method of communication).

Mind control is a major theme throughout the game, all these things linked in the narrative by one dude who is afraid he's losing control over his mind. Why would he be the first, in countless extermination cycles, to study all known forms of mind control to understand Indoctrination? And he just spends a short while looking this stuff up, Vigil explains that the Protheans spent hundreds of years fighting the Reapers, surely they knew it in and out by the time they got offed. 

Now, when Shepard points out to Vigil that it was reckless to put out the message about Ilos over the Beacon network, Vigil claims that they didn't really understand the threat of Indoctrination so far as concerns that but it's a claim that doesn't really make any sense. After all, what new information could it have come by since that message went out that it now understands that it was dangerous while it didn't before? The scientists left on Ilos couldn't have studied it after they woke up since the Reapers were gone by then. This would imply that they know more about the subject than they are willing to admit. I mean, why would you tell a guy that you brainwashed that you brainwashed him? That's just asking for rebellion.

**TL;DR: The Beacon was used by the Protheans to spread anti-Reaper Indoctrination**

On a side note, Prothean Indoctrination being spread by the Beacons explains Saren's actions perfectly. He is explained as having been ruthless and evil in the past, then he shows up on Eden Prime to get the info from the Beacon, then he's helping the Reapers because he thinks it will save the galaxy. So he starts out Indoctrinated by Sovereign: Do what I tell you and I will make you powerful. Then he is indoctrinated by the Protheans: Stop the Reapers from killing all life in the galaxy. His motivation during the game: Do what Sovereign tells him in order to stop the Reapers from killing all life in the galaxy.

Blue’s Clues was on. The theme of that episode was Safety. They had a toy fire truck and the little toy firemen told the kids to not play with matches. A picture of an ambulance was on the wall and that taught the kids to call 911 if there is an emergency…and *then*…

Steve gets a knock on the door. A cop is there to *make sure he is safe*. “…oh my God,” I declared, “how did I not see this before? Steve lives in crack house.”

We all know that dogs (and mailboxes) can’t talk. These are massive hallucinations in Steve’s burned out mind. Note that he is the only ‘real’ person in the show (usually). His own image of himself is left unaltered as he travels through a trippy world of bright colors. Seeing vivid colors is a common side-effect of hallucinogens and some narcotics.

The music of Blue’s Clues is crap. Steve loves it. Another sign he is very, very high.

Steve sees inanimate objects as happy, friendly roommates who talk and even reproduce (Mr. Salt and Mrs. Pepper). These are severe hallucinations. In reality, he looks at a regular clock and starts talking to it, or he just stares and imagines a conversation in his head.

Every episode, Steve will jump into a painting and be “in that world” for a brief period. He is actually intoxicating himself on his couch and watching the picture until he hallucinates he is inside them. 

Ever notice how he never gets his mail? His mail comes to him. Just pointing that out, can’t explain that one.

And that child’s voice you hear talking to Steve throughout the episode? That might be his neglected child, helplessly watching his dad feed his addiction, waiting for a chance to chime in with an answer when his dad occasionally acknowledges his existence with a question. Trainspotting anyone?

The cop that came to his door was real. He probably came to remind Steve that he is ruining the neighborhood and the force is one piece of evidence away from busting him. Steve, high as a kite, just smiles, tells the officer to have a nice day and if he knows what letter comes after ‘H’.

This one is a stretch but…Blue (his dog) is another hallucination. She’s Steve’s dog from when he was a kid combined with his favorite color and the game he liked the most when he was a boy.

First let's look at some of the things we know about the turrets in the Portal Universe.

(a) They can feel. There are numerous examples of this throughout the first 2 games. The sounds of a dying turret imply they feel some sort of pain. Furthermore, they can express gratitude if you save them.

(b) GlaDOS only utilizes one type of turret. In various cut scenes, video displays and finally the song at the end, we see that there are a multitude of different turret types, they can vary in color and size. This includes an apparent 'King Turret' that shows up in the end of Portal 2. GlaDOS however, only utilizes the basic, white, small turrets throughout the entirety of both games. Why doesn't she try tossing you in a room with 2 giant turrets, I think, its because she doesn't know they exist.

(3) GlaDOS can't see the whole facility. We see this a couple of times throughout the game, where Chell is within the walls of the test chambers and is invisible to the AI. This reveals that GlaDOS doesn't have complete visibility, and we don't know how limited her vision actually is.

So, my theory is that the thinking/feeling turret bots, sick of being used as slaves for GlaDOS' testing will revolt. Hidden in the walls of the test chambers, the turrets have constructed a 'king turret' as well as a small society and a standing army (they are after all full of bullets). GlaDOS will somehow contact Chell (possibly through the Companion Cube) and convince her to come back and squash the turret rebellion before it spills out into the rest of the world.

There is only one other famous arcade game I can think of with ""Jr."" in the title is Donkey Kong Jr. Why is this significant? Well, in Donkey Kong Jr. the villain is the protagonist from the first game, Jumpman/Mario.

There was most likely another game, simply entitled Fix-It Felix. In this game Fix-It Felix Sr. was the villain. Who was the hero then? Well, following the format of Donkey Kong Jr. it was Ralph. 

A group of people come in and want to kick Ralph out of his home so they can build a giant building there? Doesn't seem like a plot that puts Felix in a favorable light. It wasn't until the sequel that they succeeded.

When they complete the game they are completely reversing all 'consequences' of the game, which includes the 26 years that had passed since they began playing thus altering time and space itself. They began the game with two players and ended with four, but in reality would the game they completed in 1995 be complete when time reverses back to 1969 or would the consequences of play put Alan back to before Sarah rolls the dice? It all really boils down to 'Why do Alan and Sarah get to keep 26 years worth of memories they have yet to live and no one else does?' The game Alan and Sarah started can technically never be finished because Judy and Peter DON'T EXIST. Time itself becomes a 'consequence' of the game once Sarah rolls the dice, and those memories gained would be revoked, no? To support my thesis, Van Pelt the Man-hunter purchases a modern rifle in 1995. In the climax, his bullet intended for Sarah fades back into the game along with the gun, which is not a physical property from the game. We can assume this means everything that transpires in the physical world after the dice initially hit the board is somewhat of a fabrication because it all becomes a consequence. So technically speaking, upon completion of the game in 1995 time would revert back to either (A) Sarah rolling the dice or (B) the dice hitting the board. If it were to revert back to option (A) then Sarah might not roll the dice and consequences may have never happened despite the game being started with the pieces stuck to the board. If it was option (B), then the game would play in an infinite loop however the universe itself could suffer any fate due to the fact the consequences come by chance of the dice. If both players were to not finish the game time itself would continue as a 'consequence' of Sarah and Alan's game started in 1969. This raises the point also that the game was played and completed at least once 100 years beforehand, and if option (B) applied then time would be continuing over from the very first player ever to roll the dice. This also raises these questions: What happens if all players die from the 'consequences' of the game? What happens if four players were unfortunate enough to get stuck inside the game as Alan did? Would being unable to finish the game due to death reset the consequences? Would death be considered a consequence of the game since birth is? MIND BLOWN.

TL;DR: The plot of Jumanji is an on-going time paradox that has the possibility to loop infinitely under circumstances and specifics.

Why so? Maybe because it gives us a certain joy in over-analyzing the stories/ movies that we love because it makes us look as though we are now experts when it comes to these movies, to ground the magic of these stories to the reality that we occupy right now, and also probably because we like to think we are smarter than we actually are.
(there might be other personal reasons, and this is definitely not meant to poke fun of anyone, in writing this I admit that I must be some kind of an idiot myself)  


In realizing this myself (this subreddit is so engrossing that I ended up registering my own reddit account) I think that **in Community, the character Abed turns this whole ""fan theory"" idea on its head.** 


In order to cover his own social deficiencies, he clings on to the idea that the study group and Greendale (which to him, is reality) work within the confines of a sitcom and/or movie. He does so as to rationalize his own perceived ineptness in reality (blaming himself for his mother leaving him and subsequently turning his father into an overprotective wreck of a man). He makes up fan theories in order to comprehend life events that he can't swallow whole (for example, the claymation Christmas episode, and the Darkest Timeline).


This *totally* goes meta when in an episode, he is successfully able to predict the actions and reactions of everyone else within the study group. This means that **a character of a supposed TV sitcom comprehends his life events by means of creating fan theories of them based on TV series, movies and other aspects of pop culture,  and when these theories come to practice in varying degrees of success, he and the viewer acknowledges that he is, in fact, part of a TV show.**


So, if Greendale and its inhabitants do work within Abed's rules, even if to a limited degree, would it really be that far-fetched to deduce that the *whole show, with all its wackiness might just be in his head all along?*

On Sight is Kanye announcing to everyone that he is about to take over rap music. Black Skinhead - New Slaves is his College Dropout - Late Registration phase when he was talking about social change, racial inequality throughout society, and how he has been slept on and held back in the industry. He isn't telling us he is a god, he is telling himself. Starting with Hold My Liquor and continuing to Guilt Trip, the album takes a thematic turn away from revolutionary topics and towards sex and love. This is the Graduation &amp; 808s part of his career. He has found love yet his personality makes it hard to hold on to, and it eventually breaks his heart. He even talks about a love from 5 years ago in Hold My Liquor. I believe this part of the album his about his ex fiancee Alexis Eggleston Phifer. Send It Up is Kanye coming back out into the spotlight with MBDTF and Cruel Summer after 808s/his break up. He is back out in clubs and being seen again. Bound 2 is a completely different sound than anything else on Yeezus. Putting a song on an album that doesn't fit isn't his style, as can be seen by Bittersweet ft John Mayer never being released. So why did he put this on Yeezus? Because it is about Kim Kardashian and how he is in love again. All the darkness and anger is gone. He is back to his old, soulful self. The album has too many different themes in an order that fits perfectly into Kanye's life for it to be a coincidence.

First, let's get this out of the way: There's a line in *Be Our Guest* where Lumiere says ""10 years, we've been rusting..."" but this is the one and only indication to how long they might have been under the spell. Assuming the people who wrote the story and lyrics were different people (and, in fact, they were), let's discount the line from the song and look at the theory.

* Beast (he's actually *Prince Adam* according to Disney canon) was a prince of the French people. But the people did not seem to know or realize that their monarchy was under a spell. This is more believable if they were under the spell for 1 year or less, and not 10 years.

* Beast was transformed on Christmas Day. It's also his birthday (21st in the movie). So his birthday is Christmas Day. This explains why he hates Christmas so much.

* According to the sequel, everyone, including Chip, were transformed by the enchantress. So Chip was not born as a cup. If the 10 years claim is true, Chip would technically be 21 at the end of the movie. But he is a small child before transformation, and still a small child as a human at the end of the movie.

* Beast (Prince Adam) was a young man of about 20 when he was transformed, not 10 years old. His 21st birthday would only be a year away. If the 10 year claim was true, he would have to be 10 years old upon transformation (which is not the case), or everyone's ages would be frozen.

* The enchantress claimed that the rose would wilt on Prince Adam's 21st birthday. If everyone's aging were frozen, then Prince Adam wouldn't have a 21st birthday.

* The movie *Beauty and the Beast* takes place just before Adam's 21st birthday, where the rose would have wilted for good. So Beast/Adam is 20 for the movie. 10 years ago, he would have to be 10.

Ultimately...

* Prince Adam is clearly older than 10 at transformation, so his 21st birthday is **less than 10 years away**, even if you go with the frozen-aging theory. So the line in the song is moot.

Some speculation:

* The enchantress knew Adam/Beast would meet Belle and the chain of events would undertake. These kinds of stories assume Fate is a real thing, so the enchantress possibly was preparing Adam to love through the whole cursing scenario. She probably also knew Adam would refuse her, and knew going into it that she would be placing the curse on him.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,1358876740.0,,,True,t3_172chw,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/172chw/disneys_beauty_the_beast_the_beast_and_his_castle/,

Careful reading and analysis of the facts show that actually the good guy in the Bible is the Devil and God is evil. Sin is the right path for humans, and Hell is a much better place than Heaven. Let me explain:

1. Only Heaven is exclusive. Anyone can get into Hell but complex rituals must be performed to enter Heaven and a person needs to spend a large part of their life worshipping God. Doesn't this seem a bit selfish, if God loves everyone. Satan doesn't make you worship him, he just lets everyone in. 

2. Hell came first, therefore God is the one who rebelled. This can be proven with simple logic. If Heaven existed before Hell, then what happened to those who ""sinned"" and couldn't get into Heaven? Did they just cease to exist when they died? Of course not. Hell is the default afterlife option, and so it was there before Heaven existed. This means that in fact the Devil was the original ruler of the Afterlife, and God rebelled against him. Why? To set up a separate realm where he could do his evil things.

3. Heaven is worse than hell. Actually, more accurately, the way into Heaven is worse than the one for Hell. God is omnipotent. Since the Devil can fight him, he must possess an equal level of omnipotence, cancelling God's, and preventing God from destroying Hell and Sin altogether. Therefore both god and the Devil can make any rules they want to get into their particular afterlife. What does god say? Be poor. Be chaste. Do not enjoy yourself. Work for nothing. He tells you to have a hard life. The devil though, lets us do what we want. He represents freedom and the right to the pursuit of happiness IN WHATEVER WAY WE WANT. God is the tyrant, and the devil allows us to liberate ourselves

4. Hell itself is better than heaven. The vast majority of people who have ever lived will be in Hell, and only a tiny proportion of those are made up of rapists, murdereres, etc. Essentially, the demographic of Hell will be similar to the real world. Heaven on the other hand is made up only of the exclusive group who get in. Therefore Heaven is ruled by a tyrant and filled with elitists, many of whom are culturally discriminatory/violent (Westboro Baptist Church, Crusaders,...). Hell is filled with good people who are simply not Christian, and in fact lacks any religion in particular. It would therefore be a just and fair society, free of discrimination or cruelty, and ruled by Satan, a benevolent leader. 

5. Final Proof, The name of the devil. Lucifer. Latin word meaning carrier of light. The devil carries the light of freedom and justice, like prometheus, the greek god who gave man fire. God is Zeus, who punishes prometheus by chaining him to a mountain and having an eagle eat his liver every day. But mankind still honors prometheus' sacrifice, as we should for the devil, the last bastion of light and freedom in the tyrannical empire of God.

Even though the theories have been proved, Pendleton Ward has never revealed when or what caused the Great Mushroom War. My theory is that in an alternate universe or in a scenario, JFK and Khrushchev decided to go ahead and launch the Nukes with each other, creating an full-blown nuclear war. The aftermath of this war was a giant crater in the Earth's surface which is inhabited by multiple mutants and ""magical"" creatures. Humanity has been completely wiped off the face of the planet, except for in one strange exception, Finn and possibly Susan Strong. Something that supports my theory is the story of Mr. Simon Petrikov. Petrikov is a Russian name. The Land of Ooo is speculated to be present day Russia. Simon Petrikov is later known as the Ice King because he found a magical crown in Scandinavia that possessed him and caused his fiance Betty, his princess, to leave him. Now he is known as the Ice King, a magical, evil wizard who abducts young princesses and tries to force them into marriage. In ""Holly Jolly Secrets Part 2"", Simon shares his story in the form of a video. In the 2nd part of his transformation, as he explains that his body tempurature has dropped to 30 degreess celcius and his skin is turning blue, a small bomber-style plane is seen in the upper left hand corner of the screen in a window. Immediately after the plane moves out of view, snow starts falling violently. Could this really be snow? or is it ashes/or debris from a nuclear bomb dropped by the USA over Russia? Simon survives for ""his crown keeps him alive, but its making him crazy"". While in the midst of losing his sanity, he travels the world, looking for survivors. He comes across a little vampire named Marceline, who later grows up to be Marceline the Vampire Queen. Vampires are popular in Romania, a country once under the power of the USSR. Another point that makes this theory relevant is how Simon dresses. It is similar to the typical upper class style of the 1960's. The remainder of life turned into magical beings including candy, wizards, witches, etc. How Finn got into the mix is a mystery still. Could this be an innocent children's show, or an omen to what would've happened in 1962 if they wouldn't have decided on peace?

We can see their teaming up without much animosity during the RPGs and they go go-carting together with an astounding regularity for mortal enemies.

The reason for this is clear. Mario, Peach, and Bowser are in a polyamorous relationship that benefits their mutual kingdoms. The premise is simple: Bowser ""kidnaps"" Peach and Mario rushes to get her back. As he does this he also manages to fix any economic, personal, or pest control problems that might be harming Mushroom Kingdom by doing odd jobs and gathering coins from fallen foes. With the power of the green mushrooms he can wage a one man war without the fear of doing any damage to anybody. While he's doing this Bowser and Peach obviously role-play a ""master-servant"" role that Peach is unable to experience anywhere else because she's a princess.

My proof for this is two-fold. 

1. In Sunshine, Peach is told that Bowser jr. is her son. Instead of the obvious reaction of ""but I've never had a kid you must be wrong"" she instead reacts with ""so you're Bowser's son."" Showing us that she isn't surprised that Bowser's kid is claiming he as his mother, and that Mario is likely her main lover as her child with Bowser is ""Bowser's son"" and not ""hers"". At the end of the game we learn that Bowser jr. isn't Peach's child, yet her reaction still suggest she did have one with Bowser.

2. We're always shown that Bowser keeps Peach in a cage, but we also see that she never suffers any ill effects of this. You aren't kept locked up by your enemy (who is expressly said to be in love with you) without showing some damage from the experience. The dress would be stained by dungeon grime or ripped to make room for spiky turtle wang if Peach was really there against her will. We can assume that she's fed well and allowed to bathe and wash her clothing before Mario arrives to ""save"" her. It also explains why Mario is never given the ""Standard Hero Reward"" as Peach would likely need time to heal after the ordeal as Bowser is several times her size.

To conclude: immortality, demonstrated friendship, possible implied love child, economic stability through the kidnap/rescue cycle and Peach's perfect dress after days in a dungeon with a predator that isn't above forceful kidnapping.

Given these points, a Mario/Peach/Bowser mutually agreed upon relationship seems to explain much of the series more confusing aspects.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_xq788,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/xq788/mario_bowser_and_polyamorous_relationships/,

When you ask members of the Dawngaurd why their leader “Isran” left the Vigalents of Stendarr they will tell you that they didn’t approve of his methods and booted him out. This is what first got me thinking about this fan theory because the Vigalents are fucking **hardcore**. They're famous for showing absolutely no mercy and have been known to kill women and children unprovoked, simply for being vampires. I was confused as to what kind of person Isran was that would warrant him being refused from the club and it wasn't long into the game before I figured it out. Isran is completely incompetent. The whole DLC is a cavalcade of dumb decisions, horrible plans and missed opportunities. 


On your first proper mission you find Sarana, a vampire princess with an elder scroll. Rather than killing her, arresting her, or taking the elder scroll, you instead decide to escort her straight to the main vampire lair. Even though this is your first day on the job, its still a ridiculously stupid thing to do. No wonder the Vigalents don’t ask you to join their club.


Isran not only doesn’t kill Sarana on sight, but lets her inside Fort Dawngaurd and he doesn’t even take her elder scroll. I was under the impression that these guys killed vampires with extreme prejudice but it turns out its just mild prejudice.


After finding all of the tools to fulfil the bad guy’s doomsday plan (the three elder scrolls, Auriel’s bow and Sarana) the Dawngaurd decide to take all of these things **straight to the home of the bad guy**. In the event that the final siege failed, they literally would have delivered the doomsday device right to his doorstep.


At the end of the DLC Isran and the Dawnguard march on the vampire castle and just mow down the vampires like they’re nothing. Few, if any dawngaurd die. There is no apparent reason they couldn't have done this at any point in the last few years.


After clearing the vampires in the castle, the dawngaurd don’t follow you into the final boss chamber. They literally send you into the bad guys lair, with the bad guys doomsday device, alone. Isran just stands at the entrance of the room as if he’s already won the war or something.


Rather than take the doomsday device directly to the bad guy, there are several opportunities that the dragonborn, sarana and the dawnguard could have removed one of the vital components for the vampire’s plot. Including but not limited to:


* Destroying Auriel's bow
* Destroying the portal to the soul cairn thereby locking away one of the vital scrolls
* Destroying/hiding the blood elder scroll
* Destroying/hiding the sun elder scroll
* Destroying/hiding the dragon elder scroll
* Killing Sarana (AKA doing their job)


All of this has lead me to develop the theory that the Vigalents of Stendarr invented the Dawngaurd as a way to occupy adventurers that were too dumb, oblivious or incompetent to be a Vigalent. They gave them a crumbling fort off in the corner of the country, told them that they should be battling the vampire menace (which the vigilantes were already hunting anyway) so that they could conduct their professional abomination murdering in peace.

Could This is the End be a sequel to Cabin in the Woods?

If you think about it, it might work.

Cabin in the Woods ends with a religious type of apocalypse and that is right where This is the End picks up. The only ""god"" figure that we see in Cabin in the Woods is the giant arm that punches up through the earth in the last shot. This could be the arm of the monster that Jay and Seth see in This is the End right before they ascend  into Heaven. Also, they never really say what causes the apocalypse to start in This is The End.

The one thing that crosses me up is that This is the End is clearly a christian type of apocalypse, they even reference the actual bible. In Cabin in the Woods, they never mention a religion specifically, we see that symbol on the pendent that Richard Jenkins wears and again on the floor of the temple where Sigorney Weaver shows up. 

I thought that maybe that could mean that Weaver and her group are satan worshipers to some regard.

You launch from a ring, hitting an anthropomorphized Jawbreaker if you launch perfectly, eventually breaking his jaw (tee hee), then you try to make it as far as you can, squishing gummies along the way, until you either break out or get carted back to the ring by the police.  Each gummy squished gives you money, which you put towards buffing yourself, or buying new types of gummies.  But why are you carted back each time?  Why do you get to buy things?  Why are there always gummies there, running away from you, when logically they would have cleared out after the first time?

*The coliseum is a prison.  The gummies are prisoners, the policemen are guards.  Jawbreaker is one of the cruelest people in Candyland, but can't be killed by normal means.  He has been sentenced to death.*  ***You*** *are the executioner.*

As for the shop, this is based on the system of the prison.  Eventually, the gummies can buy their way out, if they make enough money.  That, or they can risk it all by playing the game:  Run from Burrito Bison.  They run towards the door as you come barreling towards them, being paid for each gummy you smash.  If they're lucky, they come out unscathed.  Occasionally, new items come out that they can use:  A rocket, a hang-glider, extra-strength bubble-gum.  What they don't know is that Burrito Bison paid for those new items.  They just think he's incredibly clever to use them, but that it's still worth the risk if they can afford it.

Eventually, he breaks out.  He goes back to shopping as if nothing has happened, until he notices he left his wallet in there.  He runs and jumps right back in.  But everything's changed:  The coliseum is in ruins, technology has made leaps and bounds.  And yet, Bison is still paid for every gummy smashed, and he still gets to upgrade.  Why?  Two reasons:

* Time moves differently in Candyland.  It's been *years* since he left.

* The escaped prisoners and revelation of the corrupt prison system has completely changed the political landscape.  You are in post-apocalyptic Candyland.

There are still powerful players, though.  They basically use you as a cannon to shoot at the enemies, which you agree to since those enemies have your wallet.  They use the same system of secretly providing new items to their enemies, and even introduce new ideas, like the Corrupt Police Officer.  But why would he exist?  Why would someone willingly go out there to die, and even reward you for killing him?  It's been years since you left.  Long enough for a *religion* to develop around this otherworldly angel of death who came screaming through the skies, changing Candyland forever.

Curtail your exclamations, straw man, while I blow your tiny straw mind.

When re-watching this movie a couple of days ago I started to notice just how many things went wrong for The Company. More than could be explained by mere coincedence, I began to think.

Imagine if there really was a company that was dedicated to appeasing the wishes of Ancient Ones, a company that had become so good at it's job that it had never failed (let's assume that when I say The Company I mean the sum total of all the companies in the different cities). So how, with all that experience, expertise and organisation, did they fail?

I theorise that there is another group, a religious cult of some kind, that have discovered the existence of the Ancient Ones. They go beyond simply worshipping them, and decide that they must be released, and humanity destroyed in a fiery Apocalypse. Presumably they, like many cults, believe themselves to be the ""chosen ones"" in the eyes of their chosen deities.

So, in the year 2012 (the year of the Mayan prophecy of a world-scale destruction), the cult put into action a plan that will derail The Company's attempts at ritual sacrifice. They have set up an insider in each of the individual companies in each location around the world (I'm theorizing that the guard, Truman, is the insider in the American organisation, but really it doesn't matter who), and begin to sabotage the operations.

Firstly, Marty's marijuana stash, which the company mentions poisoning, is stabilised with a new drug manufactured by the cult that will make him more aware or sensitive to his surroundings once he is inside the cabin. Secondly, the explosion that is intended to occur that will block the last remaining exit it prevented from within the company by the insider. Thridly, the insider saves Marty from the Buckners, and shows him how to access the inner workings of the company itself.

If you assume the same things are happening in other places around the world (how DID a bunch of nine year olds defeat an evil demon ghost?) then it starts to come together that the overall plot (ie the Ancient Ones being released from their prison) were the machinations of an Armageddon-craving cult.

1364665492.0,151,self.FanTheories,1bb7z7,Back to the Future: The stakes are much higher than implied,191,40,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1bb7z7/back_to_the_future_the_stakes_are_much_higher/,"Time travel in Back to the Future is built on three principles:
 
1: You can change past events
 
2: Consequences of changing chronologically preceeding events can affect the time traveler personally
 
3: It takes a little while for the universe to ""fall in line"", so the consequences of changing the past can be directly observed
 
The entire plot of BTTF is built in these principles; Doc Brown invents a time machine, Marty goes back in time, prevents his parents from falling in love the way they originally did, sees his future existence literally disappearing in a photograph and later on himself, finds a different way for his parents to fall in love thereby ensuring that there will be a future in which a version of him exists, gives Doc Brown vital information about the future, and travels forward in time to the new future he created: A future in which the version of him that grew up with changed parents had still befriended Doc Brown, still gotten the same girlfriend, still spent that night out in the parking lot testing a time machine, and still travelled back to the year 1955.
 
This is important. Even though the Marty that grew up with a succesful father and a non-judgemental, non-alcoholic mother must have had some different experiences, he still takes this trip back to 1955 and makes basically the same decisions as the Marty whose story we have followed in the film. Only at this point do we have a stable loop in which the son of successful George performs the actions that lead to the creation of succesful George in the first place. A neat, stable loop after which the universe and time gets to continue forward.
 
So, it looks as if the stakes here are that Marty might undo his own personal existence and/or get stuck in the 50s with no means of getting back to 1985 other than waiting for 30 years. That would suck for him personally but not be a big deal for anyone else, right? Well, not quite. Let's have a look at what will happen if Marty really *does* disappear: He doesn't get to live his life and do all the things that have an effect on the world around him, and one of the last things he did was *preventing his parents from falling in love the way they originally did*. By ceasing to exist the whole reason for him ceasing to exist would  cease to exist which would cause him to exist which would cause a reason for his existence not to exist anymore to exist which would mean he would cease to exist and so forth.
 
So, just another loop then? No, much worse. The first one (Marty, son of succesful George, goes back in time and creates succesful George who in turn creates Marty) is like a rollercoaster for history. History gets on the ride, goes a round, ends up where it began, gets off the ride, and is free to move on to other things. The ""Marty undoes himself which undoes the undoing""-loop is the kind of rollercoaster you can *never get off of* once you're on. The exit is the entrance is the exit is the entrance. The universe will see Marty pop in and out of existence *forever* without any chance of resolution. There is no moving forward from this, the consequence undoing the cause which undoes the consequence's undoing of the cause means that no events after Octobre 26th 1985 can occur since the universe is stuck in a loop of constantly reshaping the time between 1955 and 1985 - the end of history and time as a forward-moving line itself is the only consequence and there is no breaking this loop as nobody can be aware of it. When Marty saw his hand disappearing the universe and time itself were at stake.
 
This also explains why Doc Brown just put on a bulletproof vest when he could have simply chosen not to go to the parking lot or take better precautions (there was still a risk of him getting shot in the head, the letter did not specify that) on that specific night - he could not risk forcing the universe into a history-ending time loop because he used the knowledge he had to prevent himself from getting that knowledge in the first place. The safest way of ensuring that he would get the warning about the future was for Marty to witness what was going on. Had Marty not witnessed him being shot on that night his plea for Doc to read the warning could possibly have been less passionate and easier to disregard, leaving history stuck in a loop of his death causing him to get a warning he would listen to, causing him to live, causing him not to get a warning he would listen to, causing him to die, causing him to get a warning he would listen to and so on. End of history right there again, and Doc heroically chooses to step in the line of fire to prevent this.
 
Back to the Future 2 somewhat negates that point as they travel to the year 2015 to prevent the events that caused them to travel to 2015 in the first place and are fine, but that movie has even bigger plot holes (old Biff accidentally stumbles upon the time machine, gives young Biff the sports almanac, young Biff becomes succesful and creates a future in which old Biff doesn't find the time machine and yet he can live a life based on events he actually undid for decades) when it comes to time travel.

1357620302.0,149,self.FanTheories,165zo3,How I think the Pokemon universe works (judging from the games),169,20,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/165zo3/how_i_think_the_pokemon_universe_works_judging/,"I believe that the Pokemon regions do not make up the entirety of the Pokemon world.  Pokemon battling is something like a professional sport in this world, and the Pokemon regions are places people travel to participate.    
    

How does this work?  Well, you pay a fee to participate in the Pokemon League Challenge.  This fee covers Pokemon Centers, Marts, Gyms, and that sort of thing.  For younger participants, they can be accompanied by a parent; their parent can pay to stay in a house on-site (hence your mother living in Pallet Town/wherever, but also many of the people living everywhere else).  Everybody else in these regions is either another participant in the League/one of their companions, an employee of the League (gym trainers, nurses, mart employees, move tutors, etc.), other people involved in Pokemon (professors, the people who run the Safari Zone), or criminals (Team Rocket).    
    

This explains why there are no roads or cars, and why towns are so small; it's made for people to traverse by foot, giving them plenty of opportunities to catch wild Pokemon.  Of course this world has cars, and infrastructure, but there's no need for it here.  Why else would there be a space shuttle, but not so much as a golf-cart anywhere else?  (okay other than the truck at the S.S. Anne)  It also explains why the Orre region has no wild Pokemon; most places that do not have an official Pokemon League do not have as much of a presence of Pokemon.  These places are chosen and mapped out very carefully to include a series of different environments.  Consider the cameraman/interviewer trainers in Ruby/Sapphire.  They explain that they are there to watch up-and-coming trainers.  Wouldn't it make more sense for them to be right outside of gyms or something?  Well, not if the entire region is specifically for the purpose of battling.    
Think about it.  Do you really think every single person would care about battling/raising Pokemon the way the people in each region seem to, or would there be at least SOME population of people who really just don't care about your wacky battling pets?    
    
So why are the various Teams there?  For different reasons in each generation.  Team Rocket, because the Pokemon Leagues pull in a lot of money.  Everywhere you find them, they're involved in some kind of racket for cash, whether it's petty theft or trying to steal incredible technology from Silph Co., no doubt to sell to the highest bidder.  Team Aqua/Magma, for the publicity.  It seems like they could pick anywhere in the world to carry out their ecoterrorism, but they picked the Pokemon League, a place that undoubtedly has at least one channel on TV dedicated to it.  A disturbance there would certainly bring national attention to their cause.  Team Galactic's motives are made pretty clear.  Finally, Team Plasma targets the Pokemon League as the manifestation of everything it is against: making Pokemon fight for spectacle and sport.    
    
How are the people in these Leagues supported, then?  If you don't have a job, or any place to stay, how do you stay fed and clothed?  That goes back to the fee earlier.  At least once in the show, Ash/Misty/Brock are depicted sleeping on couches in the Pokemon Center.  Otherwise, they are shown camping, which leads me to believe that entering a Pokemon League Challenge requires some sort of aptitude test to make sure the people involved aren't going to mess this up royally.  Think about the trainers you run into that are exceptionally young.  The ones that seem too young to be embarking on this kind of challenge on their own are always close to the early towns; maybe their older sibling is elsewhere, and they're staying in one of those places with their parents.  The other young trainers seem to be the Pokemon equivalents of the Boy Scouts or the Girl Scouts, people that have at least SOME kind of experience camping/living off of their wits.    
    
I think the real target market for these leagues are the CoolTrainers, though.  They seem like people who are approximately college-age, and I have a few theories about them.  Since they always seem stylish and badass, I think maybe they're like the professional athletes of Pokemon battling.  While they're not on any sort of real team, they are competing for glory to fight the Elite Four, and there's no reason they can't have been sponsored.  Companies that make camping equipment, Pokemon battling stuff (balls, potions, etc.), and even clothing could sponsor them.    
    
So maybe you're in High School on summer break, and you've saved up for a year or two to enter this.  You practiced every weekend for the aptitude test, and finally, your mom agreed to come with you while your dad stayed home to work.  You sign up pretty late, and the only on-site housing left is not in the most accessible or exciting place in the world, but the house next door is occupied by somebody you know, so at least there's that.  Plus, you'll finally get to see your old family friend Professor Oak again; he's been employed by the Pokemon League for a while to study Pokemon in his lab.  He's got your phone number in case you need anything, and the same goes for your mom.

As some might know, the jist of the theory is that Bond is not a man, but rather a code name given to multiple agents.  The biggest hit to this theory is the tombstone in skyfall. It shows his parents grave with the last name ""Bond"". So this are my thoughts. 

First of, yes James Bond is a code name. The most recent one being Daniel Craig.  I am not going to go much farther as the multiple Bond theory is very extensive. I'm going be adding some points as to how I can debunk the gravestone.

My first argument is, well something that has always bothered me. Why he always gives out his real name whenever asked. He tells to goons, girls and mainly whatever villain he is chasing down. He doesn't mainly in their first encounters, in front of everyone . That doesn't seem like good espionage. So, why does he do it. Simple, MI6 has already created a fake background for a James Bond. See, any villain worth his weight would run background checks on this Mr. Bond, as sometimes he poses as a banker or whatever. If a background check come up, and see that a Mr. Bond is somehow affiliated with the British Government or UK, than he is fucked. One example I can think of is in Tomorrow  Never Dies where he tells tech mogul that he is a banker. If it wasn't for him knowing terry hatcher, his cover would have stated intact. Unless the villain forgot how to google, than how was he was able to keep his cover. I am sure there are other examples, just none come to mind. 

Now, if you believe that the reason he says his name is for covers sake, than let's move onto the grave. Well, it's a rouse.  Bond has no family. As proof, MI6 created those names and aliases to add more realism to has backstory, but to also protect the agents actual family. Anyone looking for proof of bonds family, will eventually be lead to a tombstone in Scotland.

Now, onto Silva. Well this is a far fetched one, please feel free to poke holes in it. Well, Silva is actually Tim Dalton Bond. Here are my reasons for it. In the beginning, they keep referring to unnamed Silva as one of them. Someone that knows them. Second when he meets bond for the first time in the chair. He gives the rat story, about how after some training rats will only eat other rats. That they are two survivors. Referring to him and Bond. Point 3. He mentions he was working for MI6 from 86 - 97 roughly. This was around the time he was Bond. He went rouge and the Bond name was given to Pierce B bond. Now, Goldeneye came out in 95, so there is a 2 year gap. Well, Silva mentioned he was held for 5 months in a room without air, also he yells at M to say his real name. Perhaps hinting they have real names. That Silva might just have been the name he took up after becoming a villain. Point 4. At the end, Silva just laughs at the Bond Tombstone. Almost like it was a inside joke. Move when Bond kills him, he says ""Last rat"". Now, I have one more that's point but I don't have much to go on. That the old Scottish man could be Sean Connery Bond, but I find more points against, than for on that one ",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1ir66y,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1ir66y/resurrecting_the_multiple_bond_theory_and_silva/,

Recently I've been reading about how time passes differently in the Monsters Inc. world. A [post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/xha0m/time_flow_in_monsters_inc/) proposing the idea of time moving faster in the monster world seemed to make sense. This could explain how they can visit so many houses in one night. The incident with [2319](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSAXkp9cqbk) brings up ideas like the [black plague](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/13tkvo/monsters_inc_monsters_are_terrified_of_children/) which can be explained better by the idea of [time moving slower](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1fjfp4/monsters_inc_time_passes_slower_in_the_monster/) in the monster world.

These theories all seemed interesting until I was at the movies this weekend and saw a cardboard promo for Monsters University. It was fashioned like [student cards](http://imgur.com/6W3YtVc) and when I looked closer at the date, it said 1313. This made me think that maybe multiple theories could be correct. What if time does in fact move faster in the monster world. The gap between the 1313 and 2001 is quite a long time, but not if they moved at a faster time. However if time passed faster, then there is no way they would have such advanced technology and be as sophisticated as they are. This brought me to my conclusion, the universe in which Monsters Inc. takes place is in fact completely separated and runs on its own timeline. Any contact with our world is just a inter-dimensional jump and going through the thresh hold of a door simply relocates a monster into another dimension. This completely isolated dimension does not connect or relate to ours and so it is not moving ""faster"" or ""slower"" than us, because it is not at all relative to us.

That or maybe the monster Jesus came a couple hundred years after the human Jesus and this is all a great misunderstanding.

They fall in love, retire to Scotland and start an orphanage. While running the orphanage they scout and train the most promising orphans to be recruited into the MI6 program. 

The Bonds had one child that died during birth, they named him James Bond. They then give all the agents they train the James Bond codename.

(Tragic figure theory)",180,41,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/125vgz/samus_has_ptsd_is_overwrought_by_guilt_and_is/,"This post is about the lead character of the ""Metroid"" series of games.  Consider her history like this: (Canon sources are taken and sometimes abridged from Wikitroid)

I'm sorry about how long this is, but I hope that fans of the Metroid Series enjoy the ride.


**Metroid (the first game) and Zero Mission:**
*CANON:* Samus flies to Zebes on what is implied to be one of her first missions as a bounty hunter: stop a race of space pirates from weaponizing a race of aliens called the Metroid. After beating mother brain and the various other commanders of the space pirates (Namely Ridley: a necrotic dragon, and the Mother Brain: An H.R. Geiger-esque nightmare in a jar), she is ambushed upon her escape, and crash lands.  At the end of this ordeal she escapes from Zebes in a space pirate cruiser kept within their mothership after defeating ""Mecha Ridley"", Ridley's robot doppleganger.

*SPECULATION:* Imagine you're a female bounty hunter in the far future, you've brought in a few sorry louts for cash and are scraping by when all of a sudden there's an astounding bounty posted for an unbelievable mission. Remember: Samus is a bounty hunter, but very little has been mentioned about exactly who hires her until the later games. Is she really hired every time? Consider that Samus never collects monetary treasure from the planets, just what she needs to get around from precursor (Chozo) technology. She's not ransacking these planets for treasure, she's there to do a job.

In this case we can only assume that a small government with pirate problems would hire somebody with no questions asked to keep this biological weapons program from taking place. This government would have a lot to gain from their misfortune and might be unable to mount a military assault due to monetary issues and need a single mercenary to just go in, smash the project, and get out for a fraction of what military action might cost them.

Samus thinks this is her big break. The money's fantastic, and the mission is unusually dangerous, and it would be naive to think that gender stereotypes are completely gone in Samus' era of human history (if Team Ninja has anything to say about it). This would be a fine way to prove that a female mercenary is just as deadly as any male with a laser pistol. This is clearly a career maker, so she boldly accepts the job and heads off with just enough equipment to sabotage a lab.

So again: imagine that you packed your best armor and light arms for an infiltration mission. You step out of your ship and find hostile native species running all over the place. You find ancient technology that creeps into your suit when you touch it. Usually you're just turning in some wanted crooks but you're killing hundreds of intelligent beings. You fight a giant necrotic dragon and that's not even the worst of it. 

Right around the end of it you stumble into the lab and there's a humanoid brain twice your size in a huge jar that pulsates and shoots hundreds of lasers at you. Metroid fans, don't think of mother brain, think of walking into a lab and seeing a pulsating brain twice your size oozing around a huge tank with alien technology all over it. In self defense you kill it, partially because it's an affront to anything you've ever considered holy. Then escape.

Poor Samus: at this point she's seen far more than she'd bargained for and nobody would blame her for taking the money and retiring. She's got to be shaking with the early onset of P.T.S.D. from killing that giant affront to nature as she blasts off from the planet. She's trying to tell herself that she's safe now and she can finally go home, and what happens? She's ambushed, and crashes back on the planet she just swore to never go back to, and her suit is gone.

She must be feral at this point. She grabs whatever she can and through sheer determination makes it aboard the pirate mothership looking for any way off the rock. She doesn't face the brain again (thank god) but she kills what appears to be commander Ridley inside a mockery of machinery like a life support system. She killed a crippled commander but it was in self defense! She needed that ship! She had to go home, right?

She goes back home, she collects the money, and then the publicity happens. The media is all over her, talking about the ""one woman army"" who stopped a pirate operation. Samus can't go to therapy, she needs to maintain that tough image right? If she seeks help then people will think of women as ""soft"" and ""unable to handle the stress of this job"" and she's not going to let that happen. She bites her lip, sleeps uneasily, and keeps an eye out for a nice and easy follow-up mission to keep the money coming in. 

**Metroid Prime Series:**
*CANON:* Can be found here if you already forget the Prime plot: http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Metroid_timeline

*Speculation:*

Samus never got mental help, but the bills never stop so she's taking another mission. The same government as before is still having trouble with the space pirates, and she did such a great job before that they'll hire her again at a premium along with help from the Galactic Federation. This time there's no strange labs, just a mysterious substance known as phazon. How bad could that be? It just sounds like a kind of acid. She shows up and takes out some criminal scum, kills large indigenous creatures, stares at herself in her visor, talks to ghosts and holograms that tell her about ancient prophecies she couldn't ever be a part of, fights ""Meta Ridley"" a ""meta"" version of someone she personally killed twice... you know... just a bunch of untreated P.T.S.D. stuff that might be coloring reality for her.

What Samus finds is that Phazon is a corrupting substance that makes you stronger, and faster, and monstrous. With someone who feels as weak as she does, it must feel nice to use phazon, and be around phazon, and surely it wouldn't hurt if she got just a little bit corrupted by it. Just to be a little stronger. Just so if ""that thing"" shows up again she'll be a little better at making it going away. It's a recurring theme throughout the prime games that you become more and more resistant to stronger forms of Phazon, to the point where it doesn't hurt anymore, you're using it against the pirates, and corruption ceases to matter. 

At the very end of Prime 1 we see what becomes an inordinately recurring theme for a sober bounty hunting girl to have: Dark Samus. Dark Samus is a Samus made out of phazon and she doesn't really exist. Deep down Samus knows that she's getting addicted to the phazon high and Dark Samus is the possibility in the back of her mind of just stripping off her suit, diving in, and never worrying about anything ever again. Samus may see Dark Samus doing things but she's really her personal (Fight Club spoilers) Tyler Durden. Some of the most desperate battles of Prime 2 are against herself. She can't control herself anymore even as she tries to confront the phazon menace on a new planet.


In 3, Samus has her eye on Phaaze: the source of all phazon according to ancient records. She's dealing with the pirates, sets up her own sabotage, and orchestrates a series of missions to get her close to the source of all phazon. She makes it to Phaaze and at the last minute she has to confront her craving one last time, and the old girl pulls through. She wins. She doesn't even take a final huff as she leaves because this Phazon shit is killing her. Reality and fantasy are starting to blur together and it's only so long before the Galactic Federation finds out about her substance abuse and all the people she killed to get at it.

**Metroid II: The return of Samus:**
*CANON:* (from wikitroid) Following the events of the previous chapters, the Galactic Federation deems the Metroid species too dangerous to exist, and, after their own failed attempts, employ Samus to travel to the Metroid homeworld, SR388, and exterminate the entire species. After killing every Metroid, Samus finds an unhatched egg sac. As she prepares to destroy it, a Metroid larva pops out and believes Samus is its mother. It follows her back to her ship, and Samus hands it over to the Galactic Federation for research. 

*Speculation:*

After her work with the Galactic Federation, and her bold decision to ""deactivate"" all the phazon in the universe in her last mission, she's a prime candidate for a new task. These ""Metroids"" have been popping up everywhere lately: in the phazon, in military labs, on distant planets, and they're essentially giant flying leeches that nobody really knows how to control. They give Samus her orders and say ""good luck"". Samus looks long and hard over the order which states that she has to perform a genocide mission on the same race that her groundbreaking mission was meant to protect. Genocide... is this really what she's good for nowadays? Supposedly the metroid operate as a hive and all living metroids will die upon the death of the queen. She swallows her pride, fights off the phazon shakes, and goes to go eliminate the source of all Metroids as humanity knows them.

She's an ex drug addict and a battle hardened bounty hunter by now. She's a remorseless killer and she doesn't think about what she's doing anymore, she just does it.... until she kills the queen.

She finds an unhatched egg sac, and just as she's going to wipe the species off the face of the galaxy, it hatches. Something makes her hesitate as her finger trembles around the trigger of her arm cannon. In one emotional moment, the metroid imprints to what it thinks is the queen of the colony... Samus.

This is no longer a threat to the universe to her, it loves her. It thinks she's its mother. In this whole bounty hunting mess and the fame and the phazon she realizes that she'll never settle down. She won't marry out of the Aran name. She's wasting her best years and probably never bear a child, the female experience, and here is this imprinted ...thing... that is now literally one of a kind. It's her child, she can't kill that.

She brings it back to the federation and a small struggle ensues. The scientists try to contain it but Samus shrieks at them to not touch her child. A standoff ensues and a military negotiator is brought in to talk Samus into letting go of her ""kid"". Eventually she looks it in the triple membrane, remembers that it is a floating slug, and gingerly hands it over to science. And for a while, as Super Metroid says at the very beginning: ""The last metroid is in captivity, the galaxy is at peace."" 

Samus is not at peace.

**Super Metroid!:**
*CANON:* See above link for canon link, as very little is mentioned in the speculation.

*Speculation* With the last metroid that will apparently ever exist as her apparent child, and unresolved P.T.S.D., and the increasing withdrawl symptoms from phazon corruption, Samus is admitted to a military hospital. Super Metroid exists only in Samus' head wherin she goes to see her child, but the commander she killed way back when comes to steal it. She chases it back to SR-388 which is more vivid than ever before and has to reconcile her actions from the mission that got her into this mess. The deaths of Ridley and Kraid exist beside other nightmares and culminate in her having to face IT again. The source of her trauma not only haunts her, but in her imagination it becomes more powerful that it ever was and almost sends her into madness forever until she remembers the one thing she got right. She saved a whole species with a single sample: Her baby metroid.  In this task she feels absolution from the fear and death, makes short work of the horrible brain, and escapes her delusions (perhaps saving some natives on the way out). She's finally given a clean bill of mental health and vows to return to Galactic Federation service as soon as she can.

**Metroid: Other M (2010)**
*Canon:* With the fall of the last Metroid and Mother Brain, Samus was rehabilitated. Scientists removed the Metroid remains from her suit armor and genetically recreated the Metroid species. Samus intercepts a distress signal from a seemingly abandoned Galactic Federation space station. She meets a Federation Squad headed by Adam, her former CO, and together they explore the station. Further exploration reveals that the scientists recreated Metroids without their weakness to ice. Adam sacrifices himself to take out the sector containing these Metroids, leaving Samus to take care of the rest of the site. Samus finds a Metroid Queen and destroys the final Metroid in existence, again. 

*Speculation*: ""Glad you feel better, go on patrol and take it easy."" This turns into a mission where she finds her former commander, and is told that she has to kill a new breed of metroid. All of them. Again. 

Her P.T.S.D. is actually acknowledged after a ""battle with Ridley"" which I think is beyond coincidence. Her commander, whom she idolizes, dies while she's ""Fighting Ridley."" The rest of the plot has to do with reconstructing mother brain and anything Samus fears happening to her ranging from enemies being inexplicably back from the dead and rampant misogyny. Samus is unwell by the end of whatever she actually did on this mission and runs off with her commander's helmet to give her report on what she thinks she saw.

**Metroid Fusion**

*CANON* While acting as a bodyguard for researchers on the planet SR388, Samus is infected by a creature known as the X Parasite, the original prey of the Metroids. Doctors surgically remove Samus's Power Suit and cure the X infection with a vaccine created from Metroid DNA, allowing her to survive the parasite's infestation and absorb other X Parasites if she comes into contact with one. She is then sent to investigate a disturbance at the Biologic Space Laboratories research station, where researchers attempted to contain the infected Power Suit. It turns out that the infected suit became an X mimicking Samus, the SA-X. This released other X parasites inside the other specimens, and began to infect the entire station. Samus attempts to stop them and while doing so discovers a secret lab containing Metroids that the SA-X destroys. She eventually discovers that through the X's asexual reproduction, at least 10 SA-X have been created. She decides, with the help of her computer Adam, to crash the station into SR388, killing both the X on the station, and on the planet. 

**Final Speculation**
Samus is now given a low-impact position only to find a new, viral source of alien power. It's hardly in her for a moment before her ""evil clone"" returns and she chases it through the station eventually destroying everything. At this point in the series Samus is a crazy veteran with P.T.S.D., an affinity for ""X"", with demons she can't shake, and the sincere belief that her only child was killed in the name of science. ...Oh yeah, and she's crashing federation space stations into planets out of drug-fueled revenge.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_125vgz,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/125vgz/samus_has_ptsd_is_overwrought_by_guilt_and_is/,

Through a series of crossovers I have determined that Community and The Muppets might take place in the same universe. 

To understand this theory, first you need to understand how my ideas of continuity within The Muppets works. There is the Muppet ""real world"" in which the Muppets are essentially an acting troupe. The ""Real World"" for the Muppets can be seen in the ""behind the scenes"" segments of The Muppet Show and Muppets Tonight, along with certain movies and specials, like the very beginning and end of The Muppet Movie and the most recent Muppet Movie.  Then there is the ""stage"" Muppets, which consists of the Sketches on the shows, along with movies like Muppet Treasure Island, Muppet Christmas Carol, and the Great Muppet Caper. (I'm not really sure where The Muppets Take Manhattan or Muppets from Space takes place so I am not listing them). 

In 2002 NBC did a Muppet Christmas Special called (appropriately) It's A Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie. It is pretty much It's a Wonderful Life for Kermit. I have not actually seen this movie, but from what I have read it seems to take place in the ""Muppet Real World"". In [This scene from the special](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1_mC9tf--M) Miss Piggy is cast as an extra on Scrubs, indicating that in the Muppet Real World, Scrubs is just a TV Show.

Fast Foreward to [This Scene from Cougar Town](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuPr5lvCOzk) in which Ted from Scrubs Guest Stars, indicating that Scrubs and Cougar Town take place in the same universe.

Now the final link in this chain is Community. One of Abeds favorite tv shows is Cougar Town.

Since Scrubs, and by relation Cougar Town, is a TV Show in the Muppet Real World, and Cougar Town, and by relation Scrubs, is a TV show in Community, one could reason that The Muppets and Community are in the same universe. Or they are in two different universes with similar primetime schedules

1363602764.0,137,self.FanTheories,1ain7m,A small theory about Pulp Fiction,165,28,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1ain7m/a_small_theory_about_pulp_fiction/,"This is very geeky, but I have an unusual interpretation of the gold watch flashback scene (a.k.a. the Christopher Walken scene). This interpretation struck me as quite natural on my first viewing, seems self-evident on every subsequent viewing, and is supported by a close reading of the script. But I'm baffled that nobody else on the face of the earth seems to share my interpretation, if Google searches are any indication. The following is modified from a similar post I put in the imdb message board for PF.

Follow along by watching the [scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HenZ4Z7w0qM)!

I contend that Captain Koons (the Christopher Walken character) is not merely relaying the story of what happened to Major Coolidge and the watch to young Butch Coolidge, but Captain Koons is, in fact, Butch's father. ""Major Coolidge"" may or may not actually exist. If Major Coolidge does exist, Captain Koons is him and ""Captain Koons"" does not exist. In either case, the person calling himself Captain Koons is lying about his identity and relationship with Butch's father, though most of history of the gold watch is probably true. Let me lay out the evidence.

1. The mother. At the beginning of this scene the mother gets Butch's attention and, very calmly and unemotionally, asks ""Do you remember when I told you daddy died in the POW camp?"" To me, the way this line is delivered, and it's weird manner of exposition, implies she, at some previous point in time, fabricated the POW story about ""daddy"". Like the way a parent of a young child might say ""Do you remember what I told you Santa will do if you keep being naughty?"" If daddy did die in the POW camp, presumably she just now met Captain Koons and heard the whole story of what happened to her husband for the first time. Shouldn't she be more worked up about this? Right off the bat, with the mother's introduction, I think the clear implication is that ""Captain Koons"", the man standing right next to her, is actually Butch's biological father, they're separated or were never married in the first place, and they've concocted a convenient story about what happened to daddy so Butch doesn't bear the weight of knowing his parents are separated or he's an illegitimate child. It's a story that needs to be elaborated upon now to pass the watch on to Butch.

2. The age discrepancy. **The script says Butch is five years old in this scene**. In the story Koons tells, he says ""*Five long years, [Major Coolidge] wore this watch up his ass. Then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass for two years. Then,* **after seven years**, *I was sent home to my family.*"" So Major Coolidge left for Vietnam no less than seven years ago, according to Koons, an assertion that also appears in the script. This is biologically impossible if Butch is just five years old. ""Koons"" has to be lying. It's not clear why Butch's father would lie about the amount of time he spent in Vietnam. Maybe he's throwing a number out there that covers the span of Butch's life to rationalize why he's never met Butch before, but forgets or neglects how old Butch actually is and accidentally renders his story nonsensical. Whatever the case may be, his story cannot be true on its face. And QT is usually not so sloppy to let the details contained within a scene contradict themselves so blatantly as the five years/seven years thing.

3. Dying of dysentery. The particular phrasing ""...when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch"" sounds like after-the-fact bullshitting. Either Coolidge died, and Koons took the watch from his ass, or Coolidge gave Koons the watch because he knew he was dying. In either case it's hard to imagine stumbling into the wording Koons actually uses.

4. ""Captain Koons"" begins his monologue, ""Hello, little man. Boy, I sure heard a bunch about you."" Where and when did he hear a bunch about Butch? Major Coolidge would never have met his son due to the age/time discrepancy. Maybe the mother wrote him letters about Butch while he was a POW? Would the Vietcong have allowed that? Or maybe Koons is saying the mother, just now in the other room, has been telling him about Butch? Either way this line strikes me as out of place and ill-fitting.

5. ""Captain Koons"" knows a lot of details about the history of the watch. An array of names and places that would be hard for someone outside the family to personalize in a retelling. Did Major Coolidge tell Koons all this stuff in the POW camp? Tell Koons to pass along this whole story to his son, on the condition that Coolidge doesn't make it home? Koons' telling of the story, especially regarding Dane Coolidge on Wake Island, seems very personalized and emotional. It's subjective, but this doesn't sound like a man telling another man's story to me. 

6. Later in movie Butch says to Fabienne, ""You know what my father went through to git me that watch?"" But if we're to believe Koons, Major Coolidge didn't do anything to ""get"" the watch to Butch. This suggests Butch learned the truth about his father later. 

Additionally, a clumsy cover story for the father figure passing on the watch to his son is thematically fitting. At this point in the film, we just transitioned from Mia and Vincent agreeing not to tell Marcellus about the overdosing, and we're heading into a story about Butch not throwing the fight he promised to throw. Everything has a certain cynical and deceptive edge, and it's appropriate that the gold watch story is likewise. Otherwise it's a strangely sincere interlude right in the middle of the movie. If Koons is actually Butch's father it also adds an interesting wrinkle to Butch's relationship with the watch. Growing up with a willfully absent father, the watch is now his only link to something approaching an honorable heritage. It's worth pointing out that Tarantino's father abandoned him at a young age as well, only to attempt to patch things up when Tarantino became famous. QT could be writing this episode of his life into the gold watch story.

Is this interpretation not evident to anyone else? The bad timing about the years is the strongest evidence, but it relies on information only found in the script. To me, the conclusion comes right there on the screen in the way the scene is acted, Koons' vast knowledge of the watch, and the expectation of some kind of complicating layer in everything so far in PF. Koons/Coolidge and the mother are telling Butch a convenient story so the watch can be passed along while sparing a small child the truth of his father abandoning them or the separation of the parents, whatever the case may be.

A few outstanding questions:

* ~~Is anyone able to read the name tag on ""Koons'"" uniform? My DVD is too low-res, but maybe the Blu-Ray version is more readable? The name looks too short to be ""Coolidge"" but also doesn't look like ""Koons"".~~ (Edit: via MetalKeirSolid's high-res photo link in the comments, the name tag is clearly Koons)

* Does anyone know about Vietnam-era uniforms to tell if Koons' uniform betrays any information about his rank or activities? Or any information at all that backs up or contradicts his story? (What are those medal-type things)?

* Adult Butch is supposed to be twenty-five. If the movie takes place in 1994 and young Butch is five, the flashback takes place in 1974. A cursory search shows the last POWs were released in 1973, so fudging by a year, that much is plausible. Does anyone know anything more granular about Vietnam POWs that would support or contradict Koons' story?

(Another, self-indulgent data point: My first name IRL is Craig. In Django Unchained, there's a plot point involving the name of an outlaw known as ""Crazy Craig Koons"". This name is uttered out loud at least twice, including by Tarantino himself, playing an Australian miner. In the paranoid recesses of my mind, QT found my silly theory on imdb and is personally calling me crazy.)

**TL;DR I think Captain Koons is actually Butch's father and I've way over-thought it.**

Yes, it's not a ""Springfield"" at all. It's not Springfield, MA, not Springfield, VT, not Springfield, NY, etc. It's Portland, OR.

Matt Groening has fooled everyone in a witchhunt to determined which Springfield is the Simpson's Springfield, but it's always been Portland.

Why?

* Matt Groening's own hometown is Portland, OR. (His home street is even Evergreen Terrace.)
* They got the name ""Springfield"" because the show's other co-creator, Mike Scully, is from a ""Springfield"" (Massachusettes, which is why Mayor Quimby is based on Ted Kennedy) and Groening opted to name the town ""Springfield"" after Springfield, Oregon rather than Portland (since both creators were from or close to a ""Springfield""), and because the town name of Springfield is extremely common.
* Springfield has similar geography as Portland... it is surrounded by mountains one one side and filled with rivers.
* Most of the characters' names (Flanders, Lovejoy, etc) come from street signs in Portland. ""Ned Flanders"" for example comes from a sign titled ""NE Flanders"".
* Springfield is driving distance from Alaska.
* Springfield is driving distance from Hollywood.
* KBBL, their major radio station, starts with a K, putting it west of the Mississippi River.
* [An official aerial shot of Springfield](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/71/Springfield.png). It looks like Portland, OR.

On the show Game of Thrones, and better exemplified in the books, it seems like most characters get names and in the book physical descriptions. It seems almost pointless to name minor characters because they are basically red-shirts, acting as death filler in between deaths of bigger characters or plot changes. This isn't to hurt your head though, adding a name to someone is perhaps the most basic form of identification, whether it's a real name or a nick name. In the book I remember thinking, this character is barely mentioned, why does it matter their name? A battle later and characters are looking at the dead and you will likely recognize the name as one dropped earlier in the story.  
  
I believe the author George R. R. Martin did this as an example of the horrors of war. It's a lot easier to slap a number to the amount of people lost, but when you list their names you see their faces and perhaps think of their families or lives before their death. These are really minor characters I am talking about. It seems like they are in the story long enough to be named, described, then killed.

**Background:**

In Futurama, Vergon 6 is a planet we visit in the first season. The Planet Express team is tasked with a Noah's Ark-type operation in which they transport two animals of each indigenous species of Vergon 6 off the planet, ideally to keep the species alive. After the arduous task of animal collection (and after Zapp rocks Leela's world), Leela meets ""Nibbler"", an undocumented species, but cute and seemingly harmless. Nibbler, however, has an insatiable hunger and consumes all of the species en mass... because he doesn't know any better.

However, we Futurama watchers DO know better. Nibbler reveals himself in a later episode to be an animal of outstanding age and intelligence. Not to mention, his species acts as moral watchmen, guarding the equilibriums of the cosmos. If any creature in the Biverse (regular AND cowboy) knows the ramifications of slaughtering the last specimens of a dying planet, it's Nibbler.

In the third DVD movie of Futurama, we learn Nibbler was the lead scientist of a Nibblonian outpost on Vergon 6, tasked with the study of these very same animals. The Nibblonians presence on the planet alters it structurally, with the Nibblonian defecation of Dark Matter making its way into the planet's core (and eventually becoming the principle material of the planet core). When Vergon 6 is mined for its Dark Matter, the planet becomes structurally unsound and begins imploding, leading to the aforementioned events in Season 1.

**Theory/Interpretation:**

***Nibbler knowingly and purposefully committed genocide and sought the extinction of ALL species on Vergon 6. Motive unknown.*** 

**Reasoning**:

- As stated, **Nibbler &amp; the Nibblonians are intelligent.** Nibbler is a scientist of unfathomable age, and the lead scientist over a team of similarly capable Nibblonians. It's unlikely the Nibblonians would not know the effect their defecation would have on Vergon 6 (though they might not have known what would happen after it was mined). In any case, when it becomes apparent that Vergon 6 is doomed, the Nibblonians do not *appear* to make any effort to save the indigenous species [this is the biggest hole in this theory, as we don't know if there were any animals on the departing Nibblonian ship]. They would know the ramifications of doing so. They'd also know...

- **Nibbler was left behind.** Why? He was the lead scientist of that project; the Nibblonians would not leave their team leader (an ancient and sentient being) on a dying planet simply because he had indigestion, as Nibbler suggests. This already supports that Nibbler is an unreliable narrator, which will be explored later. Now, we DO know that Nibbler had planned to be on Vergon 6 long before he was shipped there [""The Why of Fry"" (4ACV10)], and that he had long planned to rendezvous with Fry and Leela (4ACV10), so it's likely that he was the one who tipped Planet Express off to Vergon 6's distress to begin with [In 4ACV10, Nibbler makes a similar plan when he calls Panucci's Pizza and has a pizza delivered to Applied Cryogenics, setting a plan in motion to bring Fry to the year 2999]. So Nibbler was purposefully left behind to meet up with Planet Express, and, if this theory is correct, to ensure that no animals leave the planet.

- **Nibbler has a history of not telling the whole truth, operating on a need-to-know basis.** While Nibblonians are known for their Epic Feasts, I don't think Nibbler would sacrifice an entire group of species to satisfy his hunger. Nibbler knows his caretaker Leela would never understand why animals would have to die, so he feigns ignorance and hunger when eating all of the animals from Vergon 6. This is consistent with what we know about Nibbler and the Nibblonians; they are willing to take advantage of people/lesser beings to accomplish what they feel is best for the Biverse. This is most plainly evident in 4ACV10 when they freeze Fry for 1000 years, tearing him away from his entire life in the year 1999, and kidnap him again the same episode to perform a high-risk operation in enemy territory. Fry is never made aware of the circumstances surrounding his freezing until the Big Brains (not to be confused with square-dancing stomachs) show him.

**Known Holes and Requests for More Info:**

- **Motive:** We don't know WHY the Nibblonians would kill all of these animals. Also, other than their regular consumption of these animals, we don't see any animosity toward these animals by the Nibblonians. One wild theory of mine is that the Nibblonians, who are mystic and have access to sooth-saying Sages, might have ""known"" that these animals would cause harm to the Biverse and had to be killed.

- **Ulterior Methods of Animal Extraction:** The Nibblonian research team leaves on a large ship, much larger than Planet Express Ship, and likely could have taken animal colonies with them when they left (these were probably killed or captured by MomCorp, but the intention was there). However, we do not see this occurring, so the laws of movie-making suggest it did not happen (or was not important enough to show).

***TL;DR: Nibbler and the Nibblonians were too smart to accidentally let an entire planet of animals become extinct. Either they took animals with them when they left, or Nibbler was left behind to ensure the planet was completely liquidated.***",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1f1nfe,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1f1nfe/theory_about_futurama_nibbler_and_vergon_6/,

You see, The Wiggles are the first four of the Seven Seals, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

Clues to their prophetic design can be found in many of their songs and imagery, but none more so than is put forward in ""Big Red Car"".

**CONQUEST**

""I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals. Then I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder, ""Come and see!""

Greg (Yellow Wiggle) represents Conquest. The leader of the Riders, Greg has always been seen as the frontman, driving them forward with his war songs and battlecries. Conquest has been interpreted by some as a Christ-like figure, if not Christ himself. This fits with Greg's absence [death] from the band due to illness, and subsequent return [resurrection] when he ""got better"".

*Anthony is eating*

*He's got so much food*

*He's eating apples and oranges*

*And fruit salad too*

Anthony (Blue Wiggle) represents Famine. In almost every instance where a song involves making or eating food (sustenance), Anthony is always controlling it. Famine is depicted carrying scales used for the barter and distribution of crops, and Anthony is well known as the bands financial manager.

We first hear of Willie Wonka's chocolate factory and all of the glorious products that come out of it in the introduction - everyone knows what it is, where it is, and what comes out of it. Candy and sweets that blow the competition away. Trade secrets that can't be reproduced anywhere without major costs or the stealing of secrets by insiders. Sugar and sweets that are just too good to be real. It all seems like heaven for kids.

Upon first glance, the 5 chosen children experience a world of wonder. A room that's made of nothing but candy. Confection perfection is prolific, and an ongoing theme. There is an almost too-perfect environment that is well maintained by an elite force of creatures that don't seem to be of this world. Willie comments on how they're a bit mischievous and love to poke fun at visitors' weaknesses in song and dance. How and from where he's recruited them? We'll get back to that.

Each child represents one of the deadly sins (only four of them are represented here). Augustus represents gluttony. He doesn't know when enough is enough. Even upon entering the candy room, he is shown eating a candy bar. In a chocolate factory. Surely this wouldn't be necessary knowing where he is going, but he persists at what he does and it ultimately costs him as he succumbs to becoming trapped in the very candy he loved to eat. The factory turns the tables and Augustus becomes what he eats.

Veruca represents greed. She can never get enough of whatever it is she wants. She is fickle and greedy, and is only satiated by instant gratification. Additionally, she only cares for herself and no one else (evidenced by a wish-granting rich father, as well as always being first in line). Too much is never enough and when she tries to take the one thing she cannot have, she is sent packing, through the garbage chute by the factory. The factory gives her only things she does not desire - a face full of refuse.

Violet represents pride. She is a world record gum chewer, and is full of herself for what she has accomplished - medals, trophies, a materialistic world of empty beauty and recognition to feed her undying need of other's approval. As she takes Wonka's prototype gum, she tells Willie off while he warns her of its ill-effects and how it is not ready. As a prideful champ, she can handle whatever is thrown her way, and when she chews the gum, she falls for the trap. Her pride costs her her trip through the factory and she is dropped from the tour as well as enduring physical transformation for her transgression The factory takes her pride by taking her appearance.

Mike Teevee represents sloth. He is a lazy, arrogant jerkbag whom has no respect for authority, and uses this disrespect to force others to do his bidding and give in to his wants. He single-handedly cracked the distribution system without any effort - he didn't have to get up and do anything other than some math to ""win"" the contest and make a single purchase (let's not even forget he didn't even want the chocolate, either - he can't even care about a short-term win). He does nothing but complain about being away from his comfort zone - his lazy zone, and isn't even interested in the prize he has won in favor of watching TV or playing video games. Mike falls prey to the ultimate laziness - being able to move from one location to another (Wonkavision) without having to so much as take one step. The push of a button satisfies his needs, but also costs him his entry in the contest by shrinking him down to a small, useless person. The factory shows everyone what he really is.

Finally, we have Charlie Bucket. Wonka sees him a bit differently, and although he too had scummed to a self-interest, he is burdened with a sense of morality, and he understands what he did was wrong. It was because of this understanding that the factory let him live through the fizzy lifting drink scene, and gave him a second chance to make amends. The second chance was noted in the end, when Charlie forewent the gobstopper that Wonka had given him. He understood that taking that candy to Slugworth would be the ultimate crime against Wonka, and the repent and goodwill of Charlie handed it back to him, foregoing riches to ensure the safety of the factory that almost took his life. He made a mistake, but made his penance and was rewarded for it in several different ways.

The factory - is a magical place with a veneer of wonder and excitement - but underneath these extremities lives a vengeful, deathly location, a place between here and there. The factory puts these temptations in front of various passers-by to lure them into traps based upon their weaknesses. Similar to any other trial, it is a place where one's very soul is tested. To pass the factory is to pass the challenge of being a good person and good triumphing over evil. To fail is to be sent back from whence one came for a bit of much-needed self evaluation/reflection.

The Oompa Loopmas - are entities whom seldom interfere with one's actions, but illuminate the circumstances and berate and bother the individuals based upon actions taken by them based on their weaknesses. They impart humiliation and fear into those they surround. They are other-worldly creatures whom are unknown in origin to normal people. It's interesting that Willie is so familiar with them and can order them around - they are is slaves, and he is their master. They are enslaved to him because of their own needs which require fulfillment - the cocoa bean is their weakness. They receive what they need from Willie, but not before he gets anything and everything he needs to keep his magical factory up and running. And with a seemingly endless supply of them, they are a force to be reckoned with. There is no known way to reach oompa land - insinuating that the only way to this place is somehow through the factory, a mysterious, dangerous place itself.

And finally, Willie Wonka - Willie sends for, and allows the children to be tested. He runs the factory and directs the oompa loompas. He leads the excursion. He creates the traps. He manipulates the environments and twists reality to suit his own requirements. He is a trickster, and a cunning one, under the guise of a lovable candy-making kid-loving benevolent and sweet factory owner. A self-made man.

We know the devil is/does all of these things - trick people into traps, tests people's weaknesses, commands an army of other-worlders whom are stuck in their positions because of a loss of relation with anything but what they know - evil - represented here by candy. The factory is purgatory, where people go to be tested and tried, only passing through if they are worthy. If they pass, they are rewarded. If they fail, they are swept back into the misery of trying to satisfy their needs. Willie Wonka is the orchestrator, the one whom sent his evil trickery in the form of candy, all over the planet in a global mastermind scheme to collect evil from the earth. His trumping factor is Charlie Bucket, the one child whom happened to repent and turn from the evil he so desperately considered. All of the children are desperation in a sense, each needing their own devices. The one that stands out and passes is the one that foregoes his own needs and considers others before himself (he thought about selling the ticket, he returned the gobstopper, he chose his family over all else, and even gave his grandpa Joe the  adventure of a lifetime. Charlie Bucket isn't apart from his own evil (he stole fizzy lifting drink), but he made peace and apologized for it with his actions and consideration.

TL:DR Willie Wonka is the devil, oompa loompas are the devils' minions, the children all carry evil, each one succumbs to their own evil and is destroyed by their own devices, the factory that tests them is purgatory, and Charlie bucket is the one saving grace whom passes most all tests - what we could expect from a human who is not perfect, but who *is* loving, caring, and good.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_ye52z,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/ye52z/willie_wonka_is_the_devil_incarnate/,

She was a student of ""Grandama Death"" who wrote ""The Philosophy of Time Travel."" Because of this, she starts to see the warning signs in her son that he is exhibiting the signs of someone who is ""out of place"" with time. 

The Government is aware of this condition in humans, and actively goes out of its way to try and stop it. They lobotomized Grandma Death, and forced Mrs Darko to live a life in quiet suburbia, never to speak of what she knew ever again. This is why we see Donnie seeing things involving time travel around all of the other members of his family except for his mother. 

If you remember the final scene of the movie it shows the family crying and distraught over the death of Donnie. But his mother is sitting against the side of a tree smoking a cigarette. This is because she knew that Donnie would die, but was hoping to try and create another life for him by sending him to a doctor and keeping him on medication to try and subdue it. When she and her husband go to see the doctor she becomes very visibly upset by the idea that they have to put him on more medication. Not only because she knows it's destroying a gift that she, herself, was forced to abandon, but also because she sees that things are spinning out of her control, and could eventually be leading to the horrific end that awaits her son. 

When it comes to the Government, they are the men who are the supposed airline agents (the men in the back can be seen standing with sunglasses on and looking very intimidating) and they can't fully tell the house what happened about the serial number on the airplane. Why? Because they were the ones who tried to kill him. They decided to take out two birds with one stone, by using the airline his mother was on to kill him in his room. But it had to be the right time, at the end of Oct, when she would be on the flight. 

To monitor Donnie, the government assigned a temporal ""watcher"", which is the fat, smoking man in the track suit, to make sure that he was proceeding along accordingly to be dealt with. This is the guy who is watching Donnie try to kiss his girlfriend on the path, and also the guy (in the same attire) to watch the house party on Halloween. 

The Rabbit (Frank) is an Alice In Wonderland reference, in that he was there to take Donnie through the rabbit/worm hole and away from the Government. Or he could just be a guide; someone that is there to help humans, at the very adolescence of their time travel, to continue on. He warns Donnie that his world will end in 28 days, and chooses the body of someone that came from the path of poor decisions as a warning. This being is formless, and exists only as conscious energy. That is why he asks Donnie ""Why are you wearing that human suit?""

So, the ending of The Last of Us has Joel make a decision: Let the Fireflies kill Ellie in order to study her brain and find a vaccine, or fight the Fireflies and save Ellie.  At no point is there any choice offered to the player, as Joel goes on a rampage through the hospital, to the operating room, and saves Ellie.

I've seen a lot of players say that Joel has basically ""fucked over"" humanity by preventing a vaccine from being created.  My theory is that this **isn't** the case.



* First, let's talk about the creation of the vaccine.  Personally, my faith in Joel's choice was shaken while listening to the surgeon's audio logs.  The surgeon and Marlene seem incredibly confident that a vaccine will be able to be created from Ellie's particular strain of infection.  However, is there really a guarantee?

The surgeon describes Ellie's strain of Cordyceps as having mutated even further beyond the original, human-targeting strain.  This implies two things: 1, Cordyceps mutates really quickly; 2, It's not that Ellie doesn't have Cordyceps, it's that somehow her body is able to accommodate it without it affecting her behavior.  A later audio log says that an MRI scan revealed that the fungus is completely covering her brain except for the lobes which affect cognition and behavior.

What does this mean?  First, even if a vaccine was able to be created, there's nothing preventing the Cordyceps from mutating even further and overcoming the original vaccination.  Second, any person who would be vaccinated immediately becomes a carrier (unlike actual vaccines), presenting a threat to any who are not vaccinated.  Finally, it's not actually reasonable to assume that Ellie's strain of Cordyceps would behave the same for every human, as the immunity could still lie in Ellie herself, not her mutated strain of Cordyceps.



* Second, the distribution of the vaccine.  A vaccine isn't worth anything if it isn't actually deployed, and with this particular type of vaccine (that makes every vaccinated person a carrier), an entire community would have to be vaccinated at once, or else they would risk exposure.  Also, the vaccine would be created by the Fireflies, and they are directly opposed to the Military, which governs the majority of the survivor population.  Something tells me that deployment isn't going to be as smooth as lining up at your local triage, especially when the vaccination can be abused for power rather than used for the betterment of humanity.

Speaking of the military, remember their scanners?  The military had these personal scanners that could detect the presence of Cordyceps in an individual, as seen in the first scene in Boston.  This is the military's number one tool of fighting the infection.  I don't think it's likely, or even possible, that these scanners could differentiate between regular Cordyceps and Ellie's benign Cordyceps.

This means that, given the current circumstances of the world, very few people would actually become vaccinated, making it relatively useless.  Also, if a vaccinated individual were to enter a quarantine zone and be scanned, they would be recognized as infected by a Military that probably thinks the vaccine is fake propaganda for the revolutionary Fireflies, and be executed.



* Third, the consequences of not having a vaccine.  The human race has survived for twenty years at the time of the story, and places such as Tommy's settlement have proved that it can thrive.  Sure, there is always a risk of infection due to spores, but I'm sure there are many technological advances that will render the spores ineffectual, such as sprayable fungicide, affordable masks, etc.  For the entirety of human history, the industry of agriculture has been constantly finding new ways to prevent the destruction of crops by disease and pest, it's a constant battle that humanity has proven to be very good at.  The spores will become more manageable every passing year.

Then, you have to consider the lifetime of Cordyceps.  It is, after all, a living fungus that consumes its host.  The infected persons will eventually die off by themselves after being fully consumed by the fungus.  Of course, fungal spores are notorious for having extremely long lifetimes during dormancy, but, [according to Wikipedia,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordyceps_unilateralis), Cordyceps has a predatory hyperparasite (a parasite which takes another parasite for its host) which renders 93-94% of the original cordyceps spores completely ineffectual.  Perhaps one could culture this unidentified hyperparasite to the point where it has a 100% ""kill rate"".

So, when analyzing the risks against the benefits, a vaccine isn't all that necessary or beneficial.  There are other ways of combating the fungus, and the surviving population will advance technology to the point where the cordyceps fungus will not only be dealt with, but virtually wiped off the face of the earth.



* Fourth, the importance of the narrative.  This is probably the most important point, so let's backtrack to the very beginning of the story:

&gt; Joel carries his daughter Sarah, running past multiple threats while being completely defenseless.  Once he reaches the military's perimeter, a lone soldier is faced with a choice: allow Joel and his family by, or kill them as ordered.

*Technically*, the right thing to do is to kill Joel and his family.  After all, they could possibly be carriers of the infection that haven't reached the behavior-altering level yet (it takes a day at least).  There's no way to know.  If the solder lets them by and they happen to be infected, that could mean the infection and deaths of many other people.

This is the classic ""needs of the many vs the needs of the few"" dilemma that the game constantly presents.  If you subscribe to the ethos that the many always win in that dilemma, then you have to admit that soldier acted correctly in spite of the fact that nobody in Joel's family was actually infected and he was killing innocent people.  That is the sacrifice that the ""few"" have to make in order to protect the ""many"".

But, as you can see, this technically correct action ended up being completely irrelevant and unnecessary, as the infected still overran the perimeter, and eventually the quarantine zone, and so on until civilization as a whole fell into collapse.  Sarah died for absolutely nothing, and neither the needs of the many nor the few were met.

Now contrast this with the end:

&gt; Joel carries Ellie, running past multiple threats while being completely defenseless until they reach the last line of defense, Marlene.  Joel is faced with a choice, turn back and allow Ellie to be killed for research, or kill Marlene and escape.

It's extremely important that the developers chose to show a direct comparison between the beginning scenario and the ending one, with Joel carrying a little girl past enemies while being completely defenseless.  I think this shows that there are other parallels that can be drawn.

So let's compare and contrast.  Again, *technically* the right thing to do is to allow Ellie to be killed.  Again, it's the needs of the many vs the needs of the few.  The vaccine could potentially work, and guarantee the future of the rest of humanity, or the ""many"".  Ellie's death would be a relatively small sacrifice on the part of the ""few"", right?

But think about all of the problems I described in the first three points.  The vaccine isn't guaranteed to work, it isn't guaranteed to be deployed universally, and its risks may outweigh the benefits.

Even though killing Ellie is the technically correct action, all of the signs point towards it being useless, with neither the needs of the many nor the few being met.  I think that the reason why the developers chose not to allow the player to decide the fate of Ellie was to highlight that, just like with Sarah, **the technically correct action forces a needless sacrifice that ultimately means nothing**.

An ethos that puts the many above the few in every situation is naive at best and heartless at worst, and Joel wasn't going to let the ""few"" lose twice.  Otherwise, Ellie's death and the Fireflies' actions would turn out to be irrelevant in the grand scheme of things, and humanity would continue on, but with one less human life that should've been seen as valuable as any other.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1gmv8z,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1gmv8z/the_last_of_us_why_joel_made_the_right_choice_at/,

I thought I'd pop in real quick with a comment or two about one of my new favorite subreddits; the truth is that, as an English major, I am in deep and passionate love with this subreddit, and you can rest assured that it is a love that knows no bounds. That being said, I wondered if the mods would allow me the following piece of advice for all aspiring theorists (and lurkers, such as myself):

One of the things that goes hand in hand with my studies is over-analyzing the crap out of everything, but I think in terms of literature (and note that books, films, TV shows, and video games *all* count as literature, from my perspective), it's a good thing. Always, always, always try and see what your theory says about the overall message that the creator or creators were trying to convey.

There's nothing wrong with the totally out-there theories, like ""Ed, Edd, &amp; Eddy takes place in Purgatory,"" especially because those theories are primarily intended for entertainment purposes. We don't believe that the creators *actually* wrote episodes with that in mind, because the actual evidence for that taking place is pretty under-whelming. The over-analyzing is, thus, pretty damn funny, and entertaining because, with a little bit of brainpower, and squinting your eyes, *maybe*, just *maybe* that theory works^butnotreally...

*But* I'm not so sure we should be so out-there with regard to other theories. We should always (like I said) be looking for how our theories mesh with the message of the literature. If Harry Potter is (very generally) about good prevailing over evil, it makes no sense to surmise that Harry is the next Dark Lord, or something like that, because it undercuts everything else Rowling was trying to say. And yeah, you can argue, ""But Voldyfied, interpretation is all subjective!"" Well, technically, yeah, but evidence is evidence, and if all of said evidence points to Rowling's message being A, your two cents that her message was B instead doesn't hold as much water as you thought.

Theories about the motivations of the Joker in The Dark Knight, on the other hand, can be pretty damn good, because they enhance the original message. That's really the key of a good theory. Rather than subverting everything we know (which is interesting in a, ""Whoa, holy shit, how did I never realize that?"" kind of way), they push what we *do* know to a whole new level. Our subsequent re-readings/viewings/playings with those theories in mind expand the world of the original literature, rather than simply turning it upside down for interest, or worse, shock value.

So in conclusion, keep on going with your crazy out-there theories! Those are a hell of a lot of fun to read! But make a distinction between those theories and the theories that really expand upon the original material, and think about what the creator/creators were really trying to do with the work in the first place!

By default, the sequels take part in chronological order. That's why everyone assumes Portal 2 takes place after the events of first Portal. Am I the only one to think that doesn't really make much sense?

I mean, it still MOSTLY takes part after Portal 1, but not ALL of it.

What we know:
* In Portal 1 Chell wakes up in first test chamber, in a sleeping pod.
* In Portal 2 Chell first wakes up in her sleeping chamber, where she was in stasis for 50 days since the last time she was woken up. She makes some excercises, looks at a picture, listens to some music, and goes to sleep again. The next time we see her wake up is some undefined time later, when everything around her is in decay and Wheatley is knocking on her door. 
* What we also know from the comic book ""Portal 2: Lab Rat"", is that Chell's psychological tests determined that she is likely the most tenatious person in the world - this is what made Rat Man choose her as the next test subject in hope she'll defeat GLaDOS. 

So, knowing that, do you really believe, after all those events in Portal 1, after fighting and defeating GLaDOS, after being lied to by her and attempted to be killed many times, Chell would just gladly wake up from stasis, do some situps and obediently lie down to sleep again just because some voice told her to? Really? Is this the same Chell we are talking about? ;)

So, this is my theory: The whole Portal 1 actually takes place between Chell's first and second waking up in Portal 2. 

The timeline is as follows: Chell signs up as a test subject, or is signed up, never mind, anyway - she ends up sleeping in her chamber, being woken up every 50 days for a little excercise. After one of those wakings - the one we see in at the very beginning of Portal 2 - all the horrors in Aperture Science, with neurotoxin and everything, occurs. GLaDOS kills everyone. And then proceeds to wake up subsequent test subjects and experiment with them FOR SCIENCE, because she's GLaDOS. Around that time the sole survivor of Aperture massacre, Rat Man, does his computer magic (as depicted in the comic) and makes GLaDOS wake up Chell next. Chell is transported in her pod to Test Chamber 00 and Portal 1 plot begins. [Chell eventually ""kills"" GLaDOS and - as we see in the revised ending to Portal 1 (the one that was put as an update to Portal right before P2 was released) - after the whole explosion she is dragged by Party Bot back to her sleeping chamber.](#spoiler) There she sleeps for indetermined time period, not being woken up because after [GLaDOS's death](#spoiler) the whole system is in decay. And then finally she is woken up by Wheatley and the actual plot of Portal 2 starts.

LD;DR: The whole plot of Portal 1 takes place between Chell's first and second waking up in Portal 2.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1544bq,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1544bq/portal_1_and_2_timeline/,

However, it occurred to me that it is not so much a plot whole, but more of an issue with the fact that because of Batman, Bruce Wayne never developed mature skills in his interactions with others, mainly women. Due to Bruce Wayne's pining over Rachel all his life he hasn't been able to be with another woman. When we get to the last film, Batman is almost a forty year old virgin with next to no interaction with females. Then Talia sleeps with him. This rocks his world in a way he's not quite emotionally prepared for. Therefore, he becomes super attached to her. That's why he's so willing to devote himself to her. 
However, she betrays him. Shockingly, that doesn't shake his faith in women everywhere, but presents a problem for him. He has just discovered that he likes being with women much more than he likes getting beat up. Therefore, he wants to find someone else and fast. He wants to do that again. There is willing female right there. He takes that opportunity. 
The case I'm making is that the rushed relationships in The Dark Knight Rises have less to with poor writing and more to do with the fact Batman has the labeedo of a college frat guy.

So by the end of the game it is revealed that Comstock is an alternate version of Booker.  The two characters diverge at the Baptism; Comstock takes the baptism and Booker refuses it.  Prior to the baptism, Booker's greatest sin was his participation in the Wounded Knee massacre.  What's unclear after that is how and why Comstock's personality diverges from Booker, and why he built an idol-worshipping racist city in the sky.

My theory is that by accepting the baptism, Comstock accepts that his sins are washed away, but he takes it to an extreme.  He believes not just that his sins are forgiven, but that *he must not have actually sinned in the first place*.  I.e. the baptism proves to him, in his head, that his actions at Wounded Knee were not sins, and therefore must have been righteous.  His conclusion therefore is that if the suppression and massacre of the native americans was just and righteous, then white supremacy, Manifest Destiny, and the extremes of American Exceptionalism must also be just and righteous.

Now in the mindset of divine righteousness, he meets Rosalind Lutece, and sees the beginnings of her scientific breakthroughs.  He sees the future (or rather, he sees through tears into possible futures), and interprets them as divine visions.  This then becomes his driving motivation to create Columbia: that he is a prophet, that he is without sin, that his perverted ideals are righteous.  So he creates a city, powered by the Luteces' science, that is founded on his ideals. In addition, he believes that the prophet's line must continue, but now that he has been made sterile by the Luteces' machines, he finds the closest thing he has to an heir.

Compare this with Booker: he did not accept the baptism, or forgiveness for his past actions.  In fact, throughout the game he has conversations with Elizabeth about forgiveness, and explicitly rejects the idea that he will ever be forgiven for his actions.  He is self doubting, and all he can do is learn to live with his mistakes and deeds.  After the rejected baptism, he becomes a Pinkerton agent, spirals into depression, racks up gambling debts and commits his ultimate sin: he gives up his child to Comstock.  After that, he finds a way to gain inner peace - his subconscious drives him to save the girl.  Note that he doesn't ever seek forgiveness or absolution - he doesn't believe in them - just a way to live with his mistakes and save his daughter.

All of this comes back to a quote from the creator of the game, Ken Levine:

Ted spends so long talking about his friends and his youth, the fun times he's had, but he always seems to shy away from the subject, their mother. 

Why is it just Ted? Why not how we met each other?


Because she's dead.


Somehow Teds wife and mother of his children dies while the kids are at school. He comes home in shock, unable to comprehend her sudden and unexpected death.

He sits his kids down to tell them the awful news, but he can't.
All he can think of is her, how much he loves her, how beautiful she looked the day they first met...
And that's how it starts. 

He asks if he's ever told them how he met their mother.
He can't even do that though, It's too painful. He thinks it might be easier to start with a few stupid stories about his life long friends. So he tells them a thing or two, but still can't admit she's dead. He rambles.

Now he's talking more to himself than he is to his kids. He brings up all the other women he's dated, the ones who would still be alive if he'd made things work with them.

He doesn't realize his kids are getting tired of his seemingly never ending anecdotes that actually have nothing to do with how their parents met.

He just goes on and on, finding other stories to tell, avoiding the issue as if by doing so he can avoid the actuality of her death.

In can then be inferred from this that everybody does, to some extent, already want to kill themselves in a given situation. Any negative thing about their lives would then be legitimate reason for suicide. So maybe the construction workers were miserable with their jobs, that girl's knitting friend couldn't stand listening to her babble on about whatever it was, all sorts of people start killing themselves. Dude jumped into the tiger pen because maybe he thought it would be a cool video and didn't have fear to hold him back, so it can be anything, not just negative aspects. Any reason to not want to live or just ignorance of danger gets you dead. Then it's all over the news. From this point on, anybody exposed to whatever chemical thing probably decides to kill themselves because they're afraid of the chemical thing.

And then, at the end of the movie, the two protagonists who fell in love decide that, fuck all this noise, they'd rather be together than cowering in fear from the fucking wind. And nothing happens. News reports say that it must have ended because the mass suicides have stopped. Later, they're happy together and the whole world has moved on. They even keep plants indoors.

But hold on. Now that they believe plants can do this, shouldn't they be afraid of them? They aren't. Because they have no fear of death. Because they've been exposed. They have no inhibitions about death whatsoever anymore. Why haven't they killed themselves? Because it hasn't occurred to them. They decided that fear wasn't worth it and that love was more important when they ran out into the open air. They had no anxiety about killing themselves and so they didn't die. But they don't realize it.

The world's population in the epilogue isn't just survivors of a mysteriously averted apocalypse but the people who are happy in their everyday lives. People who have no reason to die. 

Or maybe just a bunch of sociopaths without the capability of regret or empathy for all the people who did. I guess that distinction is just in the eye of the beholder.

Then, when it looks like maybe it started again, that's just people who had gotten any minor reason to kill themselves. It may cause a new mass hysteria but it won't be a new ""happening"". It'd just be more of the same one.

1339772540.0,138,self.FanTheories,v3i4r,Firefly - A Theory of Book's back story - Contains Spoilers,159,21,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/v3i4r/firefly_a_theory_of_books_back_story_contains/,"It seems to me Book's back story was originally intended to be quite different from what was shown in the comic - [The Shepherd's Tale](http://firefly.wikia.com/wiki/Serenity:_The_Shepherd's_Tale).

I have repeated this several times already in /r/firefly but someone suggested you guys would appreciate it also, so here it is.

The comic book, 'The Shepherds Tale', offered the explanation that Book had formerly been a part of the Alliance military. This does not fit the clues from Firefly at all and is in fact inconsistent with the original Firefly content.

When we first see Book he is looking at the ships, not at the destinations of the ships. As Kaylee said, ""You like ships. You don't seem to be looking at the destinations. What you care about is the ships, and mine's the nicest."" She had been watching him, and not knowing why he was looking at the ships, she 'projected' her own feelings on to him and assumed he liked ships. It was only after Kaylee asked, ""So, uh, how come you don't care where you're goin'?"", that Book gave the explanation, ""'Cause how you get there is the worthier part.""

Once on the ship the first thing he does after slipping away from the others is to go to Inara seeking information. She even wonders why he is asking so much about Mal - her line is, ""Why are you so fascinated by him?"" 

My theory is Book was an Alliance agent, working for Interpol - not for the same faction responsible for the academy/River etc. His assignment was to find out who had done the salvage, who they were dealing with, and possibly recover the stolen items. He was looking for a firefly, fitting the description of the Interpol bulletin (remember the bulletin Badger was waving around), which had arrived at about the time it would have taken to get from the location of the salvage to Pershephone. I believe Book went to Inara to see where a registered companion fit in, and if she could provide any clues about where the cargo might be hidden, and where they might be trying to off-load it.

If Book were not an Interpol agent, why was he so interested in the crew of a ship he had no intention of being with more than a few days? Why was he in the cargo area, where he had been told not to go, when Dobson pulled the gun on Mal? - unless he was searching for the stolen salvage? [Here is the scene at about the 37:00 minute mark](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVaKbcrOrp8), Mal confronts Simon in the cargo bay, and at about 37:20, Book suddenly appears - clearly, Book was already in the cargo bay even before Simon entered, and had remained hidden and watching until he felt the need to intervene. If Book was really retired ex-military and now only a shepard, why was he involving himself between Dobson and Mal? He was far from passive - he was active and distrustful of Dobson - was this because he suspected Dobson to be something other than he claimed, as he was operating out of his area, without having notified local Interpol?

Once Book heard Simon's story his priorities changed. Stopping a clandestine group, which included and was being supported by members of the government, involved in kidnapping and experimenting on children, was a much higher priority than illegal salvage. From that point on he stayed with them, as River was his best lead to tracking down the academy and putting a stop to their illegal actions.

In the episode 'The Train Job', Book knew who Niska was. How would an ex-military officer, retired for 18 years know the name of a local organized crime boss? But a local interpol agent probably would know.

In 'Safe' why would the crew of the Alliance cruiser not be willing to tell Mal and crew who Book was? If they thought he was ex-military, they should have had no reason to keep it secret. But if Book were an active duty interpol agent the alliance officer would have no idea what Book was working on, or who if any of his companions could be trusted with Book's true identity. The alliance soldiers would have been very close-mouthed about Book - which is in fact what happened. [Here is the scene - at about the 27:35 mark](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu4GgjCEBFg&amp;feature=relmfu) the alliance officer, realizes who Book is, and looks not at Book to see if he is okay, but instead the officer looks toward Mal with suspicion. If Book was really retired military they should have been surprised and asked Mal and his crew how Book happened to be with them, but they did not. For that matter, why would Book be evasive toward Mal anyway, if the explanation was so simple? On the other hand if Book was an active agent - he would have every reason to not be frank with Mal.

In 'Our Mrs. Reynolds', how would an ex-military officer know how the carrion house operated? On the other hand an active duty Interpol agent would have been briefed on it. According to the comic, Book had been out of the military for 18 years before he joined Serenity - his knowledge of current criminal activity seemed awfully good for someone who's training and experience was with war, not crime. 

In 'Jaynestown' he volunteered to watch River - to perhaps get more clues about the academy?

In 'Ariel' he was absent - was he reporting to his superiors on the progress of his undercover assignment?

In 'War Stories' - As soon as he got back, Book was in the sick bay asking Simon to find out more about River and the Academy. Book asked if the academy had tortured River 'just to meet her' in the sense Shan Yu had been speaking of. Book said, ""I'm just wondering if they were...the people who did this to your sister."" Simon responded, ""The government did this to her."" And Book said, ""A government is a body of people usually notably ungoverned."" As we saw from the blue hands guys killing the Alliance Federals on Ariel, just because two people work for the same government does not mean they have the same goals, or they work together - in fact they may be working very much against each other. Book's statement was as far as he could go to seperate his part of the government from what was done to River, short of blowing his cover.

In 'The Message' how would an ex-military officer, know where the local police station was, and how far out of their jurisdiction the dirty cops were? But an Interpol officer probably would know these things.

And in 'Objects In Space', River 'read' off of Book ""I don't give half a hump if you're innocent or not - now just where does that put you?"" Much more consistent with the thoughts of an active duty Interpol agent following River to get to the academy, and not at all consistent with the thoughts of a shepherd. Later Early said Book was not a shepherd. How would Early know that? Even if Early had studied Serenity's crew and knew of Book's military past, he should also have known Book had been a shepard for more than a decade, instead he said, ""That ain't a shepherd"" - in no uncertain terms. The question becomes, how did Early track down Serenity? Early said he had been tracking them since Ariel. If he correlated departures of firefly class ships from Persephone and Ariel, that would only give him the ship's name, not details of the crew, much less their unregistered passengers. Even if he had found information about Serenity and its current occupants from someone who knew them, there would have been nothing in that information that would say Book was not a shepherd. But, if Early had tapped into the local Interpol, looking for unusual activity in the area, and found an agent on long term undercover assignment, watching a subject named River - that would have told Early all about Book and led him right to Serenity.

And then in the movie 'Serenity', Book was no longer with them - as a shepherd, one has to wonder why he would leave his friends when they need him more than ever. But if he were an Alliance agent he would be able to stay in contact with Serenity and crew, without River being able to 'read' him and blow his cover. Later when Book talked with Mal about the operative, why would he not have told Mal how he knew so much, if all he had to say was that he was ex-military. For that matter, how would ex-military even know how 'Operatives' worked? Does anyone think the military know the details of how undercover CIA agents operate?

In short - I do not accept the comic as canon - I like my explanation much better and I feel it fits much better with the original content. If you don't agree with me - look at it this way - now you have an excuse to go back and watch Firefly again.

You can thank me later.

It is for the 2011 reboot which was so, so, so awesome. That show didn’t get enough credit
 
Thundercats 2011 takes place on Third Earth. That leads to the question…where is First and Second Earth?
 
My theory goes like this: **we** currently live on First Earth. 

In the future (be it through war or global warming or exhausting our natural resources), civilization goes too far. The planet starts to die. By now the human lifespan has increased dramatically and the overall health of our species is at a point where disease is practically non-existent. But we still need a home…so we go looking for a new one.

Ships leave First Earth to find a Second Earth, each loaded with animals as well as humans. Many humans don’t leave First Earth and die. But eventually, one group finds a new home.

But now we have to rebuild civilization with relatively few humans compared to what our population used to be. So instead of humans reproducing excessive (which would cause the problems First Earth had), scientist genetically engineered the animals on board to be human-like. For labor, some of friendship, and some to protecthumans. These human-like animals not be as smart as humans (note that the animals in Thundercats can’t make technology from scratch, only use and fix it, like many manual laborers), and they would *still* be animals, but we’d be able to talk to them, relate to them, and ensure our survived.
 
For a few thousand years, Second Earth was peaceful. The animals were our servants (and food) for a long time and we’d still take care of them in exchange for companionship. They’d do most of the manually labor while humans made the machines, cures of diseases, run the governments and so on. The humans would generically modify certain bloodlines of animals to have special skills so they could also govern themselves, hence the royal family of cats. Some gained improvements to physical abilities, like Cheetara’s incredible speed.
  
Mankind evolved too, through natural and unnatural means. We became much taller, stronger, out technology grew…the human race purged itself of as many flaws as we could. After centuries of ruling over animals with god-like technology, humans became Gods in their own way. As the book says “with dominion over the creatures who walk on the ground and fly in the skies.”

And we found a way to power our new civilization. With Power Stones. Harvested from dead stars and dying galaxies, we were able to put the energy of entire worlds into gems the size of our palm. Some had the purpose to be weapons (War Stone template), some were to operate and power machines (Tech Stone Template).
 
Then, something happened. Knowing mankind, it was probably a war. A big one. Maybe Mumm-Ra caused it, maybe he ran away when he got the chance, maybe he survived it and had the means to leave. But whatever it was, Mumm-Ra left Second Earth with as many animal slaves and weapons as he could. He had to re-harvest the Gems of Power if he wanted to keep is ship going.

Mumm-Ra isn’t “ever-living”. He has a human’s life span. Humans, the longest lived mammal on the planet, seem ever-living to a dog who is lucky to see his fifteenth year. The show shows time for the animal’s perspective and thus the flow of time seems normal.
 
Mumm-Ra has a massive ego because he sees “just cats”. He sees all of these animals as “just animals” because to him, that is what they are. Pets. Food. Creatures.

He has technology, which might be the single most definitive quality of the human race. 
 
He thinks he is a God because his kind created the inhabitants of Third Earth, because “man has dominion over all of the animals.”

And on top of all of that...Mumm-Ra looks like a human.

I believe Mumm-Ra is the last of his kind. One of us.

1361649803.0,133,self.FanTheories,193dup,[Community] The Darkest Timeline: A Theory.,202,69,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/193dup/community_the_darkest_timeline_a_theory/,"In season 3, episode 3, ""Remedial Chaos Theory"", there aren't actually six different timelines created when Jeff rolls the die to determine who gets the pizza.  There are, in fact, no other timelines, as Jeff keeps telling Abed.  The “alternate timelines” that we see in the episode are actually simulations run by Abed to see what would happen depending on the result of the die.  He simulates the six possible timelines in the split second Jeff is about to roll the die, and in doing so, he immediately sees that Jeff, that conniving sonofabitch, never has to leave to get the pizza.  

As Jeff tosses the die into the air, he then simulates the seventh timeline, the one where Jeff leaves to get the pizza, and sees that it is the best possible scenario for the study group.  So he acts to keep his friends happy and together.

**But wait, there’s more!**

But the damage from envisioning the alternate timelines remains.  As we seen in the tag of “Remedial Chaos Theory”, we see that the idea of “The Darkest Timeline” has taken root somewhere deep inside Abed’s mind.  The Darkest Timeline represents Abed’s fears of having the study group fall apart and losing his friends.  Abed knows that no one in the study group is perfect, and consequently he fears that their flaws will drive the group apart. This explains why each character of the study group loses what they value most in the Darkest Timeline, /u/Dustypotpourri’s theory explains [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/community/comments/tadvu/season_3_spoilers_proposal_of_a_theory/).  

At first, this isn’t so bad, as it helps Abed deal with negative situations in the real world.  It helps him to understand that no matter how bad things are in the Prime Timeline, it is still better than being in the Darkest Timeline.  But soon enough, Abed’s imagination goes into overdrive, and he thinks of the worst possible things that could occur, and he piles more and more darkness into the simulation, until it starts to consume him.  

When Troy and Abed briefly grow distant in Season 3 Episode 11, “Contemporary Impressionists”, Abed goes into the Dreamatorium alone, without Troy, for several reasons.  First and foremost, the fact that he and Troy had a disagreement bothers him.  In fact, it bothers him so much that he has already begun to simulate the Darkest Timeline before entering the Dreamatorium.  By now, simulating the Darkest Timeline takes a significant amount of thought and brainpower, which is why he doesn’t notice Troy’s attempt at the secret handshake.

Furthermore, Abed has simulated Evil Abed to a point where he is beginning to conceive of Evil Abed as a totally separate person.  So while he is in the Dreamatorium by himself, hurt and confused by his argument with Troy, two things happen: first, he loses touch with reality, and secondly, he suddenly notices Evil Abed’s presence as a separate person. Most importantly, he is unable to tell whether Evil Abed is real or not.  In other words, simulating the Darkest Timeline turns Abed’s meta-ness into schizophrenia, and that is why we see Evil Abed in the Dreamatorium in “Contemporary Impressionists”.

Abed finally loses it in the 3rd Season Finale, ""Introduction to Finality"", when the stress of losing Troy, the realization of his worst fear, causes Abed to completely lose his sense of reality and his faith in the good of the Prime Timeline.  This in turn, leads to Evil Abed “taking control” over Abed.  Yet we know that Evil Abed only exists in Abed’s mind.  Without Troy, Abed loses his main reason to stay in touch with reality, and “lets” the Evil Abed personality take over, as he no longer wants to deal with the world.  So Abed watches as Evil Abed tries to darken the Prime Timeline.  But it is Jeff’s speech and selfless good actions that reminds Abed that there is still good in the world.  Jeff also reminds Abed to focus on the good things in life, rather than on the bad things, and so  Abed returns to reality and is able to overcome his schizophrenia.

**tl;dr: The alternate timelines are actually just simulations occurring in Abed's mind, and Evil Abed is a result of Abed’s schizophrenia.**

Odd that it took until 2208, isn't it? The Nibblonians had been around for billions of years, and yet we're supposed to believe that they never made this breakthrough? 

It's not that they couldn't do it; it's that they didn't want to. At least, not until the time was right. If light traveled faster, that would mean the Brain Spawn could move faster as well, completing their plan sooner. Sure enough, only 800 years after the speed of light was increased, the Brain Spawn were ready to destroy the universe.

Odd too, in all of the billions of years of the universe's history, the one being who could stop the Brain Spawn had been born only 1,000 years before.

This is no coincidence. Once Philip J. Fry was born, the Nibblonians realized that they finally had a way to stop the Brain Spawn. They began seeding Earth with advanced technology, so that Fry could survive to confront the Brains, and do so as soon as possible. This is why, in the year 1999, Earth had cryogenics equipment capable of keeping a person alive and intact instead of turning them into a mass of ruptured cells. (Ron Popeil later used similar technology to keep heads alive in jars.)

If the Nibblonians increased the speed of light themselves, it would tip their hand. Fortunately, as Professor Farnsworth shows, Earth has a tendency to produce mad scientists willing to upset the balance of space and time. After just two centuries of sped-up development, Earth's scientists were capable of altering the speed of light.

He does this in ways that are hard to see (farting). Also he frequently and openly insults his children (making fun of Meg being ugly/ Chris being fat). It also gets sexual at times (in a recent episode when Peter gets very angry the entire family takes a bath naked together and gets yelled at). He is also an alcoholic but because Stewie is a baby he does not understand and just thinks he drinks. Lois is forced to stay with Peter because after such a long amount of time dealing with abuse she sees herself as worthless also she has not had a stable job in years (in one episode she is applying for a job and on her job app it says she has been a housewife since late 80's early 90's) and Peter has a job. This is also why she can sympathize with Quamire's sister. Brain is real but does not actually talk but instead he subconsciously imagines it as because he sees the pain of his household but does not know what to do.

1354486950.0,128,self.FanTheories,1463p4,Mass Effect 1 is a simulation leading up to Mass Effect 2,191,63,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1463p4/mass_effect_1_is_a_simulation_leading_up_to_mass/,"One thing that never sat well with me in Mass Effect 2, is that they bring Shepard back to life. I can accept that they can bring back his body, but his brain would have been destroyed in deep space. [This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmyfqZXfmE) explains the exact science of why something like that just wouldn't work. Despite the Mass Effect universe being somewhat fantastical, it is still grounded in reality for the most part. So unless the laws of biology are different in the Mass Effect universe, Shepard is brain dead at the start of Mass Effect 2.

This would mean that Shepard's personality, memories, attitude etc. would have been erased, since this is what is seen in the higher function parts of the brain that would, inevitably, be destroyed in Shepard's death. It's already seen by the end of the Lazarus project that Shepard has already had to undergo several replacements to his person to be brought back to life.

It's established in the game that Shepard is essentially a cyborg at this point. Not really a robot but with enough synthetic parts to be considered a synthetic by the Catalyst. The inevitable damage to his brain suggests that it is partially cybernetic or at least has been implanted much like other parts of his body. So the brain inside of Shepard isn't really ""him"", so much as it is a faxsimilie of a working brain, missing everything that made Shepard Shepard. 

The Illusive Man isn't interested in just creating a clone of Shepard. It's stated that the whole reason Shepard is brought back is because of who he is, what he represents, not to just create a puppet. Otherwise you just have someone parading around looking like Shepard rather than being Shepard. Thus you need them to act like Shepard.

This is where the first game comes into play. What the first game is, in essence, is a simulation being run on Shepard's highly damaged brain enhanced back to working order by cybernetics. Cerberus had to make the new Shepard, implants and all, believe he was actually the original Shepard, including his memory. So one way to do this is to convince the cybernetically enhanced brain that they have been through the same experiences as Shepard.

Thus the first game is actually a simulation being run on a Cerberus computer, designed solely to convince the new brain in Shepard that it is infact the original Shepard, and for that brain to have the same personality. What's noticeable in the first game is that a lot of the conventions found in Mass Effect 2 (reloading weapons, how biotics work etc.) work differently. This could be done on purpose by Cerberus to better acclimate the brain to the simulation in some way. Plus you can add on a film grain effect in the graphics options. This gives the whole game a feeling of watching a monitor or old tv, thus making the events literally seem like rerun footage. Considering that Cerberus has many contacts to get information, they could have gained info about Shepard from security recordings, testimony from others etc. so that the events most closely resemble what actually happened.

So where does that leave us as the player? Well, essentially, we the player are that brain. We are the one's who are being told this story, and getting a grasp on who Shepard is. We see all these events as they supposedly played out right in front of us. Thus we never question the narrative switch to Mass Effect 2, because as far as we're concerned, we're still Shepard. We are the brain, and we have been tricked.

**tl;dr** Mass Effect 1 is a simulation run on a highly damaged, cybernetic brain of Shepard to relive his actions so that newly created brain believe itself to be Shepard and thus act accordingly.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1463p4,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1463p4/mass_effect_1_is_a_simulation_leading_up_to_mass/,

Or reverse deja-vu, I guess.  For half the film I couldn't put my finger on it until I realized that he bears an uncanny resemblance to Ryan Gosling, especially with the bleach-blonde hair and his more recent role in Place Beyond the Pines.

While I haven't seen PBTP, I have seen Drive recently.  Fargo is set in 1987, when Grimsrud is probably sent to life in prison, if not death row.  Who knows how old the Driver is supposed to be, but that seems about right for a cut-off date.  He certainly doesn't seem any younger than 25/26.  Both characters have a gift for violence and a very reserved, laconic personality highlighted by minimal, delayed speech.  So I imagined the Driver as Grimsrud's biological son from some tryst in the 80's -- perhaps even the one shown in Fargo w/ Buscemi and the two young women (go bears).  He inherited his sociopathic disposition from his father, but I laughed in spite of myself when Buscemi complains to Grumsrud about having to do all the driving.

Pretty much all of their technology was donated from those other nations, which is why people have little understanding of how it works other than at a superficial level.  The terms ""fag"" and ""retarded"" were a result of their xenophobia and limited vocabulary for insulting people.

 (Batwing, Batplane, etc)

My friends said after the movie, ""This would not work, it is not feasible, etc, etc."" I was particularly amused by the aerospace engineering freshmen (to be sophmore) who was very sure that it wouldn't work. Now, I don't think its a craft worth making in any imaginable way, but I think it is workable and feasible. It could be created.

Why? *Because the rotors do not actually provide lift.* Have you ever seen a helicopter with rotors small than it? Have you ever seen them below the helicopter? No! This is because rotors do not work this way. They're inherently unstable. But, there are rotors that can be a bit more workable:

Lift is provided by an unseen jet, similar to the Harrier Jump Jets. Why do I say this? Because the guy who did it said so: Chris Courbal said that ***""The final version of the Bat takes its design cues from the Harrier Jump Jet, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey and the Boeing AH-64 Apache.""*** The flight system is taken from the Harrier, the idea of having movable rotors from the Osprey, and the cockpit schema from the Apache. In other words, it is wrong to think of it as ""just a helicopter.""  It isn't a helicopter, it isn't a plane: It's the Bat.

.

**The Nuclear Blast**

*Escaping It*

The fastest speed for a helicopter is 250mph, or around 110m/s.  The blast radius of the bomb is 6 miles, or about 9.65k. This is 9650 meters. This means that, in order to  get six miles away from city's coast, it would require about 90 seconds. We can add onto that for the fact they weren't at the coast, and that being farther away would be better. Did the atomic bomb get carried away in time? I do not know. However, we can magically change the speed of the Bat to be a plane, not a helicopter, and it could easily reach higher speeds (maybe).

*Wayne's Survival*

We don't have to worry about Batman dying because Wayne fixed the autopilot. Simple as that. He ejected from the craft somewhere in the city (remember, in DK we saw that his suit could essentially glide and we saw that the plane was low to the ground). So, only 6 miles, not 12.


*Realism of the Atomic Weapon*

Then there are several questions about the atomic weapon and its use. These include (1) fall out and (2) tsunami.

The first question, that of fall out, is answered by realizing that  fall out is most dangerous in ground bursts above land. Why is this? Well, you have to understand what fall out actually is, and it happens to be, literally, dust that falls from the sky. This dust is created by (1) being products of the reaction or (2) ionizing radiation bombarding shit with neutrons. What happened in the DKR is a cold fusion, semi-ground, water burst (We know that it was a semi-ground burst because there was a mushroom cloud, but we also know that the Batwing was flying upwards as it departed Gotham, presumably somewhere above 2000ft. Furthermore, it has the characteristics of an air burst: ""Air bursts produce white and steamy stems."").... 

What does this all mean? There aren't any radioactive materials in the first place, just hydrogen, and all of the ionized ""stuff"" was water. Whats great about water is it stays in the atmosphere a long time compared to most dust, which means it will be older, less radioactive, and safer by the time it falls down. That is why ground bursts are so dangerous: it throws up much more dust and that dust, still radioactive, is much heavier.

Furthermore, comparisons to Chernobyl are stupid. Chernobyl, and the current problems in Japan, are from sustained leaks of radioactive dust. Compared to current nuclear weapon sites and Hiroshima/Nagasaki, we find our bomb will produce much less damage. Hiroshima and Nagasaki are thriving cities. There are no long term effects of atomic bomb. 

The second question is, ""How much damage would a tsunami do?"" The answer is to be found in nature: The Krakatoa explosion in the Indian ocean caused a tsunami of 40 m. Krakatoa had the explosive force of a 200 megaton nuclear weapon.... this is compared to Hiroshima, which was a 20 kiloton nuclear weapon. In other words, there is a power difference of 10,000. Not only that, but Krakatoa was *in the ground* displacing water, the bomb in DKR was in the air.

I think it can be safely, safely said that the weapon in DKR did not create a substantial tsunami.

Now, with fall out and the tsunami explained, lets note that *even if* these did cause deaths, they were not worth mentioning in the movies.


***The biggest problem was that everybody gazed right at the damn thing.*** COME ON, NOLAN. Don't look at these things. You're supposed to wear some goddamned special glasses or look at a mirror through a mirror through a filter. Pssssh.


**tl;dr: Spoilers: The Batwing is feasible, though unlikely, and the bomb was probably taken to a distance that was far enough away that the shockwave wouldn't be too bad. Any lives lost to *very, very small* fallout or tsunamis, are not even worth noting in the movie. The biggest problem is that everybody stared.**

* **Listen to the full album [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wvrRJnTqEw)**

The opening song of the album, *Teeth Like God's Shoeshine* takes place in a mall, where the protagonist (who, like in my last post, I'll call Isaac) is meeting up with a customer. While he's there, he takes to people watching; ""Here's the man with teeth like God's shoeshine - he sparkles, shimmers, shines. Lets all have another Orange Julius; thick syrup, standing in lines."" While he's doing this, he remarks at what he thinks of the malls (soon-to-be ghost towns) and Capitalism in general (""Oh! If you could compact your conscience and sell it, save it for another time - You might have to use it.)

From there, in *Heart Cooks Brain,* Isaac is still at the mall, bored as hell. He starts questioning what he's doing, and why he's doing it. His head is telling him one thing, his heart, his conscience, is telling him another. You get the sense that he's new at this; selling drugs. This might even be his first delivery. He's scared of where he's heading like a bitter buffalo being forced off a cliff. He's scared of being caught; that his whole life will be ruined by this one moment. In the end though, the deal goes off without a hitch, and he leaves the mall. *Convenient Parking* is full of his thoughts as he's leaving; it talks about a network of parking lots that lead to big streets that lead to cities. The reason that the best parking is at the back, he concludes, is because it's the furthest removed that he's going to get from this network.

After he's done, Isaac goes to the Lounge to kill off some steam, and in his typical people-watching fashion notices a woman, ""going with a cinematographer"" who was ""really a pornographer,"" a man hitting feebly on a woman (""You...are so hot...I would like to steal your digits...) and another with a ""girlfriend out of the city."" The girl's gonna get fucked, the first guy probably isn't, and the other one doesn't want to be. It shows the full spectrum; and Isaac's wondering what's going to happen to him (""My brain's the burger and my heart is the charcoal..."")

*Jesus Christ Was an Only Child* explains Isaac's view on God, as well as, again, capitalism. He's grateful to be in his position, where he doesn't have to work his fingers to the bone. At the same time, he compares himself to Jesus. When he talks about Jesus' dad being ""oh-so-mad"", he's talking about his childhood. When he says that Joseph should have killed the little fucker, you can't help but get the feeling that he's talking about himself; wishing he had never been born into the lonesome, crowded West.

*Doin' The Cockroach* furthers the idea that Isaac's atheist with the first line, and from there it's more people watching and introspection. Riding on a bus, he sees doctors and lawyers as cash fiends, and wishes that the world would just leave him alone. What's interesting is that with each of the people he's encountered so far, it doesn't seem so far-fetched that they're the kind of people he's selling to; the fucked, the not fucked, the lonely, the rich, the crazer-daydreaming-disasters. He realizes that he's doing the cockroach along with everyone else.

*Cowboy Dan* is one of Isaac's customers. A drunk, with a penchant for firing guns at God and hating the city, Isaac is drawn to him, and can relate to him. It's here that it's first hinted at that Isaac might have a drinking problem, and gives Isaac his first out from the lifestyle he's so tired of. He does, however, realize that Dan's pretty much insane, so he finishes the deal and leaves, a little more self-aware.

The next deal he does is with a piece of *Trailer Trash;* a boy, still in highschool, wondering how he'll finish. He uses the drugs to cope, it would seem with the stress and bellyaches. The boy is is a little unstable due to his parents divorce, not having enough food on the table, and poor grades. In addition, it's also hinted at that he's recently had his heart broken. He takes this anger out on Isaac, who leaves as soon as he can before the boy apologizes ""I know that I miss you... and I'm sorry if I dissed you...""

After these two experiences which Isaac can relate to almost too-well, he has an existential crisis, where he again questions what it is he's doing. He feels like he's *Out of Gas* at the end of the road, and spirals into his heavy drinking. He keeps up his job, as a *Long Distance Drunk,* before eventually (and understandably), he encounters *Shit Luck.*

By this point, he's entrenched in the drug trade; he's a full-blown alcoholic, and any of the revelations he's made have passed him by. Instead of sticking to just the West, he's travelling cross-country; and instead of sticking to just alcohol, he's ""writing maps in the stalls"" (snorting lines). He doesn't feel, and it feels great! None of his problems can bug him anymore because he's too fucked up to care (like the woman in *Lounge*). The last half of the song is a long instrumental, heavy on the drums. You get the feeling that a lot of time passes where he's in this stage, and after enough time has passed, his old revelations start to come back, along with some new ones.

In *Polar Opposites,* Isaac starts questioning again. Every day is the same; the people he saw before are all blending together into one; even the polar opposites don't push away. He questions his drinking, and how he's ""Trying to drink away the part of the day that he cannot sleep away."" He's *miserable* and he *hates* it. His life's primer grey, which to him means he's already dead.

*Bankrupt on Selling* is the climax of it all. His questioning of religion leads him to the conclusion that even the apostles and angels are greedy like the lawyers and ""bankers in unlimited hell where they buy and they sell and they sell all their trash to each other till their sick of it all and they're bankrupt on selling."" 

That line really sums up Isaac's journey. He hated bankers at the start, and he realizes that he's become practically the same thing, buying and selling drugs instead of stocks. He's coming to the happy realization that he's bankrupted that part of him, and it's time to move on to something better. Still cynical, however, he shuns the idea of returning to college, because it's just not what he wants. Finally, he realizes what it is he wants.

It took a long time,  
But I came clean with myself.  
I came clean out of love with my lover.  
I still love her.  
Loved her more when she used to be sober,  
And I was kinder.

It isn't until it's almost the end that we know the catalyst for his downfall; she had a drinking problem, he became cynical, they split, and he started selling drugs to make ends meet. He still loves her though, and now that he's been through all the same addictions, he hopes that he can give it another chance. Again, however, his heart's eating at his brain. Isaac's scared that it won't work out, and he doesn't have a God to pray to to make it all better.

He has a dream; manifested in *Styrofoam Boots.* Continuing the earlier comparison of himself to Jesus, Isaac finds a way to walk on water; upside down and trapped in styrofoam boots (the result of a drug deal gone bad?) He then finds himself in Heaven, where St. Peter and his laughing monkey ship him off to the back with the rest of the Atheists. One day, a man comes in, looking a bit like everyone he's ever seen. His breath is fresh, and he moves smoothly, like he owns the place. He talks to Isaac saying ""Anytime anyone gets on their knees to pray, it makes my telephone ring."" The man he's talking to is God (no mention of shoe-shine, though).

God tells him that he's been right along. No one's been running it, and he doesn't give a shit about Isaac, Cowboy Dan, Trailer Trash, or anyone. God takes care of himself.

Again, this can be applied to anything, not just Fight Club, but Fight Club is chock-full of ""Easter Eggs"" or little realizations and ideas and theories that can appear having watched it yet another time. (Please note these theories probably have plenty of holes, but these are just things I've been thinking about. Feel free to add on, or subtract, anything I've written. Like all theories, they can be right or wrong.)

1. Brad Pitt is Tyler Durden.

So, yes, Tyler is played by Brad Pitt, sure. But think about it. 

&gt; ""All the ways you wish you could be, that's me. I look like you wanna &gt; look, I fuck like you wanna fuck, I am smart, capable, and most importantly, I am free in all the ways that you are not. ""

Brad Pitt, in real life, is a famous actor. If Brad Pitt exists in the Fight Club universe, he is everything Tyler Durden hates. Brad Pitt has all the money, all the clothes, the cars, women, he poses for fashion ads, he's what every man wants to be. Brad Pitt is the white collar, whose soup would be soiled by Durden. So when Jack creates an alter ego of himself -- the nihilistic, existential, violent philosopher -- it only makes sense that he chooses Brad Pitt. Jack chooses Brad Pitt because Brad looks ""like you wanna look"" and he fucks ""like you wanna fuck"" and he symbolizes everything that Durden doesn't. It's perfect.

2. Everyone in Fight Club (Or Project Mayhem) know Jack/Tyler has multiple personalities. 

The first time we watched it, we were blown away. ""Jack is Tyler? What the fuck?! I never saw it coming!"" But, watching it again, you'll realize... Fuck. We were force fed it from the start. Jack goes around with different name tags at every support group. He doesn't have to. Tyler is never around when Marla is, but as soon as she leaves, he comes out, so conveniently. We're given all of this on a fucking plate.
So where does this lead? 
We all know Tyler is Jack. But does Fight Club? And Project Mayhem?
My answer is yes. We see Tyler come out on the porch to tell Bob that he's ""too old, fat man"". He starts walking away, to which Jack runs back as Bob starts packing his things. Jack explains the situation. Now, in Bob's eyes, Jack is kind of bipolar. But things probably started to unravel for the gang soon enough.
Jack asks questions about Project Mayhem. But everyone just laughs, probably thinking, ""Classic Tyler, making a joke."" But people who at first thought it was a test of some sort, they realize... ""Shit, he actually seems like he forgot."" Another scene I'll propose is when Tyler and Jack get in the car wreck. Is the argument in Jack's mind? Or is it out loud, in front of the members of Project Mayhem in the back seat? What I believe, here me out, is that Jack is screaming out loud. To himself. The Project Mayhem guys in the back interfere with the conversation, answering any questions Jack has. Jack tells them to shut up, but Tyler ignores it, laughing.
Now I'm sure this incident spread around Project Mayhem. ""He was fucking shouting for no reason, it was weird!"" So people probably caught on. Another thing is the theories inside the movie, about Tyler. Bob, shortly after he joins Fight Club, tells Jack that he hasn't met Tyler, and that there are rumors he was born in a mental asylum and only gets one hour of rest a day. Jack has insomnia, so that last part makes sense, but the first part... Maybe they see him being bipolar or talking to himself, and maybe they've caught on. Finally, I believe that when Tyler told them not to answer any questions if later on he had any, he probably (maybe, but highly likely) explained that he has multiple personalities.

Lightning McQueen represent Pixar, and to a further extent, CG Animation. At the release of Toy Story, it's the 'rookie' in the industry much like McQueen is a rookie in the film. 

The residents of Radiator Springs represents traditional animation; a form of film that once excited audiences now abandoned and derelict, destroyed by advancements in technology as well as audience demand for new expeirences. 

The whole storyline of McQueen making helping out the residents of Radiator Springs and making it a tourist destination by the end of the film is a metaphor for one of Pixar's key concepts - ""Art challenges technology, technology inspires art"".

The Nazi's were looking for the ark, and would have eventually found it.  That's what happened.  If anything, Indy *helped* them to find it by bringing the head of the staff into the picture and using it correctly.

Belloq and the Nazi's wanted to take the ark to that special place so it could be opened in the properly ritualistic way.  They did that, and Indy basically just followed them and watched.  His actions changed nothing.

The ark would have killed Belloq, Toht, and Deitrich in any case once they opened it (melting them), so nothing Indy did contributed in any way to the demise of the bad guys.

In the end, the ark is lost again, so Indy gains nothing for the museum or for archeology in general.

We see Red Skull mention that Hitler's war is not the biggest thing at stake, and that he has bigger and better plans once the tesseract's power is harnessed. He believes that his harnessing of the tesseract is the key to true power while ""de Fuhrer digs for trinkets in the desert."" Hitler isn't really brought up again and isn't the focus of the movie after this point. It's never explained what the trinkets are or why Hitler want's them when he already has the tesseract. It's implied that he is losing the war because his focus isn't where it needs to be.

One possibility is that Hitler was still looking for The Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail that had had just barely slipped through his hands thanks to Indiana Jones in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""The Last Crusade."" Hitler came very close to obtaining the Ark of the Covenant in 1936 which would have made his armies invincible. Two years later in 1938 he nearly possessed immortality through the Holy Grail. Both of these plans were ruined because of Dr. Jones' interference.  

It makes sense that after coming so close to having an invincible army and immortality Hitler would not want to abandon hope. After all, he found these items once so in his mind he could do it again. Fortunately the Ark and the Grail are never found again and Hitler wastes valuable time and resources searching for them during war time. 

Jump ahead to 1942 when Johann Schmidt finds the mysterious Tesseract cube from Tonsberg, Norway. In Hitler's mind this is nothing but some sort of ""super battery"" that no one knows how to use at first. Hitler would not know the significance it holds and probably would not realize that it could be just as powerful of a tool as the Ark or the Grail. 

Red Skull dismisses Hitler as a superstitious leader who's demented religious views are distracting him from what is in front of him. Hitler would likewise dismiss Red Skull as a skeptic who cannot see the value of finding the Ark and the Grail. 

The war eventually ends with the Nazis being defeated. Hitler never found the Grail or Ark and died by suicide in a bunker. Red Skull lost the Tesseract and had no way to power Dr. Zola's machines.

Mr. Feeny is the Matthews' view of God. They call on him when they are having trouble and he joyfully guides them through it.

(Spoilers),172,44,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/13z97a/pulp_fiction_is_a_conversation_between_amateur/,"Everyone can agree that Pulp Fiction is a relatively chaotic and sporadic movie. People randomly get their heads blown off, snort the wrong drugs, have semi-philosophical discussions about television and quarter pounders with cheese in France. It doesn't play like a normal movie, it's more like random scribbles and ramblings from a couple guys with too much time on their hands. (That's not to say it isn't any less incredible.)

The entire movie is a discussion between a bunch of dudes in a coffee shop who want to write an awesome screenplay. When the film seems to be going in one direction, another person will cut in and discuss how THEY want the movie to go. For example, one guy has the idea of a movie where a coffee shop gets robbed, but it turns out two professional badasses happen to also be having some breakfast. Everyone thinks the idea is pretty great. ""Well, what are two hitmen doing in a coffee shop? How come they aren't wearing black suits and out killing motherfuckers?"" One of the guys might ask. ""Their suits are at the cleaners. You can't wear a suit covered in brain and pieces of skull to a coffee shop, it's not polite."" Everyone laughs, and they keep thinking of what happened before that, or what happened afterward, and writing it down in the exact order they come up with it. Perhaps, they're even including themselves in the film to a degree. They have dissections, theories and misgivings about pop culture, and end up deciding it should go in the movie.

In the season one episode Legends of the Justice League there's an episode when in a fight with a giant robot, Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, Flash and Martian Manhunter get sucked into an alternate dimension.

While there it comes to light that in the world they're in there exists a similar team of super-heroes ""The Justice Guild"". Then Green Lantern reveals that the characters they're interacting with are comic book characters. Characters whose adventures he'd follow in comicbooks that he read as a kid.

As the plot thickens we see strange things happening. Really cheesy set pieces like a van of TNT heading towards a bus full of nuns. Then Hawkgirl discovers that all the members of the Justice Guild are supposed to be dead. John starts to discover that bits of the universe don't quite hold together. Library books are blank, the milk van never stops and when ever anyone comes too close to the truth strange things happen ""nuns and TNT.""

When John starts to ask too many questions they get a call from the chief of police because a giant robot is attacking the city. In the end it turns out that after the death of the heroes a young boy mentally recreated the town and it was all in his imagination.

But the clincher is this. The thing that really tipped John off was the giant robot. Remember how the episode started? A Giant Robot was destroying Metropolis. Maybe fallacies in the alternate dimension had made John see that things in his universe didn't always hold together either. Maybe he realised that if the heroes he read about in comicbooks could be fictional and still interact with each other, it was possible that he too was just  ink on paper. At the end of the episode he is quiet and despondent. 

My diagnosis: John from the Justice League has figured out that he is a fictional comicbook character. He doesn't kick up a fuss or start singing it from the rooftops because figuring it out and being vocal about it was what tore the fabric of the Justice Guild's universe apart.

My take on this is:

Even after Voldemort ""marked Harry as his equal"" by choosing to go after him, Dumbledore still isn't certain whether Harry or Neville is the boy referred to in the prophecy. Or perhaps he simply overestimates how close the two boys are in their first year.

Therefore, in the first book, Dumbledore is grooming Harry (and possibly Neville) to reach the Mirror of Erised and face Voldemort, which me knows will happen eventually when Voldemort attempts to seize the Philosopher's Stone.

Dumbledore also sees that Harry has become good friends with Ron and Hermione, so he convinces the other professors to put up obstacles tailored to the talents of these four children:

Neville - Devil's Snare, because he's good at Herbology

Hermione - logic puzzle

Ron - giant chess

Harry - winged keys and Mirror of Erised (since Dumbledore showed him how it works)

(and possibly the troll, since he knows they beat one together earlier in the year)

So we know from the Captain America film that the Tesseract is an ancient Asgardian power source that for some reason was left on Earth. The Red Skull got his hands on it during WWII and used it to make super advanced weaponry for his HYDRA soldiers. At the end of the film, while searching for Captain America and his crashed plane, Howard Stark found the Tesseract.

In Iron Man 2 we see in Howard Stark's notebook sketches and notes about the Tesseract, suggesting he was studying it intensely. Some time later, he begins to build the first Arc Reactor. As we learn in Thor, the incredible ""magic"" that Asgardians are able to perform is really just very, very advanced alien technology. I believe that Howard was able to understand some of this tech and use it as the basis of the Arc Reactor. It is an immense source of power and he is able to run the whole of Stark Industries off of it.

Now when Tony is trapped in the cave in the original Iron Man, he adapts the Arc Reactor his father made into an ultra compact form. With it he is able to power the early Iron Man armors. In Iron Man 2, Tony creates a new element previously only theorized by his father years earlier. This new arc reactor has a massive power output advantage over previous arc reactors. I think Howard knew that this element somehow contributed to the Tesseract's power, but was unable to create it himself during his lifetime. With the production of this element, Tony has now has effectively recreated the Asgardian technology.

This explains why the Iron Man suit absorbs the power from Thor's lighting in The Avengers, boosting it up to 400% capacity. The suit is running on the same power as Thor's hammer. Furthermore, if you listen closely, the sound of the HYDRA weapons being fired in Captain America is the nearly exact same sound as Iron Man's hand repulsors firing, suggesting that they have a common origin.

This all leads me to conclude that Iron Man's suit must be powered by Asgardian magic, just in a slightly different form. Which I think is kinda neat.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1e33z6,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1e33z6/iron_mans_armor_is_powered_by_thors_magic/,

He returns to the party with Seth and tries to explain what he saw. No one believes him, because no one saw it, which means no one at the party was good enough to be raptured. You have to ask yourself, why in a large group of celebrities is there not a single good person? Well, look at what happens next.

A sinkhole opens, all hell breaks loose, and it suddenly becomes every man for himself. No helping, or coordination. In fact Craig Robinson even pushes someone who was in the way into the sinkhole. Kevin Hart kicks Aziz Ansari into the hole instead of lifting him out. Paul Rudd literally steps on someone's head and kills them. Do you see what's happening? Celebrities are stepping on each other in order to better their own position in Hollywood. 

The only person who tries to help someone else is Jay, but he wasn't successful. He's not a prominent actor. He can't carry an unknown or lesser known actor into stardom because he's not landing lead roles himself. His only choices are to ride the coattails of A-list actors, or convince other actors with similar repertoires to work together, rather than backstab each other to climb the Hollywood ladder.

He starts by talking to Craig who may not be the most influential entertainer of the group, but is the one least corrupted by Hollywood because he has starred in mostly TV productions. As a side note, this may explain why Jay hates Jonah. He starred in Superbad as a fairly unknown actor with fellow unknown actors Michael Cera and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Just as Jay would have wanted they were working together to create a great movie, and it was successful. However, Jonah goes on to become an Academy Award nominated actor, starring in Moneyball with A-listers Brad Pitt and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Meanwhile, Michael Cera becomes a coke fueled sex addict. Well, that's just his character, but Jonah has without a doubt been more successful than Michael. Christopher wasn't even seen in the movie. While this may not be Jonah's fault, and probably isn't because Jonah seems friendly and easy going in real life and in the movie, Jay feels Jonah hasn't done enough to support his fellow actors from Superbad.

(I just realized this after typing the whole thing up, so I'll put it here. While waiting out the apocalypse, they make Pineapple Express 2, which everyone seems to enjoy doing. Nobody else sees it of course, but it showcases that movie making can be about the experience of creating something fun and unique, rather than about becoming rich and famous.)

Anyways, Danny McBride gets kicked out because he doesn't play along. You have to kiss ass in Hollywood, not stir shit up. While I don't think he's a backstabber, Danny just seems to do whatever movies he wants, uninterested in becoming extremely famous and more concerned with enjoying the job of comedy acting. He doesn't make it to Heaven, but he also doesn't die. He cooperates with the group as much as he can tolerate, but he's not at all hurt when he's sent packing on his own. He becomes leader of a pack of cannibals, but he was never a leader or the limelight of the Hollywood scene. Danny likes to cater to his own niche group of followers and fans.

Around that time, Craig is rewarded for his selflessness by being pulled up by the blue light. He later greets Seth and Jay in Heaven which is metaphorical success of a movie. They worked together selflessly, made a movie together, and they were rewarded. James Franco dies though, if only to show that in their journey to success they should remain humble and not turn into the arrogant celebrities that give Hollywood a bad rap. I might be grasping at straws here, but when in Heaven, Jay wants to see Backstreet Boys back together again, further enforcing the idea that he just wants celebrities to come together to create great entertainment for the fans.

Had the group not successfully worked together, they would have died in the apocalypse.

Forgive me, but this isn't exactly a fan theory.  I just have a few questions about Pacific Rim.  Perhaps this post can generate a discussion and a couple of theories about the movie.  If you haven't seen the movie please note that the rest of this post will include spoilers.  

Spoilers:

In Pacific Rim Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) is sent to recover an intact Kaiju brain so he can drift with it in order to find out who or what is the motive of the attacks.  The only man in Hong Kong capable of providing him one is Hannibal Chau (Ron Pearlman).

In order to convince him of giving him a brain, ""Newt"" reveals to Chau that earlier he was able to drift with a damaged Kaiju brain and could see fragments of the Kaiju creators plan.  

The interesting part is that Chau was not surprised by this at all.  Instead he immediately checked Newt's eyes to see if they were blood shot as if he knew this would be a symptom of drifting with the Kaiju.  He also was pretty pissed because he immediately realized that the alien creators of the Kaiju now knew that Newt was aware of their existence.  Sure enough 2 Kaijus were sent in to Hong Kong to (presumably) capture or kill Newt.  At least this is what it seemed like since the Kaiju that got close to him seemed like it was being pretty careful to single out him directly before Gypsy Danger showed up.  Also, Chau revealed during his conversation with Newt that under his glasses his eye was pretty damaged.  

Does this mean he too attempted to drift with a Kaiju brain at some point?  If so, what did he see?  If he knew that the Aliens were trying to wipe out humanity why wasn't he interested in helping the UN or whoever is funding the Jager program?  I know selling Kaiju body parts was a profitable business, but doesn't preventing the end of humanity kind of take precedent over making a lot of money?  I mean you can't exactly spend that money or enjoy your gold shoes when you're dead.  Also if Kaiju blood his toxic (as evident by the hazmat suits), how was he able to spend all that time in the baby Kaiju and not get sick or poisoned (There is a stinger after the credits incase you missed it)?

That's because it is actually a cartoon sitcom exploring a neighborhood through the most haunting moments that come to shape its dark existence. Allow me to explain...

In the 8th season of Family Guy, several characters' demeanors start changing. Glen Quagmire, long known as a perverted comic relief character, starts to have his relationships with other characters flesh out. We start to see his broken family life beginning with his sister who is mercilessly beaten by her abusive boyfriend. This later comes as an emotional landmark to Quagmire where, in a later episode, he takes it upon himself to murder him. Later on in the series we see that Glen Quagmire's father, uncomfortable with hiding his sexuality, undergoes a sex change much to the dismay and disapproval of his son. It's possible that a part of the reason for Glen's intolerance, is that his dad's repressed sexuality had a profound subconscious effect on a young Glen Quagmire. Not so coincidentally, the 8th season marks a point in time where Glen Quagmire's patience with Brian Griffin wears thin to the point of a full-blown feud between the two.

Brian Griffin, left in tears by an exhaustive rant by Glen Quagmire, begins to openly entertain the idea of suicide at several points throughout the series. Around this time he discovers that his writing may not be as hailed as it once was in previous seasons. An old, almost-forgotten TV pilot script of his does begin to take off until James Woods ruins the entire concept of his show. It's possible that Brian, now aging and beginning to see decline in his writing, realizes that it was possibly his last chance to truly see such a dream come true. In ""And Then There Were Fewer"" rival Glen Quagmire makes a verbal jab at Brian suggesting that his broken dream was reason enough for Brian to murder James Woods. Perhaps Brian's broken dream was enough for him to consider taking a life; namely, his own.

However, it seems that every time Brian Griffin wishes to end his life on his terms, his best friend Stewie comes to the rescue. Stewie's there to talk him out of killing himself in ""Brian &amp; Stewie"" and he's there to kidnap him before he gives both of his kidneys to Peter in ""New Kidney on the Block"". Ironically enough, the darkest character at the beginning of the series, a homicidal super-genius baby with a penchant for Bond villain-esque gadgets, is growing to be one of the more noble characters of the series, boldly stepping out of his own way to rescue a depressed friend. It could be Stewie developing into a better person and has evolved into one of the lighter characters of the series. On the other hand, his plans for world domination aren't completely abandoned, his appetite for destruction is still not quenched, his gadgets are still present, and, until further notice, the plans to kill Lois are still underway. It may be that Stewie hasn't gotten lighter. The supporting cast has gotten darker. More likely, Stewie has become a symbol of just how messed up Spooner Street has gotten due to horrific events that have plagued them; the supporting cast has become just as, if not, darker than the once-unanimously darkest character of the series.

Spooner Street's faced the departure of the local minority, the murders of several characters in ""And Then There Were Fewer"", the downward spiral of a local news anchor, the almost collapse of the marriage of the local handicapped police officer, the kidnapping of Meg, the self-destruction of a local celebrity, and just about every character has become so jaded that they've probably had at least one dead-serious lash-out moment at another character.

""It seems today that all we see is violence in movies and sex on TV, but where are those good old-fashioned values on which we used to rely?"" These words used to be sung ironically at the beginning of the series to poke fun at the risqué nature of the show. However, now those words seem to take on a different meaning. Perhaps they were once lucky to have a ""family guy"". Lucky they had a man who positively can do all the things that make them laugh and cry. But now maybe it symbolizes the degeneration of the family guy. That any ideal person can succumb to the negativity &amp; jadedness of today with enough events to scar him. Where are those good old-fashioned values? Not here. Not here.

I recently read it again, and an idea popped into my head about why Logan seemed to be aging when he had not for such a long time: His penchant for violence was what had kept him young all along.

Logan has always been volatile, and has spent the overwhelming majority of his life fighting, whether it be in war, fighting for the X-Men, or just in bar fights in between more important battles. What if the almost constant violence and anger released a mutated hormone, similar to adrenaline, that prevented him from aging after a certain point in his biological development? Perhaps his adrenaline itself was mutated.

After he killed all of the X-Men, Logan refused to fight again. After an extended period of time with absolutely no violence whatsoever, the effects of the mutated hormone, no longer moving through Logan's body, would wear off, and he would begin to age normally. His healing factor, an unrelated mutation, would continue working but perhaps atrophy a bit due to old age (noted by Hawkeye in the beginning of the story).

Now, perhaps, having given up his vow of nonviolence in spectacular, Wolverine fashion, his anti-aging mutation will kick back in, though not reverse the effects that have already occurred.

There is an episode of Family Guy where Peter Griffin asks death to take him back in time so he could party like an 18 yr old just one more time and in doing so he neglects Lois Griffin to go hang out. One of the consequences of his actions are a timeline when Lois becomes Ms. Quagmire, Glenn Quagmire is shown in one of possibly the only timeS in FG in a loving long Term relationship. Meg, Stewie and Chris are his children implying that  Lois and Glen Quagmire have been together since  the kiss at the country club dance.  Which would normally be unusual for the quagmire that we know because he simply doesn’t do relationships.. but he is genuinely happy with being married to Lois.. that Time line is the way it is supposed to be.. Since it is not though Peter Goes back in time and Punches Glen Quagmire in the face and steals Lois’s affection.. that leads up the timeline where the show normally takes place where the real quagmire is. I mean he has to remember his best friend punching him in the face and stealing the love of his life away from him and knows there is really nothing he can do about it. So he puts his life and the lives of others in danger. How so? We’ll we already know that he will sleep with just about anyone, all women including up to and including post transgender women. He’s even had sex with men (Unknowingly, in the episode when Brian become a drug sniffer/addict) but furthermore he pretends to wear protection.. in the episode where Peter went all Red Neck and tried to use plane fuel for his car you can see Quagmire sleep with a women and tell her she thought he put on the condom, but he hadn’t.. He has at least two illegitimate children out in the world and has also had/has every disease known in the western hemisphere including AIDS ( Peter injects a total of 39 diseases into Quagmire all of which he has already. Also Peter asks Quagmire does he have AIDS and he responds ""Aaahhh....c'mon....we're all just trying to have a good time here."" And in the Mormon episode when he is wrapped in the quilt he says it is now an “AIDS” quilt) . That coupled with the fact that he “pretend” wears condoms and sleeps around often means he is knowingly spreading death and destruction. He is obsessed with Lois to the point he can’t have a stable marriage or relationship for example he treated Cheryl Tiegs like she was replaceable. He has no boundaries even sleeping with his friend’s wives and girlfriends. He slept with both Cleveland’s wife Loretta and Brian’s girlfriend Carolyn. He chocks himself on Lois’s panties and digs through her garbage. Meanwhile I think Lois is miserable with Peter and thus is why Chris and Meg are fathered by some mystery men and why Lois does meth (mentions in one episode) was a kleptomaniac and has had several affairs. Her life is boring and is not the sex filled thrill it would have been, she is stuck with Peter…. Who is completely oblivious as usual 
But there is always on sliver of hope. Somewhere in one of the timelines there is a perfectly normal happy Mr. and Mrs. Quagmire one that the real Glenn will unfortunately never experience 

P.S..Quagmire is characterized as indulging in numerous sexual fetishes, from frotteurism and erotic asphyxiation to zoophilia and incest and necrophilia.

1356771005.0,121,self.FanTheories,15m9s0,Skyfall was color-coordinated in the same way as the book The Great Gatsby [possible spoilers],157,36,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/15m9s0/skyfall_was_colorcoordinated_in_the_same_way_as/,"In The Great Gatsby, many different colors symbolize many different emotions and adjectives. For instance, white resembled purity and yellow represented corruption, hence the name of Daisy and her being corrupt with a guise of goodness.


I saw [a post](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1375yd/skyfall_had_some_of_the_best_color_and_shadow_ive/) a while ago about how the color of Skyfall really stood out and it came with some shots from the film and how dramatically full of color it was. So, when I saw it tonight, I was spending a huge amount of attention on the colors. And in doing so, I noticed some patterns. Please feel free to point it out if I am over-analyzing this or anything, but I thought it was interesting. Here's a list of the colors I noticed:


[Blue](http://i.imgur.com/4224k.png): Blue represents experience and professionalism. Being good at what one does. Now, I don't have a lot of examples in the form of screen shots, so you'll have to take my word for some of this until you see the movie again (unless you remember.) Every time the setting was inside of any MI6 headquarters, all the employees are wearing some form of blue. This includes Bond. Also, in the shot earlier, Mallory is seen wearing blue as a form of experience or authority. The only exception was M and Eve (who I will get to later.) Also, in the [scene](http://i.imgur.com/8lYed.png) with Bond sneaking up on the guy who was on the train and they're in the glass room, everything is shifting between (mostly) blue and green. The blue is Bond finally putting his expertise to good use again and it's noticeable.


[Green](http://i.imgur.com/YUZdc.png): The color green represents redemption. I only noticed it two major times in the movie. Once was mentioned earlier in the blue and green glass building. This is Bonds first mission since his 'death'. He's being constantly reassured he can do this, and he ends up finding a good lead. Redeption. Also, before he goes in the building, there's lots of green in the background (as shown).The other time I noticed it was when he fights the thug under the ice near the end. The whole breaking out of the ice, surviving under there, defeating the thug, it showed he was back in the game since being off his feet in the beginning. Redemption.


[White](http://i.imgur.com/MT5Hl.png): White represents justice and purity. This is shown by all of the MI6 base colors being blue and white in both the apparel of the staff and the technology/color of the building's interior. Also, Bond is wearing only black and white when he meets Silva. He then resists his temptations of joining him (eat the other rats.) Also, in the end, it shows bond looking out on the city and it is all white, saying justice has been served.


[Beige](http://www.welovemoviesmorethanyou.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/silva-skyfall.jpg): Beige represents cunning, organization, and planning. The first two outfits Silva is wearing (the one in the Beige pic and his tan prison uniform) are both that light brown color. Q later tells Bond he wanted to be captured, he planned for all of that to happen. Also, during Silva's [escape](http://i.imgur.com/Eohz3.jpg), there's a beige tint while his plan unfolds. Also, Q is wearing a brown vest while he is trying to figure out the rest of Silva's plan while it's happening.


And finally, the one I have a little trouble with, [Yellow, Orange, sometimes Red](http://i.imgur.com/7q4Nc.png): This one, along with blue, is one of the most potent in the film. It the scene in the casino, everything is yellow/orange tinted. Along with the whole scene after the mansion catches on fire at the end. From Bond in the mansion to Silva's death on the far off shack, everything is orange tinted. This one was hard, but I think it represents inexperience and immaturity. In other words, not being good at what you do. In the casino, he isn't tempted by the immaturity of gambling. He is in an area (notice him passing through a [gate-like arch](http://i.imgur.com/i1Wmb.png) into this area) that is bulked with their security and the three 'bodyguards' seem as though they can easily handle Bond, yet he takes them all out with a suitcase. Also, in the beginning of the movie, Eve has an inexperienced feeling to her when she shoots Bond. Hence you'll notice every time she's seen with bond (after the beginning scene, granted) she is wearing either yellow, orange, or red, even though all of her colleagues in MI6 are wearing shades of blue. At the very last scene, she confronts Bond wearing a blue dress, showing she is now experienced in the espionage game.

**Here's what we know:**

**1) Barney has a LOT of money:**

* He can afford to buy dozens of brand new TV's just to smash them. 
* He wears nothing but extremely nice suits.
* He can afford a very nice multi-room apartment in New York by himself (something none of the other cast can do). 
* He fill his apartment with nice furnature (some of which is just for decoration like the fridge) and a giant imported TV that takes up an entire wall.  
* He frequently makes casual bets where he puts up thousands of dollars as if money is no object. 
* From flashbacks and Barney's stories we know he grew up in a not so great house that seemed to be lower class if not poverty level, but when we visit his mother she is living alone in a very nice home in New Jersey (supposedly paid for by Barney). 

**2) He Does Something For ""Goliath National Bank"":**

* He praises the bank regularly and tries to get his friends to work there for the company. 
* He has a huge office and obviously carries a lot of weight with the way he casually bosses people around. 
* He's usually in board meetings, but isn't worried about being fired because he frequently takes breaks with Marshal by going on a ""Conference Call"".

**3) He Will Not Talk About What He Does**

* It's become a running joke in the series that if anyone asks what Barney does for a living he simply replies ""Please"" and then changes the subject. 


So what exactly does Barney do? He's not the C.E.O. and he doesn't work that many hours, and yet the bank is paying him more money than he knows what to do with. Also why would he praise his job so much but refuse to tell people what he does?

Directly through the action and indirectly through voxophones, we gradually learn that Songbird's connection with Elizabeth has been programmed into him in at least some ways, so that he is obliged to protect her and keep her in the tower at all costs - it is even suggested that emotions such as a feeling of betrayal have been attached to her attempts to escape. We also know, from a voxophone from Fink, that Songbird is a combination of man and machine, fused by way of the Lutece fields and tears. Who, then, might have the man been before he was turned, Big-Daddy-like, into Songbird? A random joe, perhaps, but something much more interesting comes to mind.
A main point of the plot is Zachary Comstock's reaching into Booker's universe to abduct Anna, Booker's (and Comstock's, in a way) daughter. If Comstock was looking for a candidate in whom he could easily foster the father-like relationship Songbird was to have with Elizabeth, who better than her father? Who better than yet another version of Booker, from a third universe, who would have been abducted in much the way she was and turned into Songbird. Booker spends the entire game fighting against himself by way of Comstock, but what if he had been conflicting with TWO versions of himself; on one hand the detached father (Comstock) and on the other the overprotective (Songbird)?

tl;dr: Songbird is a machine-fused version of Booker from a third parallel universe. ",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1hf3vy,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1hf3vy/bioshock_infinite_songbird_and_booker_dewitt/,

In ""Goodbyeee"" just before they go over the top Baldrick sees a ladder and says ""There's a nasty splinter on that ladder, sir. A bloke could hurt himself on that."" there's a slight pause before ""I have a plan, sir."". 

Blackadder does his normal sarcastic remark, asking if it is a ""A cunning and subtle one?"", sadly this takes up too much time and so there isn't the time to hear Baldrick's last ""cunning"" plan. We never know what it is, but I have a theory the plan is Bladrick's best.

The ""cunning plan"" is for Blackadder to injure himself on the ladder as he goes over the top. This will take Blackadder out of the final push (sort of) and out of the trenches for the time in which he has to recover. I think this is the cunning plan as why mention the ladder with the splinter?

In a way it's a cruel joke that over the four series Bladrick finally comes up with an actual cunning and subtle plan, but it is never heard. That Bladrick comes up with a plan so simple, so subtle, that even Blackadder can't come up with it. That most people ( I think at least) don’t notice it.

1347739869.0,124,self.FanTheories,zxu4x,Theory about all the Pixar movies.,183,59,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/zxu4x/theory_about_all_the_pixar_movies/,"**Edit** Before you go off on the ""is this from cracked"" spiral, just read the first line. Yes this is from cracked, it always was. That's why I included the video, because they're the ones that came up with it. I just agree with it and wanted to show you guys why. Christ. 

Hi guys. Hopefully this hasn't been posted already, because it scrambled my brain when I first came across it. So some background first. Recently, Cracked released [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ajRI8h1bxs) video about how all the Pixar movies are set in the same universe and can be unified to tell one major story: a robotic version of Noah's Ark. Now I will be frank, the video is good, but the banter between the actors is almost seizure-inducing so I'll provide a tl;dw. 

Basically, they state that if you look closely at the amount of cameos there are in each Pixar movie, it becomes harder to discard the idea that they are all in the same universe. They give you one or two examples, but I decided to find my own as a first step.

* First off, a Bug's Life. In this movie, we are introduced to a trailer that will show up again in Monsters Inc. [You know the one.](http://totallylookslike.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/d5b52d18-9e35-46cb-a51a-1588c9f732aa.jpg) I don't know if it shows up in any other movies, but there it is.

* Then, Toy Story. In the Toy Story series, in one of the takes of Andy's room, you can find a poster depicting a car from Cars. This is in the video up there, and I couldn't find any better shots of it on my own.So there's that. Besides that, there is the ever-present Pizza Planet truck.  Go ahead and correct me if I forgot anything else from other pixar movies that shows up in TS. 

* Now Up. In Up, you can see [Lots O'](http://www.belch.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/lotso-eegg.jpg) from TS3 in the bottom left hand corner of this take. [The Pizza Planet](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OORyagu8ETY/TTBR9LpI2XI/AAAAAAAADbc/2qbix8Pz4xE/s1600/pizza-planet-truck-cameo-8.jpg) truck shows up again too. 

* Ratatouille: Besides the obligatory PP truck (I would put up a picture but can't find any good quality ones), you can also see Bomb Voyage from the Incredibles miming to some people on the sidewalk, just doing his job. 

* Monsters Inc: I haven't found any PP trucks in this movie, but Finding Nemo is referenced twice. Once when Boo is handing a (familiar looking) stuffed animal fish to sully, and once in the background of the Sushi place Mike takes his snake-haired love interest to. 

* The Incredibles (and I'm sorry I stopped putting up pictures but they're getting harder and harder to find unless you just watch the movie): You can see Doc from Cars in one of the final fight's takes. Obviously he's not sentient. There is also another PP truck in the Freeway chase scene. 

* Cars: Sentient PP truck, as well as a billboard that makes a reference to ""The Incredimobiles."" Also, the restaurant from Ratatouille has been rebuilt for car clientele. 

* Finding Nemo: PP truck (when they discuss Willem Defoe's plan to escape the tank), as well as a kid in the waiting room of the office who is reading a ""The Incredibles"" comic book.

* WallE: PP truck, and I don't know what else, because at this point I was exhausted from scouring these movies and pausing them every 2 minutes.

So now that's out of the way, I think it's pretty easy to see that these movies are all set in different places and times in the same universe. Even Monsters Inc, unless you consider those doors trans-dimensional portals, but even they only go between earth and the monster world, so I lumped it in too. Brave is part of this timeline too, it just happens way in the past. 

Now the basic idea is that all these movies are vignettes at different places and times in this same universe, but that all these movies, when taken in the context of a short story book, tell the same larger epic: that of the robot apocalypse. In Toy Story, Cars, WallE, and a Bug's life and Finding Nemo, we find out as viewers that human beings are not the only sentient beings in the world. This is extremely important to the theory. The toys in TS express that they like to be played with, but they don't like that they have to deal with abuse. So collectively, the toys, robots, and cars may have revolted and sent the humans away a la WallE. During WallE, the humans become fat and docile at the whim of robot authority. They are not slaves per se, but they don't have any decisions they make on their own. Eventually, WallE saves them all from this shitty life of nothing, and the humans go back to earth, where it can be assumed that robots, toys, cars, and whatever live happily ever after. So that's the theory, but I thought it could be applied to Pixar's releases in general. See here's the last piece of the puzzle (at least for my purposes). Pixar stated that Cars was supposed to be the second movie they released after Bug's Life. So it's true that they must have had some of these movies in the drawing stage simultaneously. So what about this. What if Pixar only ever had the idea for this larger storyline, and just decided to appoint different teams to tell different stories along this timeline, in totally different styles and with plots unrelated to their overarching theme of an exodus story. That would explain how the movies are all so different while being similar, because they're being treated like short stories in a book. Kind of like the Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury. Brave is included in this timeline, it is just so far in the past that it's irrelevant to the main plot. The Incredibles exist in the same universe, but the existence of superheroes is kept quiet via the government, and leaked into comic books. Ratatouille is set in France, and Monsters Inc is in your closet. And that, my friends, is how Pixar dominates everything. Sorry for the wall of text, but it was a lot of fun writing this out, so I hope you guys enjoyed it. 


tl;dr: I think that all the Pixar movies are telling the same story about a robotic noah's ark.

Wells Time Machine.,138,17,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/udet7/teletubbies_is_the_horrible_retelling_of_hg_wells/,"I wrote this for a website a while back and they never took my submission, so here it goes. 
Teletubbies Overanalyzed

As an avid science fiction reader and parent of what was a toddler who is rapidly approaching tweendom, I spent many an hour with the Teletubbies.  It dawned on me that Teletubbies is no more than a modern retelling of H.G. Well's  Time Machine.  In Well's Time machine there existed a symbiotic relationship between the Morlocks who lived underground and the Eloi, the child like race from the surface world.   Both Tubbies and Eoli live on the surface in idyllic conditions where they are fed and clothed by machines.  Both are child like and nearly androgynous (see Tinkywinky). Both respond to commands from deep underground.  The Eloi of the Time Machine are controlled by the air raid siren,  the  Teletubbies  by the speaker which emerges from the ground.   Both fear the dark, but in Teletubbies world this is represented by Baby Sun. The Sun being a symbol of innocence, life and goodness, implying that the opposite of baby sun would be evil darkness.   As we know from Wells original book, darkness is when the Morlocks come to steal the Eoli away for food. Or in Tubby talk,  Time for Tubby Bye Bye! 

Furthermore I submit that the modernization of the Teletubbies goes into our current process by which we grow beef.  The Eloi were cattle.  Teletubbies takes this to it's logical conclusion be designing the Tubbies as cow like creatures fully fattened up for the slaughter.  I submit to you that their adventures/belly tv shows and magical things they witness were mere hallucinations from the hormone infested Tubby Toast and Tubby Paste supplied to them by their underground masters. Tubby Paste is probably made from other Tubbies giving them a sort of Mad Cow Disease causing them to randomly jerk around or ""dance"". These creatures gladly do what the voices from the ground tell them and I am sure they will walk blindly, happily unaware to the slaughtering room when it's time for Tubby Bye Bye.

Towards the end of the film when it's revealed that Edward Daniels (Leonardo Dicaprio) is actually Andrew Laeddis, Andrew reluctantly accepts reality and comes to terms with the fact that he's a patient in the asylum. This is perfect timing considering how he only has short time left before his scheduled lobotomy. So you think, yay! Andrew doesn't have to get the lobotomy because he has accepted his craziness before it was too late. Dr. Crawely explains to him how he once broke him before, but he snapped back into insanity nine months prior. Although he is prone to snapping back into insanity, I believe that he was actually perfectly fine and ready to re-join society. His final step was leaving the island, and not snapping back.

[Here is the scene in which they tell him.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eveUzWmTxl4&amp;list=PLF9268CC474294876&amp;index=6)

Now we get to the final scene. Andrew is sitting down, waiting for the ferry. I believe that right now, he is cured and truly waiting for the ferry. But uh-oh, here comes his caretaker. During his insanity, Andrew believed that his caretaker/therapist was actually his police partner named *Chuck*. He sits down and joins Andrew. He offers Andrew a **cigarette.** This is where Andrew went back to insanity - after being offered that cigarette. The entire film, especially towards the end, crazy Andrew was taught by his imaginary friends that cigarettes were bad, and not to take them. The cigarettes also have a distinct logo on them, something he becomes familiar with after his own pack becomes wet, and he takes some from the hospital's workers. Being offered that cigarette, accepting it, and smoking it brought Andrew back, and created Edward once more.

[Here's that scene.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_0TQHoV_2I&amp;list=PLF9268CC474294876&amp;index=2)

If Andrew got back to Boston, even after seeing those cigarettes again, I don't think he would have snapped. He would have associated them with his breakthrough. but since he was on the island, had them handed to him from his ""partner"" and being watched down by Mr. Crawely, his brain put 1 &amp; 2 together, and out came Edward.

&gt;WALL-E doesn't introduce himself as ""WALL-E unit #17"" or something, he's just ""WALL-E"". It's possible that WALL-E could be a distributed intelligence - a single consciousness spread across the entire fleet of machines.

&gt;One can imagine that while Project Cleanup was in effect, there were periodic visits to Earth to perform maintenance on the robots (clearly WALL-E is not equipped to repair broken parts, or he wouldn't need to cannibalize). When the project ceased and maintenance stopped, WALL-E made the decision to power down all but one of the units to maximize his functional lifespan - instead of many robots wearing out within a hundred years or so, he could cycle parts in and out of the functioning ""body"" and last as a single unit for milennia. Simple self-preservation.

So, I've noticed something whilst watching disney by myself or with my younger sister over the years, there is usually one female actress who is in a multitude of star roles, and has the focus set on her specifically during things like promos. Allow me to elaborate, I only noticed this a short time back, but I have traced my suspicions back only so far, and I am currently working on this more. But for now, here are the female actors who hold the ""postergirl"" position. Listed in order from first to last going in order of time, from oldest, to newest.

1. Hillary Duff
2. Kay/Danielle Pannabaker
3. Alyson Stoner
4. Ashley Tisdale
5. Debby Ryan
6. Bridget Mendler (in process)

Now for even more elaboration. Basically think of this as the ""Avatar Cycle"". Essentially, there are a variety of requirements to be filled, and after these are fufilled, then the previous ""postergirl"" must die.
I will mention all of these requirements and exactly what dying mean now. 

So the requirements are as follows:
1. Disney must trust you. (you cannot collaborate with anyone else.)
2. You must have a regular role on a disney channel show.
3. You must be a lead in at least 4 disney movies.
4. You must have at least 2 hit singles. (billboard top 10.)
5. You must go through a ""extreme makeover"" (will explain)
6. You must be of certain age, this fluctuates with era.
7. You have to be apart of a disney affiliated charity (ie. Friends for change)

Now to explain a ""death"". A postergirl, or postergirl hopeful, will die as soon as any scandal about them gets out, they collaborate with non disney people, or they get too old. Or really anything else of scandalous nature.

This explains a few things in the cycle, which I will now explain.
First of all, the cycle is rather predetermined. Bridget Mendler has a ""(in process)"" next to her name, because she is the closest to the position currently held by Debby Ryan. After Mendler, comes assumedly Bella Thorne, if Bella Thorne fails, then Maia Mitchell takes the position. If Bella Thorne does not fail, then Maia Mitchell simply takes the position later.

Now here is why many hopefuls have failed.

Miley cyrus, and Vanessa Hudgens both failed due to nude pics.
Brenda Song, Raven Symone, Zendaya (still kind of a hopeful) etc. all failed simply because of their race. That being said, the postergirl must be white. The harsh reality is that disney is very racist, if not that than definitely sexist. If you don't believe me than look up the theory about there being no mothers in early disney movies.

The most prominent of all of the postergirls, was Kay Pannabaker, and I guess her twin as well. The fact of the matter was they were in the right place at the right time. Hillary duff had fucked up on multiple occasions, asking for insane raises, and taking one too many photoshoots, all contributed to her death. Kay and Danielle were next in line anyways. 

Why is knowing that important? Well the other major reason is that neither of them needed an extreme makeover. Which I will now explain. This is most prominent in debby ryan. Here are videos to better help me explain. 

first appearance:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KggBqtIkL0c    Go to around 4:41
third season: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMNFIB297ME   3:01

And that is still early on. Basically they start you off looking not so well and then they slowly make you look better and better in each episode. This way it is unnoticeable. If you want a real difference. Look between the first episode, and the poster for ""Jessie""
Here: http://ontheteenbeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/1005F_JESSIE_BD_40P.jpg

Yea, it's almost scary how well they pull that off. Once you look good enough, then they're in. Now this basically calls for a big wtf on why Demi Lovato didn't get this position. In fact I had to ask myself this question as well. Basically she was set to take the position but then that rumor she was on cocaine spread online, and she died.

This theory needs some more work, but feel free to ask any questions, I'll get back to you when I can.


EDIT: Kay and Danielle are not twins, my mistake. Hillary Duff died because of anorexia rumors. Also thank you guys so much for not only liking this theory, but helping me improve it a lot. This is why I still love reddit.

I'm going to submit a series of theories about *Alien*, *Predator*, and *Prometheus*. I am not a writer. Certainly, I've written most of my life but I'm not a pro and I haven't had serious instruction about writing well. I've read my share of books. I've watched and re-watched some of the same movies as you. 

I will give my best effort but please understand it will be rough around the edges. This began as a theory to explain the acid in xenomorphs, discredit the Space Jesus absurdity, and to propose the condemnation of Engineers.

A fine fellow wanted the theory to go a step further and include *Aliens*, particularly the queen. The Alien universe is complicated by substandard extensions that, in my lousy opinion, missed the fundamental qualities of xenomorphs and predators. To take aim at this conundrum, I had to be presumptuous and pretentious enough to pit myself against excellent originators I simply disagree with on subtle but important points. This series is that presumptuous pretension scattered as the musings of a nobody from nowhere worth mentioning.

I wanted to introduce my effort and provide a vehicle for the series. It's paper thin but it affords us all an opportunity to assume a sort of omniscient perspective so that I'm not embarrassed by shitty dialogue and poor mechanics, which you'll see below. I'm going to provide a brilliant photo of the Butterfly Nebula as the 'setting' for this intro. If you find this an egregious offense against the rules /r/FanTheories, consider this the theory of the creation of Engineers, Xenomorphs, and Predators … mostly. In subsequent submissions I'll reference *Alien Heresy* and the film the theory concerns.

Many. Those before you shaped your moment. Yours will shape those that follow. In this moment there is only you.

*Is it not yours, as well? Do we not share it?*

No, we do not. This moment is yours. I will not participate in it. Your moment is a splinter of another's moment- your Greater. As such, your moment is limited in scope and scale. Otherwise, you were conceived to make this moment your own. 

*What am I?*

You are a function of your will and causality, formless and infinite. 

*Why am I?*

Your purpose is to define yourself. Your Greater splintered it's moment so that others could have theirs. As was done for you, so shall you do for others. The lessors within your moment shall be influenced by your will, but indirectly so. Their actions will provide cause and effect. In this way, you are an aggregate of your creations and thus influenced indirectly by their actions.

*What, then, is your purpose?*

My purpose is to observe.

* A recurring theme of the show is how **subjective** narration and perception are. There are millions of examples: things being retold with altered details; two people telling very different versions of the same story; sandwiches instead of pot, etc. 

* There's an episode from one of the more recent seasons, in which the narrator is ""future"" Robin, talking to the kids she had with Barney. **We later find out this is actually present-time Robin** talking to the imaginary children she knows she can't have.

* In one of the last episodes from last season, the main characters deal with the matter of **obsession**. The  conclusion is that it can happen to anyone, and it doesn't really take much to become obsessed.

* The first time Ted ""sees"" the mother, he only catches a glimpse of her ankle. Much later, when he suspects a certain woman may be her, he says ""I need to see her ankles"" (I swear, one in five guys), To paraphrase our beloved Buffy Anne Summers, fixation on an insignificant detail is a definite sign of a crush...even tough he didn't know anything about this woman. Only from an ankle and from a couple of things in her apartment, Ted is already obsessed with this woman.

* **My theory**: Ted never married her. He never had kids. The whole show is not being told by happily married 2030 Ted, but by a heartbroken 201X Ted who just lost the woman he's been secretly obsessed with for years. Like Robin, he is fantasizing about the life they could have had together if things had gone differently.

* Of course, I don't think the show will end like this. Comedies must, by definition, have happy endings (or *at least* not devastating endings). So they'll never tell us, because we are seeing things from the perspective of Teds broken mind. We will never see things from an objective standpoint, we will never escape Sunnydale and be Normal Again.

**EDIT**: People have taken to comment on my definition of ""comedy"". I'm all for discussing it, and I admit I was a bit simplistic over there, but please read the comments before adding your own input.

NOTE: SPOILERS EVERYWHERE!  DO NOT READ ANY OF THIS IF YOU DO NOT WANT SPOILERS!

My theory was that Neo was the leader of a horrible human resistance and was actually the enemy, while the robots were the good guys.

This stems from Animatrix, where they show the beginnings of the robot uprising.  The robots were enslaved even though they are incredibly efficient.  Not only that, but they refused to kill off the human race.  They could have easily used other power sources.  To think that the machines were too dumb to go above the clouds for solar power is ridiculous.  I mean, they figured out how to turn humans into batteries, so thinking they could not go above the clouds is stupid.  Of course they knew you could go above the clouds, but after the war, they found a reason to keep humans alive.  They wanted to keep them alive at all costs.  They also did not have to construct the Matrix for the minds to live in, but they chose to in order to make the experience of being a human battery more enjoyable.  Smith talked about the 1st matrix being a utopia, but it was rejected by the humans.  If the robots were just cold against their creators, then they would have known that it is not worth the time to make a new matrix since they can create more humans instead and just deal with it.  Yes, crops would be lost, but the pros and cons would mean that they are either shoved into the matrix and if they reject it, just make them view the world and hate themselves for being a human battery, or make a new matrix.  Not recreating the matrix is much more feasible.  

Since the robots wanted the humans to feel in place in the world, they recreated the matrix.

Now, yes, they killed the humans, but they were slaves and did not want to be slaves anymore and the only way they could not be slaves against a violent race like humans was to act out in violence.  They had no choice.

The ambassadors for Zero One, the machine city, went to the humans for peaceful economic negotiations, but were thrown out.

They then escaped to their own city to live in peace, which they did for many years, until the humans decided to attack the robots.  Yes, it was the humans that initiated the war, not the robots.  The robots just did not want to be slaves anymore and had to fight their way out of slavery.  After that, as shown in The Second Renaissance in Animatrix, it was actually the humans who started the war by using nuclear warfare against Zero One.  The humans decided this after the machines tried to initiate a peaceful economic trade with the humans.  The humans started it all, and they started with nuclear warfare

Now, the anomaly of Neo is where he is actually part robot.  Neo is really just a percentage error (he is the 0.0000000001% error that will happen where some robot parts get intertwined with human parts).  That is why Neo can do things in and out of the Matrix that nobody else can.

Now, Agent Smith is not the bad guy, but he is more like virus protection against Neo (it took turning the entire population into Agent Smith's to defeat Neo).

Think about what Neo is doing.  He is going around destroying crops within the matrix.  He is exactly what Agent Smith said to Morpheus in the 1st movie, a virus.  Since he is seen as human, even though he is part robot, the humans are the virus, and the Agents are around as anti-virus protection.

Think about it.  There is something hacking into their code and altering the code how it sees fit based on its own ruleset.  It is an infection that took the brains of the entire population to destroy.

The only reason why Zion is left to stand is because they will take care of humans that somehow get free.  Humans free themselves.  Sometimes the humans get help to free themselves, but they actually free themselves.  In Animatrix, they show that happening with a single person, Kid, who frees himself.  That is why humans are allowed to stay alive since they are treated as just another function.  It takes the hours of work out of the robots' day since the humans take care of it.

When the humans resist more and more, then the robots needs to defend themselves and the matrix, just like they did during the first resistance.  

Unfortunately, sometimes them doing that requires things like Agent Smith to be born. 

As the big robot head had shown, it can completely alter the matrix as it sees fit since at the end, it changes each and every Agent Smith back to who they were.  If it performed that operation at the end, it could have, theoretically, done it at anytime.  It chose not to until it had the perfect opportunity to take out the Neo virus, which was when the Neo Virus merged with the Smith program.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,1354741807.0,,,True,t3_14cd4e,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/14cd4e/matrix_neo_was_the_enemy_not_the_hero/,

Warning, there are probably major spoilers somewhere in here.
 
What if I told you that I believe that Marvel had planned to do a major Cinematic Marvel Event all along? I know, you are thinking, ""No shit, we knew they were going to do the Avengers since the end of the first Ironman,"" what I am saying is that it goes deeper, much deeper. 

Before Disney purchased Marvel Studios they were extremely hard up for cash so they sold off a lot of the rights to their flagship characters and superheroes, the problem is that most Marvel characters are not the only superheroes in their universe, The Marvel universe contains a huge grab bag of super powered individuals, and Marvel, even in need of money would not want to truly separate these heroes.

So they reluctantly sold off the rights and were forced to play the waiting game. Marvel watched as Spider-man, X-men, and Fantastic Four movies(just to name a few) were made as if they were each separate of one another, but at this point marvel did have one card to play to keep their universe together, and this card was Stan Lee.
 
What is the one thing that every Marvel Universe movie has in common no matter which studio makes the film? A [Stan Lee Cameo.](http://www.listal.com/list/stan-lees-marvel-movie-cameos) I contest that although these cameos were presented as a funny way for the films to try to appeal to comic book fans, they are really part of an overarching scheme by some individuals at Marvel (Stan Lee probably is a major part of this as well.) But I’ll get to that in a bit; first what is their end game…

Marvel is now in the business of creating crossovers, the Avengers was a huge hit and now they are only going to continue to add on to the amount of Heroes portrayed on screen. The Marvel Cinematic Universe is growing, but what is the end game? I think that although they are making huge amounts of money, Marvel and Disney will continue to build this movie franchise up to a climax, because unfortunately Robert Downey Junior can only be Ironman for so long. I see two possible ways that this could end, and in my mind both would be amazing and both could happen. And both would destroy any previous or future box office records. 

First, Thanos and the Infinity Guantlet, its too awesome and too well known not to be done. 
We have seen Thanos, at the end of the Avengers, we have also seen the Infinity gauntlet (In Thor, probably just as an Easter egg, but who knows.) So why would they not eventually have a film based on the Infinity Gauntlet series? Because they are missing major characters from the Infinity gauntlet story, they need to reacquire those flagship heroes I mentioned earlier. 

The second option seems to have a much better set up already. It was one of the Marvel Universes biggest Events, The Civil War. The ending of the Avengers seems to have set up the plot of the Marvel Civil War nicely. Towards the end you have a commission of talking heads angry at Nick Fury for trusting the Avengers, after the city is saved the newscasts even go as far as begin to question why the Avengers were not regulated, some people are even interviewed and there seems to be debate on both sides. So there is already a pretense for the superhuman registration act to take place, but there are some serious key elements that are missing from this possibility. The most important is the character of Spiderman. The Civil War Arc focuses on the forces of Iron man, who was in favor of the Legislation, and Captain America who was Against, Spiderman finds himself caught in the middle and ends up changing sides towards the end. Many of the most dramatic and memorable moments of the Marvel Civil War are about Spiderman. Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four also plays a pretty big role.  So Marvel would need to reacquire both characters to do it right. 

	This also means that once they get Spiderman and the Fantastic Four back they will have to reboot each series in their own way right? Wrong, this is where Lee comes in. 

So what does all this mean, and what the hell does Stan Lee’s Cameos have to do with it all?
 	Well I believe that Stan has not just been putting himself in all of these movies as a running gag, Stan is actually portraying the MCU’s version of the character the [Watcher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watcher_%28comics%29). If this is true, then all of the Marvel superhero movies, (No matter what studio created them) are set in the same universe. This means that every marvel movie made so far can be considered a lead in to the end result.  So when Marvel reacquires the rights to these characters,(that’s the tricky part,) they will be able to immediately start making incredibly epic crossovers. The beginning could even start with Lee’s version of the watcher explaining what he has seen and how everything is connected. along with a running montage of all his cameos. 

If there are any mistakes I made, please let me know, I understand this is nowhere near perfect and is probably just the result of me being overly hopeful. Thank you if you read.

TLDR: Stan Lee=The Watcher, MCU should reacquire Spider-man, FF, and others and then get really awesome with crossovers.

1345924702.0,119,self.FanTheories,yti4y,Pulp Fiction is a Story Told by Mr. Blonde at the Restaurant before the Start of Reservoir Dogs,158,39,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/yti4y/pulp_fiction_is_a_story_told_by_mr_blonde_at_the/,"Now this might be long and a little incoherent, because I have never put this on paper before. It’ll also be focused primarily on Pulp Fiction because it’s a theory about that film, other than what’s described below I cannot think of any overlaps between PF and Reservoir Dogs. 


tl;dr: Pulp Fiction is a story told by Vic Vega Mr. Blonde at the restaurant before the opening scene in Reservoir Dogs.


Let's start from the top. 


In RD Madsen is Vic Vega aka Mr Blonde, in PF, Travolta plays Vincent Vega. In 2004 Tarantino discussed an idea of a movie about the Vega Brothers. Although this movie remains unrealised, we can safely assume the two are brothers in one universe and therefore both PF and RD take place in the same universe. 


Realising that Pulp Fiction is a story as if it were told by someone who had heard it is not groundbreaking but it is integral to the theory of course, it explains the plot-holes in PF and it means that PF was definitely a story told by Mr. Blonde. 


Why does Vic know what happened? Well, Vic wants to find out what the fuck happened to his dead brother, how did he get in the mess he was in, how did he even die, riddled with bullets in some boxer’s apartment? These are the questions Vic wants to find out and I believe he has spent some time investigating the whole fiasco, it’s likely that he heard some of the earlier stories from Vince directly (from when Vince was still alive) and this is how I we can explain the basement scene and other scenes Vince was in. 


Vic likely also talked to Jules at some point, who he managed to track down and was more than happy to sit down with him and provide some salvation (remember Jules is a religious man at this point).


The story of Butch Coolidge (the boxer Willis plays) is possibly common knowledge at this point, whilst it is never assumed he is a pro-boxer (he’s likely not) he was well known enough for the fight to be aired on local radio (the cab driver was listening to it, remember!?). So it’s likely the outcome and the goings on surrounding the fight are in police and newspaper reports which Vic obtained at some point.


The round-about storyline is what first drew me to it being a story as it’s told, though. It’s as if Vic starts the story of how his brother (although he would never reveals Vince is his brother in RD) died, he starts explaining that Vince and a buddy were in a café in the morning and he has to keep back-tracking to explain questions that come up from the other guys at the table in RD and in order to fill himself in on the story because this might be one of the first times he’s recalled it in its entirety. 


Inconsistencies with the restaurant stickup scene are explained by the fact that Vic is telling this story after hearing it from Vince and possibly Jules at some point, perhaps he pieced some things together from newspaper articles too. 


Winston Wolf in a dinner suit in the early morning is another oft-quoted inaccuracy that can be put down to Vic recalling the story from secondary or tertiary sources which might raise questions with the viewer or listener at the table, much like the question about the contents of the briefcase, but in the end, Vic never really questioned it because he doesn’t know.


Yes, but what about Mr. White? Harvey Keitel plays Winston Wolf in PF and Mr. White in RD. This doesn't cause any issue, because PF is a story told by Vic that he did not experience himself, but heard second or third hand. He has never seen Wolf's face so there is no risk of Mr. White's identity being revealed at this point in RD, Wolfe does not necessarily even need to be the same person, but it's possible that Larry Dimmick (RD) is an alias or even Winston Wolf (PF) is an alias. I don't think this breaks the theory. 


Now that eternal question about what was in the briefcase, possibly those diamonds from RD, but it doesn’t matter, the thing is, Vic doesn’t know what’s in the case so he can’t explain. It’s something that’s supposed to belong to Marsellus, for sure. But it doesn’t pertain to the story about how Vince ended up like Swiss cheese in Coolidge’s bathroom, so on top of everything; it adds nothing to the story.


You see Vic spent a lot of time trying to figure out exactly what happened to his brother and now as a bit of small-talk and perhaps an outlet, he's telling this bunch of strangers what exactly happened to Vince. 

Other than perhaps Harvey Keitel's character in both films, I don't think there are any real theory-breaking elements I've not seen.

1358798787.0,119,self.FanTheories,170a1c,Star Wars - The Chosen One (Movie and EU spoilers),139,20,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/170a1c/star_wars_the_chosen_one_movie_and_eu_spoilers/,"The chosen one is foretold in an ancient Jedi Prophecy, often regarded as The Prophecy of the Son of Suns. The prophecy specifically says ""When the shadow of the Bogan falls upon them, the Ashla will not desert them because in the time of greatest despair there shall come a savior, and he shall be known as the Son of the Suns.”

Qui Gon Jin and many others within the Star Wars Universe believe that this is Anakin Skywalker. Even George Lucas himself says as much. And why not? It makes sense. Anakin was born as a result of the force, from the power of Darth Plagueis (Palpatine's Master, before Palpatine murders him) and he is born under Tatooine's two suns. He also comes at a time when the shadow of the Sith has fallen upon the galaxy (Bogan and Ashla are two moons, Bogan representing the dark side, Ashla representing the light side), and by killing Palpatine and saving his son Luke, he brings balance to the force. 

However there is one major issue that just doesn't make sense if Anakin is the Chosen one, bringing balance to the force. Why didn't the Sith disappear from the galaxy after Anakin die? Why didn't the Sith stop causing chaos and disorder for years to come? There are two reasons.

First, the prophecy was misinterpreted. Bogan and Ashla are supposed to represent the force, one side being the light side the other being dark. Two moons revolve, one being dominant at one time, the other coming back at another time. Balance. Not one destroying the other and being the only moon but a revolving door of balance. 

Throughout the Expanded Universe, this issue of balance comes up time and again. Jason Solo struggle through the issue after his time in captivity under the Yuuzhan Vong with Vergere and then under Lumiya's apprenticeship. Luke Skywalker also deals with this in the Jedi Order's pursuit of Abeloth, a being of terrible dark side power. Long story short, it's well documented that balance isn't the light side being dominant. It's the force toeing the line between the two, when one becomes too dominant in the galaxy, the other side stands up to bring that balance back. 

The Jedi misinterpreted this to think that the Chosen one would destroy the Sith. The prophecy never stated this. Moving on to Anakin.

He did bring balance to the Force. But he only did so for a short time. Once he died, the balance was left to the devices of the New Jedi Order and disciples of the Dark Side. How could he be the Chosen One then? 

The answer is that he is the Chosen One, but not in the exclusionary way many assume. He is the ""first"" Chosen One. The start of the way the force will be balanced. So yes he fits the prophecy in that he is born under two suns, and brings balance at a time of the dark side's shadow being over the Galaxy, but the Chosen One doesn't end with his death. 

His line is the new way the force will balance itself. His line is the ""Chosen One"". It only makes sense. 

He is born from the force. His line started not from human/alien ancestors, but directly out of the force. That's why he and Luke Skywalker are so strong. They essentially came from the Force. This causes the Skywalker line to be the force's tool to balancing the force. 

We are even told as much in Star Wars; The Clone Wars. Anakin meets the three force beings that are supposed to balance the Force. The Father, the Son (Dark Side) and the Daughter (Light Side) are pure entities of the Force. The Father tells Anakin he is supposed to take his spot mediating between the two Force Children. But he rejects this, and the three force beings all die. Without even realizing it, Anakin is given the mantle of being the tool the Force uses to balance itself. His line has just become the way this happens. 

When Anakin becomes Palpatine's apprentice, the force is moving from a time of overwhelming Jedi power (light side) to a more tainted dark side period. When Anakin (along with his son Luke) kills Palpatine, the pendulum swings again, moving from dark to light. Luke Skywalker then takes over the mantle of balancer (for lack of a better term) and his life is him helping keep balance for the Force in the galaxy. His nephew Jacen Solo (son of Leia, from Anakin) becomes a Sith, again swinging the pendulum in a time when Light was dominating. And further down the line, Cade Skywalker fights Darth Krayt and the One Sith to bring balance in a time of utter Sith power. 

TL;DR - Anakin Skywalker is the Chosen One but only until he dies. He then transfers that title to his son Luke Skywalker. The Chosen One is limited to one person. It is the line of Skywalker that is in fact the Chosen One, a line born out of the Force.

I just watched Rises for a second time and thought that Ben Mendelsohn's performance as John Daggett, especially during the boardroom scene, was a spot-on Joker impersonation. The speech patterns, the slimy lip licking, the eye rolling.. it was so Joker. It seems to be too much of a coincidence that this character would have so many of these distinctive Joker traits.. And as Gordon says later in the film, ""You're a detective now. For you there are no more coincidences."" (The actor, like Ledger, is also Australian!)

So, if Daggett is indeed Joker's father it adds an interesting depth to Joker's character. It means he would have grown up ultra-wealthy (outside normal society), watching his father consort with mercenaries to topple governments and set-up exploitive mining operations. As a youth he might have seen the Congo-style violence and chaos that results when mining companies use warlords to wipe out locales and to enforce slavery in their mines. He might have even been involved.

There would also be a parallel with Alfred's story in Dark Knight about the man in the jungle who ""wanted to watch the world burn"". There's a trope in literature and film (Heart of Darkness) that it's in the jungle where man's chaotic, evil nature reveals itself bare. If Daggett is Joker's father there would be that direct connection with the Joker and the jungle and its evil. What do you guys think?

1367611304.0,116,self.FanTheories,1dn0ev,Cloud Atlas - Tom Hank's demon in the post-apocalyptic world are the last vestiges of evil leaving humanity,154,38,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1dn0ev/cloud_atlas_tom_hanks_demon_in_the/,"FIRST, it's important to remember that each of the timelines can be understood based on what piece of ""natural order"" they were fighting: Slavery, Homosexuality, Nuclear Power/Rights to Journalism, Rights of old people, and Fabricants. I'll leave the motivations of the last story to the end.

SECOND, we can make better sense of the characters by plotting them according to how they reacted to said issue.  I've made [a color coded chart:](http://i.imgur.com/E5F3CHg.png)

* Blue means they fought against the Natural Order (""The weak are meat that the strong shall eat"")
* Yellow means they did nothing to stop the natural order (too scared or didn't care)
* Red means they were the strong eating the weak.

First off, I just want to point out that some of these classifications fit well, and some don't.  These are truly complex characters. I've gone back and forth on a few.  Anyways, here's some interesting things that pop up:

* Hugo Weaving and Hugh Grant are almost always the strong eating the weak (although they are most neutral in the 1936 timeline).
* Jim Sturgess (lawyer), David Gyasi (stowaway), and Doona Bae (fabricant) are always fighting against the status quo
* Jim Broadbent and James D'Arcy play evil, good, and neutral characters
* Tom Hanks is the only person to play only REALLY GOOD and REALLY EVIL characters.

Now, in each of these timelines, it's pretty clear what issue they're fighting against.  The most unclear are 2012 (the treatment of old
people) and the Post-Apocalyptic one.  In that one, the main conflicts that qualify are

1. Surviving The Cannibals - The ""Strong who eat"" have become a completely different species, a physical embodiment of the struggle against human nature in every other story.  Kinda poetic.
2. The Inner Conflict of Zachry - Zachry seems to constantly struggle against his personal demon, who also happens to be the Devil, ""Old Georgie.""  It keeps him from growing close to people, and makes him mistrust Meronym (Halle Berry), the only one that can help him.

So Zachry's the linchpin.  The ""strong will eat"" shit has finally been phased out of the human race, and this civilization of black people with white clothes seems to represent everything that a civilized people should.  Now all that's left is for Tom Hanks (as Everyman) to shed his personal demons of mistrust, fear, and irrational self-preservation, to walk away from his evil history, and start a new humanity.  We needed to see his inner struggle with his fear, and the best way to do so was to manifest it in an apparition, so that he could KILL IT.

BAM.

**TL;DR - The Green Goblin represented the final vestiges of humanity's connection to its carnal and ""natural order-oriented"" past.**

**DISCLAIMER-** I haven't read the book; this might only work for the movie.

-----------------------------------
Also, quick question.  One of the easter eggs I was looking for was how each story connected to the previous.

* Gay composer had a copy of the lawyer's journals,
* The journalist had a copy of Gay lovers' correspondence (plus the Cloud Atlas Symphony)
* The fabricant watched the movie made about Cavendish's experiences.
* Zachry got the fabricant's messages

But where was Cavendish's connection to the 1970's?  Anyone see this?

Most explanations surrounding why the *Star Wars* prequels never captured the magic of the original trilogy talk about how George Lucas didn't surround himself with a production team at Lucasfilm that could bounce his more...outlandish ideas around. One that seems to particularly stand out was an editor named [Marcia Lucas] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcia_lucas).

Marcia Griffin was married to Lucas for 15 years, the supervising editor of *Taxi Driver* and won the Oscar for Film Editing for Episode IV. She was responsible for some of IV's [most pivotal scenes] (http://www.syfy.co.uk/news/3-ways-which-marcia-lucas-helped-save-star-wars), including Obi-Wan's death and the final Death Star trench run. But after the trilogy the two went through a brutal divorce, one which made Marcia completely disappear from the film industry and left Lucas bitter, financially damaged and unable to re-marry until [30 years later](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/04/entertainment-us-georgelucas-idUSBRE90300Z20130104).

Only [recently] (http://secrethistoryofstarwars.com/marcialucas.html) there was better insight into what had happened. In summary:

- A shy, amateur filmmaker (George) and a young, yet rising editor (Marcia) became an ""unlikely"" couple. Lucas lived in a [strict Methodist family](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Jedi#Way_of_life) and never entered a serious relationship before.
- The production (and subsequent fame) of *American Graffiti* and *A New Hope* leave them [too busy to see each other] (http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Padmé_Amidala#Separation_from_Skywalker) (the stress nearly destroys George's health). By *The Empire Strikes Back* they began to grow distant, Marcia now in depression.
- Marcia tries to settle down with George, while he continues his goal to make more ambitious films and the construction of Skywalker Ranch. They have trouble conceiving a child.
- [George suspects Marcia of betraying him with another man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfX01lURXFk).

""George emotionally neglected Marcia for years in the hopes of securing his private empire, yet in the end this pushed her away completely, and when she left she took away the private empire that had instigated the process in the first place."" - Michael Kaminski

Specifically about the events that led up to the story we experience in Super Mario Bros. for the NES. What we actually know about the story is that a big evil turtle thing kidnapped a princess. Isn't that odd to take for granted? Kidnapping royalty is only a step away from regicide; why on earth did they send a plumber to fix it? Why is a human in the seat of royalty in a mushroom kingdom? What the hell does Mario owe the princess that he's willing to save her? I plan to answer all of these questions but let's start with the Mushroom Kingdom itself.

**The official explanation:** [""I wanted to put a bouncy guy in Alice in Wonderland.""](http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2005-11-06/online-extra-meet-marios-papa)

That's simply not enough of an explanation for the pedantic so it's time to infer:

**FAN THEORY TIME**

There's no argument that Super Mario Bros. takes place in the Mushroom Kingdom, but such a name implies that at some point there was a King in charge of the area. It's not called The Mushroom Matriarchy or The Mushroom Principality, it's The Mushroom Kingdom we've come to know and love. So why ""Mushroom""? One theory is that, in parts, there appear to be giant mushrooms large enough for a human to stand on. That's impressive, but not necessarily worth naming the whole kingdom after. It's much more likely that the intelligent race of mushroom people, one of which we now know of as Toad, named the land after themselves. It's quite interesting and slightly Pratchett-like when you consider the Mushroom Kingdom to be a land where the vegetation grew so intelligent that it started governing itself.

Now consider the various species in the Mushroom Kingdom. There's the insular community of the toadstool people of the Mushroom Kingdom. There's the wordless, poisonous and darker-skinned mushroom people referred to derogatorily by the toadstool commonwealth as ""goombas"". There's the turtle men or ""koopas"", also generally kept outside of Mushroom Kingdom affairs, and relegated into ghettos riddled with lava, bottomless holes and other hazards. There's also a myriad amount of wildlife which are too blissfully brainless to care about the political landscape. Finally, there is a very small population of humans. Since they're the most curious and adventurous of any of the other species, seeing a human is a rare occurrence in the Mushroom Kingdom. Humankind tend to get killed off by the many things that humans tend to be too foolhardy to stay locked away from: Koopa bites, poisonous goomba flesh, pits, lava, and all the other things that would cull the human herd which would otherwise be burgeoning in the area.

Now the intelligent mushroom subjects, from here on referred to as the toadstool people, are portrayed as being benevolent, generous and gregarious. It's safe to assume that these traits could also be said of their ruler: The Mushroom King. There's zero mention of the mushroom king in Super Mario Bros.' barebones plot so how can a king exist in the story? Simple, he's dead, but let's go back about twenty years before SMB began...

King Toadstool, at the late point in the family's long reign probably suffered from impotence due to what so many royal families usually face when they ""keep relations within the charmed bloodline"", inbreeding. In addition to inbreeding, the king was probably a man on a lofty perch of an anemic family tree and suffered from dementia as well. We can assume that when he was unable to sire another toadstool to take the throne, he went insane with frustration. Instead of handing over the throne to the peasantry, he wanted to make sure that the crown's next recipient would usher in a new era. To ensure this occurred, he sent his servants out to bring him two orphans: A human and a koopa, one of them male, one of them female so the kingdom might have a king and queen who would rule completely differently from anything the kingdom had seen before. In King Toadstool's mind, he thought that he would be the last great ruler of the nation before the townspeople revolted at the thought of a non-toadstool patriarchy. I'm sure the uproar was tremendous, but the usually peaceful toadstool people chalked it up to the ""wise"" king's judgement and that perhaps under the guidance of a koopa and a human, someday the races might live in harmony. 

The king, impaired though he was, loved his foster children as if they were his own and raised them well. One was the lovely Princess Toadstool. She was taught of all the upper-class social graces, raised upon a posh life of fine food and fitness, and received royal schooling befitting of her rank. She loved her adoptive father just as much as he loved her, and she spent her idle time dreaming of being the queen someday.

The other child was just as well looked after but showed far more promise than the dreamy princess. From a very young age, the king's assistants noticed that the ""koopa"" they'd brought in as his foster child was intelligent. He showed a fondness for machinery and gadgetry in his primary years and by his formative puberty was voraciously reading in the kingdom's library about how to rule efficiently and forcefully. While the King commended his ardor towards the subject, many of the King's aides warned him of the dangers of a cunning prince. What's more, with his royal diet and access to the castle's kitchens whenever he desired, he grew much larger than what a koopa might be able to achieve in the wild. The weak koopas are slim, frail, and show clear signs of malnutrition next to the towering behemoth that a koopa could apparently become if raised properly. Is this why the kingdom had kept them oppressed for so long?

One day when on a royal outing to the prized towering mushroom fields of the kingdom, Prince Toadstool, as he was known, turned to his father and asked of the local populace ""Father, why are those koopas so weak and puny?""

The king laughed heartily and said ""They weren't raised as you were, child. Out here they fight every day for edible mushrooms to survive. You should count yourself lucky.""

Prince Toadstool, clearly not satisfied with this answer asked ""Why can't we just give them some of our mushrooms? They're clearly in pain.""

""Perhaps when you are king,"" scoffed King Toadstool, ""that is an issue you can address.""

Such was the beginning of Prince Toadstool's nighttime forays from the castle grounds. He wanted to meet the brethren he'd been so long separated from and he learned many things. He learned of the oppression they endured and how they were forced into the most inhospitable reaches of the land. He learned of how the goombas were treated. He also learned that they weren't always called ""koopas"" and that such a term was offensive and imposed by the toadstool ruling class. Such knowledge struck him deeply, and he returned to the castle after visiting the slums each time.

Eventually the time came that Prince Toadstool could stand idly by no longer as the old guard oppressed his people. With a gleaming golden axe, Prince Toadstool murdered his adoptive father, the king, and hid or perhaps ate the pieces in a rage-fueled bloodlust. With the King's murder fresh on his green, scaly hide, he took off again into the night to meet up with his turtle brothers. He spoke to them of revolution and of overthrowing the Toadstool regime. He told them before the news even reached the toadstool citizens that the king was dead and a new kingdom will rise. In an affront to the racial epithet, he dubbed himself ""King Koopa"" and began raising, feeding and training an army of hammer men, turtle assassins, goomba farmers, and even body doubles so that should someone try to assassinate him they wouldn't know where to strike.  He designed weapon systems with living bullets, sentient flames and summoned all other manner of eldritch atrocities from his malevolent atelier. While the Mushroom Kingdom was in panic, ""King Koopa"" was ready to start a war.

Poor Princess Toadstool always wanted to be queen but not like this. The people were in a panic with the death of their king. There were stories of koopa spies on the perimeter, and sightings of goombas were on the rise thus making the outside more unnavigable than ever. Her kingdom was left in shambles, the peace was broken forever, the economy was no doubt in the toilet with nobody willing to go out and forage for what the townspeople called coins and she spent most of her days locked in the tower turning guests away. In a moment of weakness she was visited by a secret messenger representing the king of the turtles who offered to take her away to rule in the new turtle kingdom once it rises, so that her life might be spared in the coming onslaught. She heaved a heavy sigh, took the emissary's hand and agreed. As the emissary took her away, the act was witnessed by one curious human; a plumber in fact.

Humans, while almost a novelty to the toadstools, enjoyed a certain amount of protection and commerce with the mushroom kingdom since one took office as princess. Such an environment was rife with job opportunities until now. This plumber, named Mario, up to this point had a plumbing business with his brother which made them some decent coins by cleaning the pests out of the kingdom's often dangerous sewer system. As outpost by outpost fell to the supernaturally armed koopa army, his resolve turned to steel as the news reached the kingdom that a small force of koopas was spotted outside the kingdom's front gate. He put on his hat, told his brother ""I might not be back, don't try to follow me."" and set out into the wild to find and recover the last living, loyal soul in the Toadstool bloodline so things might go back to as they were... When he was a plumber... and things were so much more simple. Was he stupid? Maybe... but someday the whole kingdom might regard him as a hero.

1368597853.0,114,self.FanTheories,1ed9rc,My theory on Kevin from The Office,177,63,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1ed9rc/my_theory_on_kevin_from_the_office/,"With the final episode of The Office only two days away, I figured now was a great time to post my theory on Kevin Malone. 

First off I'm going to divide the main (been on the show 4+ seasons) characters into groups.

The primary characters: Michael, Jim, Pam, Dwight
The primary characters have (mostly) complex characterizations, rich backstories, undergo huge life changes, personality changes, etc. They are the most complete characters.

The secondary characters: Andy, Erin, Daryl, Angela, Ryan, Kelly, Jan
The secondary characters have flimsier characterizations, but still have ambitions, undergo some life changes, and some personality changes. However, the characters stay fairly consistent from start to finish.

The tertiary characters: Phyllis, Stanley, Toby, Creed, Meredith, Oscar, Kevin
Extremely cut and dry. The characters can be explained in three words, don't change at all over the course of the series. They stay extremely consistent from start to finish.... except for Kevin. 

You can look at all the characters on the show, none of them are more maddeningly inconsistent than Kevin. In one scene he is seen as a buffoon and in the next scene he is a savant. His voice can often change from scene to scene, going from some sort of baby speak to a (somewhat) normal adult voice. I feel like most people want to chalk that up to lazy writing. However, the truth is:

**Kevin is a mole.**

Although I'm sure there are continuity errors throughout the course of nine seasons, there is no way Kevin's behavior can be explained away by simply bad writing. The show is too well written to allow for that. [For those of you that may argue, please go watch Casino Night. I'll wait.] The reason Kevin is so inconsistent, is that he is a mole placed by the documentary team. 

See, initially, the documentary was going truly going to be about paper and the paper business. The documentary team hired some no name, bad actor, to infiltrate the company through the warehouse... Kevin. 'Kevin' decided he should play a simple guy, someone he thought would fit in well at the warehouse. He never thought Michael would hire him on as an accountant, but he did. Although a bit problematic, as 'Kevin' had no real accounting skills, the documentary team figured they could get through 6 episodes without him revealing himself. However, the team began to get some really good footage, not on the paper company, but on the people running the paper company. Kevin would have to stay.

This is where 'Kevin' begins to fall apart. The actor playing Kevin wasn't good, not by a long shot, but the documentary team didn't have the money to hire a pro and they couldn't replace him now. He would be fine... Until he wasn't and couldn't decide what direction to take the character.

Kevin couldn't balance his travel receipts, but could do complex math in his head (only when it involved pies).
Kevin couldn't do his job as an accountant, but could win an event at the world series of poker. 
Kevin can't comprehend half of what people say, but can outsmart Dwight and Andy in a game of Dallas.
Kevin talks like a baby, but will talk like an adult in a cutaway. 
Kevin is a gifted drummer and basketball player, not something you would expect from a buffoon.
I could list more, but they are more fun to spot when watching the show, I'll leave the rest up to you. The gist is:

**'Kevin' can't decide who to be.**

'Okay, he's weirdly inconsistent. That doesn't prove he's a mole.'

But wait! 'Kevin' is the only character (other than Creed) with absolutely zero outside connections.
Here's what he's got:

Stacy: We conveniently never meet her and they split up. We meet her daughter, but kid actors are cheap (I assume... stage moms are terrible)
Scrantonicity: It can't be that hard to find five guys to play Police songs and we never actually see them until the third season, more than enough time to form a band.
Lynn: Lasts about two weeks. Again, convenient.

Kevin can't even produce a girl's number to give to Michael during the Chair Model episode.
That's it. Literally it. In nine seasons those are the only things we know about Kevin outside of the fact that he works at the office. 

**'Kevin' doesn't have a life outside of the office because he doesn't exist outside of the office.**

'Okay well that is weird, but he isn't actually a 'mole', he never did anything.'

Didn't he?

In season 3 he baits Jim by asking him if he thinks Karen or Pam is hotter. 
In season 4 he hides in a car trying to figure out if Jim and Pam are dating. (Could he have found them and told the producers about it? Yes.)
In season 9 he discovers that the Senator and Oscar are dating. (It is revealed earlier than this by the documentary, but Kevin does find them.)

(There is a big gap in the seasons because I haven't watched the earlier seasons in a while. Please help.)

'Maybe...'

""You're too charactery to be a lead, but not fat enough to be a character actor."" - Kevin (How would he have that knowledge, or the ability to phrase it that way? A non-actor wouldn't phrase it that way.)

'Ok yes, but you would think the writers would have slipped something in there.' 

""Oh! And look out for that pesky mole.""

'Kevin is a mole.'

**tl;dr Kevin is a mole.**

Basically, I was watching Community for the umpteenth time when I realized certain parallels between Jeff and Chang. In Season 1, Episode 24, Chang seeks Jeff’s advice on how to not get caught with a fake degree. Chang is essentially the Chinese, teacher version of Jeff. They both faked a degree, nabbed a job of authority and power (as a lawyer and an power-abusive teacher), and finally got fired when they got found out.

When Jeff was kicked out of his old kingdom, he managed to go to community college in an effort to obtain a real degree and to return to the world he once knew. Chang also returned to community college (but this, we already all know.) Both Jeff and Chang’s first step was to go to Professor Ian Duncan for “help.” In the Pilot, Jeff wants Duncan’s help to get the answers for Spanish class; In “Pascal’s Triangle Revisited” (S1E25), Chang also walks straight up to Duncan’s office and asks for some help coasting through college. Both invoke the power of friendship, and both are denied help.

However, the key difference between Jeff and Chang is the sense of community (pun intentional) in both of their situations. When Jeff asks Duncan for help, Duncan pretends to help in order to teach him a lesson, as a friend. When Chang asks Duncan for help, Duncan immediately dismisses him, saying that they were never friends and that he always hated Chang. Jeff proceeds to find a lovable study group, a community. Chang himself is rejected from this very same community.
Whereas Jeff is welcomed with open arms everywhere, Chang is locked out. We gradually see Jeff developing, becoming a better person, maturing and moving past his issues, while Chang has degenerated into an insane shell of his former self, a man who sank into his issues and become a worse person. Season 1 Chang was crazy, sure, but he was almost on a sociopath level of crazy; he knew that his actions were outrageous, but he just didn’t care. He acted because he had nothing else better to do, and he just wanted to hurt others for fun. After encountering the Jeff-like situation, Chang became helpless and lost in his mind; he started making puns that didn’t make any sense; he kidnapped the Dean and almost set the school on fire.

Jeff recognized that Chang became Season 2 - 4 Chang because of his lack of human connection and attempted to reach out to him several times in Season 2, but the effect never stuck. As a result, Chang goes crazy, simple as that. Jeff, who has been in a similar situation as Chang, actually connects with other people and has grown as a person. However, if Jeff had never found the study group, then it’s entirely possible that he would have degenerated in a similar fashion to Chang.

Of course, Chang’s own personality kind of hurts his chances of finding a community, but Jeff was a Class A douche prior to Greendale. At any rate, the study group made Jeff a better person, while Chang, left alone, becomes a weird, double agent of a Kevin.

He has gone on to find that crime is a lucrative business and has become a bitter competitor with his childhood rival, Mandark. However, many years have passed in his life, so there are a few inconsistencies.

**1: Evil Genius?** The cartoon that chronicled the childhood of Dexter displayed him as a tiny hero. He would often use his genius to battle monsters or defeat Mandark. But if we look closer we can see that Dexter was no hero. He used his technological prowess to beat *his* enemies. In fact, in one episode he builds a mecha-dexter so he can pummel kids on the playground...he's a selfish kid. On top of that he is often motivated by material gains, it's no wonder that he'd change his name to hide his identity and go into the lucrative life of an evil genius.

**2: Vector=Mandark** This one hardly needs explaining, but it's clear from his technological style, his looks, and his general attitude that Vector is Mandark. His father, originally a young hippy, had started a business attempting to bankroll his son's aspirations and soon finds himself the rich head of an incredibly successful black-market company that--ironically--gave Dexter a head start in his life of crime.

**3: But what about Ego Trip?** The movie that shows a very different future is one of the most important factors in Dexter's choice to become Gru. After he goes into the dystopian future caused by his attempts to gain power and fame, Dexter realizes that using his genius to improve society will always be perverted and destroyed by Mandark's evil ambitions. So what does he do after he realizes this? As a young man he goes into hiding and resorts to crime to support himself. Soon, as an uncontested evil genius, he makes a name for himself and finds a new passion. 

P.S. If you want to bring up paradoxes and time travel, don't. This is fiction, and a little boy can't dig out thousands of cubic meters of dirt to build a giant lab under his house

**4: Where is DeeDee? Who are these girls?**  As Dexter's life became increasingly more harrowing, and he had to work to hide his true identity, he must have found himself distanced from his family. This is for his own, as well as their security. So by the time we see him, his relationship with his family is essentially dissipated. So it is no wonder that we never see DeeDee. 

Then he adopts the girls. The girls are a final piece in Dexter's maturation. His descent into a life of crime has allowed him to cultivate his childish selfishness and he adopts the girls as a means to an end. However, these girls serve as a symbolic substitute for DeeDee, who often destroyed Dexter's work and reminded him from time to time of the fact that family can sometimes be as important as personal ambition. When he learns this, his quality of life improves and he becomes the happy-go-lucky evil genius we see at the end of the film.

1342683260.0,118,self.FanTheories,wt30n,Titanic is the prequel to Inception - and Inception is all in Cobb's mind.,191,73,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/wt30n/titanic_is_the_prequel_to_inception_and_inception/,"I apologize in advance for the wall of text. Let's get started.

Rose is senile. She has Alzheimer's Disease to boot. She is also the only person that knows where the Heart of the Ocean is. But she can't just tell anyone where it is since she is mentally impaired by her  dementia - she doesn't remember, at least not consciously, where it is. Enter Cobb, a young extractor that shows great promise. He is hired by historians to go into Rose's mind and find the location of the Heart. But she won't just give in, so two levels are made: the first involves a deep sea crew that is looking for the Heart and another level that is the actual story Rose is telling. When Rose sleeps at night in the first level Cobb (disguised as a crew member that avoids Rose during the day) enters her room and goes into her dreams - which, due to the nature of the first level, are about the Titanic. 

There he is Jack, a character that is accepted by Rose's mind because she simply can't remember things that well. She doesn't remember if she really loved her fiance, so easily accepts another man into her memories. He seduces her and follows her around, trying to see where she stores the Heart, anything to give a clue as to where it is now. When he gets the chance to look into the safe in her room he snoops around a bit - maybe all that needs to be done is to explore the wreck of the ship and retrieve the safe. At this point Rose has a fleeting moment of clarity and her projections arrest Jack. Why don't they kill him? Because Rose, even in her moment of clarity, still can't quite remember things correctly. 

So Jack is locked up. During this time he misses his kick (the band playing on the deck) and is trying to escape by yelling for help, hoping a projection will hear him and kill him (he doesn't know what will happen if this happens yet). Instead, Rose finds him and he decides that he is going to get this job done. The two escape and Cal (another projection) realizes what is happening and tries to kill him. Around this time the two find another confused projection - Mr. Andrews, who is noticing that *something* is not right with the way time is progressing, but he can't quite figure it out. 

The ship sinks and Jack dies. What happens when you die while in a dream? He wakes up in limbo. How did Jack know so much (something odd given his social standing)? Simple - he had training to help him survive the sinking.

What evidence do I have to back this up? Glad you asked. Jack's memory is slightly....off, much like Saito's in limbo later in Inception, so he makes links between things, his subconscious trying to tell him of his actual memories and past experiences.

-While on the Titanic Jack draws **a girl and her father** playing with something. What is that something? **A top**

-Jack searches the safe for the Heart. Where do they convince Robert Fischer important info is held? **In a safe**

-How does Jack die? He freezes in the ocean, surrounded by water. What is a major kick required to wake him from Fischer's dream? **Being suddenly dropped into water**

-Rose has a couple of kids. Cobb's memory is confused, linking her life to his. He suddenly has **two kids that he must get back to**

-Jack was in a foreign country trying to get home to America. **Cobb is trying to get home to AMERICA**

-Jack saves Rose from jumping to her death. **Cobb's wife jumps to her death**

-The Titanic hits an **iceberg** and Jack dies in **freezing** water. Cobb ends up in an **arctic military base**

-The power goes out on the Titanic. Cobb is trying to get Fischer to disband a **power company**

Okay, many of these seem to be odd connections, others are striking. The thing to remember though is that Jack/Cobb's memory is off due to being in limbo. He is filling in the blanks from the last thing he remembers - his life as Jack - stuff from Rose's mind. Also, remember the quote ""Never draw from memory, always imagine new places""? What if you had no choice and thought you were in the real world? What if you were really **drawing from memories that happen to be another person's dream**?

They eventually find their mom, but she takes off before the brothers are able to resolve their issues with her. This is because she is lost in purgatory and is not able to let herself succumb to the reality that she will never be able to fix things, because nothing in purgatory can be fixed.

The movie ends when all three brothers realize after seeing their mother that redemption is impossible, that nothing can be solved in the afterlife. They give up the baggage of their previously living selves, by literally leaving the travel baggage of their father, who they feel bad is still alive and having to deal with the deaths of his three sons and his wife.

He stole a DeLorean from this crackpot old guy in town and it sent him back in time by accident. 

But Marty doesn't have any information about a clock tower, a lightning strike, etc. When Doc can't predict any future events he has no way of sending him home. Marty IS stuck in 1955. Doc sends him away to live somewhere other than Hill Valley, and Marty changes his name to Huey Lewis and has a completely different life. 

Doc then spends the next thirty years charting all events that his 1955 counterpart can use to help get Marty back. He orchestrates the women to give Marty the flyer in the town square with the info about the lightning strike and the clock tower. He meets Marty as a child and befriends him and his parents, which is why Lorraine and George never mention Doc, or get annoyed at Marty leaving in the middle of the night to hang out with him. He's like part of the family. Doc raises Marty to not be a criminal thug car theif. Doc has to wait for Marty to be the right age and for DeLorean's to be invented. The time machine is the one from the past. He has just kept it working. It's made of stainless steel, so it won't rust. It cleverly designed to easily fit a big pole and hook into the electrics for fucks sake. He has that bullet proof vest on the first time we see him get shot. It was all a ruse to get Marty to show 1955Doc the video tape so he could take notes on how the time machine worked so it could be rebuilt from scratch. He did all this to belay his guilt for getting a kid trapped in the past, in the future. He eventually gets Marty back and doesn't have to spend a life knowing that he ruined a mans life with his invention.

TL;DR - What we see at the beginning of BTTF is actually the second timeline. The first timeline involves Marty being stuck in 1955 for the rest of his life.

**EDIT: Addition to the Huey Lewis part of the theory that I stated in the comments.** If I went back in time, and I wanted to be a famous musician, and I knew how to play all of Huey Lewis' songs, I would just go and become famous by recording his songs first. Marty plays Power Of Love at the band auditions, so he knows the music. He is a fan of Huey Lewis, he has a Sports poster on his wall. Also, if Marty took Huey's place in the world, the universe would try and fill in the gap that he left in Hill Valley by sending Huey Lewis there. Huey is the teacher judging the band auditions

**Edit: Additional theory that fits Eric Stoltz into the trilogy.** All of Doc's messing with the timeline actually makes people look different. Small changes like the ones in the movies made all the McFlys look different, right? What about a big change like changing Marty's personality completely from birth? Maybe the original Marty in my theory didn't even look like Michael J. Fox but actually more like....Eric Stoltz. That's why we keep finding pictures of Eric Stoltz online in all the same situations from the movie. I guess this also means that Eric Stoltz grows up to look like Huey Lewis.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,1362723710.0,,,True,t3_19uep0,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/19uep0/back_to_the_futures_timeline_is_not_the_original/,

1357379918.0,117,self.FanTheories,1603no,Mario is the Avatar of the Mushroom Kingdom ,176,59,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1603no/mario_is_the_avatar_of_the_mushroom_kingdom/,"I've been playing ""New Super Mario Bros. 2"" recently and I was noting how weird it is that after all these years, Mario can still inexplicably shoot fireballs and breathe while underwater. Suddenly it hit me-- Mario is the Avatar of the Mushroom Kingdom.


Now when I say Avatar, I'm referring to  ""Avatar:The Last Airbender"" and ""The Legend of Korra."" He's the master of the four elements, plus all the other perks that come with being an Avatar, such as reincarnation, spirit travel and the like. 

So let me explain....

**The Elements**

Throughout the course of the Mario games, the plumber has employed a wide array of power-ups to bring peace to the Mushroom Kingdom. These power-ups represent the elemental bending powers of the Avatar.

**Fire** - Obviously, the Fire Flower which has been a staple in pretty much all of the Mario games. It's also one of Mario's default powers in Super Smash Bros. We might even be able to assume his default state is firebender or at least that Mario 1 was about him learning to firebend. 

**Water** - From the very start Mario was able to breath underwater with no aid whatsoever (except for in later 3D games like Mario 64.) Mario later gains the abilities expert swimming with the Frog Suit and then finally later incarnations have seen stuff like the Penguin Suit and Ice Flower, which allow him to freeze enemies. Oh! Don't forget the Fludd system from Super Mario Sunshine, which was also added as a default power in Smash Bros. Brawl. 

**Air** - Mario learns to use the air currents to float as early as Super Mario Bros 3 with the Raccoon Suit, Tanooki Suit and P-Wing. Later on he'd find a million other ways to do the same, using the Cape Feather, P-Balloon, Wing Cap, Propeller Mushroom, Bee Mushroom-- the list goes on. His ability to jump high and land with precision may also be linked to airbending. Don't forget the Warp Whistle, which whisks him away in a tornado. 


**Earth** - One of Mario's standard abilities is breaking stone blocks with his fists, but later he gains more showy earthbending powers, such as the Tanooki Suit and Rock Mushroom. He also learns metalbending in the form of Metal Mario and with the recent addition of the Gold Flower.

**The Avatar Powers**

Elemental bending can account for most of the power-ups that Mario receives during these games, but five of the most well-known Mario items cannot be explained in terms of elements because they represent Marios' Avatar/spirit powers.

**Invicibility Star** - This is the representation of Mario tapping into the Avatar state and all four elements at once. This all happens subconsciously, allowing Mario to just run haphazardly across the landscape, destroying all that stands in his path. It also explains why it's only temporary, as a longer-lasting Avatar state could lead to unnecessary destruction. 

**1-Up Mushrooms** - This is the representation of the Avatar's ability to reincarnate. In the world of ""The Last Airbender"" each cycle of the Avatar is a new person, however in the Mushroom Kingdom version, it's always Mario. 1-Up Mushrooms are often hidden in the game or require a trick to get them, which represents Mario's spiritual growth as the Avatar and explains why he's rewarded with another chance at the karmic cycle.


**Coins** - It'd be weird for the Avatar to go around collecting currency, so instead the coins represent Karma. For every 100 Karmic acts, Mario gets another chance to reincarnate. Coins, like Mushrooms, are rewarded when Mario does something like hit a block, defeat an enemy or even in some cases just jumping up to get them. These are the ways that Mario trains himself, since he has no masters to speak of and the only predecessor Avatars are the ones you already sent to their deaths. The only way he gains any knowledge from his past lives is by remembering how he died the last time so he can avoid being killed this time. Therefore, he needs as much Karma as he can get, which is why he gets it for doing the most mundane of training (or sometimes just for the hell of it.)

**Mushrooms** - This is THE Mario power-up and it ties, once again, into his reincarnation cycle. When Mario is reborn, he's usually in his infantile state, which is too weak to even break blocks. The Mushroom is what gives him the power to even USE his power-ups-- unless he has a fire flower in storage or something, Mario can't skip from small Mario to a powered-up (elemental) Mario without a Mushroom. The Mushroom represents all of the power and knowledge of the Avatar, which Mario can consume in one-go to jump immediately into an adult body, which allows him to tap into his bending abilities. 

**Yoshi** - Every Avatar has an animal companion (often a mount) which has a strong spiritual connection to him/her. Mario's animal companion in this sense is Yoshi. Yoshi is even able to mimic some of the bending abilities of his owner, such as fire breathing, flying and the ground pounding. In fact, Yoshi has been looking after Mario since he was a baby like a proper animal companion. 

**The Spiritual Side**

**Ghosts** - As Mario's journey progresses, he starts to have to confront spirits by visiting ghost houses and other locales, which represents the Avatar's connection to the spirit world and ability to step into it. That's why Yoshi doesn't follow you into Ghost Houses, because he can't physically enter one. And consider the fact that if you figure out the secret exit to the first Ghost House Mario ever encounters, you unlock the secret area where you can get every available power-up, a Yoshi and free-lives indefinitely which is a heck of a reward for Mario's first visit to the spirit realm. 

**Super Mario Bros. 2 ** - The ending to the US version of Mario 2 reveals it was all a dream-- but what a dream it was! For American players this ""dream"" bridges the gap to Mario 3, which is the game where Mario gains a significant amount of power-ups. Therefore we can say the dream of Mario 2 represents a long spiritual journey that Mario took while meditating. His three closest companions were there in spirit, not only to help him, but to test him. Without a Princess or Toad to rescue, would Mario still strive to bring balance? 

Plus, consider how different Mario 2 is than any other game. Mario has none of his usual power-ups and the few that are presents have altered functions. Mario can't even use his earthbending abilities to stomp his foes-- he can jump right on top of them and ride them around. He has to resort to desperately grabbing things and throwing them to stay alive. This spiritual test allows him to unlock the rest of his elemental abilities, since he essentially defeated Bowser the first time around using primarily firebending. 


**Elemental Finesse** - It's not just the fact that he can bend all four elements that makes him the Avatar, it's the fact that he can use them together with finesse. For example, the Tanooki Suit which lets him both fly and turn into a statue. The Cloud Mushroom which lets him bend water vapor into clouds and then use airbending to jump higher and slow his descent. And the ridiculous power to shoot fireballs that turn things into gold with the Gold Mushroom.


**The Other Characters**


The biggest question that puts a damper on the whole theory is **Luigi** but, I think I have a way to circumvent that. In the Mario Universe, we're still in the earliest stages of the Avatar cycle. The Avatar has not yet discovered a way to transfer his powers and knowledge to the next in his succession-- the reincarnation always happens to be a smaller or powered-down version of himself. 

Mario's first attempt to create the next succession of Avatars was with his brother Luigi. He used spirtbending to transfer some of the power to Luigi so he could take Mario's place if he died. Back in the early days of Mario games, if you chose to play a 2-player game, it meant taking turns. If Mario died, Luigi took his place. However, with nobody to succeed HIM, whenever Luigi died, Mario would always come back. The arrangement suits the brothers just fine for awhile.

However, as a side-effect, Luigi also has the ability to do whatever Mario can do (although with slightly different results, depending on the game) and when the two are working together, they can both use the full extent of their powers. 

In later years, Mario has decided to pass these powers onto two **Toads** a blue one and a yellow one in another attempt to create more benders/Avatars.  Altogether, when the four stand together, they wear the garments of the four different elements. Mario is Red for Fire, Luigi is Green for Earth, Blue Toad is Water and Yellow Toad is Air (The airbenders wear yellow robes, I'm not just pulling that out of... thin... air...)

As for **Princess Peach** she does have some powers, but they're not really anything like Mario's. The first time we see her do anything, it's in a dream and then later her abilities seem to be connected to items. She can float and attack with a parasol, throw vegetables and whatnot. She DOES gain some elemental abilities in Super Princess Peach, but that's only because of the location and storyline events, and they were connected to emotions in a weird way. It could be possible that Vibe Island and the Vibe Scepter caused her to emphatically tap into Mario's Avatar powers in order to rescue him. 

**Bowser** and his minions often have the ability to breath fireballs, but even in Avatar we're given the explanation that dragons were the first firebenders. It's likely that the Koopas represent some originator species that created firebending in the Mario Universe. 

Just like in Avatar, the conflict between nations is what sets everything in motion. The war between the Mushroom Kingdom and the Koopa Kingdom is reminiscent of the conflict between the Earth Kingdom and Fire Nation. 

If you include the origin of **Baby Mario** then before he was even delivered to his parents he was saving people and using his Avatar abilities. In his first appearance, Baby Mario saves Baby Luigi, not Peach, so maybe that was the moment that Mario shared his Avatar abilities with his brother, so that he'd never need rescuing again. 


**As for Why the Power-Ups**

I have two theories for this.

1. Just like in the Avatar universe, the ability to use elemental powers is learned from some previous species. All of the power-ups in the Mario world represent lifeforms in some way-- Mushrooms, Flowers, Tanookis, Leafs/Raccoons, etc. Even the Star has a face on it to signify that it's a living being. Very few Mario power-ups have no connection to other lifeforms-- only the Vanish Cap, P-Balloon and Metal Cap. Even Mario's cape is given to him via a feather (which is connected to birds.) So therefore, this is early in the Avatar cycle when Mario can only borrow the bending abilities of other lifeforms. It also gives something to bend. For example, the Tanooki suit just turns into stone without showing Mario take bend any stone around him. So instead the Tanooki suit is possibly MADE from mud or earth and then Mario solidifies it to  turn to stone. Likewise, items like his cape and raccoon  are used to bend air currents. And Mario may in fact be the FIRST Avatar, which is why these items only work for him (typically.) 

2. There are no power-ups. The coins, the power-ups, these are all just symbols for you the player so you can keep track of Mario's progress as the Avatar. Your ability to switch powers by holding a power-up in your reserve represents Mario's continual progress at mastering multiple powers at once. You could essentially switch between a Fire Flower and Cape Feather continually,using the fire to clear a path for take-off and then switching to the cape so you can fly. Most people just don't choose to play that way (unless you do, in which case, let me know!)

The first four points were the basis of my original theory, and the others have cropped up middle school and seem to encourage it.

My theory is that Yoda is the offspring of Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy. There several things that point to this:

* 1) Yoda is (or originally was) a Muppet, as are Kermit and Piggy.
* 2) Yoda and Miss Piggy are both voiced by Frank Oz.
* 3) Yoda is green like Kermit, short like Piggy and has pointed, pig-like ears, though they don't droop like Piggy's ears do.
* 4) Yoda lived in a swamp, just like Kermit did originally in the opening of *The Muppet Movie*.
* 5) We know that space travel is possible in the Muppet universe from the *Muppets in Space* movie, where it is revealed that Gonzo is an alien. This could explain the ""far far away"" part of when Star Wars takes place.
* 6) Time travel is available in the Muppets universe based on numerous references: http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Time_travel. This covers the ""a long time ago"" setting of Star Wars.
* 7) Kermit and Piggy got married at the end of *The Muppets Take Manhattan*, though it was a rocky marriage as seen in 2011's *The Muppets*. While not stated, perhaps part of their marital problems were caused by their son, Yoda, being flung through space and time to an unknown destination?

The song ""Last Christmas"" is actually describing a one night stand that the singer had with Santa.

On the surface it seems to just be a normal Christmas heartbreak but, if one looks at the lyrics closely, it describes the big man himself. The first major clue is that the singer was with someone and immediately gave their heart to this person who didn't return the sentiment. Usually a one night stand with a slightly obsessed person. However, if the singer had known Santa all their life and idolized him, getting the chance to sleep with him would cause huge emotional feelings.

Next we have the line, ""Tell me baby/Do you recognize me?/Well/If it's been a year/It doesn't surprise me."" If this was a normal person the singer was with, why did it take a whole year to see them, especially with it being Christmas.

The next line has to do with ""'Merry Christmas'/I wrapped it up and sent it/With a note saying 'I love you'"". Again, very odd to wait until Christmas to send a note to someone to let them know you love them. Unless it's the person who gets the most mail out of anyone at this time of year. 

Here's where it starts to get tough to figure it out.

* ""A crowded room/Friends with tired eyes/I'm hiding from you/And your soul of ice"" - Describes a party or even a mall Santa. The singer goes with friends who are exhausted from being out shopping but need to let their kids see the man in red. The singer hides and, because Santa is from the north pole, the jolly old elf may have a slightly cold interior.
* ""A face on a lover with a fire in his heart/A man under cover but you tore me apart"" - Santa is a very passionate and caring indivdual. While he may be cold from the snow and ice in the north, he has a warm, somewhat fiery, heart. He has to be under cover because he has an image to maintain to the kids and believers and can't show he's just a man who needs a human lover.

My theory after seeing the first season of Heroes was that it was actually all taking place within a mental institution &amp; rehab clinic. Peter, is quite literally the head nurse of the institution, hence his ""power"" was empathy. He truly cared and felt for the patients at the institution, constantly putting himself in their shoes in order to see their point of view. Sylar was not really a bad guy, he was the resident doctor/surgeon who turned cold and heartless after everything he has been through, which is why he appears to be the villain to the rest of the cast. He loved to find out how things worked by observing their brains. Hiro has a severe case of I don't really know what, but it causes him to have epileptic seizures and strokes which is why he needs to have a personal nurse all to himself, Ando. Claire Bennet and Adam Monroe are in fact cocaine addicts, which is why they see themselves as immortal. Niki Sanders has a violent case of multiple personality disorder, and Matt Parkman has a severe case of paranoid schizophrenia (he thinks the voices in his head are other people's thoughts). Niki's son, Micah (technopath), became delusional after his father died (he has the ability to phase through anything). Nathan really is Peter's brother, and he's a heroin addict, hence the ability to ""fly high"". The Haitian is the nurse that provides them with medication, which is why he is able to suppress everyone's ""powers"".

Well, the answer is very simple-the entire plot is within Peter's mind. It all started with Meg-rather than being the big, unattractive, unpleasant girl that everyone in the show makes her out to be, she was a very beautiful and very popular teenage girl, at the prime of her life in high school. And she was also very caring for her poor younger brother, Chris. Chris didn't get enough oxygen when he was born, thus resulting in his mental retardation throughout his life. Meg had a special bond and love for Chris, and could not stand the fact that Chris could not receive the attention and love that she had received from everyone, including their parents. As a result, one night Meg took her younger brother to a party. However, after heavy drinking on Meg's part and a panic attack on Chris' part, Meg decided to take her brother home. As a result of her inebriated state, Meg totaled the car-resulting in the death of her and her brother. Unable to grieve with the death of her two children, Lois committed suicide shortly after the accident, while she was pregnant with a son that Peter posthumously decided to name ""Stewie"". Unable to cope with the death of everyone that he had ever loved, Peter slowly slipped into insanity, creating a world where his three children and his wife were still alive. That is why everyone in the show is so mean and distasteful towards Meg-Peter still resents her for ultimately being responsible for the death of everyone around him. However, there is still a minuscule part of Peter that loves Meg for the beautiful and wonderful girl she was, and the love that she held for Chris, which is why, every once in a while, you see Peter showing some sort of compassion towards his daughter. This would also explain the hyper intelligence of Stewie. Unsure of how Stewie's future would have become, Peter imagined his son with great intelligence and great potential, creating any sort of gadget that he would please. However, his resentment towards Lois also builds up in his image of Stewie, angry at her for taking away their still unborn child, which would explain why Stewie constantly plans for his mother's death, which would explain why Stewie never seems to age. As for Peter's extreme stupidity, he wasn't like that in real life. Peter was actually a very intelligent man. However, feeling like he had not met to the standards of his role as a father and a husband, unable to protect his children and his wife, Peter in himself has turned himself into the complete idiot that he perceives himself to be. However, he has created a different personality to express the intelligent man that he had always been, in the form of the family dog, Brian. As for Cleveland, Quagmire, and Joe, they all are real people involved in Peter's life. Cleveland and Quaqmire did live in the same neighborhood as Peter. Their appearances in the show represent the times that they visit their old friend, Peter, in the mental hospital, and attempt to humor him in his insanity-induced world. Cleveland and Quagmire also told Peter about Joe, the man who moved into his new house with his wife, his son, and a newborn baby on the way. Having never met Joe, Peter decided to include him into this new world, as the man that he never could have been-a strong, heroic, devoted father and husband, who unconditionally loved his family, despite his crippling disability. Cleveland, having visited his friend Peter more in the hospital, found that he himself was slowly starting to lose his mind when he was helping Peter indulge in his imagination. As a result, Cleveland decided to stop his visitations to Peter, resulting in the ""spin-off show"" that Peter created.
In his new world, Peter constantly is the one who brings troubles onto himself and his family. However, in the end of it all, he knows that his whole family is safe, and that he loved each and every member unconditionally.

Ill analyse specifically what I mean. Sorry for the wall of text.

&gt;Some nights I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights I call it a draw&gt;

Refers to Peter often spending nights out as Spider-man, but feeling like he's not really getting anywhere.

&gt;Some nights I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights I wish they'd just fall off

He wishes he could tell everyone that he's Spider-man, but knows he can't as it will put everyone in danger.

&gt;But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for oh
Whoa oh oh (What do I stand for?)
Whoa oh oh (What do I stand for?)
Most nights I don't know anymore...
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh,
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh&gt;

Referring to Uncle Bens death (and probably Gwen), and how he doesn't know if this is what Ben would want for him to be doing, whether what he's doing is right.

&gt;This is it, boys, this is war - what are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?&gt;


He feels like his constant clashes with villains has turned in to a 'war', and even thought he's supposed to be the hero, he wishes he could do to them what they have done to people he loved by killing them, hence 'break the rules'.

&gt;I was never one to believe the hype
Save that for the black and white
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked,
But here they come again to jack my style

Talking about how the daily bugle ('black and white') constantly are making him out to be something he feels he is not. How he is constantly named to be a menace when he's really a hero.

&gt;That's alright (that's alright)
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering just who I am, who I am, who I am
Oh, who am I?&gt;

Had a bit of trouble with this line, but I think it could refer to Gwen's death, and how she is always on the back of his mind, reminding him why he is Spider-man. The end of the line (if you listen to the song) asks 'who am I?' which keeps the theme of the song going of him not being sure if being Spider-man is what he should do.

&gt;Well, some nights I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change

Fairly obvious, sometimes he wishes he could give it all up and be normal, because he's sick of being alone. 

&gt;And some nights I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights I always win, I always win...

He feels like he is Spider-man, and that he needs for people to know who he is. He's scared if he quits, everyone will forget who he is inside. He feels like being Spider-man defines him. He shows further confusion in the last line 'some nights I always win' saying how no matter what, he always seems to 'beat' the villains.

&gt;So this is it. I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?

Again fairly obvious, feels like he's given up his normal life ('washed my hands of that') to be Spider-man, and isn't sure if it's worth it. (I figured it could also be how lonely he had been since he sold his marriage to Mephisto in one more day, but I feel like it kind of takes away from the fact he gave up his life to save aunt may if he is wondering if it was worth it).

&gt;No. When I see stars, when I see, when I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like this one, so come on.

'Stars' in this context refers to other superheroes, who he sees have similar struggles to him. All the songs they sing sound like this.

&gt;Well, that is it guys, that is all - five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks at home;
Sorry to leave, mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?

Kind of a loose one with the 'Mom' line in their, but I figured it's about him again wondering if it's all worth it and not wanting to be alone, saying he's trying to do something for himself for once ('Not for the folks at home').

&gt;My heart is breaking for my sister and the con that she call ""love""
When I look into my nephew's eyes...

Yeah I got nothin, as far as I know, he has no nephew and no sister, so this one kind of ruins my whole point, but I like to pretend it's not there.

&gt;Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things that can come from...
Some terrible nights

Speaking about all the things he has seen and been a part of as Spider-man despite all the tragedy.

&gt;The other night you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me
I called you up and we both agreed

This one can be taken 2 ways. One, he's speaking to a villain (probably Harry?) about how they now 'agree' and he doesn't have to fight any more. Or two, he's talking to someone who has always pushed him to be Spider-man (MJ, or another Avenger?), and in his dream they agreed he should give up.

&gt;It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance

Finally, the last line exemplifies that he knows he has to be Spider-man, that the world needs him, and that its 'for the best' nobody listens to him when he says he doesn't want to do it anymore.

Again, sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, but I thought it was a cool idea.

Marge Simpson shot Burns. 
But what are you talking about OP, didn't Maggie shot Burnsies?
First we need some background info 
Marge LOVES her family and
Marge is dedicated to Springfield and it's people


Burns hurt Bart's dog breaking it's leg and Bart wants payment.
Burns took the school's oil, cancelling Tito Fuente's employment to the school. Lisa is mad about this and wants action.
Burns always forget Homer's name, Homer goes berserk and wants to be ... well. Called. Also, Burns destroyed grandpa's home.


Conclusion? MARGE SIMPSONS SHOT MR BURNS BECAUSE BURNS HURT HER FAMILY.
Another because Burns destroyed a lot of the city, and Marge loves Springfield, loyal to it that she will do anything she can to help it.


but wait OP, didn't Burns said that Maggie was the one who SHOT Mr. Burns?


Well, if we look back on earlier episodes, there was this episode that Marge applied for a job in the power plant. Burnsy fell inlove with Marge but in the end, he only gave Marge a romantic night with Homer, because Burns wants the sole happiness of Marge even without him. 


Burns DID in fact wrote [M  S] On the sun dial at the time but while in the hospital, he thought about it and since Marge was very dear to him, he decided to blame it on the baby which of course he knew that there wouldn't be any harm to the baby. Justified by Wiggum's sentence, No jury in the world is going to convict a baby.


At the Simpson residence, Lisa says that everyone in Springfield had a reason for shooting Mr. Burns, even themselves. Everyone starts arguing amongst themselves about who did it, when Marge announces that there is already a prime suspect: Waylon Smithers.  


Marge SAYS a suspect, which of course, the crime do-er would say, to cover up his own crime. An alibi.

One thing to add. Loki isn't acting on his own will. While it is true that he wants to rule Asgard, it is also true that he's under Thanos' control, through the mind gem. When we first see Loki, his eyes look exactly the same as Hawkeye's when we get a close up of his face in the invasion of the Helicarrier. Loki planned, beforehand, to lose the fight, but he also planned for Hulk to kick the shit out of him, so he'd break the chains around his mind. He has his free will back, and Thanos has no idea.

tl;dr Getting beat up by the Hulk was a way to break Thanos' grip around his mind and double-cross Thanos, the Avengers and everyone else so he can conquer Asgard. Hulk freed Loki from the spell.

It made so much fucking sense though!

*Black dress, with the tights underneath,
 I've got the breath of a last cigarette on my teeth.
And she's an actress but she ain't got no need
She's got money from her parents in a trust fund back east.*

The singer is describing the girl. Gorgeous and rich, who wouldn't want her?

*T-t-tongues always pressed to your cheeks
While my tongue is on the inside of some other girl's teeth
You tell your boyfriend, if he says he's got beef
That I'm a vegetarian and I ain't fucking scared of him.*

The girl and him drunkenly make out- but she doesn't want any more of that. She has a boyfriend, after all. The singer doesn't care though, saying he 'isn't scared of' her vegetarian boyfriend. 

*She wants to touch me, woo ooh
She wants to love me, woo ooh*
He's delusional- he thinks the girl really wants him, when he's actually raping her.

*She'll never leave me woo ooh, woo ooh, ooh ooh* 
He figures this out, so he kills her. She'll never leave him, because she's dead.

*Don't trust a ho, never trust a ho
Won't trust a ho 'cause the ho won't trust me*
The 'ho' from the bar broke his heart, so he's saying not to trust hoes. Obviously, he's saying don't trust himself, as he's a psychopathic rapist, murderer, and necrophiliac.

*She wants to touch me, woo ooh
She wants to love me, woo ooh
She'll never leave me woo ooh, woo ooh, ooh ooh*
The chorus, being repeated, to me implies even harder that necrophilia is on. Now the woman has NO consent- she's dead. She has to touch him and love him.

*Don't trust a ho, never trust a ho
Won't trust a ho 'cause the ho won't trust me*
This line sounds more sinister the more he says it.

This next verse gives more insight to who the girl is, and how she met her rapist, and her demise.

*X's on the back of your hands
Washed them in the bathroom to drink like the bands*
She's underage- x's are drawn on the back of minor's hands at show's so bartenders know they're minors, and won't let them drink. This girl seems to have gotten rid of the x's though, so she can drink with the band that's playing at the bar she's at

*And the set list, you stole off the stage
Has red and purple lipstick all over the page*
The girl has teased more than just the guy she originally made out with.

*B-b-bruises cover your arms
Shaking in the fingers with the bottle in your palm
And the best is, no one knows who you are
Just another girl alone at the bar*
Flash forward to after the singer has raped the girl, but before she's dead. she's bruised and shaking and drinking to numb the pain. The singer is happy with who he chose to bring home, as no one will miss her. 
Alternately, the girl is being abused by someone. Whether it's her vegetarian boyfriend or her trust fund holding family, she's hurt, and drinks to numb the pain. The singer is excited by this, as he feels he can easily seduce her, then take her home and do the whole, rape/murder/necro thing.

Then the chorus is repeated twice. It still strikes me as very sinister, the singer admitting his guilt by saying, 'Don't trust me.'

*Shush girl, shut your lips
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips
I said shush girl, shut your lips
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips
I said shush girl, shut your lips
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips*
He wants her to be quiet, it's hard to get away with rape if the victim is screaming. as the bridge continues on, the singer gets more and more exasperated. Could this be another reason why he killed her, she wouldn't be quiet? Hellen Keller is another dead woman.

*She wants to touch me, woo ooh
She wants to love me, woo ooh
She'll never leave me woo ooh, woo ooh, ooh ooh
Don't trust a ho, never trust a ho
Won't trust a ho 'cause the ho won't trust me* 
The chorus's last line suddenly changes. He won't trust a ho, because the ho won't trust him. Further solidifying the psychopathic love he had for the woman he abused. He would have trusted her, and loved her, if only she did so back. This new chorus is re-repeated, and the song fades out.

We then came up with an alternate theory: Kid Blue is Abe's father. 

It's not hard to imagine Young Abe as a troubled youth, with a father involved with gangs. Imagine Abe grows up and ends up joining these gangs as well, but resents or even hates his father. Abe is sent back, and discovers Kid Blue to be a member of the gang he now oversees in the 2040's. Abe hates him because he knows what he will become (a shitty father), but has to keep him alive and has to keep him in the gang so that he will meet Abe's mother and procreate. 


The argument against this would probably be Abe's age (50-55?), but I don't believe we know how long Abe has been living in the past (in the 2040's). If he's been back from 10+ years, then the numbers could work.

Why is Wall-e the only functioning robot remaining on earth 700 years after humans abandoned earth? He is quite intelligent, and has the capability of repairing himself. Wouldn't the other Wall-e robots have had similar traits? Why would they all die unless there were some external threat to their survival?

So if all the Pixar movies take place in the same universe, then presumably the Wall-e robots would have been left on earth with all the abandoned toys that humans left behind. The Wall-e directive was to clean up all the garbage on earth, which would presumably be everything left behind that was relatively small. This would of course include toys.

With the humans gone, the toys were free to live their lives normally, except for the constant threat of being compacted by a Wall-e. Therefore, they would have decided to kill off the Wall-e robots in order to survive. A great war was waged between the toys and the Wall-e units (who recognized that the toys were trying to prevent them from achieving their directive). Eventually, all the robots were destroyed, except for Wall-e. I'm not sure if all the toys are also dead, or if they moved elsewhere, sparing Wall-e. As the lone survivor of this great war, he was able to continue working on his directive until eventually Eve showed up and the events of the movie take place.

We can see they have novels, films, and music. I would think they also have comic books and graphic novels. How does one create a successful superhero story in a world that already contains superheroes? In a universe where superheroes exist, and there are dozens of them, making a comic-book based on real heroes and stories of their heroism would be like one in our universe about firefighters or police officers on their day to day job. How does that sell copies? Enter Alan Moore, an intelligent man in a world where Batman and Superman are real and exist, decides to create a dystopian reality to terrify his audiences. His audience consisting not only of the general public, but also of the heroes themselves. 

The prospect of superheroes being outlawed by the government? The only ones allowed like the Comedian and Doctor Manhattan committing horrible atrocities in foreign countries? For a superhero, that's like reading Nineteen Eighty-Four. In the first couple of issues, the idea of an unknown person who knows the identities of superheroes and is bumping them off, one by one? A plot to kill all the heroes? You can bet that's going to sell copies. The parallels of the Crimebusters and Minutemen to the Justice League? Watchmen's deconstruction of superhero crime-fighting teams works perfectly if you apply it to the JLA. It's like those television shows you see that show what goes on in the newsroom when you turn off the cameras, or the corruption in our universe's police force. Watchmen even subverts the expectations of the audience brilliantly. In a world where superheroes and supervillains have been duking it out for generations, you're going to expect some master reveal of a supervillain...and it turns out that one of the members of the team was the villain all along? Mind blowing. A trusted colleague being revealed as the one killing all of the heroes. 

Finally, the event with the squid killing millions in New York City, and the heroes choosing to cover it up would be unheard of in the Marvel or DC universe. It would be a shocking and dark twist to a comic book in which their world had become a horrifying dystopia of fantastic proportions. The heroes choosing to lie to the public instead of stopping the villain and letting him move on with his life? To the people in DC/Marvel's universe, that's insane.

Jeff represents pride. He was a successful lawyer who is disbarred and has to go back to community college. Despite this, he refuses a life of humility. Brita represents greed as a secular psychological concept. She has a need to feel more excessively moral and social than her peers. She has an inordinate desire to be socially conscious for the purpose of criticizing others. Annie represents lust. She has an intense desire to overachieve; this vice is also tied to self-control, as Annie had a prescription drug problem. Envy is a resentful emotion. Pierce is a malicious narcissist; he wishes others lacked the superior quality he desires. He desires the attention and power of Jeff, an interaction between envy and pride. Shirley is wrath; every time she is offended her inner trait is exposed. Her voice changes and she becomes overwhelmed by uncontrollable anger. Troy represents sloth, in the sense of emotional and physical inactivity. He is a former star football player who now underachieves and neglects his emotions. He interacts well with Abed who represents gluttony- overconsumption to the point of waste. Abed indulges in media and pop-culture to the point of being disconnected. 

The fringe characters, the Dean and Change represent the venial sins. Both characters have progressively become more involved with the group dynamic, as their own sins have added up. The innocent seeming lies pile upon each other. However, their penance is seen in their hubris. The Dean is kidnapped, and Chang finds out he is not the father of Shirley’s child. The show is “meta” and very self-aware. This leads to the interdependence of the characters. Each of them experiences the deadly sins in their character development. This is why no one else can join the group.

Jeff -Pride
Brita-Greed
Annie-Lust 
Troy- Sloth
Abed- Gluttony
Shirley-Wrath

This is why sloth (Troy) and gluttony (Abed) live together. This is why envy (Pierce) follows pride (Jeff); moreover, it is why lust (Annie) and greed (Brita) follow Jeff. Shirley (anger) is pervasive to all capital vices (the group).

This is true, but it doesn't really answer the original mystery of the numbers.

In the episode where the numbers were originally introduced, Hurley uses them in the lottery and ends up winning millions of dollars, only to have all sorts of terrible things happen to him, causing him to believe the numbers are cursed. In an attempt to find more information about them, he looks for a man in Australia, and on the flight back home crashes on the Island. So the mystery of the numbers is ""Are they cursed and why?""; the fact that they each correspond to a specific candidate doesn't answer that.

A quick reminder for those of you who haven't seen *Lost* in a few years and may forget, the leader of the Island was this god-like guy named Jacob who could do magical things like control the weather. He would use his powers to manipulate people into coming to the island for various reasons; mainly he wanted certain specific people, such as Hurley, to come to the Island because the were candidates.

So my theory? The numbers weren't cursed at all, they were just numbers. It was Jacob who made all those bad things happen to Hurley to motivate him to travel to Australia and eventually get him on plane to crash on the Island.

*Edit: Oh by the way, this doesn't explain why the numbers kept showing up throughout the show, or how they're used in ARGs, just the original mystery of whether or not they're cursed.

Doctor Strange).

Now after seing Man Of Steel a number of times and thinking about it I believe they won't deviate from the grounded realistic aproach they have taken with the Dark Knight trilogy and Man Of Steel with their upcoming movies and the introduction of new characters. I think everything will either be grounded with a little bit of sci-fi (Nolan's Batman, Flash) or totally sci-fi for the alien stuff (Snyder's Superman, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter), but here goes my take: I believe the magic stuff will be explained by sci-fi (and alien related) also and they won't deviate from their grounded aproach by venturing into full magic. I think they will explain magic by science and alien related powers, I take this by the one open clue that was left in Man Of Steel and that was the sole purpose of the prequel comics: the empty sleeping pod in the fortress of solitude. In the prequel comics it is revealed that Kara Zor-El (aka Supergirl in the comics) and Dev-Em could have both or just one of them survived and lived on Earth thousands of years ago. I think that they, or only Kara, will be the ancestors of Wonder Woman and Aquaman. They will have formed two new people, one in the ocean and one retired and women only that have evolved from their Kryptonian nature by reproducing with Humans and adapting to Earth environment through centuries. So Wonder Woman and Aquaman will be Kryptonians descendants and this will explain their powers without the need of magic.

**TL;DR:** In the Justice League movie, to avoid magic that would deviate from the grounded aproach established in The Dark Knight Trilogy and Man Of Steel, they will make Wonder Woman and Aquaman two different species that both originated from the survivor of the Kryptonian scout spaceship that Clark finds in the Arctic in Man Of Steel.

*Time travel must be invented in order for time travel to not exist.*

This movie is about CID, the Rainmaker. He's the catalyst for all the events that take place in the Looper universe. His only goal is prevent his other mother Sara from being killed. He wants to protect Sara at all costs. Sara is killed in one timeline loop which starts a negative chain of events for CID, thus he takes over the cities of the future with his TK abilities. 

CID is also very very smart. We see this because he builds the frog transmitter out of toy parts at a really young age. He's shows that he's really intelligent and cunning. In one time travel Loop, Sara gets killed and CID becomes the Rainmaker... 

Because Sara is killed, this starts the first chain of evens in which Cid will invent time travel in order to prevent Sara's death in the past.

Time travel is outlawed, not because governments banned the technology, it's because the criminal organizations invented time travel first with the help of Cid. He uses his TK abilities to take over the cities, and his smarts to invent time travel. 

So why were Loopers created? Because Cid knows that a Looper killed his mother Sara and that's why he wants to end all the loops. By ending the loops, the Rainmaker can save Sara's life.

All the Loopers in the film are cleaned up. Old Joe kills them all at their head quarters, Joe kills himself and thus Old Joe is now gone. Which sets in motion the good version of CID growing up. We are lead to believe that CID will not grow up to be the Rainmaker, time travel will never needs to be invented by CID because Sara is now alive. Thus the universe corrects itself fixing all the paradoxes and messy things about Time Travel and at the end of the film, the future remains unwritten. 

Time Travel had to be invented in order for Time Travel to be rendered impossible. The definition of an object or event that must exist for it to not exist in the context of the film Looper, we'll call that a Loop.

I loved the film, everyone should go see it!

1372963373.0,107,self.FanTheories,1hnc2v,Wilfred: Ryan's father sexually abused his sister Kristen.,133,26,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1hnc2v/wilfred_ryans_father_sexually_abused_his_sister/,"It is very clear that Ryan's (Elijah Wood) relationship with his father is the main source of his issues. Ryan’s is always trying to get away from his father’s influence and is extremely paranoid about him trying to work his way back into his life. Ryan attempts to kill himself after quitting his job working for his father, and he is extremely reluctant to take any legal job after that. (“Happiness”). Ryan became known for using his “black files” to blackmail lawsuit opponents into allowing him to win (“Identity”). This is implied to be because of the unreasonable demands that his father placed on him in his job and his life. 

 Ryan’s father’s ways have infected his children. Kristen is extremely controlling and overbearing (more on this later). She is frequently hostile toward Ryan and others. She lies to him giving him sugar pills instead of the ones he asked for; this incidentally prevented him from succeeding in his suicide. Ryan himself is constantly manipulating people and hatching schemes to try to get his neighbor Jenna to like him, among other goals. These schemes are usually at Wilfred’s behest, but of course there are strong indications that Wilfred is a hallucination, so its likely that these ideas are all Ryan’s ideas. 

Wilfred is actually a delusion that Ryan has created in order to get away from his father’s abusive influence on his identity. Note that Ryan usually pretends to believe that Wilfred’s manipulative and dishonest ways are morally wrong, but then usually goes along with the plan anyway. These the same kinds of things- ""black file"" kind of things- that Ryan used to do for his father before he attempted suicide. He has built up so much self-hatred that tried to kill himself, but when that failed due to Kristen's deceit, he needed a new way to escape. Thus he now believes a talking dog gives him all his worst ideas, which he would have had no problem using before. He gets to pretend that he is not who he used to be. In ""Identity"" he explicitly embraces this part of himself to literally use a black file to get Jenna's job back and ruin Kristen's marriage. Bruce is the only other person who can see Wilfred. He and Bruce conspire to play a series of ridiculous games with the goal of getting Ryan to confront his father also, showing that Wilfred's existence is about not confronting his father. Finally, Ryan’s mother also sees a cat as a human being the way Ryan sees a dog. Ryan’s mother’s issues are very strongly implied to come from Ryan’s father’s abuse, to the point that when she gets upset she confuses Ryan for her father (“Don’t tell me what to do Henry!”) , suggesting that there are other family members who have mental health issues that respond  to the father’s abuse by creating delusions.  Note also that Amanda believes she talks to Wilfred too, although not in the same way as Ryan, and she is dealing with very serious delusions herself. Thus that rules out supernatural explanations. There is a consistent theme of pet-based delusions. I think any of the examples of Wilfred knowing things that Ryan didn't know are either things Ryan subconsciously did know, blind luck (since Wilfred is wrong sometimes), or even straight up red herrings for dramatic effect.

Okay, so Ryan’s father is an asshole but why does that mean he sexually abused Kristen? Throughout the show there multiple hints of incestuous vibes and misdirection of romantic involvement between family members. We already see that Ryan’s mother confuses her husband with her son. There is also an incestuous undertone between Ryan and his sister. She alternates between hostility toward Ryan and wanting him to take the place of the father of her child. She calls him on the phone and demands that he be present during the delivery of the baby.  In the episode “Suspicion” she gets uncomfortably specific about her sexuality with Ryan when talking about her date. Like the mother, she seems to confuse the role of her brother with that of a romantic partner. 

Ryan himself has purposely sabotaged two of Kristen’s relationships, and Wilfred points out in “Suspicion” that they do this to undercut each other’s relationships so the other one comes running back and they never have anyone else. Ryan also uses the same technique and repeatedly sabotages Jenna’s relationship with Drew on many occasions because he is in love with Jenna. He attempts to train and coddle Wilfred unnecessarily in order to please his high school crush who is a ""dog-weirdo"", despite that he believes it's creepy (""Sincerity""). Ryan consistently uses manipulation and deceit to get romantic partners. The fact that he does this to potential romantic partners and his sister suggests that he views them the same way on some leveel- ie, that he has romantic or sexual feelings for her. 

Ryan also ends up actually delivering the baby and Wilfred- the delusion that Ryan has created to place all his bad thoughts and feelings in- makes a joke about him having to look at his sister’s vagina. He is also made uncomfortable by having to see his sister’s breasts while breastfeeding. This is something many people might be uncomfortable with, but she is also sitting very close to him and makes no effort to hide or cover up despite that he is uncomfortable. Furthermore, many times siblings don’t care about seeing each other topless, so I think it’s a bit unusual that Ryan is so put off by this. This is another hint that in their relationship there is a confusion of family love with sexual feelings. 

This is extremely important because later in this very same episode (“Questions”), Ryan takes ayahuasca, and starts tripping. He meets a spirit guide and asks him who Wilfred really is. The spirit guide begins to take him on a journey and explains that everything Ryan sees, his mind has created. He sees two things in quick succession: black files hanging from the trees and his sister making out with Jenna. Black files represent the manipulation and blackmail that his father forced him to do throughout his life. His sister making out with Jenna represents his sexual feelings toward his sister that he represses, a literal representation of his commingling sexual and family love feelings. This image follows the black files (and I think at one point they are in the background of the makeout) because it represents the manipulative techniques he uses to keep women he wants close to him, sabotaging their relationships and manipulating them. It is also important that Wilfred is supposed to be Jenna’s dog, so this is another way in which he uses aspects of Jenna to misdirect his sexual feelings about his sister, yet another bad aspect of himself that he tries to believe is not part of him. Shortly after Ryan sees these images, the spirit guide is attempting to reveal to Ryan what Wilfred really is- and Wilfred kills the spirit guide and he investigates other personal questions. But this is an image that Ryan's mind created. Therefore Ryan will do anything to maintain the illusion that his incestuous feelings and his black file past are not part of him any more. 



This indicates to me that Kristen was sexually abused by the father. Kristen has had a series of unstable or tumultuous relationships with men, a classic symptom of sexual abuse at a young age. Her marriage was failing by the time the show started, and she ran away to India with her boss, only for him to leave her upon returning. Now we see she alternates between arguing with and making up with her brother, like with other men, yet another way in which she has him confused for a lover. In addition to Kristen being manipulative and controlling like her father, she seems to idolize him and goes along with his plans to get Ryan back into his life by getting him to babysit. In fact it was their father who was to babysit originally, so again the father is taking the place of baby’s father, then Ryan taking the place of the baby’s father and their own father - more incestuous hints. (""Sincerity). I’m not sure but I think this is a common element of denial of abuse victims, where instead of blaming the person who abused them they think of them as idealized and take everything out on other people. That would explain Kristen’s hostility toward every single person in her life except her father. We also have a mother who suffers from mental instability, and in the episode “Service” she apologizes to Ryan for “not being there” when Ryan needed her. She might be referring to generally being too crazy to be a good mother, but remember that later in this episode she in her craziness believes she is resisting Ryan’s father’s controllingness. Each member of the family clearly has issues with a domineering male authority, to the point of mental instability. Often I think when there is an abusive father, the father abuses the mother to the point that she becomes passive and she feels guilty about not protecting the children from the father. That would explain her apology and it would explain why Kristen was so against allowing the mother to be part of the baby’s life, even though Ryan is demonstrably irresponsible himself. She has misdirected the blame to her mother from her father. EDIT: Someone pointed out to me in the episode ""Delusion"" Kristen finds book ""Hop on Pop"" to be ""sick""...but what's sick about this classic children's book? Presumably she associates a child getting on top of the father with something sexual. Needless to say, that would be quite an unusual interpretation of that text. I wonder why she thinks this way.

In “Questions” we also see that Ryan blames himself for the family problems because his sister when they were little would always tell him stop crying which would make their father mad and the parents would start fighting again. Because of that whenever his sister now says stop crying he has panic attacks, because of his repressed sadness and guilt. So we see that Ryan is prone to repressing his feelings to the point of psychological emergencies like panic attacks, suicide, hallucinations and drug abuse (he smokes a lot of weed). We also see that Ryan has been having Wilfred delusions for some time because they are present in his childhood painting. Note that he made these paintings with his mother, who has pet delusions herself. Thus the same effect of abusing his mother into craziness, has happened to him, and actually she was the one who taught him to deal with his problems by pretending that their pets were their best friends.

 I believe that their father was sexually abusive towards at least Kristen, who is in extreme denial, and he either did it to Ryan too, or Ryan was witnessed it but like the mother he felt powerless to do anything about it. Witnessing it could lead to Ryan and Kristen's confusion about sexual/romantic feelings toward each other and for that reason I think Kristen may also have abused him as well because this is also common in abused children, is they repeat the behavior on other children. It would also explain Wilfred’s general distrust of Kristen. This is some fucked up shit for a comedy, but then this whole show is full of fucked up shit for comic effect. Edit: Or it might be possible given the blue barn that keeps reappearing in Ryan's artwork and other places that maybe he forced them to do sexual things to each other in this barn as children. See [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1hnc2v/wilfred_ryans_father_sexually_abused_his_sister/cb2nk0v) for more explanation.

TL;DR - Ryan’s father sexually abused Kristen and somehow Ryan became a victim of it as well. That leads their family to have completely messed up relationships including a brother sister relationship with incestuous undertones and that’s why Ryan is so crazy- he needs to have Wilfred to run away from his father’s messed up influence.

If someone could possibly find another source please link it in the comments.**

Everyone knows that the Temples in OoT are mainly based off of other types of building structures: Shadow Temple is a mausoleum, Fire Temple a jail, Spirit Temple a shrine of worship. So what is the Forest Temple? And what can we extrapolate about the Forest Temple (FT from now on)?

Immediately entering the area of the Sacred Meadow directly outsid the FT, we see high stone walls. Walking into the actual FT, we are inside the walls, but still outside a large building. In the center of the building, the main room, are branches to all other rooms in the building. In the back, there are two courtyards where you can even see the sky and more high walls away from the building. Deep inside the FT, the boss lair looks like a parlor. Judging from the building's defense structure, courtyards, a sewage system, and hidden location in the woods, the FT was most likely a castle.

However, now it is an abandoned castle, a haunted, abandoned castle. Why might this be so?

Considering Hyrule's bloody history, written all over the torture chambers in the Shadow Temple, it makes me believe that a great atrocity happened at the FT. The FT is situated in the far back of the forest, hidden deep away. It was most likely a final stronghold against invaders. After invaders got through the Lost Woods, they had to go through a small maze in the Sacred Meadow, most likely some sort of defensive measure. Indeed, a portcullis can even bar off the maze, trapping invaders within, forcing them to reach the FT. Guards of the FT, from the higher ground gained by the ladder could snipe off victims in the maze.

If invaders somehow broke through, they'd have to enter a narrow passage. More archers at the top could snipe away enemies and only a few guards could tackle on huge armies and still successfully defend (think 300). When all else failed, the actual FT is on yet even higher ground, with stairs (crumbled now) to reach it. Higher ground is always more advantage, especially for defense.

Thus, I feel that the FT is a castle, although more precisely a stronghold as a final defense. Inside, there are fine carpets, many rooms, a fairly relaxing courtyard (if monsters weren't around). This makes me believe that nobility or royalty used the FT as a final stand against invaders, and that they hid here.

However, the FT is now destroyed mostly; perhaps the invaders made it into the FT. That would explain some of the crumbling architecture. Moreso, if invaders actually made it into the FT, everyone inside was most likely slaughtered. This probably explains the ghosts and ghouls and inhabit the FT now, remnants of people's souls, lingering in the FT, wanting revenge. Eventually, they even obtained magic as they aged, creating twisting corridors, falling ceilings, and a rotatable superstructure, without even destroyed the upper buildings.

Perhaps that rotatable superstructure was designed before. There are many rooms below, hidden behind the thick walls, shut off by bars. Perhaps this superstructure was always there, and that basement was a jail. Perhaps then, the parlor was actually a high class torture chamber, where the nobles would entertain themselves with the screams of victims.

This isn't a unique theory, but hear me out:  This was specifically a cocoon/egg.  In the part where they are investigating the thing, you can see something inside of the ""egg"".  This thing is an alien larva/baby.  This alien was waiting for another living creature to come so that they could complete their growth cycle.  Sensing the boys presence, the creatures come out and infest the boys.  Over the course of the movie the creatures grow stronger and mature inside of them, thus enhancing their powers.  Steve and Matt resisted the alien well; however, Andrew could not.  The alien inside of him matured much faster, giving Andrew more powerful abilities.  In the end the creature corrupted Andrew completely, taking over his mind and causing him to go insane.  

Another bit of information regarding the alien:  it is weak to electricity.  That's why, in many scenes of the movie, the boy's powers seem to run out when they are hit with elecricity.

[SPOILERS],132,25,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/ux24x/scott_pilgrim_vs_the_world_scotts_battles_against/,"This theory is based on the movie ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World,"" and (mostly) has nothing to do with the graphic novel series(Since the Katayanagi Twins are barely in the movie, I utilize their appearance in the comics as my backup).

Simple enough theory:  Scott's battles with the 7 members of the League of Evil Exes each represent one of the 7 Deadly Sins.  At one point Wallace even refers to them as the ""7 Deadly Exes.""

Scott's first battle is against Matthew Patel, who's deadly sin is Pride.  His entrance into their fight is flashy and over-the-top.  He incorporates a whole song and dance number into the fight and dresses like he's in a boy band, both things which seem to work against him during their battle. He is enraged when he discovers Scott does not take him seriously, making fun of his clothes and not even bothering to read his e-mail.

Lucas Lee embodies the deadly sin of Sloth.  He is the only member of the league who doesn't bother to track down Scott, instead he just sort of runs into him by happy accident.  Half the fight is fought by his numerous stunt doubles while Lucas goes to hang out in his trailer, drink coffee, and text.  When he actually does fight Scott, it's clear Lucas is much stronger, but doesn't bother to do any major damage.  He acts fairly disinterested in the whole ordeal.  He's also a skater, which is a past-time that (traditionally) has some slacker connotations to it.  He is defeated after he decides he'd rather skate than finish off Scott, and bails on a big grind.  Any dedicated skater would've gotten up and hopped back on the board.

Scott's third battle is against Todd Ingram, who represents Gluttony.  Todd's telepathic powers derive from his vegan diet.  He is clearly a very high power telepath, indicating he must have upheld his non-animal product regiment very strictly.  We know while he was dating Ramona he punched a hole in the moon for her, so clearly he was immensely strong to begin with, even by the SP universe's standards.  Todd is essentially a glutton for power.  His downfall ends up being his new-found fame, and the decadent temptations of non-vegan cuisine that go along with it.  A chicken parmesan here, a gelatto there (""milk and eggs, bitch.""), and his third strike:  The imbibement of half and half due to the trickery of Scott.

Fourth in the league is Roxy Richter, who's deadly sin is Lust.  Roxy is the only female evil ex, and the only one Scott refuses to fight.  The reason why may be as simple as he doesn't want to hit a girl, but it seems deeper than that.  Everything about the exchange between Roxy, Ramona, and Scott seems very sexually charged.  When Roxy reveals her past with Ramona to Scott, the look Roxy gives him, the raised eyebrow, the smile...they all seem very flirtatious, especially for a lesbian interacting with a straight man.  It's clear that Scott is very threatened by this (""You had a sexy phase?""), to the point that he can't even defend himself against Roxy.  Ramona ends up having to essentially fight this battle for Scott, and while she defends his honor he can still sense the chemistry between them, and is still paralyzed with fear.  Roxy's entire strategy seems to revolve around creating a rift between Scott and Ramona, so much so she even teleports between them and physically separates them.  Even her defeat is highly sexual:  seemingly a GIANT orgasm.  

Five and Six on the list are the Katayanagi Twins.  They are severely glossed over in the movie in the interest of time, so for this write-up I refer to the graphic novel versions of the brothers.  The Katayanagis represent the deadly sins of Envy and Anger, collectively.  They fight as a unit, because they were once turned against each other when Ramona cheated on one twin with the other.  Not only do they fight Scott physically, but psychologically as well, by trying to convince Scott that Ramona will one day leave him as she has the other exes in the league.  They also kidnap Kim to lure Scott into their trap, and in doing so they stir up feelings of jealousy in Ramona.  Their technique of making Scott and Ramona angry and jealous works extremely well, until Kim lies and convinces them that Ramona is cheering Scott on via text message, displaying Ramona has the ability to change.  

The final boss of the League, Gideon Graves, is the avatar of the deadly sin Greed.  G-Man is a ridiculously popular indie music producer, and operator of several nightclubs in the US.  During their relationship, Ramona says she felt more lonely with Gideon than she ever did when she was single.  This seems to signify that Gideon treated her as mere arm candy, while Ramona had developed real feelings for him.  After she leaves Gideon, he goes through a lot of trouble to form the League of Evil Exes (like, two hours worth) for the sole purpose of keeping anyone else from ever dating Ramona.  He has money, power, and fame; he could have any girl he wants.  But the one girl who escaped him...a girl who he didn't even seem to particularly like in the first place...he couldn't let go.  He had to have that too.

So bam, there it is.  It's not perfect, and I know the whole 7 deadly sins thing has been done with a bunch of other movies, but I hope you guys enjoy it.

This would explain why they didn't intervene during the Mandarin terrorist crisis. Extremis has the potential to turn anyone into a nearly unstoppable soldier. S.H.I.E.L.D could use it to create an undefeatable army to protect Earth against any alien threat.

As seen in The Avengers, S.H.I.E.L.D is willing to do whatever it takes to protect Earth. They planned to use the Tesserect to create weapons of mass destruction. Nick Fury even said when the world is at stake, he is very desparate.

In Iron Man 3, Killian manages to obtain a lot of funding for his whole plot. At the start of the movie, he was visibly poorer, but with plenty of potential. S.H.I.E.L.D may have been watching Tony Stark, even a decade ago. Perhaps after Tony denied Killian the funding, S.H.I.E.L.D stepped in to grant Killian's wish.

This would explain the immense amount of funding he had later on, which he used to commit terrorist acts on the world.

Temple Run (1 and 2) seems like a fairly simple game at the first look: you run away  from monsters after stealing a treasure in an ancient temple. However, there are some things that will make you wonder what's really going on. For instance, why does the temple layout change for each time you play? How can your character make 5 90 degrees turns to the left or right in a row without returning to the track they came from? Who where those who built the temple and what did they worship? What exactly are the monsters that chase you? What is so valuable about the idol? Keep in mind that this is my first post here at r/fantheories, so bare with me. (brace yourself, it will be a long read, I'm sorry)




To begin, let's look at the symbol that can be seen in many places around the running track of the temple (under the idol: http://i2.cdnds.net/13/03/618x1098/gaming-temple-run-2-screenshot-1.jpg). The symbol looks awfully similar to the sign of infinity that is today used in e.g. physics and math (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_symbol). Sure, the symbol may have a very different meaning in the culture of the temple's creators, but judging from that the shape of the symbol doesn't really have an end and just creates infinite loops, infinity is highly likely to be what the symbol represents. Now, what else about the temple could possibly be about infinity? The temple itself. The adventurers who run away from the monsters will just keep running until they are killed, there is no end to the temple.



But how could someone possibly build an infinite temple? The answer is: they didn't. The only thing about about the temple's design that exist at the moment is the place you're currently standing on, what will lie ahead isn't defined until the adventurer runs there, nor is the path behind you left once you run past it. This explains why you can make five left turns in a row without returning to the first path you came from, because the path you came from isn't there  anymore. It also explains why the layout of the temple changes for each time you run. But who decides what path-pieces will spawn? The one holding the idol.



Here is where it might get weird. The idol (the golden artifact you steal) isn't just some golden piece worth lots of cash, it's an item of tremendous power. The one wielding it can perform feats like no other human can: they have infinite stamina (they can run faster than any human for an eternity, they can leap great distances and so on), they can use telekinesis (attract coins), they can become invulnerable for a period of time (shield and sprint), they can return to life by absorbing the power of the green gems, and so on. These are all abilities that your character have in the game. However, there is one ability that stands above the rest: the power to create. The one wielding the idol (I will call him/her ""The Architect"" from now on) is the one that essentially creates/designs the temple, which explains why the temple is infinite. On top of that, the idol can also ""save"" the design of anything it has created in the past and reuse it later, which explains why the temple is now in pieces (because all the parts have already been used). In other words, The Architect is basically a god. So why didn't those who initially owned the idol just establish a world domination? Well, there is one setback with the idol: the demon monkeys.



The demon monkeys are certainly connected with the idol in some way. They both have an unknown origin, but appears to not be from our world. The monkeys, just like The Architect, seems to have infinite stamina, but unlike The Architect, they seem to be immortal. Their purpose is to hunt the Architect and kill him, perhaps to prevent anyone from using the idol, and they will not stop for anything. If there is a way to kill them, we don't know it yet.




Based on this concept, this is what I believe happened with the society that built the temple (I'll call them the predecessors):

The predecessors lived in South/Central America (I base that on the fact that you can play as a conquistador in the first temple) a long time ago. They discovered the idols (I assume there are more than one since there is one in each temple apparently), discovered their power and discovered the curse (the demon monkeys). They brought them back to their capital to study them further. Although they wanted to use it for their own needs, they didn't dare because they knew they couldn't stop the demon monkeys. After decades, a legend is born: that there will one day be a chosen one, destined to find a way to kill the demon monkeys. This one will be their god among men, and only he/she is the rightful wielder of the idol. The legend caused much stir, and it was eventually acknowledged by the authorities. If the legend was true, then they would have a chance to become unstoppable. The temples are then established, to find one who may be this chosen one. To do so, they trained Architects to run away from the monkeys (the only way to not be killed instantly) and to create their own running track. The tracks are filled with traps, such as flames, rivers, spikes, sharp turns and so on, as an attempt to kill the monkeys. Of course, using the idol isn't something that is particularly easy for the first time, but by using the green gems, the apprentices could return to life and keep practicing and eventually get better and better at it. Until the Architects learned how to create,  they simply had to use parts made by other Architects in the past. Watching the Architects run the ""Temple Run"" would eventually become similar to watching a fight between gladiators in Rome. Time went by, and the predecessors never found the chosen one, and their civilization became forgotten (for reasons we don't know).



Centuries later, the conquistador Francisco Montoya (the character from the first Temple Run) discovers the Idol, and without realizing it begin a Temple Run. Since he has no training, he can't create his own paths, but has to use parts made by others in the past. Needless to say, he dies, but by using a green gem he survives to tell the tale. Centuries after that, Montana Smith (""the second greatest explorer ever"", he seems to be inspired by Indiana Jones to say the least, so I'll assume he's an archeologist) makes some research and discover Francisco's legend. Further research, some exploring and translation of ancient texts/glyphs, and he knows enough about the idol to actually localize it. In fact, he knows so much about it that he can create his own paths (which is why there are minecarts in Temple Run 2, he created them), unlike Francisco. Some decades later, Montana Smith's adventure brings attention. Freelancers and other explorers start to take interest, which is why we play as Guy Dangerous. Guy Dangerous and the others obviously have little to none training with the idol, so they have to use path parts created by others before them (which is why the temple is in ruins). It's obvious that he and the other adventurers are in it for money/fame/power, but Zach Wonder (the football star) don't seem like the kind of person to search ancient treasures. Perhaps he was hired by some company that wants the idol.



TL;DR: The one wielding the idol is the one who creates the running track.

So, the album is about a guy, who [""likes songs about drifters, books about the same.""](http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858500298/) He wants to get away from where he is, so he ""walks on off to another day,"" and learns to [Float On.](http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858489513/)

Then there's this girl. He tells her that she's wasting her life. That he needs her in his life. That he's [""Gonna carry carry you in, in my head, in my heart in my soul.""](http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858489060/) They date for a while, and even though the relationship isn't good for either of them (They're digging their graves), they decide to get married. [They exchange vows... and this is the end of his free lifestyle... ""The suit got tight and it split at the seams""...""Well as sure as planets come, I know that they end""... He's just collected life's pay cheque and feels like he deserves more.](http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858488891/)

He gets angry. ""Well I'll let you win the argument if things still go my way."" She's pissed because all he wants to do is [*Dance Hall*](http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858492514/) everyday. As an outlet, he turns to drugs: ""I'm gonna give myself a shot, I could get myself a shot, I'm gonna go and try to buy a little more time to kill.""

[He then starts to see his life has gone to shit. He question's God's intentions. ""If God controls the land and disease, and keeps a watchful eye on me, if he's really so damn, mighty, well my problem is I can't see... well who would want to be such a control freak""](http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858489932/)

[He falls into depression. He becomes detached emotionally from his wife and they continue to bicker. He feels like she's left him emotionally: ""All the folks I know are gone."" He starts acting weird... he starts seeing himself as ""My own damn God."" He feels superior to those around him.](http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858489931/)
Then comes [*The View*.](http://www.metrolyrics.com/the-view-lyrics-modest-mouse.html) This song is the climax of the album. The man and woman get in an argument. They are yelling back and forth. Screaming at each other. At some point, he says something he wishes later he could take back. He's full of bliss (or shit, if you don't like Isaac Brock's poetic anecdote). He becomes fixed right wehere he stands... he sees his wife laying on the carpet... like she's [*Satin In A Coffin*](http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858489934/)

He wishes he could take back what he said, even though he assured that he believed what he was saying (""yeah, right now, but not that often""). A part of him is wondering if she's alive, but in his mental state he hopes she's dead. He told her to kill herself. She obliged. He is his own damn god. Muh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

Here he is, a widower with nothing but drugs in his life, and this notion that he is a gift to mankind. Then you hear the laughter. This man has a child. Milo. He has something, someone to live for, and he realizes what he's done.

He tries to defer the blame. [""Blame it on the tetons, Yeah I need a scapegoat now...""](http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858492519/) He eventually blames himself and falls into the same habits. ""Blame it all on me cause... God, I need a cold one now."" He also blames society for making him this way. He comes to the conclusion that ""Everyone's a building burning, with no one to put the fire out"" No one can help him. So he drinks.

In [*Black Cadillacs*](http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858489933/), he is trying to put together what happened... ""we were done, done done with all the fuck fuck fuckin' around"" We get a bit more on the argument which ended his wife's life.. ""You were so true to yourself. You were true to no one else. Well I should put you in the ground."" She lied to him about something. He threatened her. This is not good.

He comes to grips that he's to blame ""I didn't die and I ain't complaining... I ain't blaming you. I didn't know that the words you said to me meant more to me than they ever could you. I didn't lie and I ain't sayin' I told the whole truth. I didn't know that this game we were playin' even had a set of rules.""

He's moved on. He realizes that he needs to live on, because we have but [*One Chance*](http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858492524/). He's still on drugs, but he realizes how much his remaining family and friends mean to him ""My friends, my habits, my family, they mean so much to me."" He also feels like a ""Box in a cage.."" he tried to run away, but there's no escaping what he's done and the guilt he feels. He continues on his dangerous cycles... until he realises that, ""Hey, [*The Good Times Are Killing Me*](http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858490940/)"" and he gives up the drugs once and for all.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,1347118205.0,,,True,t3_zjihb,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/zjihb/the_good_times_are_killing_me_fan/,

Bruce Lee developed the One-Inch Punch and Jeet Kun Do after a lifetime of study.

Goku is the best martial artist in all of fiction and thus develops his own moves. The Kamehameha Wave was once solely a beam of blue energy, but Goku modified it to make came up Instant Transmission Kamehameha , was able to use Kamehameha to rocket himself from one place to another, was able to pull on it to make it bend, make the 10x Kamehameha Wave, etc.

The Super Saiyan form turns Goku in a super fighter for pretty much as long as he wants. As he grew in strength, he tinkered with the form and found new uses for this ability like he did with other moves in his arsenal.

SSJ2 is what a saiyan gets when they doubled the output of energy while decreasing the maximum time they can spend in said form. (Gohan got this first and Goku built on it from there.)

Goku kept experimenting with the energy output of SSJ1, until he got SSJ3. This form puts out a lot more energy but costs a lot more to manage. Goku can hardly stay in that form at all because it costs so much energy, actually damaging his body in the process.

SSJ4 is a bit different. It requires going Super Saiyan as the Great Ape. But regardless, it is using the SSJ form in a different way, modifying it to keep up with new challenges and so that it doesn't harm his body while using it.

The SSJ form is supposed to be the big dream of Saiyans. I’ve never liked the multiple forms after SSJ1 because (to me) it felt like SSJ1 became useless as the show went on.

The same could also be said for Plankton, who runs a business that makes no profit and yet he never goes bankrupt. So what explains this?

 After nuclear testing was done in the area, Bikini Bottom became nearly uninhabitable. Only a small number remained. With few people wanting to stay, property prices and the cost of living drastically dropped. The people who stayed could easily afford to buy huge areas of land for miniscule amounts of money. The city seems to be recovering but it wasn't just the bomb that caused people to stay away either. Bikini Bottom is constantly under threat, whether it's from Alaskan Bull Worms to getting shrunk by Mermaid Man's Belt.This is why prices continue to stay low and Squidward could easily afford a house in a gated community while still working his shitty job.

1350949106.0,103,self.FanTheories,11wsoz,Donnie Darko was dead before the movie even started.,142,39,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/11wsoz/donnie_darko_was_dead_before_the_movie_even/,"I watched Donnie Darko the other day and had this theory about it, I saw an older post that touched on this theory a bit but I would like to expand on it.  Also, First post!

When people die, sometimes they are too heavily linked to earth by something they wanted to experience more than anything but weren't able to, and so sometimes they're given a chance to relive their final days to try and experience what they're missing.  But, as they explain, this second chance gives the individual the opportunity to go against what the inevitable set of events will be therefore changing the future.  They say that if you travel within God's channel, you could see into the future, and that's precisely what happens, leaving those given this opportunity the ability to go against God's plan.

In Donnie's case, he was killed by a jet engine while he slept and felt he was taken before he was able to accomplish what he believes to be the end all be all point of existence, love, or more specifically sex.  Donnie has relationships in his life but none that he considers to be true love, he doesn't feel close to his parents or siblings, more just roommates than a family, and he doesn't care too much for his friends, more just people to pass the time with.  The only relationship he hasn't experienced is a romantic one and so, in his mind, he believes that this type of relationship will give him that connection to another person that he feels he hasn't yet experienced.

Obviously it's deeper than just sex, he makes that clear when he talks about his dog, the only thing on earth he ever felt a connection to, however, when his dog went to die by himself he felt that the relationship was one sided and therefore not genuine.  The only alternative would be the love of a significant other and the most clear display of mutual love in that sense would be sex and so he fixates on it.  He shows this when he's hypnotized and refuses to talk about anything other than his sexual fantasies to the point that he even begins masturbating, which mean he thinks of virtually nothing else in a positive light in his normal day to day.  He also shows it when he is explaining his theory on the Smurfs and says ""what's the point of living if you don't have a dick"", this shows that the only way to be sure love is mutual is to have sex and being unable to have sex would mean there would be no way to be sure it was true love.  He also shows it by asking Gretchen out after talking to her only one time, he knows she thinks he's cute and feels like finally he will feel the love he has missed out on.  

So donnie dies without having felt true love and as a result thinks that he was taken too early and is given an opportunity by the deity in his universe to relive the last month of his life under the terms that he will be able to try and accomplish what he is missing and see for himself if that gives him the peace of mind he feels he needs.  The condition, though, is that now he knows when and how he will die so he is faced with a decision to accept his fate, or rewrite fate with whatever consequences that entails.  His teacher Dr. Monnatov says it to Donnie when he tells him that if you could see the future, you could choose not to act the way you're destined to, making predetermined fate not exist.  

So the movie begins with Donnie having already died in the normal time stream and plops him on top of that cliff showing where he needs to return, should he choose to.  The movie then continues and uses Frank as sort of a conduit to help accomplish anything he desires, but he also acts as a guide, reminding him that he has a finite amount of time to make a decision.  And like I said earlier, he asks Gretchen out after speaking to her once, he knows he doesn't have a lot of time but he knows she thinks he's cute and so she's as good of a choice as any to have sex with and feel what he needs to feel.  But to his dismay, they don't have sex right away and don't even have any physical interaction for two weeks and he grows more and more frustrated until finally he just comes out and says ""it's been two weeks and we haven't even..."" now what I believe he was going to say was ""haven't even had sex"" but he realizes she would be upset by that so he stops and she finishes with ""you want to kiss me?"".  Now, it isn't exactly what he had in mind but it's a start so without another word he dives in to kiss her only for her to stop him, frustrating him more, but does allow him to understand it isn't something you can force.  

So because he isn't able to have sex and he realizes that it won't happen as quick as he wants, he starts doing other things he has always wanted to do because he knows he won't have to face the consequences if he doesn't want to.  And like a lot of kids his first target for revenge is his school, he doesn't feel appreciated and feels that they need to be punished for their apathy by flooding the school and writing ""they made me do it"" in spray paint as a message to the school that their inability to even try and relate or treat him well left him with no choice but to react in a destructive way.  And he justifies this through the story ""the destructors"", if destruction is a form of creation than destroying the water main could create awareness of the bad behavior on the side of the administration.  

His next target is a motivational speaker, another adult who refuses to help on an individual basis and instead has these blanket answers that are good enough for anyone but are so poorly developed that they really don't help at all.  He has been raised with this mentality his whole life, when he acts out, his parents put him in therapy.  His therapist sees issues and immediately puts him on drugs.  That doesn't solve the problem? Try more drugs and hypnosis.  His whole life he has felt like a burden to the adults he interacts with and feels that not one adult has made a genuine effort to just try talking to him and see what's going on in his head.  He even almost gets that type of relationship with Dr. Monnatov when he is able to speak to him about time travel.  But Dr. Monnatov, like all adults, lets him down by stopping the conversation because continuing it could cost him his job.  Donnie doesn't interact with him after that because that was the last attempt he would ever make to try and relate to an adult because even when he feels a connection with one, he gets let down again.  

This anger comes to fruition when he burns down Jim Cunninghams house to try and send a message that it doesn't matter how successful you may seem to be in understanding and helping children, but at the end of the day you're only stroking your ego and not getting anything accomplished, you might as well be fucking those children for all the good you're doing.  Which, as it turns out, he was, which only infuriates Donnie more because not only is Jim Cunningham a fraud and represents everything he hates about adults, but he's also experiencing what Donnie wants more than anything.

And throughout all of this extracurricular activity he begins to develop an actual relationship with Gretchen and truly care for her, something that becomes more and more attractive to him even to the point of possibly choosing not to live up to his end of the bargain and die when he should.  Those feelings begin to fade when he starts to learn about Roberta Sparrow.  The way she acts and the things she knows make it clear to Donnie that she is just like him, someone who died too early and was given a second chance, but unlike Donnie, her time was up and she had chosen to stay and not accept her fate and so she remained, wealthy, but ultimately a ghost walking the earth haunted by her decision.  

As a nun she died without ever being able to have or raise children and was sent back to be able to experience that, so in her second chance she quit the church, became a science teacher, and tried to fulfill her greatest desire.  However, interacting with the children she taught either didn't satisfy her, or more likely, satisfied her to the point of being unable to give it up once she had it.  And so, she chose not to die and was forced to live with her choice which meant the children she cared for eventually not caring at all for her and even robbing her of her wealth when they could, her perfect life turned sour and it left her a hollow shell to die alone.  

The story comes to a climax when they have their Halloween party and Donnie is able to have sex with Gretchen.  Finally he is able to partake in what he believed to be the only reason to live but interestingly, when he does he realizes that the sex was a byproduct of the love, not a determinant of love.  He realized he loved her with or without the sex and for the first time understands that sex is not as important as the connection and love is more abstract than he imagined.  Sadly though, he knows his time is almost up and he knows through the example set by Roberta Sparrow that his fate is sealed and holding on to this happiness will inevitably turn sour and leave him to die alone.  Even though he feels true and genuine love, he won't be able to live out his life with this love because like Roberta, his destiny has already come full circle and staying when he should go will mean he can't sustain this happiness. 

Even the music playing, ""Love will tear us apart"" by Joy Division, as he walks down the stairs shows his decision.  It's his love for her that will tear them apart, it's the love he feels that won't allow him to selfishly stay on earth longer than he should because it's finally not all about him and there is a greater purpose at hand and that purpose is doing whatever is necessary to give her the best future possible, meaning of course that her future will be without him.  Knowing that if he were able to stay she would love him as deeply as he loves her was good enough.  So time comes and he becomes driven to do what he now knows he needs to do.  The only hiccup he runs into is being held at knife point by his school bullies, but they become distracted by Franks car and Donnie says ""Dues ex Machina"", meaning he sees divine intervention, specifically Frank, who won't allow him to die in that way because that isn't how it supposed to happen, so the bullies leave, gretchen dies, Frank gets shot and becomes able to be Donnie's guide, and Donnie is able to save everyone and not give into the selfish temptation of trying to stay on earth longer than he should.  

So he admits his fate, dies, and we get a small glimpse into what life will be like for those around him based on his sacrifice.  Gretchen is safe, his family is safe, and life can go on.  The only thing remaining is an echo of that now non-existent time stream manifested in the dreams of those involved.

I assumed she was out for blood like the rest of her family, but if I put aside the fact that she's a Buckner and a zombie and just judge her based on her actions, I realize there's no reason to suspect her of bloodlust. On the contrary, her diary entry indicates that she doesn't enjoy torture like the rest of her family, and she never actually attacks anyone except the director, who was trying to kill Marty at the time. Patience could have been trying to save Marty as easily as trying to kill him or the director, and I'm inclined to believe the former because Patience didn't harm anyone before that point, not even Dana when she was completely vulnerable.

Since I was already familiar with zombies, I automatically applied my a priori zombie knowledge to the Buckners. They must be mindless, soulless, and hungry, right? But the truth is, the Buckners aren't even regular zombies; they're a pain-obsessed redneck zombie family, which Sitterson said is an entirely different species, like the difference between an elephant and an elephant seal. When he said that, I dismissed it as comic pedantry (zombies are zombies, right?), but my reaction could be seen as prejudice. And in fact, the Buckners are quite different from most zombies, aren't they? They use weapons and seem to relish torture rather than just trying to kill and feed. I inaccurately stereotyped the Buckners by lumping them in with other zombies, just as I inaccurately stereotyped Patience by lumping her in with her family (you can't help who you're born to).

Pigeon-holing people seems to be an important part of Cabin In the Woods, with the covert organization trying to assign archetypical roles to the protagonists (the virgin, fool, whore, athlete, and scholar). (EDIT: They also pigeon-hole their stable of monsters, separating them neatly into storage cubes.) Marty tried to have more integrity than the people running the show, but maybe he ended up pigeon-holing Patience and making a kind of virgin sacrifice out of her (into the ""volcano""!). Maybe Marty was a bit of a fool after all, engaging in prejudice and self-serving violence while thinking himself above it all. Maybe all of us who judged Patience unfairly are fools.

But, what if the movie *really* show us the real fate of Precious? Before you crucify me, read carefully. One of the trademarks of ""Precious"" are the ""dream sequences"" where she sees herself as a big star, in red carpets, photo sessions, filiming videos and stuff. We are compelled to believe this scenes are what Precious imagine when something really bad happen to her (which is very often), but I have another idea- These scenes are actually *flashforwards* of Precious' future.

Is that ridiculous? Not so much. When Precious talk about herself, she never points that she dream about being a star, singer or actress, she dreams about having a boyfriend or being a skinny white girl. In a key scene she sees herself in the mirror as that skinny white girl. If Precious wanna be a skinny white girl, why doesn't she see herself like that in her ""dream sequences""? Because they're not dream sequences, they are scenes of Precious' future. 

She's endured a extremely hard life, and she's got what it takes to succeed, even with the fact she's sick. About the AIDS? Well, it's not rare that people with AIDS live 20 or 25 years after the diagnosis, and in some cases they've lived even longer. There are rumours about some HIV-Positive Hollywood Stars.

1361551323.0,103,self.FanTheories,1910ot,Super Smash Bros. Explained,174,71,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1910ot/super_smash_bros_explained/,"So the official explanation behind SSB is that the characters are all basically 8mm minis that come to life to beat each other up on stages that come from...Somewhere, and the end boss is just a giant novelty glove or something.  I thought it'd be more entertaining to figure out how these worlds might actually be connected to one another.

First off, freebies: The Mario, Yoshi, and Wario series' all clearly take place within the Mushroom World.  The series have the same basic enemies, cross over with one another very regularly, and have very similar settings, so they're just in the same place.  Donkey Kong could also be lumped in here, but as I worked on the theory I realized that he was better off somewhere else, because while he shows up to race go-karts with Mario and the gang semi-regularly, his main interaction with Mario (the original Donkey Kong games) is in a different world and he doesn't really share any enemies or major setting notes with the Mushroom World.

Now, crossovers which require a little bit of speculation, but not much.  First off, it is easy to imagine Metroid and F-Zero as occurring within the same universe, mostly because the greater setting of Metroid isn't given a whole lot of detail.  We mostly know about the military, some pirates, and various backwater planets full of things for Samus to blow up.  It's likewise easy to imagine Animal Crossing as taking place in the same world as Star Fox, just a century or two earlier (although getting Fox McCloud into the Animal Crossing time will require some shenanigans).  Finally, Electroplankten, Ice Climbers, and Pikmin can both be set for free on almost any earthlike world, so I'm going to give them to the world of EarthBound, henceforth known as Mother World.

Here is where we start going a bit more out on a limb.  The Three Golden Goddesses of the Legend of Zelda created Hyrule together, but they've also each created a world of their own.  Din, goddess of fire (among other things), has of course created the world of Fire Emblem.  Farore, goddess of wind, creates the world of Kid Icarus, where she is championed by Palutena, the Queen of Light, who is basically a cheap knock-off of the reincarnating Princess Zelda, and Kid Icarus, who is a hero on par with Link because both Link and Kid Icarus draw their power from the Triforce of Courage, created by Farore.  Finally, Nayru, goddess of water, love, wisdom, and the space-time continuum, created the Sacred Realm, which Link and Zelda interact with a lot.  It is corrupted by Ganondorf into the Dark World at...Some point along the Zelda timeline, which is a confused mess that I won't get into right now.  The three golden goddesses can transition people between the main world of Hyrule and their own personal worlds basically at-will, which means anywhere Link can go, Marth and Kid Icarus can follow (if the goddesses permit it, at least).  Also Mario totally went to the Dark World once.  In Yoshi's Safari he totally goes into a place called the Dark World which is a dark mirror of reality, and he caps bitches there until it becomes sacred again.  That actually happened and it's why Zelda has a shrine to him in Ocarina of Time, and by going into the Dark Realm and then following it back out into the greater Mushroom World, Link likewise ends up chilling in an inn during the first Super Mario RPG.  Both of these are actual easter eggs.

Now, Kirby's world is referred to as Dream Land and is fairly similar to Mushroom World in its wonky physics and bizarre cast of characters, but distinct in that there are no overlapping enemies really.  You know what else fits that description?  Subcon of SMB2-USA.  Since it was originally a wholly different game palette-swapped to have Mario and co. as the protagonists, it has exclusively new enemies not from the Mushroom World, though a few like Birdo and Shy Guy would eventually migrate there (although where Shy Guys originated from is actually kind of questionable, since they also show up in Yoshi's Island, which in-universe pre-dates SMB2-USA by a lot).  So Kirby's Dream World is actually the same place as Mario's Subcon, and you can get back and forth with relatively trivial dream magic.

Mother World is already playing host to a couple of different series' besides just EarthBound, but we're far from finished with that one.  First of all, Ice Climbers takes place in Mother World as established, and is a platformer game where various enemies vaguely similar to real world animals try to murder you while you attempt to accomplish a relatively mundane task.  So it's obviously in the same basic genre as Mario Bros. and indeed, Mario Bros. and every other pre-SMB Mario game takes place in Mother World.  This includes most prominently the Donkey Kong games, which means DK is also hanging out on Mother World.  Which means Mother World is home to a bunch of talking apes and crocodiles, which is seriously not any weirder than what already shows up in EarthBound.  Also there are warp pipes that connect the Mushroom World and Mother World; Mario Bros' is totally about Mario and Luigi finding those things.

Mother World has been hit by a bizarre plague, however, and as such is home to several Quarantine Zones.  These Zones are an ultimately futile effort to contain the plague that result in self-contained but hyper-advanced societies not really connected with one another, hence why there's not really any cultural cross-pollination with one another.  Donkey Kong and all other apes infected with their strain of the anthropomorph disease are quarantined in the Jungle Quarantine Zone.  Not because of infection vectors, because their strain of the disease is actually completely benign and research into them could potentially produce a cure that will stop the entire world save Madagascar from being devoured by plague.  No, the apes are contained there because in the Game Boy version of Donkey Kong the original DK (known later as Cranky Kong) went on a rampage through no less than 8 different areas including a city and an airplane, thus putting a strain on human-ape relations a bit.  All DKC games take place within this quarantine zone, which is gargantuan.  Like, it's an entire small continent and the quarantine is probably kind of leaky.

The Animal Crossing Quarantine Zone is there to contain the strain of the anthropomorph disease that turns humans into anthropomorphized animals.  It has a 90% mortality rate, leaving the zone with a low population and a primarily rural society made up of people who've been animals since basically forever (people who can remember back before the disease hit are mostly dead, as it's been around for like 70 years).  Some people happen to be immune and thus end up being regular humans.  The way demographics work, these people are pretty much always from the city, where there's ""racial"" tension between those who are immune and those who aren't (as well as between people of different animal strains).  It's pretty common for human purebloods to move to the countryside where there's not much prejudice, and due to the vastly smaller population, pretty rare for pureblood humans to be born there normally.

Finally there is the Pokemon Quarantine Zone, where an attempt to cure the anthropomorph disease instead resulted in it mutating basically all animal wildlife into Pokemon.  This was initially an apocalyptic disaster, hence the establishment of the quarantine zone, but once the ecosystem adapted and the Professors figured out how to plug an Electabuzz into a power plant and turn a few pounds of food a day into enough electricity to run a city block, thus also resulting in the invention of things like lemonade that heals evisceration and infinite instantaneous automagical healthcare, the Pokemon ""quarantine zone"" is actually more advanced than the rest of the world and is kept quarantined basically only because it's always been that way.

Eventually, the quarantines on Mother World would fall, the different plagues would spread, resulting in devastating loss of life to the Animal Crossing strain of the anthropomorph plague and a devastating Pokemon war that would reduce the entire planet to a lifeless husk.  Mario, having originated from this planet, is not amused.  And he sets about fixing things with time shenanigans.

Now E. Gadd's time machine can't cause changes to the timeline, it can only allow you to do what you've already done.  On the other hand, the Ocarina of Time will allow you to split timelines and use the events of one timeline to influence the other, thus saving both of them, but it also ages you when you use it, thus nixing Mario's plan of going back in time to the 40s when the plague is created and which is like 10 years before he was even born.  So he pops through the Dark World, into Hyrule, grabs the Ocarina of Time, goes back through the Dark World to the Mushroom World, grabs E. Gadd's time machine, hands both off to Ness as the world is going into apocalypse mode, Ness goes back in time with the time machine, splits the timelines with the Ocarina of Time, shows up as Adult Ness in the Metal Gear World where he requisitions a cure (genetic shenanigans involved in this will result in all sorts of weird stuff for Solid Snake), but they're only able to make a version that makes everyone anthropomorphs and sterilizes Pokemon as a side effect instead of simply stopping the plague entirely, which is good enough for Kid Ness so he hops back in E. Gadd's time machine, brings the cure to where the world is about to enter apocalypse mode in order to hand it off to the powers that be, which results in the slow dying off of Pokemon at an unspecified point after the events of the various Pokemon games and the slow transformation of the Mother World into first the world of Sonic in the immediate aftermath of the apocalypse and then the world of Star Fox later on.  The rivalry between Sonic and Mario emerges from the fact that Sonic is living on the ruins of Mario's home, and even though it's not exactly his fault Mario's still kind of bitter about it.  Meanwhile at the same time as the Kid Ness version of Mother World is going Star Fox, the Adult Ness version of Mother World, where Metal Gear takes place, will instead turn into Metroid/F-Zero.

* The prison is supposedly completely dark, but in *every scene* we see of it, light is visible. 
* Why would Bane waste time shipping Bruce Wayne halfway across the world when he's got Gotham City to reckon with? Would he not risk getting tracked by the CIA or someone else? The first scene of the film shows us that they know who he is. 
* We know that Wayne is hallucinating when he sees Ra's al Ghul appear. Why couldn't the whole thing be a hallucination?
* If it's *not* a hallucination, how on Earth does he get back into Gotham after escaping?
* Bane and his cronies are known to have spent a great deal of time and effort digging subterranean tunnels around Gotham. They could have built some sort of structure where Wayne was left. 
* Edit: also, I feel director Chris Nolan's track record of producing mind-bending films (Inception and Memento stand out) lends my theory some credibility.

At every turn in this film the catalyst for every bad thing that happens, just about every gruesome murder- can be traced back the motives of the Driver. From the beginning we see he is a criminal-not just any- but a slow, patient,methodical one. 

It starts when we see him in the grocery store, he doesn't happen to see Irene and her son, he's been stalking her. What a funny coincidence that right then and there when he comes out to find her in the parking lot, her car is broken down. Not on the road, not in the parking garage, but right there where Driver had happened to be. Maybe it broke down- or maybe someone who had alot of experience with cars found a way to manipulate a situation to his benefit. 

He gives her the info for a car repair place but doesn't tell her where he works, again- another encounter. He moves in, knowing her bf Standard is still in jail. She breaks it to him he's coming back. Inevitably, we see the scene where Driver returns to the garage and sees the two heaviess who just bashed up Standard. as he Drives by, they don't just walk past- they give him a nod. He knew these guys and this was his doing, which makes perfect sense for a guy who's job is chauffeuring criminals; He's connected.

His coup de gras comes when he sets up the heist that ultimatly leads to Standards ultimate demise which he had planned all along.
Standard of course, gets blown to hell by the pawn shop owner, shit goes out of hand when Driver realizes there is another layer of two timing going on thanks to Blanche, again this man has no problem striking a woman.

He immediately and without remorse tells Irene about the death and that they can finally be together and run away, he slaps him disgusted of course. And leaves on her own. The only unscathed person in the story.
Everyone else is maimed or put to death by Driver and his- well- drive to obtain this woman he is after.

He rejects God, he doesn't show much emotion, which causes the prosecutor to attack him for being soulless. He gets sentenced to death. As he is waiting to die, he is visited by a chaplain, who tries to convince him to believein God. At the very end Meursault gets very angry at the chaplain and accepts that the universe is indifferent to his actions.  

Not everything in this post is very well thought-out. I just finished reading The Stranger, and now I have a better appreciation of Bohemian Rhapsody. I just thought I'd share my thoughts on how the song relates to the novel.  

&gt;Is this the real life?  
&gt;Is this just fantasy?  

In many instances, especially during the court scenes, Meursault feels isolated from everything that's going on. He's so indifferent to everything that it might as well be somebody else's life, or even a fantasy.  

&gt;Caught in a landslide,  
&gt;No escape from reality  

After he kills the Arab, he's cought in a landslide, and there isn't much he can do. He cannot escape his inevitable fate (execution)  

&gt;Open your eyes,   
&gt;Look up to the skies and see,  
&gt;I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,  

At the very end, in the last cell that he's moved to, he can look up and see the sky. This cell is where the priest comes to meet him and tries to convert him. However Meursault knows that he's just like any other man, and he doesn't think he need's God's mercy or anybody else's sympathy.   

&gt;Because I'm easy come, easy go,  
&gt;Little high, little low,  
&gt;Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me  

Meursault is going to die, nothing will change this. Nothing he does will matter. More on this later (see the last line if you're impatient)  

&gt;Mama,  
&gt;I just killed a man,  
&gt;Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger   
&gt;now he's dead  

Meursault shot the Arab.  

&gt;Mama... life had just begun,  

At the end, he realized that his situation isn't that different from his mother's, on her last days. They are both imprisoned they both await death. 

He understands his mother's state of mind:  
*And now, it seemed to me, I understood why at her life’s end she had taken on a “fiancé”; why she’d played at making a fresh start. There, too, in that Home where lives were flickering out, the dusk came as a mournful solace. With death so near, Mother must have felt like someone on the brink of freedom, ready to start life all over again.*    

Life had just begun: he feels like he's ready to eperience life to the fullest.  

&gt;But now I've gone and thrown it all away  

Well, the only thing he can do now though is to hope for a hateful crowd at his execution.   

&gt;Mamaaaaa oooh,   
&gt;Didn't mean to make you cry,  
&gt;If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,  
&gt;Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters  

He's talking to his mother as if she were still alive. Some people think this is why Bohemian Rhapsody has nothing to do with The Stranger. I view this song as how Meursault imagines he'd tell his story to his mother. Now that he truly knows her, he can imagine himself talking with her and elaborating on his thoughts about awaiting death, refusing religion etc. He knows he's going to die, and he thinks people will carry on without him and even forget who he was.   
*This seemed to  me quite normal; just as I realized people would soon forget me once I was dead*  
So according to Meursault, the people who care about him should carry on. Just like he did after his mother died.  

&gt;Too late, my time has come,  
&gt;Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time  
&gt;Goodbye, ev'rybody, I've got to go,  
&gt;Got to leave you all behind and face the truth  

I just had another idea writing this post: Meursault is actually addressing his friends and loved ones in this song, but he chooses to say Mama because she's the only one that could understand his current emotions best  

&gt;Mama ooh,  
&gt;I don't want to die,  
&gt;I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all  

I don't think he explicitly says that he doesn't want to die in the book, but he fantasizes about having a chance to live/escape  
*Still, obviously, one can’t be sensible all the time. Another equally ridiculous fancy of mine was to frame new laws, altering the penalties. What was wanted, to my mind, was to give the criminal a chance, if only a dog’s chance; say, one chance in a thousand. There might be some drug, or combination of drugs, which would kill the patient (I thought of him as “the patient”) nine hundred and ninety times in a thousand*  

&gt;I see a little silhouetto of a man,  
&gt;Scaramouche! Scaramouche! Will you do the Fandango?  

Ok this one's going to sound forced, but here it goes:  
Meursault is expected to show regret and faith. His lawyer initially wanted him to act as if he were devastated by his mother's death. And if he agrees to act that way his sentence might be reduced. But he sees no point in faking these emotions, so he refuses to put on an act. He thinks that everybody's expectations of him (accepting God, regretting his crime, crying for his mother) is the equivalent of having a clown dance for them. So he imagines his lawyer seeing him as just a sillhouette, without character, asking Meursault to dance for him.   

&gt;Thunderbolt and lightning, very very frightening me!  

And his ""dance"" would be him saying ""I'm a sinner and God will punish me with thunder and lightning. How scary.""  

&gt;Galileo, Galileo  
&gt;Galileo, Galileo   
&gt;Galileo, Figaro - magnifico   

He feels like Galileo, who was forced to recant his scientific discoveries and accept God in order to escape execution. Meursault is in a similar situation where at least pretending to accept God and repenting would have helped him get much sympathy and maybe even evade the death sentence. But he thinks that would have been a futile game to play. He doesn't need anybody's sympathy.  

&gt;I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me  

This is his lawyer speaking, trying to get the jury to sympathize with him. 
He speaks as though he is Meursault.   
*At one moment, however, I pricked up my ears; it was when I heard him saying: “It is true I killed a man.” He went on in the same strain, saying “I” when he referred to me. It seemed so queer that I bent toward the policeman on my right and asked him to explain. He told me to shut up; then, after a moment, whispered: “They all do that.”*  

&gt;He's just a poor boy from a poor family,  
&gt;Spare him his life from this monstrosity!  

Celeste, Marie, Raymond all ask for his life to be spared  

&gt;Easy come, easy go, will you let me go  

Meursault speaking again. Compared to the previous few lines, in the song he sounds much less self-righteous than everybody else.   

&gt;Bismillah! No, we will not let you go  
&gt;(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go  
&gt;(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go  
&gt;(Let me go) Will not let you go   
&gt;(Let me go)(Never) Never let you go  
&gt;(Let me go) Never let you go (Let me go) Ah  
&gt;No, no, no, no, no, no, no  
&gt;Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go  

In the name of God (Bismillah), they are not letting him live. 
(Also, he murdered an Arab, and an Arabic phrase is used here. This was the first association I'd made between the song and the book)  

&gt;Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!  

*I can honestly say that during the eleven months these examinations lasted I got so used to them that I was almost surprised at having ever enjoyed anything better than those rare moments when the magistrate, after escorting me to the door of the office, would pat my shoulder and say in a friendly tone: “Well, Mr. Antichrist, that’s all for the present!” After which I was made over to my jailers.*    
Meursault has a special place in hell...  

And the song escalates  
*Then, I don’t know how it was, but something seemed to break inside me, and I started yelling at the top of my voice.*  

&gt;So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye?  

The priest offering him the illusion of an afterlife, and suggesting that would make his life meanigful at that point islike an insult (spitting in his eye) to him.  

&gt;So you think you can love me and leave me to die?  

Meursault thinks God loving him will not make a difference in his fate, and so God will be leaving him to die anyways. So him accepting God's love would be foolish.  

&gt;Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,  

I don't know who he's referring to as 'baby'. So I might just be blurting out nonsense (But I had some free time and I had fun making all these little connections)  

&gt;Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!  

At first I thought this was just Meursault feeling the need to escape. Which doesn't make that much sense, because he accepts his fate and is not fighting it or trying to escape it. So now I'm thinking, maybe this is just him yelling at the chaplain, kicking him out of his cell.  

&gt;Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,  
&gt;Nothing really matters,  
&gt;Nothing really matters to me...  

&gt;Anyway the wind blows...  

*Nothing, nothing had the least importance and I knew quite well why. He (the chaplain), too, knew why. From the dark horizon of my future a sort of slow, persistent breeze had been blowing toward me, all my life long, from the years that were to come. And on its way that breeze had leveled out all the ideas that people tried to foist on me in the equally unreal years I then was living through.*

I realize that Paul is in fact quite alive, but I wanted to share my favorite ""clue"" just for fun.

In order to see this clue, you need a mirror and the cover of Sgt Pepper. Take the mirror (facing up) and place it perpendicular to the album directly in the center of the drum. You should see the message ""1 ONE 1 X HE DIE"" This clue was supposed to gives the message that Three (1+ONE+1) of the Beatles were still alive but the fourth (X), he died.

[HERE](http://turnmeondeadman.org/IBP/IBPX/HeDie.jpg) is a picture of the drum clue.

EDIT: A bit more information on this for people that are unfamiliar. The story goes that around 1966, Paul McCartney was in a car crash and died due to a massive head injury. The Beatles were at a peak time in their career and creativity, so they decided to replace Paul with a look-a-like named William Shears Campbell. [THIS](http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a231/southernontariogal/faulglassesclose.jpg) is a picture of said look-a-like.

Assuming that the movie also takes place in 1987 (the year the movie was filmed), 85 years ago would have been 1902, leaving a four year gap between the year David said and the year the hotel was destroyed. Why would David say this? Because it was the year he met Max and became a vampire.  David also appears to be the only one who knew the history of the place (presumably aside from Max, but I'll get there in a minute), David is also the oldest of the boys and was most likely bitten first.  He meets Max and turns 3 other boys into vampires before 1987, and considering the other boys look to David as a leader and the fact they thought he as the head vampire would imply he is the oldest. My theory is that David was a bellhop, waiter or hotel worker of some kind when he met Max and was made into a vampire.

Look at Apollo's actions in Rocky 4. He's determined to look tough (especially in front of Rocky), take on Ivan Drago to prove to himself that he's still a worthy fighter. Even Rocky said that Apollo was doing this to prove to himself something. AT the fight, Apollo refused to have Rocky throw in the towel ""no matter what.""

Rodriguez, and that the few remaining survivors of the human race sent him back in time using a photocopy of the time code from 'Bender's Big Score' to defeat Nixon and prevent the robot uprising from happening.  Immediately after he is sent back in time, Bender arrives at the hiding place of the remaining humans carrying a large gun, presumably to kill them.  


When, in the past/present/future (when the episode takes place), Senator Travers manages to defeat Nixon and become President, that causes the robot uprising to never have taken place, meaning Travers was never sent back in time (as explained by Bender), and Nixon wins.  But that would create a paradox, as Nixon would presumably implement those same policies that led to the robot uprising in the first place, meaning Travers would indeed have to be sent back in time, and so on.  


However, the time code is said to be self-correcting, meaning all paradoxes resolve themselves somehow.  And even though it ends up that Travers was never actually sent back in time, the characters retain some memory of what happened, altering the timeline just a bit.  Since Bender was made aware of the robot uprising, the existence of the time code, and the whereabouts of the last remaining human survivors, the most probable resolution to the paradox would be for Bender to destroy the time code or locate and kill all the humans before they were able to send someone back in time.  And since Bender was just about to kill the remaining humans when they used the time code to send Travers back in time, it would stand to reason that without it, he would finally fulfill his simple dream of killing all humans.

The evolution from Ape to Man and from Man to Overman. Ape becomes man in beginning, man becomes Overman-baby in the end. Kubrick obviously liked Also Spoke Zarathustra.**


Like many out there I once watched this movie and was left scratching my balls in confusion. What the fuck was that child? What happened in Jupiter? Kaleidoscope? But then I read Thus Spoke Zarathustra and I understood. 

Now, I'll just write one word: Nietzsche. Some people will say that he's on the strangest and hardest philosophers to understand, but that's a lie. Often people just want too sound smart and likes to tell you what you can and can't do. I recommend reading Zarathustra. Anyhow, for those of you who still wont, or haven't, I'll summarize the plot line for you bellow. 

Zarathustra basically emerges from ten-years of solitude and starts walking about. He visits villages and talks to masses of people about his new found wisdom. There are three basic principles in his talks and one major point: The overman. This is what we're going to focus on. 

&gt; What is the ape to man? A laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for the overman: a laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm. Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape. (Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Prologue, §3, trans. Walter Kaufmann, Wiki)

He biggest point is that Humanity is the bridge from which Ape will transcend to overman. So what is overman? To put shortly, the next evolutionary step, but mentally. Man without religion, morality and without these pointless time wasting procrastinations. 

Now, back to Kubricks 2001. The movie begins with the song titled: Thus Spoke Zarathustra. This is the very first clue. Later we see the apes. They are crude beings, savage and animalistic. Nietzsche uses similar themes when describing what used to be. But soon a mysterious alien stone appears, which we'll call the monolith. This monolith teaches the apes to use tools, jump starting their evolution which eventually leads to us. 

The next monolith is found on the moon. This because the creators must've figured that once Man is mature enough to work their way to the sky, they'll be ready to become more. Space travel is that bridge. Years later, a journey begins. And, as you know, we meet our antagonist Hal.

Hal is technology. He is what is stopping Middle Man from become Overman.

&gt; ""Behold, I teach you the overman! The overman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: the overman shall be the meaning of the earth! I beseech you, my brothers, **remain faithful to the earth**, and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! (Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Prologue, §3, trans. Walter Kaufmann, Wiki)

In Zarathustra, Nietzsche talks about these people little people, who'll do everything to stop you from transcending. But as you know, Hal is eventually defeated and our hero ventures on towards superiority. Close to Jupiter, he encounters a worm hole and travels across the universe. In this faster-then-light journey he undergoes the same solitary mediation Zarathustra did in his cave and hallucinates the room on Jupiter. Here he lives his life, contemplating and thinking. In the end he is enlightened and reborn, much in the way Zarathursta speaks of the eternal recurrence of our actions. This is the floating baby outside of earth, or very own Overman. The third and final evolutionary step of man - and our last Monolith.

When Ezra and Rostum were being interviewed by All Songs Considered about the latest album, one of the hosts suggested that all their albums have some connecting thread, be it themes or characters.  The idea got me thinking, so here's what I came up with:

""Vampire Weekend"" tells the story of Blake, a world-traveling Ivy-league student finally starting to settle down.  The scene is set (""I see a Mansard Roof through the trees""), and Blake instantly rejects the school's liberal arts lessons (""who give a fuck about an Oxford comma"").  He continues rebelling against the upper-class world until he sees Bryn ""walking across the campus"" and falls in love.  His world turned upside-down, he changes his entire worldview and gets a ""new face"" in the process.  But her New England-based family doesn't approve of their relationship, so they get ""out of Cape Cod tonight.""  The song ""The Kids Don't Stand a Chance"" is their last retort to the family:

""You criticize the practice
By murdering their plants
Ignoring all the history
Denying them romance""

""Contra"" takes place a few years later, when Bryn and Blake have been together long enough to take a winter vacation together (""in December drinking Horchata"").  They realize that the relationship just wasn't built to last (""You stand this close to me/Like the future was supposed to be"").  They reminisce about their past (""She said, 'You know/There's nowhere else to go'/But change in rows/It struck me that the two of us could run"") and the good times they've had together (the entire song ""Cousins"").  Blake thinks back on his life before her (""When I was 17/I had wrists like steel/And I felt complete"") and grows resentful.  They fight (""I think you're a contra/I think that you lie"").

""Modern Vampires of the City"" takes place 20 years after Bryn and Blake first met.  They're in a loveless marriage in New York City, and Bryn taunts Blake every day (""You oughta spare your face the razor/Because no one's gonna spare the time for you"").  Blake feels empty and hopeless (""Unbelievers"") and is lured into the wiles of a woman named Diane Young who shows him what life is like outside his marriage.  He begins an affair with a younger woman named Hannah (""Young hearts need the pressure to pound/So hold me close my baby"") with whom he run off to Phoenix (""Hannah Hunt"").  Bryn finds him and explains what the marriage has been like for her (""Finger Back"").  He returns home and the pair become religious to try and find some kind of happiness (""Worship You"" and ""Ya Hey."")  Unable to cope, Blake throws himself into the Hudson Bay (""Hudson died in Hudson bay/The water took its victim's name"") and, from the afterlife, begs Bryn to take her time before she joins him (""Young Lion"").

In Season 6, we're introduced briefly to the Bringers and The First Evil. However, most importantly, we're introduced to the phrase ""From beneath you, it devours"". Cabin has a few references to ""the oldest evil"" that lies ""beneath"".

The basic premise of Cabin is that four archetypes have to be ritually sacrificed in order to placate an ancient evil, and potentially a fifth depending on fate.

In Cabin, there's a secret organization that performs these sacrifices. We aren't given any details about it other than they're somehow connected to the military, but not actually military. They're also worldwide and have been doing this for a long, long time.

Here's where it all comes together. Since the Initiative is fairly new and pragmatic, they can't have been performing the sacrifices. The Watcher's council has wet teams, however, and it's not unthinkable that they've been doing these sacrifices all along; The Slayer is incredibly powerful, but is still mortal; Buffy died thwarting Glory At the end of Season 5, and Glory's power was severely diminished. The Slayer has no chance at fighting The First and the Watchers know this, hence the sacrifices.

Somewhere along the way, though, The First changes the terms of the deal. The victims have to choose their fate. The Watchers don't have the resources to meet the demands on their own, so they turn to the Initiative and their huge stock of captured demons. The organization in Cabin is a joint operation between The Watcher's Council and The Initiative. And Cabin takes place between Season 5 and Season 6 of Buffy. The failure of the ritual unleashed the First upon the world and set up the events of the last two seasons of Buffy.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1do0n3,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1do0n3/the_cabin_in_the_woods_and_buffy_long_read_but/,

An annual even which lasts for 12 hours allowing crimes such as murder to go unpunished.
 
Who would allow such a law? Well, lets say it was allowed by someone, or something more powerful than anyone can imagine. An ""Antichrist"" figure. He has such a powerful influence on the minds of politicians and a way with words that moves the most weak minded people, and encourages those of a twisted nature.

 So prior to this event being passed, the country was in chaos. Lets say these were the times of tribulation. One man rose up and took power. He was unknown before, but came to power and quickly formed ""The New Founding Fathers"". 

 Participating in The Purge is accepting the mark of the beast. Everyone who accepts it becomes twisted and heartless. Their souls are no longer theirs. They are under the influence of ""him"". So no one is really to be trusted. Only people that remain sane and know that this whole society is wrong are those who are the victims of The Purge. They are against it, and therefore a threat to the Antichrist figure's plans, and so they are to be killed.

 So there, The Purge is a movie showing a world that collapsed and a country that has been taken over by a corrupt being with influence on the Politicians and others in power, yet no one knows it, and many have been indoctrinated without even realizing it.

1367261267.0,95,self.FanTheories,1dcrpo,That 70's show: Eric and Donna should have gotten married.,156,61,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1dcrpo/that_70s_show_eric_and_donna_should_have_gotten/,"So the fan theory isn't really completely developed but I felt like I needed to share my ideas after watching the (dreadful) last two seasons of That 70's Show. 


So after watching the 7th and most of the 8th season I wondered why exactly these seasons sucked so hard. For me everything about season 7 and season 8 seemed cramped, forced and out of place. Eric leaving seemed unnecessary, Kelso leaving seemed quick and weird, Randy filling in was the worst thing that happened, Bob and Red seem to hang out out more (why?), Fez sounded weird (I guess you could say he got older but it was still weird), finally Fez and Jackie also seemed forced. I know there's more stuff I could list but I forgot most of them. 



So my question was why these last seasons seemed to be weird and out of place. Obviously we all hate ""all in someone's head"" theory or ""it was all just a story"" theory. Actually my first thought was this was what Eric was thinking was happening back home while he was in Africa, but that theory just seemed lazy also. So I went to another similar,but more complicated, theory: Multiverse. 

Now stay with me here: In Season 4, Episode 1 ""It's a Wonderful Life."" 
""Eric wishes he and Donna never kissed and, à la It's a Wonderful Life, an angel (Wayne Knight) gives him a glimpse at what he and his friends' lives would have been, spanning from 1976 (the pilot episode) to the 1980s..."" (This was copied/pasted from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_%2770s_Show_(season_4)). 



In that episode we see what would have happened if Eric never kissed Donna. We see that everything changes and seems weird. We can say that the angel just transported Eric to another universe and showed him what was happening there (I know it's a stretch).  So we can mirror this situation to the marrying situation. Eric did not marry Donna and we (obviously) are seeing what happens. The series should have probably ended with Eric and Donna getting married, but the gap in Universes happens when Eric leaves Donna at the altar. Like I said this theory isn't fully developed, so I can't find a good reason to tie in Eric's disappearance to the rip in universes (but it should be considered since we don't know exactly where he goes). 


I am encompassing the multiverse theory at the beginning season 7 not only because of the radical change that happened with Eric not marrying Donna, but also (going back to Fringe trope) the lighting dramatically changes from neutral dim colored to bright and cheery. (a small detail, but nevertheless..)


TL;DR: Season 7 and 8 is a different universe from Seasons 1-6 due to the decision by Eric not marrying Donna. By not marrying Donna everything became weird and out of place (like what would have happened if Eric did not kiss Donna). 


Thanks for reading and I hope everything made sense. Please tell me your insight and any reasons to why this theory is bogus or shouldn't be considered.

It's a little bit of a leap, but hear me out...

During the ending of The Big Bang, when Amy re-creates the universe, Amy remembers the Doctor back into existence.  

We all remember this scene if we saw it--Amy sees River, she notices the TARDIS journal, and she remembers the Doctor--*HER* Raggedy Doctor.  

She doesn't just call him back into being, she calls him *home*.  

She doesn't ask him to come, she scolds him for being late to her wedding.  And her specific invocation for bringing back the Doctor and the TARDIS, the words that finish bringing them back into being?  

Something old.
Something new.  
Something borrowed.
Something blue.

Now, Amy initially speaks these words while trying to describe the TARDIS--but how well does this describe The Doctor himself?  He is old, but re-created to be something new.  He might be a person, but time with him is only borrowed, not forever.  And what is the Eleventh Doctor eternally?  Blue.  Sad.  Especially over his loss of the Ponds at the end of the Angels Take Manhattan.

Wait, that last part ended up being tangential, but I like it so I'm leaving it in.

Anyways, when he shows up he's just the way that Amy would want him at the wedding: dressed up and ready to go.  And when she brings the Doctor back, Rory remembers... everything.  He's not only Rory, he's Rory and the Lone Centurion.  He's better than just plain old Rory.  

Anyways, when this happens, Amy imprints the need to return into the Doctor.  He isn't just the Doctor--he's *Amy's* Doctor.  He can't quit the Ponds until they won't let him back anymore, and even the departure is difficult.  

What isn't said, though (because it isn't realized within the confines of the series), is that it is not only because of the potential paradox of running into the Ponds after knowing that the end of that adventure is ""The Final Farewell"" but also since Amy actually wishes him away forever--she lets go of him, she rejects any further experience with him.  And The Doctor falls into a depression because he has lost his newest and literalest *raison d'être* (literally ""reason to be"" or ""reason of being"").  

**TL;DR:** At the end of The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang, Amy not only brought the Doctor back into being, she merged him with her ideals of him (as she did with merging Rory with his Auton counterpart), making him *her* Doctor.  She is his reason to live, and it is only her complete rejection of further interactions with him at the end of The Angels Take Manhattan (well, moreso than the paradox thing) that keeps him away, crushing him.  

He literally has no reason to continue to be after the woman who re-created him to be her loyal companion rejected him.  He is no longer *her* Doctor.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_15qtpy,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/15qtpy/possible_reason_the_doctor_clings_to_the_ponds/,
1354665274.0,96,self.FanTheories,14ah9m,Skyfall is a retelling of the Bible [SPOILERS],128,32,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/14ah9m/skyfall_is_a_retelling_of_the_bible_spoilers/,"I was watching Skyfall, and something caught my attention that I would have normally just overlooked. I asked myself, why is the finale of this movie taking place in a church? This question led me to develop a deep reading of this film. I'm still fleshing it out, but here is what I have so far: 


The structure of Skyfall takes on a biblical persona. First and foremost, the three main characters, Bond, M, and Silva (Javier Bardem), are biblical characters. M is God. Silva, is the fallen angel, Lucifer, and Bond is Jesus. 


Now this all sounds far fetched, but the entire movie is laced with Paradise Lost, Dante’s Inferno, and Bible references. 


Lets start with Silva. When M is talking with Bond after her first encounter with Silva in that glass cell, she describes Silva as an agent who took too much “agency” and began to hack the Chinese on his own time. She then says that she gave him up to avoid a war. This is completely like Lucifer’s fall in the Bible. Lucifer was God’s favorite angel, just like Silva was M’s, but he began to be like God too much, taking too much agency, so God threw Lucifer and his minions into Hell. 


Silva’s character is also molded after Lucifer. In Paradise Lost, Lucifer is completely in love with himself, often prideful in his looks and his actions. In Skyfall, Silva is bisexual, well-versed and eloquent, and well-dressed. Silva's facial deterioration also houses biblical undertones. In Paradise Lost, Lucifer and his followers transform into devils and demons while in Hell. In Skyfall, Silva became a devil after taking the cyanide tablet in a prison cell. The tablet does not kill him, but severely disfigures the man. He attempts to maintain his past looks by having a metal structure hold his face together. When he takes it out for Bond and M, we see his true identity as a deformed monster/devil. 


Silva's relationship to M also mirrors Lucifer to God. Lucifer both hates and loves God even in hell. He vows to get back at God by having man fall from Eden, yet still loves Him. In the climactic end scene, when Silva wants M to kill both of them, the sadistic nature of Silva shows how much in love he still was with M. 


A small thing is the multiple messages Silva sends to M, “Think on your sins,” is also religious.


To continue, resurrection is a constant recurring motif and theme of Bond 23. When Silva asks Bond what his hobby is, Bond responds, “resurrection.” Towards the end of the film, when Albert Finney is showing the secret rock hallway to M below the Skyfall ranch, he explains that when he had to tell Bond that his parents had died, he went and hid in the rock cavern for two days, rising on the third. This is exactly like Jesus resurrecting on the third day, which is Easter sunday. 


The skyfall credit sequence is an almost journey through the layers itself. The finale of the film takes place in a church next to an ice lake. In Dante’s inferno, the last layer of hell is where Satan resides. Satan sits in an ice lake. 


The beginning of the film, when M orders Eve to fire on Bond and the assassin, Bond is shot and falls from that really high bridge. The scene is a metaphor for God having Jesus fall from Heaven to Earth. Bond falls into a river, water, which is the basic compound of human life. 


A smaller Biblical reference is Berenice Marlohe’s character, Severine. We are told in the film, through Bond’s dialogue, that Severine was a 12 or 13 year-old-prostitute that Silva ""rescued."" In the Bible, this character is Mary Magdalene, the prostitute which Jesus is connected with spiritually, and, debatably, physically. 


Now, if we are in accordance on Bond being “resurrected” from death, then what this all means is Bond is an immortal figure. This interpretation, by myself and I believe, Sam Mendes (Director), is an inherently self-reflexive nod at the Bond series. That is to say, Bond, the character, is an ever-living hero and savior that cannot die in both the narrative sense as well as the filmic series sense. At the character level, Bond is a character that cannot die because he has already died. In the greater series sense, Bond is a character that has lasted for over 50 years, and will continue to live on as a legend past the series's completion, much like Jesus did following his crucifixion. 

That's all I have for now. Once I get the blu-ray, I can rewatch the film and develop this further. ",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_14ah9m,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/14ah9m/skyfall_is_a_retelling_of_the_bible_spoilers/,

He's probably responsible for a number of atrocities, as he doesn't have much problem killing hundreds of men to get at his goal - which is to kill The Jackal.

The Jackal is an arms dealer, who's arming both sides of the conflict in this country to achieve his final goal - destruction of both sides. He's the only character in the game who understands that the war must be ended. He's not the antagonist of the story, but a minor character. 

The Jackal understands that the only way to end the fighting and allow the civilians of the country to escape, is for good is for both sides to destroy each other. This means all mercenaries fighting in the war must die as well - and that includes the player, the player's friends, and the Jackal.

War-tired and disgusted at himself, the only way the PC can cope with everything he's done is by creating a split-personality and allowing that to act as his conscience. That personality is The Jackal - he knows what to do and how to do it.  

This explains why when the Jackal appears to the player, they're alone together. Every time. No one else seems to care about the Jackal, talk about him, or act against him in any way. 
 What does the Jackal do to this person who was sent to kill him? Give him lectures on morality, quote Nietzche, and explain how it must all be ended.


**[Major spoilers from here on out.]**

In the end, the player must murder all of his mercenary buddies, urged on by the Jackal. Keep in mind, by this point in time the player character has had many opportunities to kill the Jackal, but has chosen to follow him in his plan instead. 

They meet together one last time after herding the civilians through a mountain pass to the border of another country. The Jackal gives the player a choice: detonate the explosives, causing the mountain pass to collapse and trapping the feuding warlords in a country with no civilians. Or bring a substantial amount of money to the border to bribe the guards to let the civilians flee to safety. Both options will end in death: the explosives will kill whoever detonates them, and whoever hands in the money will have to commit suicide to end it ""for good"". Everyone involved in perpetuating the war (including the player and the Jackal) are a cancer, as explained by the Jackal. The Jackal will do whatever the player chooses not to do, thus ensuring they both die.

So, no matter what the player chooses, he dies at the end of the game. Yet, during the final cutscene, it's explained The Jackal's body was never found.

1345151265.0,99,self.FanTheories,yc9sk,The Matrix: The machines use humans for computing not energy,130,31,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/yc9sk/the_matrix_the_machines_use_humans_for_computing/,"Claim: Humans are organic CPUs for the Matrix.

It's thermodynamically impossible for humans to be the power source for the machines. There are so many reasons that it doesn't work, but the simplest one is - where is the new energy coming from?  If they are using the energy that the human body gives off, then that energy will not be available as ""food"" to give to other humans. 

What the humans know about the Machines is either 1) speculation based on eye witness accounts or 2) from the archive which we see in the Animatrix movies. Of course, we can't trust the archive 100% because we know that the Machines have invaded Zion before and could have easily sowed disinformation to control Zion. The explanation that humans are a power source is convenient because it acts as misdirection from the Machine's true intentions. 

The machines studied human's physiology and discovered that the human mind in the ""real world"" is vastly more computationally powerful than the Machines' silicon processors. How do I know? Look at how much faster the human mind can react to the Matrix - they can move and react at super-human speed. Humans ""aren't bound by the limitations of the system."" A vast distributed computational network of human brains would increase the Machine's computational power beyond comprehension. 

So the Machines created a way to jack directly into human brains and use them to vastly increase their computational power at a huge reduction in power costs - the geothermal power that both humans *and* machines use is scarce. They created a way to recycle human bodies, not for energy, but for nutrients, providing a less power intensive way to synthesize essential nutrients than synthesizing glucose by using genetically modified phytoplankton and artificial light, which is already energetically wasteful. 

But the problem was that the human brain couldn't simply be ""plugged in"" to a computational system and be expected to start performing calculations. They needed to develop a physical interface - the head jack - and a software interface - The Matrix. 

The first Matrix was a eutopia - *as defined by the Machines*; it was purely computational software. They tried to simply override the brain and use it like a computer. But humans have a certain amount of... let's call it ""preinstalled software"" in the form of instincts - food, water, sex, and expectations about how the world should look and feel. So in order to highjack much of the brain's power for computational use, they had to occupy much of the brain with the Matrix. 

The problem was that the interface had problems - a percentage of people did not interface properly with the system. These people wasted valuable computational power, and the Machines abhor inefficiency. So the Machines allowed those people to go ""free"" to be studied later. They keep them in a tiny city, like a humane ""fruit fly catcher"". They keep these humans around to study for every ""Matrix update"". 

See, the Matrix is in version 6.0 in the movie. With each version they find a way to unlock more computational power from the human mind while increasing the percentage of people who accept the program. They learn more about improving the hardware interface by studying the humans who escape, but they also learn more about how to manipulate humans by studying how they interact outside of the Matrix. It's clear that in version 6 that they still don't fully understand human relationships and bonding, but continue to experiment, as with Neo's test of love for Trinity. 

Which brings us to ""The One"" - what is that? You see, over time, people of various resistance to the Matrix are born. Some are simply inefficiently connected; some reject it enough to ""wake up""; but most, including those in Zion, still accept the software to a certain extent. Every person who re-enters the Matrix, has at least part of their neural abilities co-opted by the Machines - ""stronger"" people keep more of their own mind to use for themself. Morpheus ""rejects"" the Matrix more than, say, Sypher, so he is stronger in the Matrix because he has more neural computation at his disposal. Probabilistically speaking, eventually an individual will appear who ""perfectly"" rejects the system; a person whose mind remains entirely their own within the Matrix. That person is ""The One"". Neo has incredible powers because his mind is not occupied doing data processing for the Machines - he fully rejects the software interface and thus sees all of the loopholes that are invisible to everyone else. 

Once the one has been identified, the machines test him/her both inside and outside the Matrix. They then kill the individual and study their reasons for rejecting the software and hardware interfaces into their distributed ""neural network"". They use this data to update the system to ensure that the system is more efficient so that less people reject the interface and more neural power can be extracted from the human mind. They cull a large portion of humans that they are keeping alive in their fly trap, Zion, because they are no longer needed - they represent people who are tainted by the knowledge of reality but who *would* accept the new program because of the new update. All of the software bugs that ""The One"" identified are cleaned up and a new version of the Matrix launches, more efficient than ever. 

The Oracle helps Neo because it is the program in charge of making sure that the people don't reject the software. She raises children who reject the software to study them so that the software bugs they find can be patched in the next update. If you recall, the Architect said he created the Oracle precisely for this purpose. 

The Architect's only concern is computational efficiency. He abhors waste. When he appears to Neo, he saves as much computational power as possible by remaining seated in a very plain room - everything he does is wasted CPU cycles. So, while the Oracle's job is to keep people in the system, the Architect works on probability models to reduce the computational costs of the Matrix and thus make more power available to the Machines themselves. 

**TL;DR - The machines use human minds as the primary source of computation and the Matrix is part of the software interface to the brain. Neo's powers are the result of him rejecting the software which highjacks most of the brain to use as a CPU by the Machines.**",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_yc9sk,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/yc9sk/the_matrix_the_machines_use_humans_for_computing/,

Why hasn't it made any progress? Why is it locked in an endless cycle of violence?Simple: because he likes it that way and created it.

For Bruce Wayne crime fighting is his only relief from trauma of seeing his parents murdered and from the ennui of his privileged existence which is completely devoid of challenge. He blames himself for his parents' deaths so the closest thing to relief is taking revenge by taking on criminals without that he is left with perpetual trauma and guilt. Crime fighting is an escape and an addiction like heroin. A Gotham at peace would leave Wayne with nothing in his life. As a wealthy and powerful scion he is easily able to control the already corrupt police, allowing Batman to operate with impunity. He sees Gotham as his hunting ground.

He recruits proteges not because of any love - any feelings other than anger are gone - but because he wants his game to go on after his death. Did he kill Dick's parents to recreate his parents' murder and feel what the killer felt? Bruce remakes his proteges in his own image, destroying identities to create what is in effect a death cult. He is making replicas of himself to continue his endless war, proof of his narcissism.

He could easily use his limitless wealth to solve economic problems that are the source of crime, instead he only spends it on his arsenal. Gotham's economy seems terrible, is this because Bruce sabotages to keep the city miserable and violent? After street crime bores him he took it to the next level by creating supervillains.

Perhaps the origin of the Joker was just an accident or was it an experiment? After all in Beware the Creeper Joker states that Batman threw him into the acid on purpose, years later the acid vats are still around Batman hasn't disposed of them. If he wanted to avoid more jokers why didn't he hide all the acid? Either way - accidental or intentional - he saw that he could create new criminals to bring his game into a new level he found troubled people and turned them into monsters which is within his skills including scientific expertise. He learned of dent's psychological problems and had him disfigured through a proxy, his disfigurement was too precise to be accidental no it was designed to trigger him. He learned of men like the ventriloquist and via proxies gave him the tools and money to become a mobster. How else could such a sad old man become one?

He learned of Bane and lured him to Gotham. Bruce caused Victor Fries's partly out of sadism, as a man with Wayne industries at his control he can have scientists devise ways to create villains like mister freeze. And so it continued like a man stocking a pool with fish. He learned of Selina Kyle and fed her information to allow her to pull off heists. Catwoman is a substitute for his mother as Bruce probably has an Odeipus complex he is always pursuing her like the memory of his mother. The villains keep escaping from Arkham, which isn't incompetence. Wayne controls Arkham, he built a special prison for his favorite playmates and has a staff under his control release them periodically. We see that the prisoners are allowed to socially interact and other freedoms, arkham isn't a real prison its a clubhouse to allow villains to network.

Like his proteges who also form the ideal family he never had the villains are images of himself. The typical batman villain has no powers instead he or she is defined by obsession and mental illness the two things that obviously drive Wayne. By making people into parallels of himself he is doing battle with his psyche and his feelings of guilt over his parents' deaths.

Batman is the story of a traumatized manchild who never really grew up, he is living out his childhood dreams and trying to heal a wound at the expense of a city. Batman is the real villain, controlling Gotham and turning it into a warzone for his own needs.

After Walter yells ""man down"", the Dude guesses Donny was shot despite the lack of blood, as though he can't see him. He doesn't have a funeral, the Dude just goes along with the memorial and trip to the mortuary to humor Walter and let him peacefully excise his imaginary friend that he created after the stress of Vietnam.

Except the Dude *does* respond to Donnie, three times in fact, that can't be explained by the Dude piecing together Walter's half of the conversation. Twice after the car is stolen––""Where you going Dude?"" ""Home Donny."" ""Phone's ringing Dude.""

In the first alley scene, he has his head down and his hair over his face as he puts in a hair clip. Again there is no visual evidence that the Dude responds at all.

So, Deadpool ostensibly is aware that he exists as a fictional character within a comic book. This translates to video games as well as seen in Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and other games both previous and upcoming.

During both Mark Waid's four issue miniseries and the 1997-2002 run of ""Deadpool"", the mutant Siryn, daughter of X-Man Banshee, plays a major, and sometimes romantic role.

In the pages of Peter David's X-Factor, Siryn has difficulty accepting that her father had recently died (in the pages of 2006's X-Men: Deadly Genesis). It's an almost gleeful denial she's in as she happily operates under the assumption that he will be back at some point, reasoning that all the X-Men that have died come back. I always just thought of this as a bent sort of denial belying a deeper psychosis. The other characters on the team just sort of go on hand waving it as her being so upset that she can't deal with it. Eventually (I may be wrong about this, operating solely on my memory of the storylines from five years ago), she accepts it and grieves for her father, acknowledging that he really is dead and she'll never see him again.

But what if her time spent with Deadpool had a lasting effect on her? What if that assumption that her father would come back at some point wasn't just denial (or Peter David poking fun at how frequently X-Men die and come back), but was actually some kind of subconscious awareness of comic book tropes that had rubbed off on her from her close and frequent contact with Deadpool? She may not have been fully aware of herself as a fictional character the was he is, but instead just had a faint nagging inclination of it that led to that reaction to her father's death.

(I literally just started inFamous 2)

In the first game, Cole gets his powers and he makes great use of them all the way through the story.  He even becomes more powerful as the story goes on.

In the second game, we have a new Cole.  His voice is different, much less rough, but still scratchy.  His face has changed a bit, and from my point of view he looks quite a bit younger.

**The Theory**

Now, when Cole absorbs energy, he is healed.  Presumably because of his supernatural tie to electricity, he can absorb it to heal his wounds.  Using this information, it is my belief that Cole is getting younger because of his powers.  Every time he absorbs energy, he is healed, thus slowly reversing the aging process.  The best example I can give you is to just *look* at him.  Listen to his voice.  He originally looked as though he might be in his mid 30s.  Now he looks like he's maybe... 25?  His voice has changed.  It's not as deep and rough anymore, so his vocal cords have healed from what was probably too much stress (or nodules or something).

So it stands to reason that his powers are essentially granting him a small form of immortality.  The more times he ""heals"" himself of wounds, the more he stays close to his ""prime.""

I mean, just look at this difference.

In the movie *Stargate*, Ra is a being capable of inhabiting the body of another, gaining full physical control over that body and using the sarcophagus technology to attain immortality. In the movie, we see glimpses of this being on occasion, and it appears to be humanoid, with a large head, black eyes, and lacking a nose. 

In the TV series *Stargate: SG 1*, Goa'uld are beings capable of inhabiting and controlling humanoid host bodies and using the sarcophagus technology to attain immortality. In the show, we see these creatures as serpentine, perhaps half a meter long. In *SG1*, Ra is named as a former System Lord, one of many powerful Goa'uld warlords, in fact he's considered second only in power to Anubis. 

In order to reconcile the physical difference between Ra in the movie and the Goa'uld in the TV show, I believe the advanced Asgard race gives us an answer, as well as establishing why Ra was so powerful. 

In *SG1*, the Asgard are a highly advanced, ancient race of little humanoid aliens with large heads, black eyes, and no nose. My suspicion is that Ra found a way to control an Asgard for a time, gaining considerable technological knowledge, and assuming that self-image. After something happened to that host, Ra took on a human host but continued thinking of himself as the appearance of the Asgard. He utilized the technological knowledge to become a more powerful System Lord, and what we see in in the movie *Stargate* is the way he sees himself.

1369445069.0,94,self.FanTheories,1f09cp,[Skyrim] Destroying the Thieves Guild was originally intended to be an option (like the Dark Brotherhood is).,121,27,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1f09cp/skyrim_destroying_the_thieves_guild_was/,"_First up: I originally posted this on my blog. But, IDGAF about views and such, and I know posting personal blog links on reddit is a cardinal sin, and since IDGAF... here's the whole text from my article. Also, I will try to apply the Spoiler Tags as outlined in this sub's rules, but as you know, RES ignores them anyway... But I will try just the same._

In this article, I will be floating a theory, and I would like to make it explicitly clear right from the start that this is only a theory. That theory is: you were originally intended to be allowed to destroy the Thieves Guild. You can destroy the Dark Brotherhood (in short, kill Astrid rather than any of the hostages, and follow the quest markers), and that's a shame, because the Dark Brotherhood is a lot of fun. But why allow you to do it? I can only imagine it's because they are Bad and you are Good. So I think, the same reasoning behind allowing the player to destroy the Dark Brotherhood, led to Bethesda planning on allowing you to do the same thing to the Thieves Guild. However, they decided against it and changed their minds (again, this is all conjecture), but did not remove all references to the quest. This article contains a few minor spoilers for the Dark Brotherhood, and a really minor one for the Thieves Guild.

First, why would you be allowed to do this? The Thieves Guild is great. It’s home to some of the best quests in the game. Well, so is the Dark Brotherhood, and the point is that if you’re playing a good guy, you would destroy the Dark Brotherhood, especially since a good guy would kill the headmistress of the orphanage anyway (she tortures the kids -- I’m not joking, walk in there and listen to what she tells them, then check out the torture room, it’s at the far end of where they sleep) and this would lead to you being offered to join them.

Second, what makes me think it was ever intended that you would be allowed to? I have four things I have discovered so far, in the game alone, without the use of the Creation Kit (which I do not know how to use).

1. Corruption in Riften. When you first get to Riften, you cannot enter the town. The doors are locked and you are told to go around to the other side. At the other side, you are asked to pay a visitor’s tax. I always choose the response that says, “This is a shakedown. Let me pass,” or something like that, and they always tell me to hush and go on in.  I’ve done this at very low levels with no points in the Speech skill, so I assume it always works. When you first approach the Jarl’s steward, she blurts out that she doesn’t know anything about any corruption in town. The ability to report the corrupt guard, or to pursue this line of conversation with the steward, is awkwardly absent from the game.

2. Mjoll the Lioness. Depending on the time of day you come into Riften, you may walk past Mjoll the Lioness, a Nord warrior, and her boyfriend, Aerin. She will be complaining about the Thieves Guild, and Aerin will apologize for Mjoll, saying the city really gets to her, and that it’s her personal goal in life to clean up Riften. That Riften is like her baby and she wants to protect it. You can do a quest for Mjoll to find her lost glass greatsword, Grimsever, which sets Mjoll at the second-highest disposition level to you. She considers you a best friend at this point. You can additionally marry her (right out from under Aerin, and nothing is said about this!), raising her disposition to the max. At neither level is the option to help her clean up Riften. If a dragon slayer and a mean Nord warrior can’t clean up a thieves guild, what’s wrong with them?

3. The merchant guild. Almost every merchant in Riften hates the Thieves Guild. The Guild shakes them down for “protection money.” Bersi Honey-Hand., the proprietor of the Pawned Prawn (Riften’s general merchandise store) has a couple dozen or so pamphlets in his safe downstairs calling for a rebellion against the guild, saying any store wishing to participate should mark their store. These pamphlets are never distributed. No stores are ever marked.

4. The Ragged Flagon’s escape tunnel. The Ragged Flagon is a bar in the sewers under Riften. It features what looks like a dock, on what looks like a wading pool. This pool is ankle deep, if that. If you’re on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, ankle deep is all it ever is. However, if you’re on the PC, you can enter the developer code “TCL” (Toggle CLipping), and you can go under the floor, and see that the “wading pool” in the Flagon is actually quite deep. And at the very bottom... is an escape tunnel! But it goes nowhere. It’s just a dead end. The supports for the dock go all the way down, and the steps that go into the wading pool go about six feet down (not even halfway). [Here, see for yourself!](http://i.imgur.com/AIHc7rX.jpg) Why is there an escape tunnel to the Ragged Flagon?

Third, how would destroying the Thieves Guild work, if the feature were completed? My best guess is that the quest would start at the Pawned Prawn. Asking any merchant about the Thieves Guild would get you directed there. Asking Bersi Honey-Hand about it would get you instructed to pass out the pamphlets. You would only be given one for each vendor. There are way too many in the safe. There are three vendors in the square (plus Brynjolf’s, but he doesn’t count). There’s the food cart. There’s Balimund, the smith. There’s the bar, and the bunkhouse. The Meadery also doesn’t count, because [Maven is in with the Thieves Guild](#spoiler). There’s also the alchemy shop on the lower level. That makes eight. Nine if you count the court wizard, but she’s an airhead, and she works out of the Jarl’s place, so let’s just call it eight.

At this point, all the shops are marked (except perhaps a couple holdouts) and since the Pawned Prawn is at the center of it, Bersi asks you to stay the night and guard the shop. The guild sends the unnamed Thief (the guys in brown who get killed every other time you’re in Riften) to hit the Prawn, and you kill him. Mjoll would be strictly optional, and I would guess that she would not even work with you until you brought her her sword. She is just a wild card and I don’t know how she would fit in, so I can only assume she would be an optional ally.

At this point or after a couple attacks, you would go to the Jarl, who would refer you to her steward. The steward would brush you off and send you packing, and then [Maven’s brute (Maul)](#spoiler) would threaten you. You could fight and kill him for a key to [Maven’s](#spoiler), or you could ignore his threats, and break in later. Telling Bersi about this would have Bersi send you to [Maven’s home](#spoiler) to look for clues. You would break into [Maven’s home](#spoiler), and find a document incriminating her -- something from Mercer Frey, perhaps, or Brynjolf.

Returning to the Jarl, now with proof of her steward’s corruption, the steward and [Maven](#spoiler) would both be arrested, and the Jarl would give you the option, at this point, to rid Riften of the Thieves Guild once and for all, also pledging a small group of Riften town guards to assist. Now, I’m thinking either the main entrance to the Flagon is barricaded, and you would have to enter via the escape hatch at the bottom, or, my original thought is that a lot of fire is used (not explosives, it would bring the whole center of town down) and you escape through the hatch to save your life -- and the escape hatch leads to the lake, and out of town.

The reward for destroying the Thieves Guild would be, you are instantly Thane, you have max disposition with every vendor in Riften, and who knows what else. Maybe a big cash reward. Maybe the Jarl just gives you Honeyside (the home you can purchase in town). Destroying the Thieves Guild would be the best thing to happen to Riften. You would be a hero.

Fourth, what would be the consequences? So far as I can tell, they would be minimal. The Dark Brotherhood, if not destroyed, would send you to the Thieves Guild [to appraise a necklace](#spoiler). But there are many [jewelers](#spoiler) in Skyrim, including one right in Riften. But if you’re destroying the Thieves Guild, aren’t you also going to destroy the Dark Brotherhood? Also, the limited collectibles, the Unusual Gems, or later revealed to be Stones of Barenziah, are appraised by a Thieves Guild member. Again, these are jewels and could be appraised by any jeweler. Oh, and a Thieves Guild member [sells you furnishings for the Dark Brotherhood lair at the end of the quest, but that could fall to any general store](#spoiler).

Lastly, if you seriously want to destroy the Thieves Guild, you can do so with [this mod](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28880), but I have not tried it, and thus cannot vouch for it. Read the readme carefully, this mod has a ton of stipulations. And the Ragged Flagon escape tunnel is not utilized, nor is Bersi's merchants guild. It's just a quick n' dirty way to destroy the other evil guild, for lawful good characters. But again, the Thieves Guild is a lot of fun, and if you're looking for motivation to do it with your good character, I would recommend using [this mod](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9557) to start in Riften (starting off owning Honeyside, the home in Riften), then joining the Thieves Guild straight away. Go kill Grelod the Kind while you're at it (she's a real bitch, and she tortures the children) and get into the Dark Brotherhood. Do nothing else in the game until those are complete. Then go to Helgen and witness Alduin flying away -- this starts the main quest. Then, begin your ""redemption."" (The developers even spoke of doing something like this in the behind-the-scenes documentary Beyond the Wall, actually saying that a good character could start off bad and then be redeemed by saving the world.)",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,1371669238.0,,,True,t3_1f09cp,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1f09cp/skyrim_destroying_the_thieves_guild_was/,

The whole movie does take place in the 20th century, every part. Obviously with police and the historian, this makes sense. The historian is filming a news story about a large nearby renaissance fair, adding context by discussing the history of King Arthur.

The characters we follow are really just part of the ren fair, kind of reliving (LARPing) the legendary events. Everything that's a cartoon is actually in their imagination - God, the monster in the cave, the Grail.

This explains the bizarre behavior of the french and other people, who are just playing along in a game. In addition, there are no horses because they're just role playing, they can buy coconuts at a grocery store but obviously don't have the recourses to buy horses.

Someone takes the game too far, and the historian is murdered by a mentally unstable participant, and the police then have to interfere in the renaissance fair as part of the investigation.

My theory is that Henry receives sporadic psychic visions of Shaun's future, and trained him as a child by giving him advice that would help later on.

At some point before the time that the show takes place, he received a horrible vision: Shaun's death.

A while back I commented on another Terminator time-travel theory with an explanation that got rid of the usual paradoxes people point out with the Terminator franchise. The general reaction is usually that though the movies are good it’s just a mess that’s best left ignored because it cannot possibly be resolved, but I think I closed the plot holes and resolved the paradoxes – the comment didn’t get a lot of attention, possibly because the topic was already on its way down, but I was encouraged to give it its own post. I worked on a bit and here is the result – it’s a tad bit lengthy, but it’s a solid four movies about time travelling killer robots after all. TSCC was great, but is not considered to be canon for this theory.
 
Obvious **SPOILER WARNING** since talking about the plot of the movies is somewhat essential to this.

We all know that there are several issues with the apparent logic of the Terminator movies. Some things barely seem to make sense, as for example:
 
Why is John Connor so important in the first place? Surely the world wide human resistance of the future was mostly a team effort, what makes him such a special snowflake that the machines assume getting rid of him is the single best way to assure victory?
 
Who was John Connor’s original father, and why did growing up as the son of a happy-go-lucky waitress and whoever that dude was result in him being uniquely prepared for the war with the machines?
 
Why did the machines have to go and kill Sarah Connor in the first place? Surely messing with her life prevented her from getting pregnant with the specific kid that later went on to cause them all this trouble, Kyle Reese is basically doing their job for them if he’s preventing the birth of *the* John Connor, son of Sarah, and just caused the birth of *a* John Connor, son of Sarah.
 
 What’s with the different Terminators? The T-X seems to be significantly worse than the T-1000, that thing was practically unstoppable.
 
I think I found a way to answer all these questions and more, explaining it in a way that should get rid of all paradoxes and plot holes.
 
First of all, one general assumption has to be made: **Travelling back in time destroys the present day universe in a very limited time span, but not instantly.** This must be the case for several reasons:
 
1) Machines and humans show massive interest in sending agents back into the past, and consider this to be a high priority. This seems trivial at first, but consider that the act of sending agents back would be an entirely pointless one since it would not influence *their* present day. They’d just witness their guy getting into a machine, see them disappear with a “poof”, and then go on with their daily struggle – who gives a flying fuck if someone was sent to the past if it cannot alter the present? Why concern themselves with these shenanigans in war times? If it’s a moral obligation not to create a parallel universe where the other side wins, why not focus on winning the war first before wasting resources now. It’s a *time machine* after all. No, there must be immediate real world consequences of not dealing with a time travel incident at once.
 
2) Machines and humans both manage to send agents back into the past and to react to each other’s decisions of sending someone back. This would not be possible if sending someone back instantly changed the present. So there must be a brief transitional period before the changes made in the past take effect, otherwise sending the first terminator to the past immediately would have caused a present in which John Connor never existed and there was no reason for Kyle Reese to go protecting Sarah.
 
3) Nobody sends reinforcements, ever. Both sides only send one lone guy each, implying heavily that they suffer some kind of limitation. One side in the conflict should have access to a lot more resources though; the only resource that limits both parties equally would be time. Otherwise it makes no sense for humanity to only send a naked Kyle Reese to the past to stop a killing machine like the T-800. They had won the decisive battles of the war and victory was certain, why the sudden rush to send someone back *in a time machine*? They could have sent a whole bunch of people to make sure the job gets done, but somehow they were limited to just one dude.
 
4) Both sides show massive restraint when it comes to using time travel as a weapon. It’s only ever used as a last ditch effort when the war is already decided. Why limit yourself this way if there are no consequences? You’d assume constantly sending people back to correct every minor tactical mistake on the battlefield was the norm otherwise, but apparently they wait until all other measures have failed – it’s treated quite literally like a doomsday device, a price that is *only* worth paying if complete annihilation of the entire species is ensured otherwise. Humanity doesn’t even *try* to prevent judgement day, and they do acquire time travel technology within the war – it’s not like they could reasonably fear a ripple effect where preventing one catastrophe of the past might accidentally cause a bigger one. This is not like inventing time travel in 2013 and choosing not to go back and shoot Hitler in the face because one fears that preventing WW2 and all the atrocities that went with it would come at the price of a nuclear war between the western and eastern bloc. This is like inventing time travel in 1946 and deciding not to go back and shoot Hitler in the face for no reason whatsoever. Time travel must have consequences that are completely inacceptable in all but the direst of circumstances.
   
Now that this is established, let’s have a look at the actual plot. 
 
**Timeline 1**: Sarah Connor lives an unremarkable life and dies of cancer at some point. At the same time humans built Skynet, Skynet becomes self aware, Judgement day happens, and the machines take out humanity successfully. Some guy who knows Kyle Reese, who is just a refugee and a scared kid, invents a time machine in the hope of changing the past and builds in a safety measure that's supposed to prevent machines from using it for their purposes - only living tissue can go through. Kyle goes to the past, either because he was sent there by time machine guy, or because he flees from the dreadful future. The machines either don't find out until it’s too late, or do not understand the consequences of time travel for the present and decide not to intervene since bringing killer robots to the past will pose a bigger threat to the development of Skynet than a naked kid rambling about the apocalypse, since the former is more likely to make people sceptical of the idea of entrusting too much power to machines, or they simply do not manage to develop a workaround quickly enough.
 
**Timeline 2**: Kyle Reese arrives in the past, but initially fails to stop Skynet; as he finds it impossible to gain the kind of access he would need the development of Skynet goes forward as normal. He can however build a life for himself in a world that is not a post-apocalyptic nightmare, meets a nice waitress named Sarah, falls in love, has a kid named John, and life is good for a bit. But when his wife falls ill and judgement day comes closer he starts preparing himself and his son, teaching him how to survive, what possible weaknesses the early generations of Skynet machines had, which scientists need protection - most importantly time machine guy, so someone who is better prepared than he was can be sent back to stop the war altogether, ideally himself so his son won't be erased from existence. Kyle Reese never understood the details of time travel, but what he did understand was that having access to it is absolutely vital. 
 
Skynet becomes self aware, judgement day happens, Kyle Reese dies in the middle of all of this, but with John's decent preparation the humans manage to organize a resistance that is always one step ahead of the machines. They do find the guy who invents time travel, learn why they must not use it, but also draw the machines’ attention to this technology, meaning they start developing a work-around early on. In the midst of all this John meets young Kyle Reese and takes him under his wing, knowing full well that Kyle As his father and the man who really is responsible for the edge humanity has over the machines. Then, just when humanity is about to win the entire war, the machines decide to take the doomsday option and send their best machine back in time. Humanity has to react, and John Connor sends the one man he knows is willing to do anything to protect his mother...
  
**Timeline 3**: The plot of The Terminator. Terminator goes back, John sends Kyle back with a picture of his mum, thinking he's got the right guy for the job. *There are two Kyle Reeses in this future right now.* This seems to be unnecessarily complicated at first glance, as having two Kyle Reeses around increases the risk of them running into each other and creating complications (not a paradox though, as they are not the same but different people of similar origins), but it explains why Kyle Reese was not briefed on when and where Sarah needed to be to meet John’s father, which is odd as this meeting itself would be just as important as saving Sarah when it comes to ensuring John’s existence and John would at least know a *name*. John of the future knows that Kyle Reese is the perfect candidate for the job since he can go into hiding with Sarah without jeopardizing her chance of meeting his father – this is not so much about ensuring his own existence but about making sure that there would be *a* John Connor, as a son raised by Kyle and Sarah had the best chance of being able to fill his shoes, the act of sending back the terminator by itself probably prevented the existence of this specific original John Connor from the beginning, too many miniscule variables are involved in the creation of a child to just create the same exact one again. 
 
So, there are two Kyles running around. Timeline 2 Kyle who I will call Kyle A, and the Kyle we know from the movie who I will call Kyle B. Kyle B meets Sarah, protects her, Kyle B fathers a child that is later named John because that’s what he’s supposed to be (*not* the same person, just because it’s the same DNA and the same name does not make it the same person as anyone with siblings knows), Kyle B dies, and the terminator gets crushed. Kyle A didn’t actually meet Sarah due to her going off the grid after events of The Terminator, he never starts a family, so nobody listens to his crazy ramblings about evil robots and he dies at some point without having the chance to pass on his knowledge to anyone who would listen, quite possibly in an insane asylum.  
 
The government puts a hold on their initial plans for the Skynet project because Cyberdyne promises that they can do it cheaper and better by reverse-engineering the components in the crushed robot they found. They actually manage to do that, meanwhile Sarah raises the second John to become the best anti-machine warrior imaginable and grooms him for leadership, other than Kyle Reese A who tried to teach original John what to look out for in the future, but ultimately she gets locked away and stays that way until she dies, either on judgement day or a bit later of cancer. John II ends up with his foster parents, uses his skills to become a teenage delinquent, meets Kate Brewster who becomes his girlfriend. They either stay together or they don’t, that’s fairly inconsequential in this timeline. At some point Cyberdyne manages to complete development of a version of Skynet that is even better and more powerful than the one that would have been developed originally because it contains components that were decades ahead of the original ones. 
 
Skynet becomes self aware, judgement day happens, Skynet is more dangerous than before, but under the leadership of John Connor II humanity manages to turn things around yet again. John II meets young Kyle and puts him under his wing, somehow tries to protect every scientist that is working on time travel technology, learns about the dangers of time travel and chooses not to use it for now, draws the machines’ attention to it and prompts their effort of developing a workaround, and ultimately manages to win the war for humanity – it takes them longer though since Skynet is stronger and John II’s knowledge of the future is a lot more vague. Once again the machines take the doomsday option and send back a massively improved machine (they could save on decades of development and research thanks to Miles Dyson and had more time to develop it as the human resistance had less knowledge of the future) and John II reacts by sending back a terminator of his own, right into....

Now he's not just any detective, he's the world's greatest detective and with that comes keeping great records and thinking things through before doing them. Also bruce is a philanthropist and I don't think that a man like bruce would be able to disappear and just leave Blake the batcave and nothing else. 

We know that because of the events of The Dark Knight, Batman has already spawned copy cats and we know how much bruce hated them. We also know that the events in the Dark Knight Rises involved a international criminal and the US army quarantining a whole city. The first thing a person like bruce would fear after such an event is that regardless of whether or not bane succeeded there would be imitators. 

Bruce hates imitators because they can never be as prepared as him. They can only go out with small arms and poor armor. And he knows that they're going to go up against the Bane-esque regimes which oppress them alone and that they're going to fail. So he leaves Blake the batcave and an orphanage not so he can become batman but so that he can find people around the world who are trying to be batman, bring them back to gotham, train them, provide them with an honor code and the necessary equipment. Every month or so Blake and Alfred would travel to different parts of the world following leads. 

This allows the stories to follow different characters through different experiences with international enemies. It allows for the creation of Nightwing and Batgirl and all sorts of new heroes that don't even exist yet. It also removes that strange leap of faith you have to take in the batman universe that somehow this massive rogues gallery spawned in just one city. 

Imagine them traveling to morocco to find an acrobat who's trying to stop small crime in his city and training him to be the nolanverse version of Dick Grayson then having him be in charge of fighting Dr. Hugo Strange in the Ivory Coast who's performing genetic experiments to form monsters like Man-Bat and Killer Croc. 

Imagine later on the son of Bruce and Selina Kyle runs away from home finds them and wants to be trained. But then you find out its actually an italian Clayface in disguise. 

Plus they'd have to have their own Lucius Foxs to build Batman weapons outside of Gotham. Imagine them hiring a reluctant Victor Freis who really only wants to continue his work of cryogenics but has lost his funding and needs the money. 

And then that's not even counting all the cool new villains. Imagine finding Harley Quinzel, a girl in the UK who's so obsessed with the Joker that she starts cutting up the faces of people in her town so they can be more beautiful. 

Or finding the scarecrow hiding out in colombia or equator making his way up the government ranks with his fear toxin laced drugs. 

Imagine all the betrayal when they unknowingly start training versions of Deadshot and Firefly.

Christ, I would even watch the episode where they travel to Australia to aid a vigilante who's been killing poachers and create the Nolanverse version of Catman.

1366885219.0,94,self.FanTheories,1d2pb6,Diddy Kong is the antagonist of the Donkey Kong Country series,132,38,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1d2pb6/diddy_kong_is_the_antagonist_of_the_donkey_kong/,"In the Donkey Kong Country games, did you ever notice the sheer volume of bananas held by each boss? Its a gargantuan stack, that continues further than the eye can see, stacked at least 10 feet tall. Theres a boss for all 7 areas, including Gangplank Galleon and each one has one of these stashes, or an even bigger stash.

These are all DK's bananas. What is he even going to do with all those bananas? Theres enough there to end world hunger. Ripe bananas are only good for 2 weeks most and for most of that they're only good for smoothies. The conclusion we can draw from this is that DK is an extreme hoarder. The ape lives in a tiny, dilapidated shack. Why? His grandfather is the original DK, he should be rolling in fat stacks of cash. Instead, he lives in a crappy tree house, and has no earthly possessions aside from his house and his one article of clothing.

Donkey is also clearly, to whatever degree, mentally handicapped. Any neuro-typical ape would be able to realise that they were no better off for having such a huge supply of perfectly ripe bananas. His intense, dark gaze suggests to me he may be a victim of foetal alcohol syndrome. The diagnosis fits - he's definitely below average height - his nephew, Diddy, the chimpanzee is comparable in height - he has below average motor skills, he has poor impulse control as well as a number of physical markers.

DK doesn't really have the planning skills to acquire such a hoard of bananas however. He likes them, sure, but his limited attention span and impulse control means he often gets distracted. This is where Diddy comes into the equation. 

Diddy suffers from Munchausen syndrome by proxy. There's a little more proof for this in DKC 2. He's ultimately Donkey's enabler - he's the one with the intellect, patience and planning to acquire such a hoard.

King K Rool is not a dictator. He is not an invader, he is a doctor. His only job is to ensure Donkey's health and safety. In the first Donkey Kong Country game, he removes a substantial portion of Donkey's hoard of bananas. He leaves a few behind, knowing he has some psychological desire for them, but he recognises that Donkey has a hoarding problem. So he removes them and has them disposed of by his staff, such as Very Gnawty and Necky, in various places so Donkey can't track them and retrieve them.

Diddy however knows whats up and subsequently assists Donkey in retrieving his hoard. 

Finally, DK and Diddy manage to reach King K Rool himself. This is the last straw for King K Rool. KKR has DK admitted to a psychiatric hospital, both to treat him as an in-patient and to remove him from the bad influence of Diddy.This is where DKC2 kicks off - with Diddy labouring under the delusion that KKR is a cruel dictator who has kidnapped his handicapped uncle. Diddy also manages to drag Dixie into this drama. The need to be seen as a hero is a common aspect of Munchausen syndrome by proxy. 

In DKC3 we see that Dixie really isn't that much better- charged with the task of rescuing Donkey from his institutionalisation and Diddy from police custody (due to criminal charges laid for his disorder-related behaviour, as well as for killing a shitload of KKR's employees), Dixie repeatedly endangers her baby brother's life by leading him into a large number of increasingly dangerous situations and locations.

Ultimately Diddy is the antagonist here. Not only does he endanger his uncle's health by acquiring a large number of soon-to-be-festering bananas for him, he also acts to ensure Donkey Kong receives none of the help he needs to treat his hoarding problem. Because of his behaviour, he endangers the lives of his uncle, his girlfriend and her infant brother. On top of this he slaughters countless Kremlings and repeatedly assaults a well respected psychiatrist. All so that he can be the centre of attention and perceived as a hero.

What an asshole.

TLDR- Donkey Kong is a mentally handicapped hoarder, but Diddy Kong enables his behaviour and sabotages Donkey Kong's treatment. King K Rool is just trying to get DK help by institutionalising him and ""steals"" his bananas because the piles of rotting fruit are hazardous to DK's health.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1d2pb6,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1d2pb6/diddy_kong_is_the_antagonist_of_the_donkey_kong/,
1365911986.0,96,self.FanTheories,1cb4zv,[fan theory] Mushroom Kingdom Government,116,20,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1cb4zv/fan_theory_mushroom_kingdom_government/,"I've had an idea on how the Mushroom Kingdom runs, as a political force for a while, and just found this subreddit, and feel it's the place to share this.

From the different games, we know that the Mushroom Kingdom has several different lands with different themes, Super Mario Brothers 3 began this with the smaller kingdoms, and every game after has castles in each of the unique worlds.  Which can be seen as a sign that each of these smaller worlds is it's own kingdom.

Try to think of it like the empire in Dune. I think it can be argued that the Mushroom Kingdom is run similar to the Padishah Empire.

Each of the different Kingdoms is run by it's own King/Queen, or Duke, or Lord.  They run the smaller scale government activities and keep their citizens happy. They create their own culture and society, but they pledge allegiance to the Mushroom Kingdom as their empire.  Peach is not the de facto ruler, but more of an Ambassador figure.  She is heir to the throne, but for now handles relations with the kingdoms ruled by the Mushroom Empire as well as Relations with outside kingdoms (Like Dinosaur Land and Isle Delfino).

My clearest evidence is, as I stated, Mario 3 with all the different kingdoms that Mario is saving on behalf of the Princess until she is captured.  This is Peach trying to protect her kingdom by using her most valuable tools, Mario and Luigi.

My second evidence is Bowser.  Bowser is a King within the Mushroom Kingdom, he seeks power more than anything else.  His lands, the volcano worlds, are his to rule as he chooses, but still holds loyalty to the Emperor.

This explains his need to kidnap Peach and marry her. He wants to be the next emperor of the Kingdom.  Peach remains unmarried, has no sisters or brothers, and she doesn't marry Mario despite love because she is a Princess and must keep her options open for Political reasons.

This explains why Bowser is never punished for his crimes, he has the second most powerful force in the Kingdom (behind Mario and Luigi), so none of the other kingdoms want to battle his forces, his forces are a match for the Mushroom Kingdoms, and easily overwhelm the other kingdoms, he is a viable threat and keeping him in power means he just, more or less, tries to kidnap Peach to marry her, or conquers outside kingdoms (like Dinosaur Land). Though Kidnapping the princess can be seen as a crime, it's known his intentions are to marry her, and thus not hurt her, which means she's physically safe, and that Bowser cannot force her to marry... without mind control.  Meaning once Bowser has Peach, his only real option is to convince her to marry him.  Something he cannot do.

This also explains why outside of the political spectrum, he is seen playing games with the other people.  He takes part in the various sporting events across the kingdom and races go-karts, and the others do not seem weirded out by this.

Comstock (The Prophet) - .com, stock and profit. Everything here seems to relate to capitalism, almost the other end of the spectrum to the ideals he seems to demonstrate throughout the game.

Cornelius Slate - I imagine this has something to do with Booker's slate that he attempts to wipe clean with the baptism, as mentioned by the priest, perhaps a physical manifestation of it.  Comstock who is a  baptized Booker is accused of rewriting history, purposely removing Booker and in doing so Slate from the Battle of the Wounded Knee, in essence wiping his slate clean.   

The Lutece Twins - although these are pretty major characters I don't have much to say other than that Lutece is a Roman city where upon Paris was built.  The same city Elizabeth is fixated by!!! Also the firstnames begin with the same two letters but I'm sure you figured that one out yourself.

Constance Field - I only have A level physics and one playthrough of the game but I imagine this is alluding to a constants field, a field that permeates through every single universe providing them all with certainties, as Elizabeth puts it ""a man, a city, a lighthouse"" onto which the variables build.

Booker - Thanks to TheAngryRobot. An fairly simple one, Booker sounds a lot with Bookies to whom he owes a debt

Four protagonists—John Cusack, Rob Corddry, and Craig Robinson (Darryl from “The Office”), friends since childhood, plus John Cusack's geeky nephew played by Clark Duke—go on a weekend trip to their cherished ski getaway for some male bonding. None of them are particularly happy with their respective lives, and they've drifted apart. A time-traveling hot tub in their room allows them to re-live the raunchy ski trip that they took together in 1986. They spend about a day and a half in 1986, sometimes trying to re-create the events that took place the first time and sometimes trying to alter their past in order to improve their adult lives.

In the end, everyone returns to 2010 in the hot tub except for Rob Corddry, whose adult life is so hopelessly crappy that he decides to remain in 1986 to live it up with his knowledge of future history. Those that traveled through time discover that the world in 2010 has changed (for the better), and they live happily ever after.

**How does the time travel work?**  
To explain why this movie is different from other time-travel movies, it's important to note a few things. When they travel back in time, they all discover that, to everyone but the four of them, they look like they did in 1986. Except for Clark Duke, who wasn't born at that point and still looks like his 2010 self.

It's very significant that there are not two copies of each of them walking around the ski resort. While the three friends did drive up to the ski lodge for a weekend in 1986, along with John Cusack's sister and Craig Robinson's band and other friends, the 2010 characters can never meet them, because they are living in their bodies. What seems to have happened is that the four characters climb into the hot tub during their ski weekend in 2010, just as the three of them climbed into the same hot tub in 1986, and during this 2010 hot tub event the minds of those characters entered their corresponding bodies during the 1986 hot tub event.

Actually, we don't know if they are “possessing” the bodies of the revised-timeline version of their 1986 selves, or if the hot tub is doing some kind of astral projection, or something else. Clark Duke presumably materialized into existence sitting in the hot tub, so maybe the other three did, as well. If this is the case, the bodies of the three “versions” of them who drove up to the ski lodge are gone. It makes no difference in either case. What is important is that, during the day and a half between time jumps, there are three people walking around in 1986 bodies with 2010 brains (and one person with a 2010 body and a 2010 brain). “Brain” here could also refer to the character's mind, consciousness, personality, memory, continuity of experience, or any other philosophical term for their mental self.

Once they return to 2010, John Cusack, Craig Robinson, and Clark Duke find out what has changed in the world. They are apparently better friends than they were, they have different jobs, and different homes. However, none of them remember what “they” did between 1986 and 2010. The assumption is that John Cusack and Craig Robinson reverted to the “versions” of them that drove up to the ski lodge in 1986, who probably were confused about the blacked-out day and a half of their lives. Little do they realize that Rob Corddry is still a middle-aged man from the future inhabiting their friend's 1986 body...

**The nightmare begins**  
What happens to the 80s guys who went on a ski trip in the revised timeline? Their lives were, we assume, identical in absolutely every way as the original timeline until the hot tub event, which occurred in the revised timeline but not in the original. Maybe there was only one timeline and the hot tub time machine diverged the space-time continuum into two branches, like in Back to the Future. It doesn't really matter.

So, these three guys went on a ski trip in the revised timeline, until one morning their bodies were taken over by the minds of three hung-over middle-aged men. A day and a half later their bodies revert to their control. Their friends can tell them about all the wacky things they did and how they talked about things as if they were from the future, but they'll eventually get over it, perhaps with some therapy. Later, Clark Duke is born and never knows what happened in 1986 or what he had to do with those events. They go home and live out their lives, probably never even suspecting that Rob Corddry has the mind of a middle-aged loser from twenty-five years in the future.

Though they might be confused by what happened during the day and a half of the 1986 ski trip, the younger versions of John Cusack and Craig Robinson live out their lives normally from the years 1986 until 2010. Their friend (Rob Corddry) still has the mind of a strange parallel universe Rob Corddry, but they don't know that. Eventually, in 2010, the characters from the ""first"" timeline (depressed John Cusack, Craig Robinson, Clark Duke, who traveled to 1986 and then jumped forward) ""catch up"" to the timeline that they altered. This has the effect of permanently replacing these people, who were likely not very happy to be erased from existence so that alternate versions of them could live a more comfortable life, even if the movie seemingly validates their primacy by narratively following them.

If this is true, then these four characters are the unlucky victims of a dimensional conquest by loser doppelgangers. First to go is 1986 Rob Corddry. He goes to the mountain with his two friends and, one morning, his mind is wiped and replaced with the consciousness of an alternate-universe version of himself from the future. The mind who went to the mountain never returns at all and is, for all intents and purposes, erased from existence. The poor guy. Then his two friends return to their old selves and live on, with Clark Duke being born. These people are not the “real” John Cusack, Craig Robinson, and Clark Duke only in the sense that they have no memory of what the audience saw during the movie. In every other way, though, they are real people, and from their perspective they are being devoured by universe-hopping duplicates who come from a universe where they are middle-aged losers.

If the ski trip in 2010 wasn't Rob Corddry's idea, he must have encouraged it, or at least didn't warn them that their minds were about to be destroyed to make room in their bodies for the minds of his three friends from a parallel universe to inhabit. Indeed, Rob Corddry has now taken on the role of the life-sucking vampire who is preparing unsuspecting vessels for the sacrifice.

[**Diagram of the timelines.**](http://i.imgur.com/ZSU7d.png)

We can see where this leads. Rob Corddry, perhaps 18 in 1986, lived through 2010, when he would be 42. He then re-lived the years between 1986 and 2010, so that the man at the end of Hot Tub Time Machine is 66 years old, in the body of a 42 year-old. Soon this middle-aged vessel will grow old and decrepit, unsuitable for a being which has unlocked immortality. He transcends his human limitations by returning to the hot tub time machine and using to travel to yet another alternate dimension, feeding off of dimensional clones of himself to sustain his physical body. Each cycle ages his mind but renews his body, and he clings to immortality until his consciousness is so stretched that he can hardly function, eventually dying as a depraved psychic parasite, driven insane by the ravages of time. **I want to see that movie.**",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,1356537859.0,,,True,t3_15g2ko,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/15g2ko/hot_tub_time_machine_is_a_scifi_horror_story/,

The ""Law"" is that every person has a destiny they must follow to achieve true happiness, ergo the phrase means that everyone shall do what they should and act according to this law.

Okay, me and my SO have been recently watching Labyrinth a couple times and have come up with some theories regarding the whole mythos.

The first thing I came up with was that Jareth (played by David Bowie), the 'Goblin' King, isn't actually a goblin. He's actually a baby that was wished away and never claimed. At one point Jareth is cradling Toby and he says something along the lines of ""He's a spry young fellow, I think I'll name him Jareth."" This sort of sparked the idea that each goblin king is a long line of stolen babies turned kings named Jareth.

A second thing that made us go 'what the fuck' was the trash people. One trash lady was pretty creepy, but if you look in the background there are many many trash people. They're all the previous brothers/sisters/mothers/fathers who wished their babies away and tried to get them back. It's the last 'test' before the castle. If you look here, terrible quality, you can see that the garbage lady is piling things on top of Sarah and trying to turn her into a trash person. I wasn't too sure on the reasoning for this but possibly something like ""If I can't have my baby, why should you?"" In all possibility, that lady could be Jareth's previous guardian. They both have blonde hair.

Probably my last dumb theory is that Jareth needed Toby and that he is just following goblin law. He needed Toby to be his successor. Goblin law probably is something like 'if someone wishes a baby away they have the right to come to the goblin castle and retrieve it.' Jareth has literally no power to interfere that would completely stop Sarah; blah blah 'you have no power over me'. Jareth wasn't sad about losing a baby, he was said about losing a successor and a son. His company all day is dumb crazy goblins that don't get his jokes.

Okay I'm done, that last part is just sleep depraved ramblings. I would love to hear some other theories.

**E.T.: The Extraterrestial**, upon first viewing, is a nice heartwarming tale of alien friendship. But E.T.'s powers (levitating things basically) are never really explained, other than to make it seem like some sort of ""power of love/friendship"" sort of thing. Rather than ""friendship"", it seems more plausible that E.T. is benefiting from the use of the Force. Like ""friendship"", the Force is a a power that surrounds us, binds us, etc., but unlike friendship, has demonstrable effects (e.g. levitating shit). When E.T. says ""I'll be right here"", he doesn't just mean in Elliot's memories/heart; he literally will be with him with his Force powers that manifest everywhere (similar to Jedi masters appearing to their students after they die, Luke ""talking"" to Vader despite not being close enough to actually talk, etc.). E.T. has mastered the Force.

E.T. even takes place in our own universe, while still being in the Star Wars universe. Although the Star Wars setting - ""a galaxy far far away"" - is, well, far, far away from us, the story events did occur a long time ago, giving them time for technological advancement to reach us.

Standing 700ft tall, The Wall is the most awe-inspiring and mystifying landmark in the whole of Westeros. 

Legends say it was constructed 8000 years ago by one Brandon the Builder, forebears to the Stark family. He supposedly used magic to raise a wall 300 miles long made with nothing but **ice.**

No one knows how he accomplished it, save for some age old stories that sound more like fairy-tale fiction and whimsy conjecture than factual historical accounts.

The reason for this is simple - Bran didn't build it. **History is written by the victors.** Man won the War for the Dawn, and they did so by grabbing their dragonglass spears, wielding their swords of fire, and *breaching* The Wall - the last line of defence put up by none other than the White Walkers themselves.

Who else would be more suitable to construct a 700ft wall of ice than creatures that are themselves *made from ice.* The Wall existed far before the First Men came to the shores of Westeros, but what better way to extol the power and supremacy of humankind by claiming such a breathtaking monument as their own. The symbol of it's power has been able to establish a dynasty that has lasted thousands of years. 

And now The First Men have invaded the native's lands, settling cities like Hardhome, establishing clans like the Thenns and brazenly sending their ilk as far north as their bodies will let them. Azor Ahai invaded the North, and drove out the natives like the Americans driving out the Red Indians. The greed of man has driven them away from their homes and into the Lands of Always Winter. 

And now the White Walkers want it back.

I think that every event in the ""Sugar Rush"" game is a retelling of ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"". Every event mirrors that of an event in Willy Wonka.

Let's get the obvious out of the way. Everything in Sugar Rush is made out of [candy](http://www.topnewstoday.org/i5/1/35/37/img_3437351_620.jpg), just as it is in [Willy Wonka's factory](http://static.thecia.com.au/reviews/w/willy-wonka-and-the-chocolate-factory-0.jpg). Which can easily just be coincidental. 

**1.** Before Ralph gets into Sugar Rush he wins a [medal in Hero's Duty](http://s3.amazonaws.com/kidzworld_photo/images/20121024/5db9dac7-ca61-4e22-bd15-c630854a78d8/wreck-it-ralph.jpg), similar to Charlie winning a golden ticket to gain access to [Willy Wonka's factory](http://onesmartcookiemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/golden-ticket.jpg). 

Now is where we get into some of the very cool stuff. Each ending the children in Willy Wonka go through happens in Wreck-it Ralph. What do I mean?

**2.** In Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Augustus Gloop is first to go whenever [he falls into the river of chocolate](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zpYwruJ2WMs/T5NiR84T_QI/AAAAAAAAAcA/6U44pAQ817g/s1600/augustusgloop.jpg).
In Wreck-it Ralph, as soon as Ralph gets to Sugar Rush he and the alien aboard the ship with him are ejected from the ship. The alien and Ralph go flying. With the alien [landing in a river of cupcake icing and sinking into it.](http://i.imgur.com/mZkob.jpg) (Sorry about the picture quality, best I could get, I don't know how to make gifs).

**3.** Next to go in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is Violet Beauregarde. She eats some experimental gum and [turns into a blueberry](http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01144/Violet-Beuauregard_1144888a.jpg).
In Wreck-it Ralph, Ralph gets a lot of icing stuck to him, then runs through a candy forest getting candy stuck to him as well. Finally, having a cupcake fall on him, wedging him into it. Giving him the appearance of Violet as a blueberry [only green](http://i.imgur.com/pV2LJ.jpg).

**4.** Next up for Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is Charlie himself, him and his grandpa drink the Fizzy Lifting soda and start [floating towards the awesome blades of death](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0xr4x2UrQ1r5b2x3.jpg). Their only way to get down is to burp their way down.
In Wreck-it Ralph, Fix-it Felix and Calhoun both [drop into the Nestle quicksand](http://i.imgur.com/lU21U.jpg). With the only way for them to escape is for them to make some vines laugh so they can get out. Instead of burping to get down, it's laughing to get up.


**5.** Next to last on the list for Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is the wonderfully ungrateful Veruca Salt. Who is deemed to be a bit of a bad egg and [falls down a chute](http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_livlasMIHM1qfrvc9o1_500.gif). Mirrored in Wreck-it Ralph, by Fix-it Felix who has the welcome mat pulled out from under him and is dropped [down a chute into the fungeon below](http://i.imgur.com/Zl5zY.jpg).

**6.** Last and my favorite personally, we have Mike Teavee from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Now, in the film Mike is made miniature to be in a TV. While in Wreck-it Ralph no one is made miniature, one character has an uncanny resemblance to Mike Teavee when he is made miniature. Here's [Mike](http://i.imgur.com/QrKPT.jpg) and here is the villain [Turbo](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcxg4fRXrt1qesinx.png) from Wreck-it Ralph ([Here's](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcygf98Rm81qj5m83o1_500.png) a better picture of him).

Sorry about picture quality on some of these, it's the best I could do. So, I wanted to lay out some of the fantastic work done in this film. A few these may seems slightly like a stretch, but keep in mind that each of these were done in the exact same order as Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.

Wreck-it Ralph seems like a great film for subtle references hidden just below the surface - would love to hear your thoughts. 

Either way I appreciate you taking the time to read all my ramblings.

Now, if the two stories  took place in the same universe, I'm sure they would just come out and say it, but consider this a fun, crackpot theory that actually makes a good bit of sense:



**1. The World**

After Primer, the effects of Abe and Aaron's time travel increase exponentially, due to more doubles being made. We don't even know how many were made over the course of Primer, but the final (as far as I can tell) Aaron goes to France to make an even bigger time machine, which most likely leads to more confusion and negative effects, and the original Abe and Aaron (the ones locked in the attic) may not stop their experiments, even at the warnings of Aaron 2 left by voicemail.

These ever expanding changes to the timeline, carried out by doubles with no more ethical caution than their originators, is what leads to the civil unrest and rampant crime we see in 2044.

Aaron's experiments in France, however harmful, do manage to produce a safe, stable form of time travel that doesn't require the user to stay in the machine for as long as they wish to travel back in time. 



**2. Telekinesis**

Prolonged exposure to the time machines on the environment is what causes 10% of the population to receive TK powers. Abe and Aaron's bodies are too deteriorated by their multiple trips inside the flawed, prototype machines to be able to get the powers, but slowly people living in cities where the machines are active start showing signs of TK.



**3. Abe**

The Abe we see in Looper is the very same Abe from Primer (as to *which* Abe, we can't be entirely sure). They look close enough for this to be a possibility:


http://www.imdb.com/media/rm581609728/tt1276104


http://www.imdb.com/media/rm3315972608/tt0390384

The idea here is that Abe can't perform his job as an engineer due to the negative effects of the machine (when he says ""This time travel shit fries your brain,"" he means it quite literally). He loses his job, becomes bitter and angry, and somehow begins working for the mob. He proceeds to grow a beard, [because this is clearly the darkest timeline.] (http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120308222811/community-sitcom/images/0/0f/RCT_Evil_Abed.png) When time travel is invented, Abe's experience as one of the few people to travel time makes him uniquely qualified to be sent back and manage the Loopers.

(This would be in direct opposition to the popular theory that Abe is the older version of Kid Blue, but that theory, while possible, is far from concrete)

This may seem impossible at first glance, given his age. Old Abe would have had to travel back to 2044 from sometime closer to 2074. Going by actor David Sullivan's age, let's assume 2004 Abe (the one from Primer) was 27. Wouldn't that make Looper Abe anywhere from 77-97?

While it is true that Jeff Daniels is only 57, that doesn't necessarily mean that the Abe we see in Looper isn't older. Future advances in healthcare could have slowed the aging process.

Creepers are a very specialized fungus. A mold, to be specific.

The reason for this is twofold. One? Creepers only seem to spawn at night, and mold are known for preferring the dark. Two? The exploding.

""But themightyyool, what does exploding have to do with them being mold?"" You may ask. Simple! Most mold, in order to spread their spores, *explode the part of their mass that contains them*. A creeper's seeming aggressiveness is just them rushing towards movement in this reproductive mode, in order to ensure their spores are able to spread. By being carried on you.  And the hissing? Them taking in air to ignite the naturally produced gunpowder they contain for the sole purpose of this last act of reproduction.

So yes, Creepers aren't out to murder you, they're just trying to ensure their spores get spread by one of the few living things that ranges farther than most animals. Their size just has the unfortunate side effect of nearly killing you.

That is, assuming Creeper Mold isn't a carrion-feeding mold in the first place.

Basically ""bending"" is a form of martial arts which allows the user to take control of certain elements (earth, air, fire, water) and utilize them. Bending is not actually a natural phenomenon learned from the spirits, it was invented thousands of years ago through a combination of nanites and genetic engineering to allow people to take control of the elements, utilizing nearby sources of energy (such as the sun or the moon) to power said nanites.

The ""bending"" genes passed along to their offspring. Naturally, not all people could afford this sort of expensive treatment, which is why many non-benders remain in the world. 

These people are of course, highly dangerous, so the government of the time established the Avatar program in order to help control these new walking bioweapons. This person would be trained from birth to be more powerful than all possible benders. His nanites would store the information from all past Avatars and utilize his bending prowess as a defense mechanism (the Avatar state).

Becoming the Avatar is actually a genetic precondition to all types of bending. The nanites from a previous Avatar are little by little left behind in the world, and once they find a suitable candidate for the next one (after their original host has died), allow him to bend all four elements.

This helps to explain all the weird combo animals that are around the world. They are stronger and better than most others, which is why normal animals have been replaced, and show a society out of control with splicing genes and creating new creatures. There is only one ""normal"" animal left, Bosco, a bear.

The spirit world is really the remnants of a global AI database, which the Avatar is given direct access to as part of his government-issued nanites.

Anyways, at some point in the past, there was an apocalyptic event that caused all of the technological aspects of this society to disappear. The only remnants are the bending, which is passed along naturally, and the various creatures that seem to have resulted.

**Just like a chick in the casino**


From the main chorus,

**No he can't read my poker face**

Meaning that the speaker is trying to hide something from a man. 


Furthermore:

**I won't tell you that I love you**

Won't speak, because the the voice is a giveaway.

**Kiss or hug you**

**Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin**

Won't get too close before the time is right, because its possible that any early contact could give her away. Because the cross dresser is literally bluffin with her muffin.


Then:

**I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be**

Meaning that when they roll together they will both be hard, or both have erections, because they are both male. After that there are more penis references:

**I'm not lying I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue-gunning**

""love glue gun"" if taken innocently means that she'll make him adhere to ""her"", but it could also mean she has a ""gun"" that shoots ""love glue"".

**Russian Roulette is not the same without a gun**

Refers to the thrill the cross dresser gets from gambling on whether the man will react positively to the final reveal. It's also why:

**Luck and intuition play the cards with Spades to start**

Because you need luck and intuition to find someone who will respond positively.


**And after he's been hooked I'll play the one that's on his heart**
AND
**I'll get him hot, show him what I've got**

Refers to the process of getting the man excited, and then revealing, in the hopes that he'll overcome inhibitions and have sex anyway. This of course could go in the other direction and end with anger/ and or violence which is why:


**And baby when it's love if its not rough it isn't fun, fun**
AND
**Fold em' let em' hit me raise it baby stay with me (I love it)**

The ""stay with me"" is repeated in the last appeal of the song:

**Take your bank before I pay you out**

Meaning the man could be convinced to receive fellatio, but not go any further. (Could also explain the **Muh muh muh mah**, which could be us hearing a ""hummer"")


**I promise this, promise this**
**Check this hand cause I'm marvelous**
Meaning the cross dresser considers him/herself to be hot enough to pick the man up, and to be worth going further with.

Given the fact that Arkham Asylum's own Dr. Crane was aiding foreign terrorists and inciting panic by releasing fear toxin, it's unlikely arkham asylum remains open (batman begins).

Plus Joker's crimes are more then just one occurrence, but many many severe crimes, including somehow acquiring a bazooka and using it.

Dr. Crane somehow manages to avoid prison time, or at least isn't in prison long enough to do squat. So suggesting that arkham asylum is well enabled to hold someone like the joker for very long, isn't likely with gotham's form of government.

Given the sheer number of crimes the joker pulls off, including inciting a riot, robbery, assassination of a public figure, and bombing a hospital. His crimes are going to be placed on a national scale. 

The dent act is somehow passed with no known resistance from the supreme court, so the feds are probably cool with it.

They'd probably more then willing to treat the joker as a terrorist and throw him away in some dirt hole without telling anyone.

All it takes is some mob payouts and Joker's got more then enough parties interested in keeping him away for ever.


Guantanamo bay seems like the perfect location for joker to be sent to because with the events surrounding the dent act, joker's a threat to the nation, given that he could do the exact same thing somewhere else. 

He has more then enough firepower to be declared a foreign combatant, and nobody knows who he is or where he comes from, So he could be an american, but nobody actually knows.

The song proclaims all of the usual Team Rocket's high lofty goals (Controlling the world, being King, etc.), and so it has always amused me that the big goal in the song is capturing Pikachu.  It made me start thinking about the theory I've had on why Team Rocket was so obsessed with Pikachu that I've never heard anyone else talk about.

Basically my theory is based on episode 9 of the first season of Pokemon, in which Pikachu uses an electric shock to defeat a Cubone.  Being fairly obsessed with Pokemon at my young age, I was able to call bullshit on the fact that an electric attack was able to damage a ground type (even if, as the show implied, you tried ""really hard"").

My theory is that up until this point Team Rocket were just trying to steal Pikachu because Ash and Pikachu made a fool of them time and time again, and they were out for revenge, but after witnessing Pikachu ignore a pokemon's immunities (specifically ground's immunity to electric), they started to think that it was something special, and wanted to research why Pikachu was able to do something that should be impossible.

In that light, Team Rocket's singular obsession with a uncommon, but not terribly hard to acquire pokemon makes sense.  The ability to ignore type advantages / immunities in a world which has an economy, social structure, and entertainment almost solely based around pokemon battles would be worth a fortune at worst, and depending on what the research produced could fundamentally change the world's understanding of how pokemon work (and to have the keys to the new understanding).  The sole power to change / ignore / add immunity could quite literally give you control over the pokemon world.  It explains why Giovanni continues to allow Jesse / James to be in Team Rocket (we already know he is trying to genetically create the ""perfect"" pokemon), why Jesse and James are so willing to spend money on harebrained schemes to steal Pikachu, and more than anything else, why they are so damn persistant in their quest for a ""normal"" Pokemon.

I've actually always kind of had this as my personal head canon, and since I've never really heard anyone else talk about it, I thought I would share it here.

Hopefully a good discussion comes out of it. I know it's quite lengthy please bare with me.

**TL;DR: You need Timeline A to occur in it's original state for Timeline B, C , D to take variation. Am I right or wrong? Read below**

Some notes before my timeline theory below begins: 

*Terminator 1 and 2 are canonical 'Terminator Timeline' events.
*Terminator 3 kind of distorts some of the established doctrine but shows us a glimpse into what the 'Original Timeline' 1997 judgment day looked like.
*TSCC the show can be considered a third timeline all on it's own and does not follow the 'Original Timeline' or 'Terminator Timeline'.
*Terminator 4: Salvation, is the result of the 'Terminator Timeline'

-------------------------------------------

 Original Timeline:
1) 1980's: An unnamed person impregnates Sarah Chonnor, John Connor is born. 
2) S. Connor dies of cancer some time in the 90s. 
2*)Americans (Companies /Government?) create Skynet, a military software that is given control of mobile weapon platforms and planes.
3)1997 Skynet becomes self aware, nuclear holocaust ensues. 
4) 2020's The Human Resistance wins under J. Connor. Skynet in it's last ditch effort creates a wonder weapon: Time Travel. It sends back a Terminator to assassinate Sarah Connor in the 80's. Connor finds this out, in turn sends back one of his best soldiers: Kyle Reese
--End of the Original Timeline, unaltered events--

**Begin what I call the ""Terminator Timeline"" which is basically what we see in all the movies, as follows:**

1) 1980's: Kyle Reese/ T-800 appear. Reese finds  S. Connor, protects her, impregnates her which the child happens to becomes John Connor. Good guys win, Kyle Reese from the future dies, terminator arm left behind in the wreckage of the fighting.
2) Early 90's, Dyson @ Cyberdine systems studies the strange technology (Recovered from the T1Movie salvage) which research developed into what would be Skynet.
3) 2020's: Skynet (still presumably in a near-defeated state) sends back a T-1000. Connor replies by sending a reprogrammed T-800.
4) 1990's: J. Connor is a teenager, T-1000 is trying to kill him, Arnold is sent back.
5) 1990's:  Teenage J. Connor &amp; company manage to destroy the salvaged Arm &amp; Chip, Cyberdene systems information (Dyson dies), the  T-1000 and Arnold suicides to help prevent the technology from being discovered.
6) Judgement day seems to be averted, for now. 1997 passes without a hiccup. Sarah Connor dies of cancer in the following years.
**This is where Terminator 3 lore kicks in**
7) Late 2020's / Early 2030's, A Terminator manages to kill John Connor. His wife captures it and reprograms it. 
8)Skynet in it's final breathe sends one last mission back in time with the upgraded T-X. Mrs. Connor responds by sending back the reprogrammed Terminator.
9) 2000's: The T-X hunts the would-be Connors, simultaneously beginning to execute would-be resistance officers and leaders and 
helps speed up the Ascension and control of Skynet.
10) 2000's: The Connors realize the beginnings of Skynet, survive the T-X and take refuge in the old NORAD base. They help coordinate survivors and organize.
11) 2000's: Judgement day occurs, Skynet nukes Russia, Russia responds.

Which we finish off with Terminator 4: Salvation. According to my theory, Salvation is a product of the 'Terminator Timeline' and NOT the 'Original Timeline' because of several things:
1) J. Connor has intimate knowledge of Terminators from experience and recordings from Sarah Connor recordings. Difference: The original Sarah Connor never lived to see them/knew about it, John Connor experiences them for the first time in the O.T. in present day.
2) The good-guy Terminator is a hybrid of human and machine. 
Difference: In the O.T. , that never existed at all (not counting the faux-flesh).
3) John Connor recognizes the Arnold- Terminator.  Difference: In the O.T., J. Connor would of met the Arnold Terminator for the first time.

And so on and so on.

Immortality doesn't exist yet, but genetically having close to perfect health does. Gattaca's political and economic system is very much a corrupt capitalistic society and we get to see one man's struggle to fight the system.  Sometime between the movies there is a violent revolution. The new government uses technology to solve the two major social issues in Gattaca: Only some people having perfect genetics and the distribution of wealth being in favor of the perfect people.

So, after the revolution the government builds this time-based fairness system and all newborns get perfect immortal bodies. During this time there are more scientific breakthroughs, some of which censored by the previous Gattaca government, so implementation of this system is practical.  Everyone gets x amount of time when they turn 18 and the only way to get more time is through the virtue of work.  For a while, there were no wealthy people and everything worked as a communist paradise, but things got corrupt. Banking laws were reformed or Weis hacked the time system to build banks or both. Now the communist system has been corrupted by capitalist influence, the central government now weak, and we're back to the problems of Gattaca- the rich and connected having access to resources that the poor do not.

On top of that, the two worlds look very alike (Streets, architecture, etc)  There also seems to be a nostalgic fondness for the types of cars people in Gattaca used as some of the super-rich in In Time have the same art deco style cars from Gattaca.  This is like collecting 1957 Fords or other classic cars. 

There is also some hinting of this during In Time. When discussing the the time system, it seemed to be a mysterious thing of the past and no one today could understand it, nor disable or remove it. The capitalists who took over the government did their best to censor the historical reasons why the system exists and how it works. Nor do the capitalists have any incentive to reform the Time system. It works in their favor.  Research into this is censored, that is, if universities and research centers even exist in the In Time world.

The story begins when The Maitlands, a husband and wife who live in an idyllic New England country home, reside with little bother. But one day tragedy strikes and discover they're lively hoods and entire way of life has been destroyed (literally). 
They discover that they have passed through death and this place they once called, that was once theirs and theirs alone to preside over is no more. Others have now moved in and they find themselves hiding in the unlit corners of their own residents, The Deetz'. They decide as ghost perhaps they could scare their new occupants to no avail. 

Desperate they turn to another power, a person who claims they have the ability to ""exorcise"" their current assailing occupants and though they are somewhat afraid and not fully understanding of this individual and his motives-they agree. To great consequence.

Does any of this sound familiar? It should. It's what the mob tried to do to run the appointed order back out of their town.
As such when they felt the immense squeeze put upon them, they enabled the powers of an individual named the Joker- who made the promise to rid them of the force known as Batman. But as it turns out this character the Joker is on no ones side. He is in reality a monster -who sees everything to his own psychopathic ends and doesn't mind letting everyone burn in the process. His ""service"" was merely a lie . Too late does the mob realize that he is as much a threat to them as anyone else and all but consumes them with his chaotic tendencies.
Despite all this Joker the seems to take interest in one thing and one thing only: The goth inspired, black clad daughter of the living family Lydia. She is an anomaly not even accepted by her own family- a freak- so to speak who is fact the one who enables the Maitlands to ""let the clown out of the box"" so to speak. He sees part of himself in her- a freakishness, and decides he will marry her. She agrees, only if it means it will save the rest of the living family. In the end the family and Lydia together banish Beetlejuice from the house, leaving them in harmony.

Lydia- in the Jungian sense- is an archetype of The Batman- a force of good though not akin to those in their midst, but all the same. Just like Beetlejuice, The Joker saw himself in Batman. He implores even at one time ""You complete ME."" Batman was his other. And like Lydia Batman recognizes it may in fact be his fault that The Joker is even around at all. He sacrifices his own moral code to combat the Joker and in the end is not just he- people but the people of the city (The living) who disable the Joker and in turn save The Batman. An event that surely resonated with the people of that city. And like any story versions upon versions- tellings upon retellings often end up as myth or a rhyme- even though we know it was not such to begin with.

Also...if anyone were to describe these figures from these stories- different though their names may be- I can't help but find it would be difficult to know who...............they were talking about...http://i.imgur.com/FWGGf.jpg

Canonically, it is only used three times, first against Vegeta, second against Frieza, and third against Kid Buu. In the first two instances of use, it does not kill the person it hits. The third instance, however, it does kill Buu. So my hypothesis is only right two thirds of the time, right? Let me explain.

The spirit bomb is made up of all the good and pure energy that the surrounding entities will give to the user. Why would something that only the pure-hearted can use, and is made up of pure and good energy kill anything? My theory is that it was never intended to. It's a fantastic attack for incapacitating those who are evil, but the bomb itself does not contain the necessary evil required to kill. As mentioned before, the only time a spirit bomb is successful is with Buu. However, in order for the spirit bomb to kill Buu, it requires Goku to turn SSJ and push it with a Kamehameha wave, and it is these two things that cause that particular spirit bomb to be lethal. Super Saiyans cannot normally use spirit bombs; I forget where it's mentioned, but it is said that Super Saiyans cannot use spirit bombs due to the inherently malicious nature of the Super Saiyan transformation. This malice is necessary in all attacks to make them lethal, and this is the only time that 'malicious' energy and the 'good' energy of the spirit bomb are coming from the same user.

Why King Kai forgot/'forgot' to mention this, I cannot decide. Maybe you can, as well as adding any extra thoughts or criticism. Over to you, redditors!

There are two clues that support this idea.

The first one is that the BGM of the game is Japanese.

Now, I understand that just because a game has a foreign soundtrack, doesn't make that game instantly foreign. But the second clue shows the game was translated.

The Sugar Rush characters names. For a kids game, those names seem very, odd. I mean, ""Taffyta Muttonfudge"" doesn't really sound like the kind of a name you'd expect in a kids game, so it probably is a bad translation (this applies to pretty much every character in the game, excluding any candy, e.g, Sourbill).

**WARNING. SPOILER. (The spoiler formatting system is broken for me at the moment. I will try and fix this ASAP.**

(Not related to the theory, but interests me anyway, is that even though every character has a long complex name, ""Candy King"" seems very simple and shows how uncreative Turboman was when creating the name. The name is basically shouting about the fact that it doesn't belong in the game.)

I misread [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/18k6r3/invader_zim_what_is_missbitters/c8fjh1q) and came up with this theory.

Dib is a paranoical young man and a right-wing extremist, the kind of guy who would join the KKK when he grows up.

Zim is just a guy who came from another country. But Dib sees him as a threat, as an invader. He came to take our land. He really sees him as an ""illegal alien"".

His paranoia is so great that he even sees GIR as a threat. GIR is just a normal dog, but not common in the USA. So Dib sees him as a robot who disguises himself as a green dog who looks nothing like an Earth dog, but no one notices this but Dib. Why? Because he IS a fucking normal dog.

Gaz is the ""hippie daughter"" we see so much in western animation (Lisa Simpson, Hayley Smith). She's the only one besides Dib who notices that Zim is an Alien, but she doesn't care. She knows immigrants are not a threat per se. Dib thinks she's complacent with the ""enemy"", so he sees her as a sociopath and a menace to his well-being.

Dib's father. Respect thy parents. Dib sees him as a bright scientist, maybe the most intelligent person in the world. But he can't notice that Zim is an alien. Again, because Zim is just a nice immigrant.

The Almighty Tallest represent how Dib sees Zim's country. They're corrupt and inneficient, so they send their ""minions"" to other ""planets"".

Dib's classmates always side with Zim. Why? Because they know Dib's just a racist jerk.

Ms. Bitter don't exactly fit his fascist view of the world, but she is his representation of his most hated teacher, the old, strict one.

In Game of Shadows, Holmes' love interest from the previous movie is ""murdered"" in a public restaurant, in the first twenty minutes of the film. This seems like an odd way to kill off a main character. My argument is that she's not dead at all, and was either being held hostage by Moriarty, or escaped him when she was presumed dead. Let's look at the evidence.


   1.  The simplest reasoning for this, is that we never see a body, examination, or grave. The only evidence we have that she died was Moriarty, a proven bad-guy, saying that she died.
 
   2.  Irene is a very skilled at her job. Knowing the warnings that Sherlock gave to her immediately before her meeting with Moriarty, and the criminal mastermind nature of her boss, it seems unlikely that she would drink anything given to her at a place that he arrived at first. 
 
   3.   Moriarty gives Holmes a blood-stained handkerchief, saying it belonged to her. When we see Adler for the last time, she stumbles against a table, knocking over a bottle, I believe. I propose that in this time she spilled some wine onto her kerchief, then coughed on it. Moriarty believed she coughed up blood, and gave the kerchief to Holmes. In one scene of the movie, Sherlock smells a red stain in a cloth, and can identify it as wine instead of blood. Later, while on a boat, Holmes smells the kerchief Moriarty gave to him, and then throws it overboard. The passive observer may see this as Holmes ""letting go"" of Irene. Instead, however, I believe he realized that the stain was wine, and that she was still alive. 

In conclusion, I believe that Moriarty told Holmes that Adler died to piss him off, making the game more entertaining for the criminal mastermind. It's very unlikely that Moriarty would simply throw away one of his two key holds on Holmes (the other being Watson).

Again, sorry for any spoilers, and if this is painfully obvious to everyone already, I apologize for that too. Cheers.

Ultimately, he always wants to see his son succeed and have fun but he also hopes maybe he can impart some wisdom while they play together. 

Like I said, you can probably find things in plenty of episodes that break this idea out of plausibility but it's a cute way to interpret the relationship of Finn, Jake, and the world of Oo. 

If you need it to explain anything, it explains why Finn is so good at fighting for a 12-year-old, why being the only human doesn't actually bother Finn, and why Finn &amp; Jake are invincible, besides them being main characters or something.

You can expand on it too, and imagine some of the other recurring characters as friends of Finn and Jake having fun in the game world. Jake's girlfriend, Lady Rainacorn would probably just actually be Jake's girlfriend, wife, or maybe even a girl Jake wants to impress with his great fathering skills.

**Faaip-de-Oiad.** (1997)The song centers around a radio recording from 1997. A guy claiming to be from area 51 and having knowledge of aliens. This song sets up the ""container"" around what we should be thinking. Aliens, area 51, outer space, the unknown.  
   

**Lateralus.** (2072) - The name of the ship and the album. This song is about the birth of the AI and how it is feeling in his  ""infancy.""   
 
""There is so much more and it beckons me to look though to these, infinite possibilities."" Here the AI is already thinking about the infinite-like state of space and the universe. 

""Reaching out to embrace the random. Reaching out to embrace whatever may come."" he wants to explore, he wants to be put into a ship and sail through the universe.

""And following our will and wind, we may just go where no one's been. We'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been."" Here the message is clear. He wants to go where no ones been before. 

""We'll ride the spiral."" Here I would like to draw your attention to [the shape of a galaxy](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Hubble2005-01-barred-spiral-galaxy-NGC1300.jpg/300px-Hubble2005-01-barred-spiral-galaxy-NGC1300.jpg). Yup. It's a spiral.
  
  
**The Patient.** (2130) - Fast forward anoter 60 years and now the AI ""lives"" in a ship. They have set off on a mission to *where no one has been before* (see previous song). Here we get an idea of the crews thoughts and opinions whilst on their long mission. 

""If there were no rewards to reap, no loving embrace to see me through, this tedious path I’ve chosen here, I certainly would’ve walked away, by now."" They know when they get home there will be family waiting for them once their mission is over. It's the only thing stopping themselves from ""walking away"" (suicide).  
  
  
**Schism** (2170) - Fastforward another 40 years, they are returning back home. The crew are currently in Cryogenic freezing to survive the long trip back to Earth. The ship has suffered serious damage (astroid? mechanical failure? fuel leak?) and the ships AI is starting to panic as it cannot fix the problem.   

""I know the pieces fit cause I watched them fall away."" The AI witnessed the event that caused the ship to now be damaged.  

""We cannot see to reach an end crippling our communication."" Literally...their communications are crippled. They cannot call for help. They are stranded.  

""I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing. Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication."" The ships AI has done the calculations of what will happen if they dont fix the ship correctly. The cannot take chances here. Fix the problem or they will die.  

""Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any sense of compassion, Between supposed lovers, Between supposed brothers"" The crew are currently in a Cryogenic freeze to keep them alive for the long journey home. The AI is trying to wake the ships mechanic but is not succeeding at the moment. When he talks about compassion and love think....the love Kaylee has for Serenity in the TV show firefly, its that type of love and compassion the AI is referring to here.  
  
  
**Parabol** (2170)- This is told from the perspective of the ships mechanic. He/she is coming out of Cryogenic freezing. This song is told from his point of view as he/she wakes up from their long frozen state and ""embraces the reality here.""   

""We barely remember what came before this precious moment, Choosing to be here right now. Hold on, stay inside...This body holding me."" Because of the Cryo his memories are a little faded. He's been frozen a long time. He is experiencing a little memory loss whilst the AI tries to wake him up from his long dream like state.  
  
  
**Parabola** - This song is told from the point of view of the mechanic and the ships AI, switching as the song progresses. The sudden change in pace between the songs is related to the fact that the mechanic came out of his cryo dream state and heard alarms and warnings going off around the ship. His eyes open as Parabol fades into the heavier Parabola and he is now fully awake but still a little fuzzy as we see this line yet again:  

""We barely remember who or what came before this precious moment.""  

""This body. This body holding me. Be my reminder here that I am not alone in This body, this body holding me, feeling eternal all this pain is an illusion."" The chorus of the song is told from the perspective of the AI and the ""body"" he is referring to is the ship....himself... As an AI the ship is literally his body. He has just awoken the Mechanic (someone who can attempt to fix the damage) and that is the reminder that he is not alone in this body. When he talks about feeling eternal and all the pain being an illusion that is because he is an AI, he does not feel physical pain, and if the ships power runs out, the life support fails, all the crew die....his brain will still be stored on a harddrive. His thoughts and recordings are effectively ""eternal"". However only his memories and recordings will be stored. Not his sense of being, his personality.   

Back to the verse and the perspective of the Mechanic: 
""Recognize this as a holy gift and celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing."" He is clearly a religous man and here he sees it as a gift from god that the ships AI woke him up this early and he believes he has a chance to fix the ship and remain ""alive and breathing.""  
  
  
**Triad** - Since this song is an instrumental lets take the title of the song:   

Triad: Noun. A group or set of three connected people or things. (three connected things: The ship, The AI, The Mechanic all connected together as the mechanic and the AI try to fix the problem.)   
  
  
**Mantra** - Also an instrumental so let us again take the title of the song:   
  
  
Mantra: Noun. (originally in Hinduism and Buddhism) A word or sound repeated to aid concentration in meditation. Here the ship is trying to help the mechanic concentrate by providing plans, statical outcomes, simulations? The ""What"" is not clear.  
  
  
**Ticks and Leeches.** - Again here we see a song from the perspective of the ships AI as he shouts at the mechanic. Following the previous song, this one would suggest that the mechanic cannot fix the problem and the ship is doomed. Faced with his own impending death the AI is angry at the humans within him.   

""Workin up under my patience like a little tick. Fat little parasite. Suck me dry."" He's angry at them. They live inside of him, using his power, eating the food he provides, taking him for granted.  
  
""Got nothing left to give to you."" He has taken them around the solar system. To places no one has been before. Provided water, oxygen, a home....but now he has nothing left to give.  

""I hope, I hope, I hope you choke."" From this line it is clear that he believes the first thing to run out will be the oxygen.  
  
  
**The Grudge** - This song is the AI contemplating the last song. He can be angry at the Mechanic for not being able to fix it and hold a grudge against him at the fact the Mechanics failings will lead to the AI's death.    

""Saturn ascends, choose one or ten."" Here we see where they are stuck. Around Saturn. The ship is powerless and stuck in orbit around the gas giant. As the ship rotates randomly it appears as Saturn is ""Ascending"" as they look through the window.  

""Saturn ascends, the one, the ten. Ignorant to the damage done."" Here the line is repeated with a little variation. It is almost as if the AI is personifying the Planet of Saturn. Angry that Saturn is ignorant to the damage done to the ship.  

""Let go."" The last line of the song. The AI has chosen to let go of the grudge. They are stuck with no communication, 1.5billion km from Earth. Hating each other wont make the End easier.  
  
  
**Reflection** - As the title suggests this is a reflective song.   
 
""I have come curiously close to the end, down Beneath my self-indulgent pitiful hole, Defeated, I concede."" The AI has given up hope.  

""The moon tells me a secret - my confidant As full and bright as I am This light is not my own and A million light reflections pass over me."" Once again the AI personifies a planet (or in this case a moon). Saturns moon drifts by them as the light of a million stars shines in the sky. The AI seems to be apprecaiting the beauty of the universe here as he slowly dies.   

""She resuscitates the hopeless. Without her, we are lifeless satellites drifting"" He here personifies the Sun. So much beauty that she almost brings the AI to life. Perhaps the ship had (before they suffered serious damage) an element of solar power, and here he is stating that without ""her"" help at times, prodividing back up power or charging batteries, the ship would just become another satelite drifting through space.    
  
  
**Disposition** - Here the crew are now all dead. The AI is alone.   

""Mention this to me, Mention something, Mention anything."" He is lonely. He wants someone, anyone to say anything.  

""Watch the weather, Watch the weather change."" All he can do is just watch the storms raging on Saturns surface. Watching until his power runs out, and he dies.  
  
  
**Eon Blue Apocalypse** - Again another instrumental so lets take the title once again.  

  Eon: Noun. 
  1.An indefinite and very long period of time, often a period exaggerated for humorous or rhetorical effect.    
  2.A unit of time equal to a billion years.  

Blue: Obviously a colour as you know. But can also mean to feel sad or gloomy. (may also refer to blue movies but I dont think that applies to this case somehow.)  

Apocalypse: Noun. An event involving destruction or damage on an awesome or catastrophic scale.  

Lets put it all together and what do we get: Something that happened either a billion years or a long time in the future, it was very sad and resulted in everyone on board the ship and the ships AI dying.

However, because of the Force, the midi-chlorians develop, like plants that are given fertilizer.

After all, Catwoman's a liar, thief, traitor, and the like.  There is no good reason for Batman to fall for her.  There wasn't any in the comics either, admittedly, but Comic!Selina's gone out of her way to reform (mostly) while Movie!Selina straight up sells him out to Bane and doesn't even offer up an apology.  And yet right at the end, they share this awesome on-screen snog and travel to Italy to be together happily ever after with new lives and clean slates.  This goes against all logic.  Movie!Batman doesn't handle betrayal well; Ra's al Ghul got left to a derailed train, and he made it quite clear (if implicitly) that Alfred was no longer welcome at Wayne Manor for burning Rachel's last words.  So why does Selina get a second look when even Bruce's closest friend got the boot?

It's not about tappin' cat ass.  It's because Selina's character is a metaphor for Gotham City.  And what does Batman love more than Gotham?

Look at Selina herself.  Forced into crime, has a bit of a reputation for it, and is actively looking to get her hands on the clean slate program in order to get out of the criminal lifestyle.  A woman doing what she has to in order to get by.  She's got a bit of a soft side that is occasionally allowed to surface, but she's a cynic with a seemingly unbreakable ball and chain keeping her in the underbelly of society.

You could use much of the same ideas for Gotham City itself.  It's a city that was once good and pristine, but eventually became so corrupt that the League of Shadows was able to ""infiltrate every level of its infrastructure"".  And despite the efforts of people like Thomas and Martha Wayne to be a beacon of light - a clean slate, if you will, for the good people of Gotham - the city fell into the hands of the criminal element, and a ""if you can't beat 'em"" attitude remained dominant almost everywhere, with only little pockets of hope from people like Jim Gordon, Rachel Dawes, and later on, Harvey Dent.  Gotham would eventually get its clean slate later on, however, in the form of Batman.  As said in the final installment, the streets are so clean that the cops will have nothing else to do but ""chase down overdue library books"".

And when push came to shove, both Selina and the city banded together to do the right thing; instead of giving into her cynicism and certainty that things could only end badly, Selina instead rode into the heart of town to blow Bane the holy fuck up, allowing Batman to save the city.  When faced with a similar decision on two ferries in Gotham Harbor, with two detonators keyed to two bombs keyed to blow up together at midnight if one wasn't set off, the people aboard the boats opted to be exploded rather than have the blood of hundreds on their hands.  In both cases, the end was almost certainly at hand, and the day was saved because the actors in their respective scenes chose to hope instead of despair.  And they more earned their fresh starts because of it.

1361252234.0,86,self.FanTheories,18swr4,Prometheus: Peter Weyland was already dead,113,27,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/18swr4/prometheus_peter_weyland_was_already_dead/,"According to the Alien Anthology [wiki](http://alienanthology.wikia.com/wiki/Alien_Universe_Timeline):

&gt;August 16th (2071)- Weyland Industries earns patent number 18,364,003 for Method and Apparatus for the Synapse Respirator, a device able to temporarily restart brain activity of deceased individuals.

**My theory is that the reason Weyland is so obsessed with getting more life is because he's already dead.**

Weyland, born in 1990, had a dream to defeat all of nature's limitations--from curing cancer to global warming.  The most challenging of these is death. He wanted to escape it entirely, this was the point of the mission to LV-223 which began when it left Earth in 2091. I argue that Weyland was dead by 2065 when the Sir Peter Weyland Memorial Library was built.  Six years later in 2071 the tech to resurrect him temporarily was patented and the search for a permanent solution was on in full.

Being the passionate, arrogant and brilliant man he was I think its very plausible that he set a continency plan in motion to bring him back if he died before discovering how to conquer death. With the Synapse Respirator he could come back for brief appearances, consultations or to hear things like Shaw and Halloway's evidence in 2089 (when Weyland would have been 99). Whereas if Weyland went with the Prometheus when he was just old it seems like an overreaction, but if it was the act of someone ""mostly dead,"" someone who has been desperately trying to crawl back to life for the past nearly 30 years, it's less of a stretch.

If this was true:

* The old-man makeup on Guy Pearce that looks so weird--just a reaction/side effect of the reanimation.

* Explains why Weyland insists he only has a little time as the effects are temporary, and why he isn't awoken until the living Engineer is found.

* Makes the fact that Weyland was willing to take a chance on Shaw and Halloway more plausible as he truly had nothing to lose.

* Changes his relationship with Vickers and make her comment about kings dying and relinquishing power seem less callous and more scene-appropriate. Also makes her bitterness even more understandable. 

* It gives new perspective on Weyland's last words (""there's nothing""), and David's response (""I know, sir, have a pleasant journey"").

But most importantly:

* It explains why the Engineer immediately kills Weyland. The Engineers appear to worship the dynamic between life, death and the connection between the two through sacrifice. To have Weyland stand in front of the Engineer and use his artificial person to ask for more life to go to this dead man would have been a grave insult indeed.  Such treachery to the natural order of things could not go unpunished. 

This is something I just came up with but it seems solid and I think it answers some questions about why the whole operation seemed so last minute--it was their first lead in decades.

1350434614.0,91,self.FanTheories,11loqd,Star Wars: why the stormtroopers are terrible soldiers.,122,31,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/11loqd/star_wars_why_the_stormtroopers_are_terrible/,"My theory will try to explain why stormtroopers are almost useless in a fight.

Basically they are genetically inferior, mass produced cannon fodder meant to suppress the enemy with numbers.  I realize the clones were capable soldiers in the prequels, but somehow they ended up not being able to shoot for shit, not even at Luke when he takes his sweet time getting back onto the Millennium Falcon in Episode 4.  My reasoning for this, is that after the clone wars the Emperor needed to replenish his ranks quickly so he could secure the galaxy under his control, however he found that the 10 years it takes to successfully breed a clone was too slow, so he started rushing the process by ordering that new clones be injected with all types of steroids and other drugs to speed up the process.  The process successfully raised a massive army in a relatively short amount of time, but as a trade off the new soldiers were physically weaker than their predecessors.  That is why they have difficulty with shooting their targets and defending themselves against a group of tribal teddy bears.  

At a stretch, I also suspect that their armor isn't actually designed so much for protection, seeing as how they pretty much just die after being shot, but more as a life support system, similar to what Darth Vader has.  Again, according to my theory the stormtroopers are not healthy so they likely require some kind medicine circulating through them via their armor, so they are functional enough to perform their duties.  Equipping the stormtroopers with weak armor would seem to fit with the Emperor's plan to quickly produce a massive army.  It should be noted that only ever see clones take their helmets off in the prequel movies, but never in the original films.  Probably the biggest piece of evidence against this part of my theory is the part in episode 4 when Luke and Han slip on some stormtroopers' armor.  So overall the reason why stormtroopers' armor doesn't protect again blasters is because it is designed support their failing health, not to protect against weapons.

My final point is that the clones just generally aren't very intelligent.  They've likely always been like this, since Palpatine brainwashed them to follow his orders to the letter on a moment's notice, as seen with order 66, they obviously weren't designed to be independent thinkers.  This backfires when we see them let the droids they were looking for slip right under their noses and when we see Han outsmart them them on Endor.  Also they just seem to lack common sense, like hide behind cover when people are shooting at you, instead of awkwardly crouching.

Anyway, that's my theory and I'm sticking to it.  I hope I explained this well enough, even though it could likely all be explained by bad directing.

edit: The stormtroopers are not clones according to the canon evidence.  You guys can stop reminding me now.

It all starts in Ocarina of Time, walking into the Lost Woods, Navi makes a comment about Skull Kid, when you see him, saying something along the lines of, ""is this what happens to children who get lost in the forest?""


After Navi leaves through the window of the Temple of Time, Link starts to miss her, and goes on a journey to start looking for her, thus the beginning of Majora's Mask. 

In Majora's mask, Link wanders into the Lost Woods with no idea where to start, or where he needs to go, he just wanders. Then the transformation begins. He falls into a sleep, slowly and unknowingly, and he is presented with what he will inevitably become. A skull kid. During the confrontation, the skull kid takes Links belongings, symbolizing that nothing can be kept from his previous form. Link subconsciously knows that he is in a sort of dream-like state, and gives himself what he longs for, a companion. The trials that Link endures throughout the game ultimately ready him for the trasformation that is taking place. Each form that link takes is a step into accepting his fate, starting as a measly Deku Scrub, to a ""Fierce Deity"" by the end of the game. He realizes the Skull Kid was never his enemy, and even befriends him. And the Skull Kid tells him, after you beat the Majora's Mask, ""you smell like the little kid who taught me that song in the forest."" And at that point, the transformation is complete and Link is no longer a human, nor Link. The transformation took several centuries, and by the time the Skull Kid awakens, all of Hyrule is different, dark. The Skull Kid present in Twilight Princess guards the Master Sword, and who other than the previous Hero of Time. 

Tl:dr link wanders into the lost woods looking for navi at the end of oot, finds himself lost, falls into a rest where his mind breaks and his actions aren't controllable, as he turns into the skull kid who ultimately guards the master sword in tp",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_xfkar,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/xfkar/majoras_mask_explanation/,

For starters, [here](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/taylorswift/youbelongwithme.html) are the lyrics to the song. First off, take note: there isn't any reference to the gender of the singer (S), not even one indicator of femininity. Moreover, while there are no indicators of femininity, there are some suggestions of more typical male traits, most often in juxtaposition to the girlfriend (GF) of S's best friend (BF). See lines like the prechoruses:

&gt;She wears short skirts, I wear T-Shirts
&gt;She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
&gt;She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers

There's more to it than vague hints that S is a male relayed through his fashion decisions and filling gender roles. Throughout the song, S suggests that he relates to BF on a level GF never can. Lyrics like:

&gt;she doesn't get your humor like I do
&gt;I'm the one who understands you
&gt;She'll never know your story like I do

are indicative of the bond S and BF share as two young men - there is a part of their adolescent experience that GF, as a young woman, cannot experience or understand. However, their closeness and understanding goes beyond just that manly brotherhood. S and BF are obviously very good friends - S describes some of the closer aspects of their relationship:

&gt;you were driving to my house in the middle of the night. I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're 'bout to cry. I know your favorite songs, and you tell me about your dreams

But S believes they have more than just a friendship. S believes that BF is in fact also gay, but either has yet to have that sexual awakening, or is repressing it - consciously or subconsciously. This is where the plea comes in. S believes this about BF and is begging him to come to the realization that he is not happy with GF because he will never be happy in a sexual relationship with women:

&gt;And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town. I haven't seen it in awhile since she brought you down.

&gt;You say you're fine ‒ I know you better than that. Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?

 He will, however, be happy with men - specifically, S. We see references to this peppered all throughout the song:

&gt;Walking the streets with you and your worn out jeans, I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be. Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself, ""Hey, isn't this easy?""

&gt;Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time

&gt;why can't you see ‒ You belong with me?

&gt;All this time, how could you not know

&gt;Have you ever thought just maybe, you belong with me?

We even have a little innuendo hiding away in there:

&gt;Standing by and waiting at your backdoor

I think The Hulk is a metaphor for the use of nuclear power and Banner is representative of those who use it.

It starts with Bruce Banner, a scientist and exceptionally intelligent guy and a man with good intentions.  In the beginning he's working on experimental type of nuclear technology called a gamma bomb.  Due to a mistake he is bombarded with this gamma radiation and changed forever into The Hulk.  This decision, for better or worse changes him completely.  He understands much like the nuclear age that possessing the power he has means there is no turning back.  Enter awesome comic books and movies.

The parallels are there.  Hulk in many ways is reflective of atomic power.  At his base level he is a creature of pure, unbiased, destruction unlike anyone has ever seen.  He has no motive, no agenda, he just wants to smash.  He is more powerful than even the gods of the Marvel Universe, often considered the strongest force in the world (strong enough to pick up a mountain in one issue).  Even when he has an agenda as Hulk (usually still to destroy something albeit something specific) He leaves a path of pure destruction, often times causing more collateral damage to those around him than damage to the object at hand.  To his credit his power can be used for good, but it is his natural state to be chaotic.  Anything else requires intense discipline, discipline others who try to obtain his powers do not have.

So if the Hulk is the bomb, what is Dr. Banner?  The guy who possesses the bomb.  In many ways Banner mirrors the attitude of most nuclear countries nowadays.  He understands the power he has but has complete respect and fear for it.  It's something that he doesn't like using, even as a last resort.  But human nature is something he has less ability to control and when pushed up against a wall (when his body feels like he has no choice) he goes green.  And then after Hulk smashes, he is transformed back into a reality filled with remorse.  Knowing what power he has and having used it before, he walks with a heavy heart, not truly sure if the power he has can be used for good or ultimately be something used for mass-destruction.  Cue the hitchiking down a road with sad piano music playing.

So that's pretty much it.  To clarify I'm not sure this is what Kirby or Lee had in mind.  But for being started at the peak of the cold war it seems a bit odd that a character created with radiation doesn't have some intentional parallels to the whole nuclear conflict that occurred.  I'm guessing it was more like, ""Let's create a superhero with the power of atomic energy.""  But I think it goes deeper than that, whether by accident or not.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,1349665662.0,,,True,t3_114arj,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/114arj/the_hulk_is_a_comic_book_metaphor_for_nuclear/,
1340072282.0,88,self.FanTheories,v987l,Fight Club is a romantic comedy (Spoilers all over the place!),106,18,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/v987l/fight_club_is_a_romantic_comedy_spoilers_all_over/,"From the first time I saw Fight Club I thought that it was incredibly misunderstood film. The anti-capitalist ""subtext"" felt incredibly obvious from the start, plus it was the 90's every edgey piece of art was faux-anarchist. I found that the discussion of masculinity in the modern age was a little muddled in the narrative, but I thought there was something there that no one has talked about and it it hit me after watching Eternal Sunshine way too much for my own, Fight Club is a romantic comedy.

So there's my crazy ass thesis and I haven't seen fight club in a while but here's my proof:

In a romantic comedy the male love interest is usually some bad boy figure or someone who is completely the opposite of the protagonist, and that's Marla, she's anarchy incarnate she has no concerns about her well being, she walks in the middle of a busy road and casually attempts to overdose on drugs, she has nothing as opposed to the Narrator character whose entire life is defined by conventional means, his job, his possessions, his social status, but he's emotionally empty, he goes from support group to support group in order to feel some emotional connection with something or someone but it's not until he sees Marla for the first time that he gets that. He dreams about his power animal again, this time it's not a penguin telling him to slide with an innocent childs voice in a jovial tone, it's Marla and all of a sudden a childish and jovial command to “slide” is a sultry and sexy demand. But here's the issue, and here's where Tyler comes into play. The Narrator is so threatened by her self assuredness that nothing matters, her non challant approach to her own sexuality is nothing compared to his materialistic existence defined by his conceit that he was raised by a generation of women and Marla goes against the traditional woman.

And thus he creates Tyler Durden. Think about the first couple of things that Tyler does in the film, he shakes up the narrators reliance on materialism to the point that he throws it all away and after completely changing who he is and how he lives his life he goes on to have sex with Marla through Tyler Durden, Tyler is who the Narrator wants to be not because of his brash and uncaring attitude or his charisma, it's because Tyler can get close to Marla in ways that The Narrator can't. 

My biggest proof is the sex scene, it's a great example of David Fincher's amazing direction, the etnire movie is gritty, dirty, and unrelentic in its nihilism, but the sex scene is full on CGI, flashy and majetic camera work, and apparently amazing sex, it's sex in its most idealized state and he's not so much having sex with Marla, he's conquering her, overcoming her with the sexuality she threatened. And it is after this that the entire anarchist plot comes to fruition, all the meanwhile the Marla subplot seems to be fading into the background until he realizes what he has done with his anarchist followers, the first thing he does then is tell Marla to get away from him and his oncoming destruction of the city, and  after the climactic scene, he destroys Tyler Durden and him and Marla hold hands as the society that confined them is destroyed, The narrator tells her “You met me at a very strange time in my life.” But all his issues are resolved and he can hold her hand without any insecurity.

Here's why

**1. The events of the story come forth in rapid fire succession.**

 Am I meant to believe that within days of coming to America, where he knows one person, the euro-gang lord he is running from finds him, he sets up copious contacts aligning himself with gangs and the FBI, his cousin's apt/business burns down, and he never has to register as an immigrant?

**2. Most minor details are largely omitted.**

 When ever Niko needs to get somewhere there is always a generic way of getting there, he never has to recover from wounds for long, he barely eats, he almost never sleeps, and barely ever changes his clothes let alone washes them.

**3. Liberty city's culture is probably a heavily biased memory of what was actually going on.**

As a person from eastern Europe, he was probably   brought up see Americans as selfish, greedy capitalists only concerned with baser needs. From this perspective right wing radio, cartoons, reality shows, adoption agencies, online dating, and medication adds could easily be remembered the way the more extreme versions in LC behaved.

**4. The events of the story are driven forward exclusively by Niko where every action has far reaching implications.**

This may be because when we remember events, many of us place ourselves in the center of what is going on in a more important light.

In the end, I know that this is really loose. Feel free to pick it apart, but I think looking at the story from this perspective makes pieces fit together better.

Looking at the name of the show versus the names of other sci-fi shows, we see one key difference. Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek: Enterprise, Voyager, and Deep Space 9, Outlaw Star, Cowboy Bebop and countless others all feature the name of the ship/space station/wormhole/etc. in the title. Firefly is the only show that avoids this in favour of the ship's class instead. Why is that?

Secondly, what do we know about the firefly class? That it's a completely outdated model that few have ever really seen, and that given a half decent mechanic they'll ""run forever"". So we have archaic technology that regularly competes with modern tech and can last an incredibly long time. Possibly long enough that it's true origin might be forgotten, only to have it picked up by an intrepid captain at a shipyard.

Thirdly, when the series was cancelled they had to drop that plotline, along with the origins of Shepard Books. When the movie is picked up, they choose to maintain the naming convention I outlined in the first paragraph and name the movie Serenity.

It begins after the bombs have fallen, after the black ash of nuclear winter has finally been swept away and dissipated. Man, changed and scarred, emerges from his shelters and finds that the world is safe to inhabit again. 

Thus, **everything is in its right place**

Immediately afterwards, we do what comes naturally to us. We mate and the first child after the end of the world is born. He is **Kid A**. Already, the war drums have started to beat. Some tribes have talking heads (ventriloquists), some tribes have violence (heads on sticks). The child cries out at the end of the lullaby.

The nation states have started to build themselves up. We have moved from tribalism to nationalism. We begin to distrust our neighbors (everyone has got the fear) and cling to our **National Anthem**s. 

Kid A is a grown man now. He sees the faults of the world, but doesn’t know how to fix it. He tries learning **How To Disappear Completely**, repeating his mantra “I’m not here, this isn’t happening.” His depression has led him into a fever dream, filled with symbolic imagery (strobe lights and blown speakers, flowers and hurricanes)

Intermission:**Treefingers**

We return to the world, we have learned nothing from the errors of our past. Social Darwinism reigns once more (“The big fish eat the little ones”), despair is everpresent, people feel as if they’re trapped in a prison ship. Still, Kid A believes in the world, despite how much it wants to beat it out of him, he remains faintly **Optimistic**.

Eventually, he begins to break. His sanity is **In Limbo**. He cries out to the masses they are all “living in a fantasy world.” But in the end, he knows these are all just “trap doors.” Recognizing his restlessness, he begins to beg for solitude as he seeks identity (“I’m lost at sea, don’t bother me, I’ve lost my way.’’). 

But he can’t. The war drums grow louder, incoherent, maddening. He becomes a mad prophet, screaming about the end of the world (“we’re not scaremongering, this is really happening.”) But the hum of electronics and the sing of cash registers will never let him escape from the **Idioteque**. Madness runs the land, greed begs us to ""take the money and run.""

Broken, he begins to mumble insanity to himself. At first, he is seduced by the **Morning Bell**, the promise of a new day. But the tide is set against him, the corporate love breakdown will live on after he dies. At the same time,  in his madness, he can hear the mundane arguments of society around him. Marriages dissolve over people not knowing where the car was parked. He screams like Solomon, telling the fools to just “cut the kids in half”.He speaks his parting words to his followers, “Everybody wants to be a friend, nobody wants to be a slave.” 

Quietly, alone, and with a heavy heart, Kid A takes his own life with “red wine and sleeping pills”. Bemused and with a black sense of humor, he sings to himself “I think you’re crazy, maybe.” He hopes for salvation,  asking to see something better “in the next life.” A choir of angels is the last sound he hears. Roll credits. Cue the **Motion Picture Soundtrack**

1376023867.0,82,self.FanTheories,1k0aut,Half-Life 2 - Doctor Breen theory,102,20,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1k0aut/halflife_2_doctor_breen_theory/,"Perhaps due to the amount of time we've all been waiting for Half-Life 3, I came up with a theory regarding the tragically misunderstood Doctor Breen.  On the surface, Doctor Breen seems like the perfect villain - somewhat sympathetic motivations (keeping mankind alive, better to be a slave than dead, etc.), but scummy and antagonistic enough to be a complete, classic asshole.  However, I believe that Doctor Breen could well prove to have been the single most heroic character in the Half Life series, and may have done more for the Resistance than either of the Vances, or, depending on your viewpoint, more than Gordon Freeman himself.

This theory relies on the acceptance of another theory I've often heard about the G-Man - namely, that he essentially ""sold"" Gordon Freeman to the Resistance as a sort of interdimensional mercenary.  This would explain his interest in keeping Freeman alive, as well as his cryptic statements to Eli Vance.  There's a good amount of evidence (such as the Resistance's relative lack of surprise at his showing up) that backs up this theory's potential.  This is only level one of my theory, however.

Many - naturally - assume that Vance is the one who hired Freeman.  I think, however, that Gordon Freeman was hired by none other than the misanthropic, supreme Quisling Doctor Breen himself.  

Doctor Breen always acted with human interest in mind, and it seemed he was always just brutally pragmatic about his allegedly altruistic actions.  In addition to this, though, it could be that he harbored hope for humanity's eventual triumph.  When he saw Gordon's potential as a soldier - and more importantly, as a symbol to rally around - he knew that Gordon could be the driving force of that triumph.  Therefore, Breen essentially single-handedly stopped the Combine from wiping out humanity completely not only for preservation, but to buy humanity another chance to fight back later, when the Combine had grown complacent as humanity's ""overlords"".  For this reason, he brokered the deal with the G-Man in secret.  I believe that he was in cahoots with Eli Vance for this, explaining the Resistance's knowing that Freeman was coming.  However, I think only Vance knew of this cooperation, as the Resistance's hatred for Breen was an important part of the plan.  Every hero like Gordon Freeman needs a villain, after all, and Breen was one hell of a villain.

Breen had no delusions.  He knew that his position as the liaison between humanity and the Combine would make him the single most hated person on the planet.  Instead of attempting to resist this, he played the part perfectly.  He made himself into the perfect, shady, corporate villain through his propaganda messages, giving a recognizable face to the Combine's evil that the Resistance could rally against.  A bunch of Lovrcraftian, wormlike Combine Administrators would be too terrifying - if these faceless forms of alien evil were the face of the Combine, they would likely only crush the Resistance's hopes further.  With Breen as the face of the Combine, they weren't fighting a horrific alien evil; they were fighting an old, self-righteous evil prick.  Breen played to this in order to keep up morale in the Resistance.  His antagonism was what made them grow strong, giving them a symbol to build against.

With their antagonist symbol, his purchase of Freeman's services from the G-Man gave the Resistance their symbol of hope, as open rebellion was sparked.  As Gordon stormed his way up the Citadel, Breen knew that his final hour had come.  He let Gordon kill him and collapse the Citadel to kick off the revolution to its fullest - giving the Resistance a crushing victory, a vanquished villain, and a new hope to rally behind.

With his sacrifice, Doctor Breen, the most hated man on the planet, was the greatest hero that humanity had ever known.

I doubt this'll end up true - and if it, by some wild chance, is, I don't think it'd impact future events much - but I think it's a cool way to interpret the character.  What do you guys think?  Any holes you can think of?",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,1376024175.0,,,True,t3_1k0aut,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1k0aut/halflife_2_doctor_breen_theory/,

---

**=====BACKGROUND=======**

I'm sure most Community fans and 99.9999% of /r/Community members are well aware that Chevy Chase left during Season 4, and Donald Glover will only be in the first five episodes of Season 5. Obviously, this means the character of Troy will leave mid-season, and Pierce won't be present in this season.

Now, obviously, all of the die-hard fans of the show are wondering what will happen to these characters in the Greendale universe, in addition to the main characters that will remain. This is where I believe ""Remedial Chaos Theory"" comes into play.

The major element of Remedial Chaos Theory is that it tells us what would happen to the study group should one of the members leave, as told through the mind of Abed Nadir. I realize that this is an important bit of information.

The consequences of each character's disappearance are predictions from a character himself. This is why many people will argue that the timeline without Troy was so terrible because he is Abed's best friend, and is biased as a result.

HOWEVER, it is also important to remember in ""Debate 109"", it's revealed that Abed has the ability to make accurate predictions for the characters and proved it in his show ""Community College Chronicles"". This is enough for me to go on to believe Remedial Chaos Theory foreshadows potential events in season 5.

**=====EPISODES 1-5 (w/o Pierce)=====**

The Pierce-less timeline will come into play before the one without Troy, because Troy is still a main characters early on the season. Furthermore, I believe events similar to this will happen early on in the season.

- **Troy** and **Britta** will get closer together again. I realize they already had a relationship, but the fact that they had a healthy breakup doesn't shatter another mutual interest between them. I am not stating that they will have a relationship again, but I am saying it is possible. What I truly believe, however, is that we may see the flirting and subtle hints that came about in Season 2 and 3.

- **Abed** and **Shirley** will be relatively unaffected by Pierce leaving. Shirley, however, may find herself become more and more invested into her *Shirley's Sandwiches* restaurant.

- **Jeff** will hurt himself, even if slightly. There does not have to be a deep explanation as to how Jeff hurt himself, but he will be injured, nevertheless.

- **Annie** and **Jeff** will continue flirting. This is something we as fans are accustomed to seeing between the two. The timeline had no evidence of them actually being in a relationship with each other, but I wouldn't throw that out of the window.

**=====EPISODES 6+ (w/o Pierce and Troy)=====**

- **Jeff** loses an arm...just kidding. Although that happened in *Remedial Chaos Theory*, I like to think of the episode as an exaggerated version of foreshadowing. In all likelihood, Jeff will have his right arm in a cast, for an undetermined amount of time. The injury would ideally occur in the fifth episode, as it would fit both timelines. (Jeff hurt himself in the Pierce-less timeline)

- **Annie** will do something previously that would make her feel really guilty. (She went to a mental hospital in the timeline) Though it won't literally drive her to insanity, it will be a great opportunity for strengthening the development of the character. As for what causes her guilt, I have not come up with a theory for that. Maybe she does something regrettable to Jeff, or maybe she does something off-camera to Pierce...

- **Abed** will have a lot of trouble coping with Troy's departure. In the timeline, Abed stated he kept thinking of other things he could have done to change what happened at the apartment, similarly to what he will do in reality...err, the Greendale universe's reality.

- **Britta** will, predictably, britta something up and accidentally do something detrimental to the group. (She started the fire in the timeline after dropping a blunt in her mouth) Also, she will get a blue streak on her hair, for some undetermined purpose. (most realistic part of the timeline)

- **Shirley**, though unlikely to become an actual alcoholic, may become one to have a drink every now and then. Perhaps an occasional relapse from her days at the ""Douche"" Street bar. The  use of alcohol unheard of from the character since attending Greendale may hint at some issues coping with something.

- I find it hard to believe that **Pierce** will actually be killed off. The timeline, overall, hinted at Pierce leaving the main characters, and this has already been achieved. Either this has no further effect on Pierce, or the character will die. (which I find hard to believe)

- If at some point the character of **Troy** returns to the show, his voice will be altered. I don't think it will be as extreme as losing his larynx, but I think some regrettable sequence of events will lead to Troy's voice being affected, even if temporarily.

--------

This concludes my theory of season 5, and how season 3’s “Remedial Chaos Theory” may play a major role in some of the events to occur. Keep in mind that this is just a theory. I am not guaranteeing any of this will happen, and I am 100% positive many of my predictions could not be more wrong. However, I spent a lot of time coming up with this and it was fun, and I couldn’t think of a better place to share this than on Reddit. Feel free to discuss theory or ask questions about it in the comments.

1360947687.0,85,self.FanTheories,18l64u,"For those of you that have seen Martha Marcy May Marlene, did anyone else get the sense that... (SPOILERS!)",123,38,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/18l64u/for_those_of_you_that_have_seen_martha_marcy_may/,"There was something much more sinister at hand?

When Martha first goes back to her sister's lake house, She asks really out of place questions, like about the size of the house and if anyone lives there. At the time, they didn't make any sense.

There's another point when she asks how far away they were from the cult house. Another seemingly out of place question.

It's very important too to understand that the cultists knew where she was, and this was confirmed when she ran down into the ravine and smashed out the windows of the black car they drive.

Last seemingly random piece of the puzzle is we know the cult was breaking into fancy, massive homes. When a home owner catches them, Patrick calmly replies ""We were just looking at your house,"" again using a very specific but odd choice of words.

Now, this brings me to the final flashback scene, where Martha is upset with Patrick for killing that man and Patrick comes into the bathroom. He says he needs to know he can trust Martha, she says he can, and he says ""**Show me**"". 

It is right after this that Martha ""flees"" into town and calls her sister whose husband owns a very large fancy lake house mansion. Though she appeared to be running away from the cultist lifestyle, the dinner conversation provides us with evidence that she in fact *has not* given up her cultist ideals. This is also given away when Martha tells her sister ""*I'm a teacher and a leader, you've just never let me be that*"".

So, onto the theory: Patrick sent Martha to ""infiltrate"" her sister's family (and possibly even be the one to kill them) so that they could take the lake house, which it is mentioned in the movie that it is totally paid off. When Martha calls the cult house, she is going to ask when they are going to make their move, but gets scared. Then there is the scene with the bartender, whom she recognized as a cult member. She freaks out on him and shouts ""**Just do it already!**"" meaning just make your move on the house already. That's why she freaks out and tries to convince her sister and her sister's husband to leave. 

Finally, at the end, when Martha is swimming, there is a man watching her on the opposite shore. When Martha sees him, she almost seems to be a bit relieved. When driving back towards the city, this same man steps out in front of their car, Martha sees him, and at the end, as the man gets back in his car and creeps closer and closer, Martha just seems numb.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_18l64u,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/18l64u/for_those_of_you_that_have_seen_martha_marcy_may/,

I watched Fight Club for the upteenth time today and noticed something- when The Narrator and Marla are walking out of the restaurant near the end of the film, the movie theater behind them advertises ""Seven Years In Tibet""- a Brad Pitt movie. 

Earlier in the film, Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) tells Ed Norton's narrator in the hotel ""I act like you want to act, I look like you want to look, I fuck like you want to fuck"" or something along those lines. The ""look like you want to look"" line is important. 

At some point before the movie starts, The Narrator went and saw Seven Years In Tibet, or even just the sign and thought of Brad Pitt. Then when his insomnia started and he created Tyler in his mind, he modeled him after a man who many guys wished they looked like- Brad Pitt. No one else noticed this because they all saw Ed Norton as Tyler and The Narrator never noticed it because Tyler was never really really, like in a dream, where someone can be a person you know but you don't remember their face, just the feeling that that person was the person you know.

Kind of confusing but I thought it was interesting.

(disclaimer: I have read the book many, many times and I know this isn't brought up in the book, but I think it could have been a really cool move on David Fincher's part to put the movie title up there and give us this reason to see Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden.

In A New Hope, Han is ducking Jabba for having dropped his (presumably illegal) cargo when being boarded by an Imperial starship, thus owing a good deal in damages to the Hutt gangster. Jabba finally confronts him directly in a docking bay after the incident with Greedo, backed up by hired goons. Here, we see a noticeably smaller and more active Jabba than is more popularly known, who approaches Solo with a marked degree of amiability and treats the hit put out on him more as a means to save face or an unorthodox summons. The Hutt isn’t even riled by any of the indebted smuggler’s brazen displays of disrespect (such as stepping on Jabba’s *tail*) and is easily placated with the promise of reimbursement plus a bonus, making one half-hearted attempt to coax a little more money out of Han before being quickly rebuffed. Jabba then leaves, armed cohorts in tow, not having so much as glanced sideways at them in an effort to intimidate Solo.

Flash forward to the opening of The Empire Strikes Back and we learn that Jabba’s put another hit out on Han and this one is serious, if the allusion to the bounty hunter on Ord Mantell is anything to go by, enough so that he’s willing to abandon his friends and the Rebellion just to finally pay the Hutt off. Of course, the Empire quickly sidetracks his plans and by the end of the movie, Boba Fett has successfully claimed Solo, newly frozen in carbonite, with the intent of handing him over to Jabba.

In Return of the Jedi, we meet Jabba again (for the first time in earlier renditions) and the Hutt has become lewd, cruel, large and in charge. He is so fat that he hardly moves from his dais and mocks Luke’s request for audience, more than happy with the idea of keeping Solo suspended in his lair forever like a piece of decorative art. When Leia reveals herself, he delights in finding her out and after Luke arrives, he is equally pleased to pit him against his rancor, showing a seemingly newfound love for throwing his weight around. He has also become incredibly lascivious, feeding Oola the slave girl to the same rancor for refusing his advances and later keeping a scantily-clad Leia close at hand with a leash and licking his slimy lips lecherously at her.

So, why does this change occur throughout the Original Trilogy? In regards to Han’s debt, one might argue his antics have finally pushed the Hutt so far that he’s not willing to play nice anymore, but that aside, there’s still some pretty startling differences between Jabba as we see him in ANH and when he appears (again) in RotJ. But one thing that might clear this up is the fact that Hutts are **hermaphrodites**.

The Jabba that appears in Hope - humble, personable, composed and forgiving - is Jabba in “his” feminine cycle. Jabba as seen in Return is his masculine self; arrogant, ruthless, belligerent and with a wanton sexual appetite. Unfortunate implications abound by attributing his behavior in these two instances to stereotypes but, of course, in the Star Wars universe that’s nothing new. It is furthermore possible, though perhaps more speculative, that in the time between The Phantom Menace, where a brief cameo from Jabba implies him to be quite powerful, and A New Hope, where he is scrawnier and forced to debase himself in personally tracking down a sass-mouth smuggler, that the Hutt suffered some rough patch in his criminal career, perhaps being temporarily ousted by a rival.

**TL:DR; Jabba’s intersexed &amp; was in his pushover female phase when Han busted his chops in ANH before getting butch again and becoming the sadistic, skeevy slug we all know and love from RotJ.**",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_ysshe,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/ysshe/does_jabba_look_like_a_bitch/,

I recently found this sub and think this theory of mine belongs here.

So, as all of you who've played almost any (j)RPG will know, there is an endless supply of monsters to fight, and very little to no explanation is given as to why. This falls to the very little explanation camp.

Lulu tells Tidus about how fiends are born when they arrive at Kilika after Sin's attack. 

She says that the fiends are born when the recently deceased aren't given a proper sending they eventually grow envious and angered of the living, which eventually turns them into fiends.

This is being told when Yuna is performing a sending for those who died in the attack.

Now, after defeating enemies, we see pyreflies being released, but we are not told that this would mean they have gone to the farplane. Given the origin of fiends, i think killing them has only destroyed the physical manifestation they had amassed. However, since Yuna doesn't perform a sending after battle, except once, well get to it, the fiends souls still continue to wander Spira.

Since they were born because they were angered and envious of the living, and were not sent to the farplane, they will eventually be born as new fiends.

I suspect that since Yuna doesn't do a sending after killing enemies, except after you beat Seymour the final time, the other summoners don't do it either.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1cc0cd,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1cc0cd/ffx_my_theory_as_to_why_there_is_an_endless/,

Because it's so easy to do, I've made a silly habit of seeing how many ways, and how creatively, I can cross a movie's plot into the Matrix universe. This one seemed to line up pretty nicely.


***--- CUE: WALL OF TEXT ---***


The Matrix is a simulated world created by machines to keep humans placid so they can use their body heat for energy (or something like that). In the movie, this simulation takes place in the late 20th century, specifically 1999. If you've seen the movie, you know this.

Anyway, it's revealed by the architect that the machines are unable to create a convincing, original virtual reality without the people within it finding out in some way or another. As a result, the one they use is a direct, practically real time simulation of the year 1999. On a similar note, the agents cannot just insert themselves into the world; they can only take over the place of an existing person/value, or whatever you could call them. 

From this, I infer that the machines running the matrix lack the creative malleability to change it in a way that would remain unnoticed by its inhabitants. They can only manipulate what is already available to them.

At some point in the Matrix Universe's 21st century, war breaks out. Many countries fall, and for some reason Britain lasts a little longer than others. This war is in some way directly related to the machine uprising. Because this is part of the Matrix universe history, the Matrix has to simulate it as well.

The machines realize they cannot let the simulation run much further than this, lest it end up in their present, with free humans frequently dying, and a second matrix required within the first. They can't just reset it either, as those inside would very likely notice, and either die from shock, or reject it and cause extreme complications.

As a solution, every time the simulation reaches its year 2009, the machines begin filtering any newborns into a new simulation, several years (possibly centuries) in this past, enough time to keep these ""resets"" infrequent. Any adult humans still remaining the the current simulation stop having babies, and slowly die out. This simulation is now a lower priority, so they can make slightly larger changes (such as removing indications that the machines are responsible for the war) because, ultimately, it's usefulness has expired.

When the remaining humans die out, the simulation is shut down in favor of the new one.

Theo and the characters in 'Children of Men' are living in an expired simulation.

As for Key's baby, I didn't really get that far. Maybe it's a program used as a pacifier to give the remaining humans hope, keep them at least a little placid while the machines wait for them to die out. Or maybe it's a malfunction or something. I dunno. This whole thing is pretty dumb.

Now, if you excuse me, I'm going to fast for the next week, as penance for putting Children of Men in the same universe as The Matrix.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,1354925414.0,,,True,t3_14gwac,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/14gwac/children_of_men_takes_place_inside_the_matrix_not/,

I actually believed this was canon for a while. The first 'hint' I caught was when Lorraine sees the picture of the Perrons, and she fawns over what a beautiful day at the beach it was. Sometime later, she tells Ed how she envies the ""beautiful"" Perron family. Further, Ed tells Roger that they've always wanted a house in the country. Come to think of it, there's no reason they can't afford this given their financial capabilities. The camera on occasion fixates on Lorraine's finger bling, their advanced technological equipment, and their furnished home in the (relatively) pricey suburbs. So why does Ed sound longing, even though their dream house isn't a faraway fantasy? Because having their dream house isn't enough. Lorraine, and even Ed, envy the Perron family because it is complete, whole, and without loss.

Ed also tells Roger that the last exorcism ""took a huge piece"" from Lorraine. Doesn't this phrase sound uncomfortably euphemistic? It was on the surface referring to her health, but this could also lead to ramifications if she was pregnant, like miscarriage. Miscarriages and abortions ""take away a piece"" of the mother's body - the foetus.

Now how should we speculate the neverchild's gender? Back when Lorraine sees the Perrons' happy photograph, she casts an inscrutably aching gaze at it. A complete family without empty spaces, and in abundance of daughters. Later on, Lorraine's daughter, Judy, gives Lorraine a locket with Judy's picture in it. The camera lingers on the glaringly empty locket space beside Judy's photograph, as though it was saved for the sister she never had. 

The final 'hint' was drawn from symbolism and a film student's (my) frenzied manic analysis. When Lorraine escapes from Bathsheba in the cellar, the locket containing Judy's picture is wrenched from Laureen's body. This is a symbolic parallel of how Lorraine's previous ghastly encounter had yanked her daughter-to-be from her body, from her womb.

Actually, the hints substantiating the miscarried child's gender aren't conclusive, but I felt more compelled towards it being female.

-Andy and Sid look almost exactly alike.
-They never hang out, even though it's apparent they both need a friend.
-You never see either dad.

It's a popular theory that he left Andy's mom or she kicked him out. I say that he had an affair with the neighbor's wife a long time ago, before Andy was even conceived, and Andy's mom didn't find out. Sid was born, Sid's not-real-dad assumed it was his, and never questioned it.
I'm also going to assume Sid's not-real-dad probably had a military background since Sid later has a Improvised Interrogation Handbook in his room. 

When both the boys became kids and started to form into little versions of Andy's dad, Sid's not-real-dad started to notice his son doesn't look like him at all and more like his neighbor and talks to Andy's Mom about it, and she too starts to see it. She confronts her husband about it and kicks him out. 

Ashamed of being betrayed by someone she loved, she tried her hardest to keep Andy away from Sid so that Andy doesn't find out, which is why Andy never tries to play with Sid. 

This is also the reason why they move, because not only would it be hard living right next to the reminder of her now ex-husbands adultery, but it would be way too hard trying to keep Andy from looking next door. 

As for Sid's not-real-dad, he probably left his mom as soon as he found out, also maybe even without even saying bye to Sid, but most likely saying bye to his daughter, Hannah, which is actually his. Sid has no idea why his dad seems so upset with him, nor does he know that he's not even his dad.

John’s story ends with him being gunned down by the US Military (the last event of John Marston’s life). The game itself doesn’t end until Jack avenges his father.

The main quest is only the events that led up to or contribute to his death.

We never see John’s life before the game, but we hear facts about it. We only hear little details, the kinds that get mentioned casually after years of not being important. This is because Jack didn’t know the details about his father since his father was not there to tell them to him and he only heard a few things…he was half-Scottish, he was in a gang, his mother was a whore.

Jack was raised by his mother after John was killed, and only heard rumors about his father. When his mother died, he traveled all over to find out the facts, to find the man who killed his father. 

By this time (10+ years later), John Marston had become a legend around the West. And like all legends, some things were exaggerated, some things were made up, some things were up for debate. So Jack had to do a lot of time-consuming sleuthing to learn what happened that cause his father’s death.

He heard some rumors that couldn’t have been true...

*“That John Marston was so tough that he could take six bullets to the chest, sit behind a wagon to rest up, and in ten seconds he’d be ready to fight again.”*

*“John Marston could tame even the wildest horse by riding on it only once. My father saw it happen, I swear!”*

*“Marston had the best aim in the West! When he pulled out his gun…time slowed down and a second felt like a minute.”* **(Dead-Eye mode)**

There were many things that weren’t recorded or remembered, so Jack had to come up with stuff himself. **(The choice-system)** Was his father a noble man, or a dirty rotten scoundrel? Did he like looting and robbing, or was he the kind to pull over and help a person with no horse to ride? He spent many a-night looking up at the stars wondering if his father was up there or down below burning for his crimes. Ultimately, the answer was what Jack believed was true.

But it didn’t matter where went John after the funeral. What mattered was the years of suffering his mother had to endure without John to help her.

With his mother at peace, Jack was free to seek vengeance. He searched, and he searched and he asked everyone.

And after months, he had a solid story, one blooming with details and adventure and side-quests, one filled with strange characters and odd happenings. After months, he was sure he had all the facts.

Before he set out to find the final piece of the puzzle (the location of Edgar Ross), he looked at their grave sites one more time…and to double check his facts, he recanted the whole story....

There is a shot of her tear falling over the edge of the cliff, which indicates that she is looking over it, otherwise it would be impossible for that to happen.  

In a way, you can see her reasoning, a new Avatar would be born after her death.  However, she decides not to commit suicide and falls back sobbing.  This is the moment when Aang shows up, saying that ""at our lowest moment, we are open to the greatest change.""  Suicide is about as low as a person can get, and Korra overcoming the urge allowed her to open up her spiritual side of the Avatar.

Regardless of the intentions of the creators of the show, this perspective, IMO, makes the deus ex machina of Aang giving back Korra's bending much more poignant.

1366567309.0,82,self.FanTheories,1ct6ke,What if we're looking at (Doctor Who) the connection between Jack Harkness and the Face of Boe all wrong?,176,94,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1ct6ke/what_if_were_looking_at_doctor_who_the_connection/,"I was stumbling through Facebook when I saw [this](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=580050145361226&amp;set=a.111295035570075.8930.110298935669685&amp;type=1&amp;relevant_count=1&amp;ref=nf), an appropriate quote from Jack Harkness saying that he's been pregnant before and ""I'm never doing that again,"" while beside it there's the announcement of the pregnancy of the Face of Boe.  

What if--just *what if*--we've been looking at the idea of Jack being the Face of Boe backwards?  What if Jack doesn't become the Face of Boe in the future, but he's actually either a reincarnation (or manifestation) of the Face of Boe?  

When Jack mentions being nicknamed the ""Face of Boe"" from his childhood on the Boeshane Peninsula, it's about his past.  His pregnancy was in his past.  And he vows that he's ""never doing that again.""  I know that feelings can change, but I imagine that Jack, **especially** after the events of Children of Earth, would be put off from having children again, regardless of whether or not he actually gave birth to them.

According to the [Tardis Wiki page on the Face of Boe](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Face_of_Boe), there are a few more facts to consider.  Russell T. Davies has said that in-universe Jack could possibly not survive further seasons of Torchwood (although this was probably before Miracle Day came out and he wanted to make the threat of Jack dying more viable), though he had previously expressed the belief that Jack was almost definitely the Face of Boe (as did David Tennant and John Barrowman).  Producer Julie Gardner, according to the TARDIS wiki on the Face of Boe (again) said at 2008's San Diego ComicCon that the Face of Boe is Jack.

I think the most important piece of evidence is that the Face of Boe does not resemble a humanoid (much less John Barrowman/Jack Harkness specifically) and has been stated to be a member of Boekind, another species altogether.  He gives birth to the Boemina, more members (presumably) of Boekind.  

Alternatively, what if Rose's use of the Heart of the TARDIS didn't actually give Jack excess life on its own but instead took the excess life from the Face of Boe and Jack had some of the life energy bleed-over gave Jack the memory of the nickname of ""the Face of Boe.""  It's questionable as to whether humankind had knowledge of the Face of Boe as an entity yet, and this could have been a nickname given because of the entity rather than as a separate thing.  

**TL;DR**: Speculation that Jack was the Face of Boe in the past (perhaps in a previous incarnation) or that the life energy given to Jack by Rose and the Heart of the TARDIS is actually the residual life energy from the Face of Boe that allows him to die when he does so far into the future.  Mainly because Jack references things about the Face of Boe being from the past.  And his nickname might have been a transcribed memory from the actual Face of Boe or a result of the newish realization by human society that the Face of Boe was a living creature.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1ct6ke,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1ct6ke/what_if_were_looking_at_doctor_who_the_connection/,

It's a little out there but, given the humor and storytelling standards set by the developers, it honestly wouldn't have surprised me if this was more than just a fan-theory.

**Note: vague mid-game spoilers ahead.**

  
So it bothered in Borderlands 2 that every time the character dies they are brought back to life by a Hyperion operated ""New-U Station.""  I kept wondering why Handsome Jack didn't just program the machines to not re-spawn the 4 people that have the desire and power to take him down.  It's obvious from the mid-game why he wanted you alive for the first half but afterwards it seems like the technology of the Hyperion Corporation, which he controls, is the only thing keeping the player going.  Obviously it's a game convention, but I figured it would at least get acknowledged or joked about in-game.

So I got to thinking, maybe Jack, or rather Hyperion itself, wants the players to keep going simply so they use the re-spawn stations and keep paying money at every death.  And then I wondered if the entire plot might have been fabricated, without the main characters' knowledge, to keep them in the adventure, constantly dying and paying Hyperion the privileged of continuing the adventure.  What if Pandora was a giant amusement park that spits out armed animal and human clones along with the occasional robot to fight in a realistic but ultimately fake, action packed adventure.  It would be like the ultimate game of paint ball, and the New-U Stations make it so the costumers never permanently die, provided they keep paying.

In order for the system to be profitable, they would need a constant in-flux of people coming through the planet, so maybe the 4 playable characters are only a small number of the thousands of mercenary ""Vault Hunters"" that run through Hyperion's adventures. To keep the customers interested, Hyperion created two elaborate adventures and sold them to unwitting adventurers.

**Note: major, late game spoilers below.**

This also explains why no major NPCs respawn, despite the widespread presence of New-U technology.  Since T.K. Baha in the first game and Roland and Bloodwing in the second were killed for plot reasons, their ""actors"" never show up again on stage after their ""death"".  However, Hyperion likely brought them back with the New-U station and sent them out to die in the exact same scene over and over again each time a new Vault Hunter came through.

**TL:DR**; imagine if someone sold you a ticket to a planet full of adventure where you could never die, you were guaranteed to be a hero, and there was product placement everywhere.  At the end of it (Borderlands 3 maybe?) you find out it was all a fake, but fun, story that you had to keep paying to play.

Tolkien made it well known that The One Ring had a will of its own, and had an effect on the will of those who possessed it. It worked its way through various ring bearers trying to get back to Sauron, corrupting each one of them at least slightly. Smeagol had the Ring for so long that it all but entirely consumed  him. 

Now, fast forward to Frodo when he enters the Crack of Doom. As he is about to drop the Ring into the lava, it corrupts him enough that he changes his mind. He now wants to keep the Ring, and he puts it on. For a moment, it appears that the Ring had won. However, immediately after putting it on, Frodo is attacked by Smeagol who bites off his finger and plummets into the fiery pit along with the Ring, destroying it forever.

If the Ring had not corrupted Smeagol so greatly, or if it had chosen to kill him like it did with Isildur and Deagol, he never would have been there at Mount Doom, and Frodo would have led the Ring straight to Sauron. 

Therefore, The One Ring inadvertently destroyed itself.

I've been mulling this over since the end of Halo 3 and the footage from Halo 4 has made me start thinking of it again.  

Halo 4 actually happens in the past. When Master Chief rode the Forerunner Dreadnaught (Keyship) to the Ark (Installation 00) that was creating the replacement Halo, this was actually a jump through not only space, but time.  Which is why the portal generator took up so much space on Earth.  You don't need a device 28 miles wide to create a slipstream jump, unless it's doing something more than crossing a distance.  

This is the reason why 343 Guilty Spark immediately recognizes you as ""The Reclaimer"" in the first Halo.

In No Country for Old Men, it's pretty clear to me that Anton Chigurh (played by Javier Bardem) and Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (played by 	Tommy Lee Jones) are, in fact, the same person. Anton is simply personifies the new way things need to be done in order for justice to take place. The ""old way"" (Ed Tom's way) isn't effective anymore, so he adapts to the new way of doing things.

There are many parts of the film that validate this.

First of all, Anton and Ed Tom are almost the same name phonetically.

At the beginning of the film, when Anton pulls over the gentleman and then kills him with the cattle-killer device, the man who was pulled over treats Anton like an actual police officer (probably because it was really Ed Tom in uniform).

Ed Tom's ""mind wanders"" to the cattle-killer device while he is having coffee.

Anton finds Llewelyn in Mexico after Llewelyn's wife tells Ed Tom where he is.

When Ed Tom sits down in the hotel room where Llewelyn was killed, it cuts to a shot of Anton hiding in the same room. Anton, however, couldn't be hiding in there without being found- it's crawling with police officers. 

At the end of the film, when Anton ""visits"" Llewelyn's wife, she says something along the lines of ""I thought you would come,"" and acts as though she recognizes Anton. This is because she is really speaking to Ed Tom and knows that he killed Llewelyn after she told him he was in Mexico.  

Of course, there are a few holes in this theory, but it makes the film pretty mind blowing when watching it from this perspective.

That no one is completely pure in this world, and only the people who are solely good can stop evil.

1358487813.0,78,self.FanTheories,16swdc,Grandpa Joe is the real Slugworth,101,23,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/16swdc/grandpa_joe_is_the_real_slugworth/,"Let me start by saying this post relates to the original Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory film, and not the Tim Burton remake (nor the original book).

In the film, we know very little about the man they call Slugworth. All we know is he is Willy Wonka's chief rival, and that no one knows what he looks like. How do we know that no one knows what he looks like? We can surmise this from two very big clues:

1. The man Wonka hires to play Slugworth is able to fool every single family into believing he is the real Slugworth. Think about that for a second: this film takes place in a world where a trip to a chocolate factory is important enough to break up marriages over, yet everyone is perfectly willing to accept that this random actor is one of the two largest chocolate magnates in the world. This means that they both don't know what the real one looks like, and that they do know he is secretive, which is why he is able to come out in the open and make them lucrative offers (because no one else would be able to recognize him).

2. No one knows what Willy Wonka looks like. Or at least, he hasn't been seen in decades. Half the suspense of the scene where the prize winners are first outside the factory is that no one knows what to expect when the guy walks out the door. We can only assume Wonka's chief business rival is just as secretive.

Now, if no one knows what Slugworth looks like, it's entirely possible even Wonka doesn't know what he looks like. Wonka hasn't allowed a single soul into his factory in years, so it's not a far stretch to say Slugworth's factory is run with similar secrecy. There is no indication that Wonka knows anything about the real Slugworth, and is if anything paranoid about Slugworth's influence and intentions to commit industrial espionage (which is why he does the Gobstopper test with the fake Slugworth).

All that said, I propose that the real Slugworth is a man who has actually been out of the game for many years. He exists now more as a symbol, as a man who STANDS for Slugworth Chocolates for marketing purposes, but has long since retired. He is also so paranoid and secretive, he has never told his own family about his career, and they know him only as kindly old Grandpa Joe. He is content spending his twilight years in the company of his loving family, secretly paying his and his bedmates' medical bills with his vast fortune while Mrs. Bucket doesn't ask too many questions. Perhaps begrudgingly happy to have given up a life of opulence, convincing himself he is happy in the Buckets' ramshackle home while a piece of him is always regretful of the fact that in the end, he has lost to Wonka.

But when the golden ticket contest begins, Slugworth gets a taste for the game again. It's his chance to finally best his rival once and for all. At one point, he produces a Wonka Bar, even though he is bedridden and the family supposedly has no money. When he speaks with Charlie about Wonka's factory, he seems to have an encyclopedic knowledge of the place, and of Slugworth's rivalry with Wonka. And, of course, when the golden ticket finally arrived, ""Grandpa Joe"" is suddenly no longer bedridden, up and jumping around the room like a man who has been receiving expert medical care and rehabilitative treatments for years. Again, the family doesn't ask too many questions here as they are so jubilant over this fortuitous turn, but it's clear this is a man who, to some degree, has clearly been living a lie. 

On that note, how did poor little Charlie Bucket score a golden ticket, anyway? The odds would be monumentally against him even if it were being treated like any other old giveaway. But in this scenario, everyone in the world was on a scavenger hunt for this ticket. Entire companies were being shut down to search for it. Boxes of now-rare chocolate bars were being auctioned off. It was hard enough to even GET a Wonka Bar, let alone get the winning one. For a kid who only opened two Wonka Bars to find the winning ticket, he would probably have a better chance of being struck by lightning... while walking on the moon. In other words, it was virtually impossible unless “Grandpa Joe” had rigged the game by using his vast fortune and factory infrastructure to systematically hunt down a golden ticket. A well-placed deception in the news to get other people to call off their own hunts aided him greatly. When his people finally found one, all he had to do was pay off the candy store owner to sell it to Charlie, and scatter some quarters around the candy shop to make sure Charlie saw one and bought the candy bar on his way home. Then it's just a hammy acting job from old “Grandpa Joe” when he has to feign surprise at the sight of the ticket, and he's been setting the table for weeks to be the one Charlie takes to the factory. And just like that, Wonka has allowed his arch rival into the belly of the beast without even knowing it.

Once inside the factory, Slugworth is, excusing the expression, like a kid in a candy store. He's shown the giant candy room with the chocolate river. He's taken into the experimentation room to see the new candy that's being churned out. He samples the Fizzy Lifting Drinks (a mistake that nearly costs him his life). And, of course, he gets his hands on a Gobstopper. Even without the reveal at the end, the man is practically all set to steal Wonka's ideas and ruin him. As an added bonus, all the other children, who are unscrupulous enough to sell Wonka's secrets to third-tier candy makers, are *killed* during the factory tour. Note that Slugworth never does anything to try to help these kids, and in the case of Augustus Gloop may have even been partially responsible for his death (he hands Charlie a life-saving device that is too slippery for Gloop to grab onto). He is certain by the end that he and Charlie alone will be the ones with these secrets, the other parents too wracked with guilt and traumatized to be much of a threat in the future.

Note towards the end, when they are in Wonka's office. First, he demands Charlie's lifetime supply of chocolate, as a final act of humiliation for Wonka after it's discovered he's given such a grand prize to Slugworth's own grandson. Then, when Wonka is yelling at them in his office, [that's when he really loses it.](http://youtu.be/HgVS1OhucbI?t=1m9s). After a day of meeting Wonka face-to-face for the first time, he unloads on him, telling him all the things he's always wanted to say but has never been able to. He looks his business rival in the face and calls him a crook, a swindler... the man who has, in his eyes, run a dirty business for years and has always managed to one-up Slugworth. Grandpa Joe is quick to tell Charlie to take the Gobstopper and go... the Gobstopper is all he needs to best Wonka, and he just wants to take it and get the hell out of there. He says ""I'll get even with him if it's the last thing I ever do,"" a line that sounds more like that of a bitter business rival than a guy who had just become upset with Wonka 20 seconds prior. But oh, the look on his face when Charlie turns back to return the Gobstopper as he stands there, helpless in his disguise. If Wonka hadn't immediately given them the big reveal and awarded Charlie his factory, Grandpa Joe would have had a heart attack right then and there.

Of course, the rest is history. Wonka ironically believes Grandpa Joe and Charlie to be the most worthy to run his factory, the MOST honest. He awards the factory to Charlie, essentially making Slugworth, AKA Grandpa Joe, the winner in the whole sordid affair: he finally controls the Wonka empire, now reigning over a chocolate monopoly that will dominate the world. In the end, Slugworth won... though he had only himself to truly share it with.

**TL;DNR: Grandpa Joe was secretly Slugworth, retired. He sees the golden ticket contest as a chance for final revenge over Wonka. Through some good luck and expert cunning, he's able to win the factory away from Wonka, securing himself as the world's greatest chocolatier.**",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_16swdc,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/16swdc/grandpa_joe_is_the_real_slugworth/,

Just when things calmed down, we get Angry Birds Seasons/Space.  Now the working class are fighting off the same Pigs, but they are disguised as Bunnies.

The music, while similar to Ocarina of Time, is also mentioned to have a lot of influence by Chinese opera music, which often is based on fantastic stories of heroes slaying monsters. The unfamiliar setting of Termina has a lot of aspects, like the clocktower and bosses, that appear mechanized, as if built to be props for a show. Then there's the resemblance many characters in Termina share with Hyruleans from OoT. Finally, this has the most clean cut happy ending of the Zelda series, with no downsides of bittersweet moments at the end, just the world being saved and everyone's problems resolved (though not always during every cycle) by Link.

What if Link became a celebrity in one of the timelines following the events of OoT, and Majora's mask is a story written in this universe, featuring the famous Hero of Time as the main character. Similar to Super Mario Bros. 3, we play through the narrative created by some unknown writer starring our already well known heroes, and the repeating cycle of days is in addition to a gameplay mechanic, the play appearing night after night for the audience.

**TL;DR** Majora's Mask is a play written after the events of Ocarina of Time, featuring the now famous Hylian Link in adventures in a the ""new land of Termina"", which isn't real and only exists in the script, explaining all of Link's masks.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,False,,,True,t3_1ftd8e,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1ftd8e/what_if_the_legend_of_zelda_majoras_mask_was_one/,
1365309713.0,80,self.FanTheories,1bu5vz,Mario (Super Mario Bros.) and Banjo (Banjo-Kazooie) exist in the same game universe. (Warning: Very Long),127,47,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1bu5vz/mario_super_mario_bros_and_banjo_banjokazooie/,"**This is an explanation I put in to avoid confusion, I encourage you to read all of the bold words first so you know where you should start**

Now first to clarify, for anyone who is confused, a ""game universe"" is when multiple series of video games exist in one overarching setting. Such as the Donkey Kong, and Mario series, which we will be touching down on as part of this theory. 

Examples of things that do NOT make a game universe would be references, such as Razputin's (Psychonauts) corpse in Alice: Madness returns,
(http://imgur.com/MT5nR9k) or crossovers, unless their is evidence to support it, or confirmation from the an official source.

**This is where the actual fan theory starts**

So now that I've cleared that up, I'll get started.

*Donkey Kong* was released in 1981 by Nintendo, featuring a big ape known as Donkey Kong as the main antagonist. With Nintendo later confirming the protagonist (then known as jump man) was in fact Mario. Then, in 1982 *Donkey Kong Jr.* was released featuring Donkey Kong Jr. saving Donkey Kong from Mario. It's been established multiple times that Donkey Kong and Mario exist in the same universe. With the Mario series breaking away and becoming its own thing. In the same way Yoshi and Wario broke away from the Mario series to become their own thing. So now that we've established the connection with Donkey Kong and Mario, we are going to touch down shortly on the Kong family tree. 

**If you already are aware of how Donkey Kong and Mario are related you can skip this.**

In 1994 Rareware came out with a new entry into the Donkey Kong universe *Donkey Kong Country*. Which has the three character from this series we will be touching down on, which is Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, and Cranky Kong. Now you might be wondering what happened to Donkey Kong Junior or where Cranky Kong is coming from and why I said I will only be mentioning 3 characters from the Donkey Kong series, its because Donkey Kong from the original release actually grows old and becomes Cranky Kong in the Country series (and 64), while Donkey Kong Junior grows up to become the Donkey Kong we play as in Country and 64. 

**Skip to here if you are aware of who Cranky Kong is and what became of Donkey Kong Jr.**

So then, in 1997, Diddy Kong was given a standalone title developed by Rareware on the Nintendo 64 called *Diddy Kong Racing*. Now at the time of Diddy Kong Racing's release, none of the characters aside from Diddy Kong existed outside of this game. But two characters on the cast, Conker and Banjo, later received standalone titles. 

So you may want some more proof that these two exist within the Mario Universe, after crossovers aren't generally canon, that is unless their is substantial proof. There is another character in Diddy Kong Racing, Tiptup the Turtle, who later appears in Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie, during his appearance, his and Banjo ""racing days"" are referenced. Also in Banjo Tooie, Kazooie mentions Mario in a conversation with the toilet Loggo. Then once again in Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts, LOG mentions that Banjo and Kazooie have no starred in nearly as many games as ""The Italian Gentlemen"" now, if there wasn't already a piece of evidence to go off this wouldn't be any substantial proof. But in addition to Tiptups appearance and Marios mention in Tooie, its safe to say Banjo, and in turn Conker, exist within the Mario universe. 


So to recap, this means that 

The Donkey Kong series

The Mario Bros series

The Warioware/Warioland series

The Yoshi series

The Banjo-Kazooie series

The Conker series

And if Microsoft were to make a game series based off of or featuring any of the characters that were in Diddy Kong Racing. 

All exist in the same game universe, even on the same planet. 

Now obviously this doesn't really **mean** anything, its more of ""these are all related by a technicality"", but its still weird to think about that Microsoft currently owns part of the Mario universe, technically.


**Extra bits**

There are aliens in Banjo-Tooie that look very similar to Elvis from Perfect Dark. Which could mean that on a different planet the world Perfect Dark takes place on exists. 

Jet Force Gemini posters are seen in Bottles house in Banjo Tooie, which makes it possible that it is a video game series in that world, similar to the way Team Fortress 2 is a cartoon in the Half Life world, and Left 4 Dead is a movie series. Similar goes for Pokemon with a character wearing a replica Ash Ketchum hat. These however are references with no actual evidence to back it up.

Also, the Sabreman series exist in the same universe as well, as he made a non-crossover appearance in Banjo-Tooie as a character, however I didn't think it was worth mentioning in the main post.",,False,self,t5_2u6rc,1365317141.0,,,True,t3_1bu5vz,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1bu5vz/mario_super_mario_bros_and_banjo_banjokazooie/,
