Every day a few hundred come here to the lost-and-found of /r/, and ask for people who they do not know to find things that are precious to them and that become in turn precious to others.

Whether it's a remix of Starry Eyes, or a video game from one's childhood, or a song that goes ""dah tahhh dah dah daaaahhh"" or a comic book page that explains why Hawkeye feels he must not miss even a single shot, it's always an object of something that imprinted itself on a person's memory, something that made its way into someone's inner chamber, something that moved them so much as to find it once again with the help of strangers on the Internet but brethren of Reddit.

It is when the question is asked that the finder's search begins. Sometimes they too know the exact location of this lost memory, this moving moment, and solve the question for the searcher and other finders to see. Sometimes the quest can last hours or even days, scouring the Internet, scrounging through loads of data and images, combing vast caverns of forgotten .com's just to find that one lost object, or sometimes (as I've personally done) visiting a place itself to find that which has been lost.

Tried a few times, tried Reddit gold, I'll send *edit $40 PayPal* to anyone who can figure out the below book 

**EDIT if you can reference the point the book you are recommending it would be helpful, instead of just saying ""TOM AND THE WALL"" would be better like ""In Tom and the Wall there is a part where they get in a boat with a lantern guiding them and here is a photo I found showing what I mean"", or something more to go on that just a title

Someone posted this awhile ago, I resposted it few months ago but have never been able to figure out what it was, it went unsolved and has been killing me because I read the same book and just can't place it even after more time on google then I want to admit, anyone know what it is? Here was the first post:   Note I put what I can recall in *my edit* format

""It is a child's book. Possibly from the 60s, 70s, or 80s *my edit, I think it was from the 80's, I read it between 1983-87* . I only recall two things from the book. One is a child reading from a book with warm golden light pouring out. The other is a child in a small boat with a lantern hanging from an small hook above him. The boat is shaped like a chair with a tall back that curves around with the hook for the lantern. *MY EDIT I believe I remember this boat with a lantern hanging off the front of it going through a cave* If anyone knows what book this is I would be forever grateful. I loved it as a child. I seem to remember the book is sort of a compilation of stories. It may not be a single story.""

I could be totally wrong, but I think it was something like this book takes the kid through 3 tales, that are slightly interwoven IE NOT just like Chapter 1. the lantern does this. Chapter 2. the lantern and boy are now randomly in Egypt       

I think the book flowed like he had the 1st adventure, and it lead down a river to another, and then down the river through a cave,  note that it might not have been exactly 3 stories, but something in that area, and finally back in his bed at the end

EDIT I checked out Wynken, Blynken and Nod on Google images and none of them triggered anything so I'm pretty sure that is not it. Also it is NOT the Gloworms books


EDIT the person that first posted it tried again a month ago, here is his post

http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/15rmfk/tomtbook_a_book_from_my_childhood_but_i_think_its/

Here is info I believe is relevant from the first post I reference above, from user lurker_becomes_lurkd

This photo really jarred my memory, I think the boat did look something like this  ""http://i.imgur.com/Hbym1.png""

lurker wrote this "" I just remember the warm glowing light that seemed to play a strong role in the theme of the book. The light represented knowledge I think."" this triggered a strong memory with me

There was a lot of lights changing colors or something.

This has been driving me bonkers for 14 years.,305,38,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/pgsgl/tomtbookdoes_anyone_know_what_the_title_of_this/,"My mum and I read a book about 14 years ago that we both loved and then rather stupidly lent it to a neighbour...who subsequently moved. Neither of us can remember the title; I've tried Googling it, I've tried book forums, my mum has tried ringing around bookshops. Every so often one of us with bring it up purely for the purpose of tormenting the other.

Please please pleassseeeee help me find out the title and author.

THE PLOT:

It starts at the beginning with a man seemingly committing suicide by jumping off a building. Then, his son comes along to investigate to find out why. His father was involved in some way with a large pharmaceutical company.

Time rewind to backstory for the CEO of the company: when he was a child/adolescent, he became interested in devil worship. He finds a ritual knocking about somewhere and decides to test it out. He buys a rabbit from a pet shop and steals some sacramental bread. He uses them in the ritual; kills the rabbit, defiles the host...but it doesn't work. He tries again (not sure what he does differently), has to go back to the pet shop and tells the owner that the rabbit died and he wants a new one. This time the ritual is a success and this causes his father to die of a heart attack (which was the intent as he has a rabid hatred for his parents). There's a little more backstory on him; he joins a devil worship 'club', which, for all intents and purposes, is just a big shagfest of orgitastic proportions involving making their way around the available women in the group.

Right, snap to the future. We now have a woman about to give birth; something goes hideously wrong. The baby has a placental cowl and when it's removed, the baby's eyes are fused into one in the centre of his head. Oh my, he’s a Cyclops! Chaos abound!
So the guy investigating his dad's death hooks up with another woman, they start creeping about being all Holmes and Watson blah blah blah. Turns out the company has been trying to create babies with a genetic predisposition to psoriasis (and other diseases) so that they'll have to pay for the cures that the company is churning out for exorbitant prices.

Ends up with the two of them running around in the pharmaceutical building and she gets caught. They take her down in an elevator to the secret basement level labs (of course there’s a secret level) where the rapscallions do all their dodgy testing. We get to the point where they're about to pluck her eyes out of her head and replace them with eyes from massive GM frogs (this is fucked up shit). They escape somehow and set off the fire alarm system in the labs; which floods the area with halon gas (expelling all the air), killing all the lab techs/doctors down there in the process.

Very nearly at the end… somehow, the guy and this CEO dude end up in the middle of the desert. They're mishing to the CEO’s devil worshiping hang-out cave for some bizarre reason. The CEO is using his freaky mystic devil powers to make the guy forget what's going on; the guy has water on his back and he makes him believe that it's gasoline and he can’t drink it. The dude forces himself to drink the water that he knows is really there and once he gets past the taste of the ‘gasoline’ he starts to get more clear headed. They reach the cave; which is covered inside with sigils, upside down pentagrams, the usual. Then the two of them have a face-off. CEO man is bustin’ his devil power moves; other guy goes into meditative state and slows his heart beat down. The line ‘One…beat…a…minute’ pops up in there somewhere. He stays like this and then releases a load of energy in one go and BOOOM, CEO dude go bye-bye.

I seriously hope someone knows the name of this book

**EDIT:**  Reddit, I don't believe it, you've just solved 14 years of irritation in less than 24hours. The book is [The Alchemist](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Alchemist-Peter-James/dp/0451179978) by Peter James.  Thankyooooouuuuuu! (I just rang my mum and she made a squeee noise down the phone).

I saw this years ago while in Japan 2003 and found it again in the states later on, but cannot find it anymore!!  It definitely looks like an old VHS camera quality..

If I can provide more info I will!!!

Update: so it's color.. Recorded on a obvious home VHS camcorder.... He is tan, sitting at a table to the camera's right... The camera notices his hand first, then his head ( which is elongated and looks like the diva from fifth element without the tentacles)...

When you clicked on any of them, you got a window full of tiny screens, I think one of them had a cloudy sky background behind the screens. You clicked on it and you got an interactive short movie. All cheap animation. You know, it might not even be a game at all. I remember one of the shorts was nursery rhyme of Three Little Kittens, setting might have been a tree house at night.

Remember, speaking about a show that ""you saw when you were 9"" isn't that helpful because others don't know your age or who you are. Try to avoid that.

I can't say that it will be over night but it should be done in at least a week. I'm in the military and so my time is limited. This task, for me, is best done on the weekend.

I finally found a spare few hours to sit down and code a robot which will walk the submissions every so often. When the bot determines that your submission has been solved, it will place a green check-mark next to the title to denote that it has been solved! Overall, it should help this community direct more of its time to concentrating on solving things instead of clicking around looking to find unsolved posts.


Note: The robot, named cssbot, will only watch the past 72 hours worth of submissions. Let me know how it is running and any suggestions you may have to make it better.


For those technically inclined, you can fork it [here on github](https://github.com/bweck/cssbot).
I will be tweaking it, cleaning it up and documenting it better over the next few days - I just wanted to get it out in the wild now. PM me if you have any questions on the code.

I can only remember brief snippets of it, and they may not be in the right order - obviously what I'm going to say will include Spoilers, so, leave now if you don't want to find out what happens in this obscure, possible TV Movie from the early 90's.... ;)

It's going to end up being an episodes of Neighbours or something, I know it...

A kid, in a car, with Mum and Dad in the front - driving down a snowy (mountain?) road. They skid on the snow to avoid a horse (which may or may not have been pulling a cart). They hit the horse, and it kicks through the windscreen and kills the Mum.

I think.

Blah blah blah Now Single Dad tries dealing with The Kid and mourning his wife.

This is where it gets hazy: *SOMETHING* to do with timetravel.

I'll let that sink in........

Low and behold the very end of the movie, the Dad or Kid wakes up, hearing the piano being played in the house - it's the song that The Mother always used to play...implying that they've managed to 'change' the past, *or* it wasn't time travel, it was to do with being able to change certain things...

Yuma heely boops veely veely booma yuma blockeya
or even more phonetically: 
You-mah hee(or high)lee boops Vee-ly Vee-ly Boo-mah You-mah Block-ee-yah

She was German or Irish or both, but born in America. My father was raised in New Jersey so she probably lived her life in a similar area. 

EDIT: [Voice recording as requested](https://soundcloud.com/craftyintentions/yuma-heely-boops-veely-veely)

PLEASE keep in mind that this is ME saying what my Father told me years ago from what he remembers when he was 4 or 5 years old.  Though he seemed to remember it vividly, and I repeated it to myself hundreds of times so that I would never forget - he seemed so fond of the memory. 

Thanks so much for any help.  I'd love to be able to tell him what it meant, and then maybe do a silly cross stitch of it - not just of the phonetic version. I'll be so impressed if someone figures this out.

EDIT 2: Wow guys!  Thanks so much for the attention this is getting, and trying so hard.  When my Dad told me about it, I wrote the phrase down as best I could on a piece of paper, but yesterday my 2 year old spilled something on my wallet and the paper was ruined beyond recognition.  After almost 40 comments here, I sent my Dad an email requesting a little more information about it - his own phonetic pronunciation, and whatever he can remember about her.  I'll update when I get that info, and I'll wait to repost to a different translation subreddit until I have HIS phonetic interpretation. 

It's like a game of telephone across decades of time. 

EDIT 3: There's a twist!  Here's what my dad says: ""It was my Mom’s Mother- My Nana.  You got it pretty right. It was something like: “Yuma highly boops veely veely booma yuma block-eeya.”  Supposedly it was related to something in Yiddish or Pennsylvania Dutch (German). She also sometimes said the more understandable “Cheese and Rice Got Damp in my Cellar.”"" 

I remember him mentioning the ""Cheese and Rice Got Damp in my Cellar"" thing - aka ""Jesus Christ God Damn it to Hell"". 

So that's the Irish/German Branch of the family, but I couldn't remember which branch was what.

Jackaltoad found it for me! [It's this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvqtE1VEcME)! Thank you Reddit, you've set my soul at ease!**

I used to hear this song all the time back in 1999 when I lived in Oklahoma. It was played on 93.7 KSPI The Spy. It's a college station out of Stillwater that played 'alternative' music at the time.

The song was sung by a moody female singer with a warbly guitar sound. The lead up to the chorus went something like:

*Many days just to see you falling, spinning wheel*

The timing always worked against me on never hearing the name of the song or singer/band. I'd be driving somewhere and arrive at my destination as the song ended or something like that. 

After a few months of not driving a whole lot, I'm cruising around and put on the radio only to discover that 93.7 has switched to a goddamn pop station! Over 10 years later I still think of that song, but I can't figure out what it was and the lyrics I recall aren't enough to show up on a google search.

Please help me Reddit, you're my only hope.

Edit: Thanks for the help so far. I'll follow the advice given and post something with me humming the toon later today. Does anyone know if there's a way to look up top radio singles from a given year and genre? A list of 'alternative rock singles from 1999' might help.

Also, the closest singing I can think of that sounds like that voice is the singers from Morcheeba and the chick from Sneaker Pimps. I've listened to as much of those groups as I can and I don't think it's either one, but they sound similar to the song I'm looking for.",Solved,False,,t5_2r4oc,1350354858.0,solvedcase,,True,t3_11i7bw,http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/11i7bw/a_song_has_been_haunting_me_for_over_10_years/,

1369141434.0,166,self.tipofmytongue,1erez6,[TOMT] All I can remember is this scarring movie scene from a film I accidentally stumbled upon as a child. NSFW description.,212,46,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/1erez6/tomt_all_i_can_remember_is_this_scarring_movie/,"Remember being in a hotel in Mexico flipping through channels and stopping at a movie network channel to briefly witness a scene from this movie.

This is going to be incredibly weird-sounding because the memory is convoluted in my head and I was young when I watched it (around the years 2000-2002). The film is probably not from then, just thought I'd give a little more information.

Anyways, here's the description: There is an alien or monster. And inside his cave/lair there are a few people he is keeping as prisoners. One of them, I think it was a woman, is strapped to chair similar to the one you find at the dentist. Another prisoner is definitely a man. The alien/monster then proceeds to take a hand drill and tortures her. 

I was so scarred by the scene, that I quickly changed the channel, but it has haunted me for many years since.

EDIT: I'm pretty sure that the scene is the opening scene of the movie if that helps at all. Also pretty sure it's an alien (black and humanoid) not a monster.

EDIT2: Judging by the many comments, this is not an obvious one. I guess that means we can assume it is a slasher B-flick as opposed to a popular blockbuster that I might have not known out of ignorance. And to reiterate, I'm almost certain there was an alien involved. Hope this helps a little!

FINAL EDIT: Well that's that then! /r/horror figured it out. The movie was called Evil Aliens!

It's a fairly famous song I am pretty positive. But no way I ever found out the artist or the name. Its really good.
I recorded the main part of the vocal, I really am bad at singing but I think if you know this song, you will recognize it.
I have no idea about the lyrics other than it's a female singing and possibly 90's. Could be earlier. It was played a lot of times on radio etc.
Offering 5$ on paypal who solves this.

edit: 
guyz I did another recording, almost the same but a little better https://soundcloud.com/m-7/song-im-looking-for-ages-rec2/s-wd7Ey. I am positive if you know the song you will recognize it by this (horrible) recording. !!! thanks a bunch so far. lots of plays in the clip 
also more clues. It has probably a breakbeat and strings/pads , possibly keys. Maybe piano a little too. Im sure about the strings/pads. It is pretty melancholic

My ideas:  

* allow a great deal of trustworthy users that frequent the site to mark posts as solved.

* if a certain number of any other users type 'solved' to respond to an answer (2 or 3), have it automatically mark as 'solved.'  [this would be kind of like the old system with 'solved' responses to answers, but for any user instead of just OP]

a few aspects to focus on as essential based on the original points plus feedback:

It was a terrible romance novel. The main character is a French girl. She is bathing in a pond in the woods when of course a handsome man rides by and decides to rape her. After this, she runs back to her family to report the rape. When the guy shows up at their family home, her brothers force him to marry their sister despite both of them protesting. Regardless the marriage takes place, and the new husband says he has to leave and get on a ship. The girl follows him, and boards the vessel with him against his wishes. On the journey they begin to fall in love, but he is shanghaied by another ship and forcibly conscripted. The girl is left to the crew, who continuously rape her until she has a miscarriage. Later on she is rescued off the coast of America by pirate Jeanne Lafayette, who begins to help her put herself back together. Unable to return his affection, she eventually is reunited with the first guy who raped her, and tries to escape him by buying her own house. She is eventually engaged to a foppish man who was one of her suitors. The sister of this man does not like her, and plots to have her removed. Her fiance's sister and cousin conspire to kidnap and sell her into slavery. The cousin is having a gay affair with her finace, and the cousin rapes her before she is sold off to slavery. Finally she is given over to a cruel slave master who, you guessed it, rapes and beats her. She attempts to run away, earning herself the brand of a runaway slave, until finally she kills the slave owner and escapes, only to be discovered again by the very first rapist, who rapes her again. Seeing that she does not enjoy this (surprise!) she finally makes a deal with the former fiance's sister (who somehow also knows the first guy) to go back to France, where she gives birth after being told she would never have children. Eventually the first guy finds her in France and the two become a couple.

They end up finding work on a farm. They earn money but the cost of working (lodging) is always greater than their earnings. They cannot leave farm until debt is paid off. There is an African-American friend who ends up working with the family on the farm. Towards the end the owner of farm rapes the daughter of the family which causes a riot. That is all I can remember now. Help appreciated.

EDIT: Added info. Local cops are in on farm exploitation

EDIT2: Thank you all but the book is not Grapes of Wrath. White family with a black friend, not criminals. Leave their own town (don't remember why) to look for work. Go south (not west). They borrow money from the farm owners  because what they earn is not enough to live on. This is how they become indebted to them and cannot leave until the ever growing debt is paid off. Sometimes they travel to a nearby small town. They managed to inform the sheriff of their situation. They get punished on the farm for informing the sheriff who collaborates with farm owners. The rape leads to riot which might or might not kill the owners. Also not 30's because wondering how such thing could happen in modern times, but I will back away from stating that in 60's. I need that one guy who also read it.

I was in the video store (Videos Etc.) in the late 90's/early 00's. The movie was in the action section. It had a painterly style to it, like 70's and 80's movie poster art, so it was probably from that era.

The image centered around a diver breaking the surface of the water, weapon raised. The angles of everything depicted in the above rendering match my memory pretty closely, though there may be more water splashing and running off the diver. I tried to approximate the colors as best I could remember.

It's *almost* [Thunderball](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-t-h01f5ILAk/TmQjdeRoJzI/AAAAAAAAAcY/efgqbCODM_4/s1600/LP+front.jpg), but not quite.

Weirdest thing I've ever seen, want proof that it actually exists and I didn't hallucinate.",144,27,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/1h4rr7/tomt_french_movie_might_have_come_out_in_the_80s/,"So a bit of background, I went to Ireland on a class trip about 5 years ago and stayed up till 3 AM watching this French movie. About every 5 minutes my roommate asked me ""are you seeing this?"" and about every 3 seconds I muttered ""what the fuck."" Since that night I've been looking for this film mainly to convince myself that we didn't hallucinate because of a gas leak or something.
So the movie kinda goes like this: Frenchie 1 (maybe middle aged or a bit younger) is visiting his adoptive brother with down syndrome at an assisted living home and the brother is laying on the ground feeling the moles scurry underneath him.
BAM flashback: Frenchie 1 (maybe 10 years old or younger here) is living in a huge house with his mother, father, and older sister, who we will call Frenchette. Frenchie 1's father disappears, and his mother is shopping with the kids at the market. As she reaches the cash register blood starts dripping from her forehead. So now the mother's out the picture, and Frenchie 1 and Frenchette are chilling alone at home, Frenchette takes a bath-
BAM incest: Yup. Incest.
BAM back to the present: Frenchie 1 runs into a woman who looks a lot like his sister and he falls in love with her. She loves him, and he believes she might be his sister.
BAM we're in the future now: Frenchie 1 is old and alone. Really don't remember what happens. Probably nothing important.
BAM flashback: Frenchie 1 and Frenchette are still doing the incest thing, when a friend of Frenchie 1's, Frenchie 2, starts to become jealous and threatens Frenchie 1 with a knife. Then something happens and Frenchie 1 is adopted by a nice family with a child with down syndrome.
BAM future again: We see Frenchie 1 still being alone driving his care, and see a rich older guy I assumed to be Frenchie 2 in a completely new environment, his mansion. Frenchie 2 is gunned down in his bathrobe, and the movie ends with Frenchie 1 driving behind a UHaul-esque moving van that opens up to reveal his sister playing the trombone and a guy singing on piano. He starts laughing and
BAM he turns into a plastic bag blowing in the wind.

It was log-shaped, about 4-5"" long and about the diameter of a nickel or quarter, like a thicker Tootsie Roll. I don't remember anything about the wrapper, but I do remember that the candy itself was in a folded white paper tray just like how the larger Tootsie Rolls are stored in their wrapper. The core was root beer flavored (it has been suggested that it may have been sassafras or sarsaparilla), translucent dark brown, with a texture and consistency like taffy (so if you pulled it apart you'd get those characteristic taffy ""tendrils""). This core was rolled in chopped nuts; it may have been walnuts, almonds, or hazelnuts, but definitely wasn't peanuts.

It was definitely a manufactured (not handmade) candy and I used to get it from the local ice cream man and the local pharmacy. This was in central New Jersey.

*Edited for words and details.*

Some of the responses are starting to repeat, so let me further clarify.

* Specific candies that it is NOT include: Tootsie Rolls, pecan nut roll, Cow Tails, Payday, Charleston Chew, candy sticks, fudge

* It is NOT a pecan log roll, though the form factor and general appearance is similar. My mystery candy had a distinct translucent brown root beer core. No pecan roll has that.
* It was NOT bite-sized. This would have been the same size as a standard candy bar.
* It was NOT a hard candy.
* It had no chocolate anywhere on or in it.
* It had no peanuts anywhere on or in it.
* The core was not actually a taffy, it just had the same ""pulling properties"" of taffy. Taffies are opaque due to the hundreds of folds and trapped air bubbles within. The core of this candy was translucent, like jelly in appearance, but would pull apart similar to a taffy. Imagine, say, a Chuckle that you could pull apart and get taffy-like tendrils between the pieces.
* The core was not wrapped around or mixed with anything.
* I am pretty certain that this was not a sugar-free candy as this would have been in the mid 70's and ""sugar free candy"" wasn't really a thing back then.",,False,,t5_2r4oc,1368300377.0,,,True,t3_1e2buz,http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/1e2buz/an_unusual_candy_i_adored_as_a_child/,

       --- a thin white woman with small breast, brown hair and I think hair bangs is sitting on the floor in a bedroom covered with a blanket. A man breaks open the bedroom door. The man has a full beard. The bearded man walks to the woman, picks her up by her arms. She maintains holding on to the blanket to cover herself. She has something colorful on her hair, maybe feathers. The bearded man then grabs the blanket and drops it down. This reveals her naked body. The bearded man then picks her up and throws her onto the bed. Then you see the bearded man on her and a close up of her face. She is smiling and laughing.---

The men of the bar/theater are cheering this whole scene while the main character just stares at the actress quietly. He then realizes he is now by himself watching a blank screen.  He then goes out to search for this woman he saw on the screen. 

He somehow finds her agent, a man,  and then her. I remember the main character was with her and her agent in a bathroom. She was in the bathtub and the agent said something about if he wants to be with her or something he has to have sex with her in the bathtub while the agent watches. The main character agrees. 

 I remember one strange thing that happen sometime later. They end up at some private party where guest play this deadly game. They lay on the ground facing up.. I don't remember how many but more than 6 people. There is a big heavy ball that's maybe black and spiky hanging above them. I don't remember if they were in a row or in a circle. The game starts by the ball being swung. It swings and swings. At some point it will just drop on one or two of them. This was the point of the game. It was like a game of Russian roulette. As it got closer to falling on someone, at least one woman was cheering it on. Eventually it falls on someone and there is blood on everybody. 

That's most of what I can remember. I hope someone else has seen it and knows the title, actors/actress name, image of the vhs cover, maybe a link to the trailer or entire film. Something. I really want to see it again. Thanks

Solved!!!! I fucking love reddit.  Its “Carnival of fools”  I can't find a trailer or film online to watch it and it might be a while before I can watch it, I'm broke, but at least I know the title!!! This film has been on my mind since I was a kid. I don't remember what age but I was prepubescent when I watched it. I always wondered what  women were hiding under their cloths and after watching this film and seeing the girl go nude, I discovered women are hiding beauty. I watched scenes of the film over and over. Rewind button was used constantly and I would stay up late watching in the living room. My dad didn't care but my mom was bothered by it. The girl and scenes in this film has shaped part of my erotic mind. There are two female looks that I find extremely attractive and one type is the girl in this film. She is probably why I like her type. She was the first nude I saw. I was so into it and my mom so bothered by it, my mother threaten to throw it away. I said she wouldn't really do that. She then took the movie and started walking outside to throw it away to the big dumpster. I walked right by her confident she really wasn't going to do it. Then when we both ended up at the dumpster, she just threw it in the big dumpster. I was shocked and cried. I was too small to climb it so I knew I was never going to see it again. I serious thought that if I ever won the lottery, that I would spend thousands of dollars for ads in two major city publications asking the readers if they know what film this is. That's how much I wanted to find this film. But with reddit and this subreddit I didn't have to spend a dime. Thanks to whoever created this subreddit.

* It has a closed ecosystem, everything is reused and recycled, there are huge waste disposal sites around the city, with roboters delivering and processing the waste. Even the food is reused.
* The male protagonist falls asleep in the subway, it travels out of the city where he is dumped due to a malfunction.

Edit: Probably came out last year or even 2011. 
Edit 2: Okay, my memory is clearing up and I am getting more details. First thing is that the cover has text right in the middle. The font is similar to maybe the Cobra Starship logo.

The only lyrics she remembers are ""you make me wet like water"". Still, no song by them with those lyrics that I could find.

A little more digging and I found what I thought was the song. But it was weird. I didn't find the song. I just found a lot of people just like me from five years ago looking for the song.

Basically, the story is as such:  
Humanity has developed faster-than-light travel, and is exploring nearby solar systems. Every now and then they discover the remains of civilizations built by intelligent alien life. As they investigate the ruins, they find that all of these civilizations have, in one way or another, obliterated themselves into extinction. This includes not only using weapons of mass destruction, but things like cannibalism and widespread suicide that seemingly occur suddenly and for no apparent reason.

Eventually, a human ship comes across a space-faring race that hasn't destroyed itself, yet when it attempts to communicate with them, they aliens immediately attack the human ship. I forget how exactly, but eventually the humans find out that the reason they were attacked was because they came from a sector of the galaxy that inexplicably drives all intelligent life within totally insane, and now the other intelligent races of the galaxy are intimidated by this species that has come out of this sector seemingly unscathed.

Human governments and militaries latch onto this opportunity and exploit the other species' fear of us. This includes things like making all of our technology that comes into contact with aliens either by communication or trade look needlessly intimidating, and people that visit alien worlds wear cloaks with hoods or powersuits that obscure their actual physical features.

That's all I've got right now; I've spent an hour or two on Google but can't find anything relating to it.

I'm looking for a very obscure arcade game from the late 90's/early 2000's. The gameplay wasn't anything special but what set it apart was the input method and the shape of the cabinet. I saw it... I think around 2003/2004 in one of those Haven Holiday parks in the UK. It was pretty weird. It spat out tickets, as I recalled.

It was conventionally shaped but it was longer along the bottom ([doodle of layout included](http://i.imgur.com/tWch0fp.png)).

Now. Unusually, the 'joystick' was gun-shaped, as many cabinets where bit it didn't rotate on the X or Y axis. Instead, it slid left and right, forwards and backwards, just like a mouse does (though only so far) and it was also able to rotate on the Z axis. All were limited, with an absolute center, like a joystick but again, no X or Y rotation.

From what I can tell, this is called a ""[Linear Slide](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umWgCpT1eIA)"" but so far I've only seen this in output gear, not on a controller. Picture if the joystick were on the head of the slider and you could move it, like a mouse but it was measured like those pistons.

I'm not so much interested in the game itself so much as the proper formal name of the input method -- but the game would help, since I can look up the hardware used to make it once I know its name.

Third night, the soldier is told to hide behind a pillar. The coffin opens, and the princess walks around, screaming, but she can not find the soldier. Then she dies. So, this story gave me nightmares when I was 7 or 8. I would love to read it again and also find the other stories which appear in the same book.

Hey reddit!


I have been searching the whole day because I want to find a youtube channel I visited months ago. Unfortunately did I not save the link and sold my old computer. You might think: ""God, why would u doo that"" and the simple answer is, that I want to watch the videos on it. LOL
THINGS I REMEMBER:


- It was on youtube
- There were 6-15 videos (each about 7-10 minutes)
- Most of the videos (all?) were INTENTIONALLY FAKED documentaries about paranormal or mysterious stuff.
- They were produced between 1970-1990 (you can clearly recognize the retro look and the low camera quality of that time). quality wasnt too bad though.
- The producer might be from France
- The documentaries were made to appear real, to entertain and to scare. it was not like some obvious faked ghost hunter series. It was acutally pretty scary to me, even though i knew it was not real.
There might have been ""X Files"" ""Lost Footage"" ""Lost Files"" in the video name (not the series ""Lost Files"")


CONTENT:


-Video was about a stranded boat that was found, with only a camera in it..the guy in the boat had survived for some weeks, with nearly no food, nothing to drink (i think he fished in 1 of the clips which were shown). he always appeared happy and in the last clip he leaves the boat and swims away, then u only hear some wierd sounds and you can hear that he gets pickd up by a ""light"" (the footage was mostly in brown colors, since the ""original footage"" used in the documentary was from the early 20. century

-there was an FBI coverup and it had to do with aliens, or an alien in a human body, a person was forbidden to leave the house and died while under arrest..i dont exactly know what it was about, sorry.
there was an expedition on a mountain, and there were some wierd natives, that were able to move very fast between the mountains (and scared the expedition by doing that). In the end 1-2 people disappeared, I think there were aliens involved again.

-There was a child, that was able to use telekinesis..there was footage of its childhood, how he moved stuff (like paranormal activity), then later how he was used for experiments. he ended up killing is family and the dog by drowning them in the pool. scary.
-There were more documentaries but i dont remember them.
If any1 provides I link or something that leads to the channel/videos, I will reward the person somehow with a small christmas present.

1) Asian girl and her boyfriend start having sex in the morning, she finishes and realizes what time is it. Gets off the guy and gets dressed while he's complaining. She comes back, blows him, and then leaves. After she leaves, a blonde in red appears and takes him back to Hell and has him seduced.

2) Fat, short devil is sitting on his throne in ice (since Hell has frozen over) and there are two girls in front of him that are naked. He's telling his blond worker/daughter to corrupt the world (or something, I think)

3) Blonde devil-girl gets fucked on couch by two guys wearing sunglasses.

I was at a babysitter's house and hiding behind the chair, watching them watch this horror movie.

The only scene that I can remember is this:

It was a scene where either a little boy a girl (I'm leaning towards girl, but I honestly can't remember) asleep on a bed, and this troll/goblin/leprechaun-y type creature is sitting on her chest. All of a sudden, it kind of breathes in, and there's this purple-ish mist that comes out of her and is sucked into his lungs. I think something stops it from continuing the soul-sucking, but once again, I can't remember. I DO remember the goblin being flung around the room, and landing on a record player (maybe?) and getting spun around until his head is chopped off, or his body is chopped in half, something like that.

PLEASE someone help me. I've honestly thought about this movie for years, and never knew the name of it. I've never seen it since, never seen anything even remotely like it. Nobody knows what I'm talking about when I mention it, and I've been wondering for fifteen+ years now.

He was having a hard time re-adjusting to ""normal"" life after that, so he went back into the army a year later. Since he was having a difficult time while he was home, I figure it's possible he's remembering the date wrong. That being said-- I think he still probably remembers better than my grandma... so I'd stick with 1971, haha.

He was working at Silver Dollar City in Branson, MO (doing pottery) when they found him &amp; asked him to be on the show. Apparently they found a lot of the show's guests there, though. If anyone on Reddit can figure out which episode it was, we will be forever grateful! My grandpa just acted like it was no big deal and he didn't know why we were so excited about it, lol.

Today, I was listening to NPR and eventually, the topic got to this new hit game that was causing some controversy. It was like Minecraft but was based off a USB that you plug into your computer and try to survive for as long as possible. When you die in the game, you're not able to replay the world, so you have to give it to a friend, until the game makes full circle around your friends. The point of the game was to see what it would be like after you die in the game and see how things turn out.

I think I remember the name Generations being mentioned, maybe That's the name. If somebody could tell me where I could find this game, I would love you forever.

The key memorable part is that in the song they would break in with a reporter doing a news report and he was talking about how bad punk rock was and how it was effecting the youth, etc. I believe the reporter's name was Lou and the singer would mock him in the song. The singer said things like 'Hey Lou, got a little mortal on the way'. Then it would get fast I it sounded like the singer was singing ""To the ghetto just get em"" or something like that.

It featured very dark, earthy colors like grey, maroon, and dull greens. The lines were done in pen.  Some of the illustrations I remember were of very large spaces, like a library or a church.  The had a gothic feel to it, but I would like to emphasize the feeling of *space* that these images created.  I'm pretty sure it was a library.  I vaguely recall a librarian figure, but I'm not sure. There were definitely books, however.

It had a very similar feel to primitive first-person RPG games where you explore room-by-room.  One room had a big birdbath type thing like a fountain or baptismal font.  There were plenty of archways.  It gave of such a feeling of loneliness.

I remember some of the lyrics, please excuse me for any errors. For a word/verse I couldn't make out, I just replaced with a question mark.

""allow me to waste a ? of space, 
as i drift to a place of ? and grace, 
new sense of power, 
new sense of taste, 
sobering dream, 
and a noble escape.
as i ? away on the clear golden glass, 
something to canvas, 
(can't remember the rest of the verse).

CHORUS:
i will never be a acquaint,
that world just wasn't meant for me.
i'm ? heading through the seas,
riding the waves of the world.

another second on the surface,
catch one last breath before i dive,
beauty of life through the grain gift of death.""

I am sorry it's so botched, but it's really all I can remember. The song is a mellow rock song, the guy's voice is so smooth, almost like he's talking instead of singing. I am sure it's a song from the early 00's. To be honest, the song kind of reminds me of something from Linkin Park, but it's not them.

So when I was in 6 grade I watched the fallowing movie on late night
HBO. This would have been around 2001-2002 and the movie couldn't have
been older than the early 90's.
It ran something along the line of a mother and daughter on and Island
(or either they lived close to a shore in the neck of the woods) and
this man (a young man) rides his motorcycle around and falls in love
with the Daughter. The mother is upset with this and tries to ward of
the young man. The daughter ends up running off with the young man and
has sex with him in a motel, where when he looks up during the act he
see's the mother stabbing him (she obviously doesn't its more like a
trick of the eye/him imagining it). The film goes on, and it turns out
that the mother wanted to keep the daughter on the island so that the
daughter would kill the mother (which there mother's mother had her do
the same thing)and carry on the tradition. I believe there is
something along the lines on an abandoned mineshaft where the murder
had happened of the mother's mother--infact there is a creepy little

The main character sees what radiation does to the cancer, and is able to fine tune the radiation (or convince the friend who works there to do it) so only the type that kills the cancer is used, sparing the patients a lot of time and side effects, etc.

It was told in the second person from the woman's perspective. You wouldn't have known that the intentions of the man were to kill her unless you read the majority of it. I've been looking for this for a while, it was just very creepy. I don't think it got very much attention in terms of upvotes.

Edit: I didn't think this would get any attention at all, to be honest. I thought maybe someone read the same comment and actually bothered to save it. 

Anyways, I'll go more in depth with this edit. I can't provide very solid information because it was a year ago when I read the comment. I'm very sure the comment was made in /r/nosleep, but I have no idea what thread, I read way too many stories there. I will say that I was very attached to the ""correspondence"" series and might have found it there. Again, not sure.

The first thing you'd notice about the comment is that the comment string it was in had absolutely nothing to do with the content of the story. It was very out of place and very long. When I read it, it had maybe 20 upvotes and only one reply that said ""What did I just read?""

The story begins with the man inviting ""you"" to his house. They're both having a good time, laughing and joking and drinking together. This continues for a bit until s9mething changes. It's hinted that there was something in the drinka. Suddenly the man is emotionless and quiet. He invites her back to his bedroom.

This is the abstract part because it describes very descriptively what the woman is thinking in her haze as she knows what's about to happen and slowly just accepts it. The story ends with her on his bed with his intentions clear, but not yet acted upon.

It was hardcover (library bound) and the dust jacket had a printed burlap or canvas background. The back flap mentioned that the author's name was a pseudonym. (And not some 'that name will sell books' pseudonym, but an 'I'm hiding my true identity' one.) The book had lots of conversation, anecdotes and opinions with little to no 'action'.

It begins shortly after the formation of a world government, and the President of Earth is presiding over the trial of Earth's only immortal man, for the crime of withholding the secret of immortality. Much of the book is taken up by his narration of stories of his life, from his birth in prehistoric times to the present. This could almost be the backstory of 'The Man From Earth', but IIRC the main character was never a famous person.

One anecdote I remember is what he called 'Pavlov's Other Experiment', with the supposed discoveries by the scientist after the surprising results of the 1924 Leningrad flood. The novelist added a vitamin deficiency factor that became an important plot point. There was also a story I recall as being very amusing about a British military steamship in Egypt before or during the occupation in the eighteen hundreds.

And finally, as a major plotline (such as it is), everybody is taught the simple trick to become immortal. When dead people are cloned and become 99.99% similar, their soul and memories are reunited with their bodies and they are taught immortality; time-traveling robots collect DNA from everyone who has ever lived and they become immortal as well.

As I said, I've been on the lookout for this book for the last thirty-five years, so if anybody can help, you will have my eternal gratitude.

1. Was in poetry format, nothing fancy as far as I can remember.

The scene cuts to her lying face down, dead and with the baby by her side. A horse drawn carriage pulls up to her, as well as the baby's, corpse.

* I saw this film in either 1989 or 1990.

Yeaaaah, this one is kind of a long shot! Any help would be appreciated! 

EDIT: The song was playing in the store.

EDIT 2: The vocals were low and sultry, and the singer had kind of a breathy, sighing voice. It's possible that the vocals had some sort of effect added that made them sound almost muffled--like they were playing from an old record. 

I don't remember too much about the instrumentation--it wasn't very prominent in the part that I remember. It was low-key, kind of coffee-shop jazzy.

It was always a wonderful experience for me, except for one time. I remember I found a book that didn't so much scare me as deeply disturb me. I didn't have nightmares about it, but it stayed on my mind for a very long time, and always popped up in my thoughts when I least expected it. IIRC, it was supposed to be a children's picture book. I believe the plot centered around a man trying to grow some manner of fruit/vegetable in his garden, but a mysterious creature frequently appeared and...ate the stuff, I think? Sounds pretty harmless so far. Except for the fact that the creature in question was something like a brown anteater--but with people inside it. I think it was a costume, and the people inside were just messing with the guy trying to grow vegetables, but something about the way it was drawn and the story played out really disturbed me. The only other thing I remember--and I remember this quite vividly--is that the guy growing stuff said ""Alas and alack"" at one point or another. Which, looking back, is a pretty out-of-place statement in a children's book.
 I get the feeling that this book wasn't made to be creepy at all, and that it just somehow burrowed itself into my subconscious and sat there like a rock. Either way, creepy or not, I really want to know what the picture book was called so I can take another look at it.  
I discovered this book in the early '00's at the Allentown Public Library, if that helps. And the book wasn't very old--it was probably published around that time frame, too.

(x-post from movies),89,19,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/wd9qc/can_anybody_help_us_remember_the_name_of_a_movie/,"Okay so many moons ago I saw a movie on TV. I don't think our family rented it, I think it was on lifetime or something. Here are the following bits and pieces that I remember from the movie:

The main premise: There is a single dad with three kids. The youngest is a girl. The other two are one boy and one girl but I don't remember their ages. The dad falls in love with a girl, who the kids really like. He has her over for dinner one night and he is going to propose to her. Something goes wrong with the ring, and there is some sort of trouble. The dad gets nervous about proposing and goes upstairs for a long time. In the end, the little girl has to step up and propose for the dad.
She says, ""Will you marry us?"" the girlfriend says yes and it is oh so happy.

Here are a few other random details that I THINK are from that same movie.
1. something with a pizza guy coming to deliver something. He comes into the kitchen and there is a problem of some sort.
2. The dad tried to do something clever with the ring. It either got lost in food of some sort, or maybe had something to do with the pizza guy.
3. There might have been a goose in the kitchen.
I have been trying to figure out what movie this is my whole life. As for a year it was on TV, It had to be at least six years ago, if not more.

It had a weird name too, which is making it really hard for me to remember. I have tried Google but as you can see I have little to go on. I'm just hoping a fellow Redditor has heard of this awesome book or knows something about it. It was read to us back in the late 80s/early 90s so it must have been published before or around then. Not very long, probably a thin 12 paged book with big pages and color pictures. If you're thinking Bandersnatch or JubJub bird from the Lewis Carroll story 'The Jaberwocky' you are probably picturing the right sort of bird and this story may have been adapted from that, but it certainly involved an escape from a zoo and a scary, tall-ass, freaky looking bird. Thanks for helping! If I can find it I'll gladly buy it and post pictures!

It was a 3D animated segement (wierd for that time/late 90's) about a kid who was playing a computer game where he could choose characters such as an GRANDMA / ACCOUNTANT / CHILD ETC.. to fight this commando in a death arena... dont remember much else except for that the commando said things like ""MONKEY WIENIES"" and the accountant's only move against the commando was ""Throw Calculator"" 

The thing is in 24 years of my life I never heard my dad laugh as hard as he did that night.... we still talk about that show every time we see each other because neither of us know the name, it's kind of been a liflong quest of ours to find the name... if anyone can just find the name that would be amazing..... if you find the clip though you would bring the old man happiness like I have only seen once before :)

He played with his friend for a while but they quit when it started getting too weird. I remember it being Mind-something, but I could be mixing it up with something else. I also remember other people claiming to have heard of it, one guy even said he found out about it through a billboard.

Apparently the group had videos telling you about them and they wore white masks or something similar to that, and after a while the site was closed to the public. It was a cool mystery and I'd like to read about it again.

Edit: I'm gonna try and elaborate a little more. I don't mean faceless white creatures by the mask thing, I remember it having these people in generic plastic white masks. I think there were a few videos with the white masked members but honestly I was a little unsettling so I didn't watch them.

And I'm not completely sure if it was an ARG. Maybe it was, but at the same time it seemed so real. My mind might just be playing it up but I don't remember seeing any of the stuff that usually comes with those sort of games (which admittedly I don't know much about). It was mostly anecdotal evidence from people like the guy I mentioned. He said he signed up for this group and at first it was a fun little thing to do with his friend, but the ""tasks"" required increasingly more personal information so they quit.

I think another guy said he was driving late at night and saw a billboard advertising them, I'm not sure how exactly. Graffiti? An actual ad? I don't know. There were some other people commenting about it on reddit and even a few other sites.

Major plot point is the establishment of a last remeanant of humanity on an isolated world following a star going super nova. In order to ensure stability, progress is artifically repressed and kept in state (think something along the line of the Priesthood in WH40k), with 'trusted' individuals having a non understanding role operating technology.

People are ruled over by a technocratic priesthood consisting of individuals who formally questioned the social/technological arrangement, who're inducted and sworn to secrecy for the greater good.

Protagonist is a young man who does so, is eventually inducted. 

Needless to say, pretty dark book, possibly written by one of the bigger names in SF.

Cheers :D

Edit: the religion also focuses around anthropomorphising the Super Nova as a war within heaven.

The story has some connection to the four seasons song December 1963 (oh what a night)
It involves a young monk going to a brothel to ""lay his wild seed"" before he becomes a true monk as an adult
He describes himself as pretty handsome and popular among girls, but he has always been too shy to lose his virginity
When he reaches the brothel, the owner welcomes him and suggests to him some unexperienced and younger looking prostitutes, but he sees one who is very developed and he likes her.  Although the owner tries to dissuade him from choosing her, saying that she is unexperienced, he ends up choosing her.
He is waiting in the room when the girl comes in with a tray of food.  After putting it down, she proceeds to bathe him with lotion and also give him a hand job (he describes it as a little painful at first, and he describes his semen a hit white lava, or something along those lines)
After that, they go to bed and when he starts to fuck her, she giggles when he misses and gets too excited, and helps guide him in.  They end up fucking 27 times that night.  When the prostitute asks if he wants her to stay with him for the entire night, he says yes and she is glad because the other clients abuse her, while he does not.

It was set in an underground laboratory. A bunch of scientists (I assume) were doing experiments on two subjects that were in an incubator, their faces hidden from the audience throughout the hole movie. So classically they became trapped in the lab and the male experiment was freed from his cocoon, completely deformed and monster like and went on a killing spree.

In the end of the movie they kill the monster but the other subject, the female, awakes, and it ends.

I have a bit of an odd request.

My father once told me the story of a band that was pretty popular when he was young. They recorded great material, but rarely (if ever) played live shows. Seeing their popularity grow with each recording (aided by the ""mystery of the band that never played live""), they decided to put on this big show that quickly sold out.

Once the night of the gig came around, they opened to a full venue - completely out of tune and out of practice. With every song they played it only got worse, until they were booed off stage by an angry mob of 'fans' and disappeared never to be heard from again.

Now, I know that this story sounds like just that - a story - but my dad is convinced it happened. Unfortunately, he can't remember the band's name. Here's what he can remember, though:

* They were active some time between the 60s and the 80s (my dad was born in 1953, if that helps).
* They were a rock band or some variation on the genre (I know that this doesn't help much).
* They were either American or English.

I've been searching for them sporadically for the past seven years, but never managed to find something relevant. I hope you guys will have more luck with this than me.

- Memento (2000)

In a large city, maybe NYC. There is some sort of outbreak of infection (kind of like a zombie) where the affected person is like a shell of their former self. They act cold and lifeless but still walk around looking kind of normal. There is a scene where the therapist woman is seeing a long-time client of hers, an older frumpy woman. The client has been having marriage problems. One day, she calls in to tell the therapist she feels unsafe in her home (her husband just killed the family dog), and can't come in for her appointment, because she doesn't know who she can trust anymore. Therapist looks out the window and sees her client talking on a cell on the crosswalk in the street below. The client's husband is now in the waiting room of the therapist's office. He's a zombie-thing, and the therapist knows(?), and tells the client not to come in. There's another scene later on where the therapist lady is in her home, and a bunch of the infected people are trying to get her. One bangs on the door at night, and she opens it a crack (with the safety chain latch on) and he says he's like a TV repair guy or something. The lady tries to shut the door but he tries real hard for a few minutes to get in and then he just leaves.

The story ocurrs in a sort of space base where researchers from several races (humanity not present) work to try and decipher several (I think it was five) messages that have been found embedded into the natural laws of phisics of the universe.

The main character is a monkey like girl, that sidesteps and climbs the rigid social structure of the station, and uses clever tricks to get help from other races (including swinging in a bucket near relativistic speeds to be able to parlay with an incredibly slow race), in order to solve the riddle in the messages. Meanwhile this ocurrs there is a power struggle in play in the station, a slow coup in progress created by the station ruler to try and initiate a war.

In the end with the help of a friend the researcher girl has to go into hiding in a compartment in the outer hull of the station to finish decoding the messages, as she understands the correlation between the five messages which before had been worked on separatedly. Finally she decodes the message, and just as the war biding attempt is about to take place, an assembly is called where she reads the decoded message, which defuses the whole situation, and leaves the reader (at least it left me) with a sense of wonder.

I wont say what the message was, in case someone hasn't read it, so I wont spoil the story, it's really good and if someone helps me here I'd suggest if you like sci fi to read it.

Seriously: I love this performer, his mouth made fake echoes, his pathos and sleek lyrics and the cheap/non-cheap production. And of course I adore his song writing.

The tape is rotting, my tape recorder's broken, my digitizing skills are modest - but I need, need, need to know who that artist is. 

My time might not be running out and my patience certainly isn't. But every day my suspicion grows, that in these songs, in this performance a secret is hidden - a secret about how I became what I am. And I'm pretty sure, I want to know, what that secret is. Or at least listen to all of the songs of this performer and see, what other secrets he has to tell me ...

Book one: 
A recently graduated high school girl, during the summer, drives to the lake for a day with her friends, but never shows up and her car is found abandoned on the side of the road. Thus begins a massive search for her, but she's never found. Her boyfriend, friends, and family are devastated, and her younger sister copes with the loss. I think her boyfriend gets with her best friend, but I can't remember. The book deals with the aftermath of her loss. I think the cover has a picture of a lake/ gorge, and the author is male. 

Book two: 
Slightly comedic, this book is about a dysfunctional rich family with three children. The middle child is middle aged but still lives at home. He is the black sheep of the family, and creeps around at odd hours wearing women's clothes. He turns out gay, and becomes a very accomplished artist. The daughter has her own family, but treats her husband very poorly. She's emotionally unstable, as is her mother. It ends on a happy note, with the daughter reconciling her marriage with her husband, and the mother learns to be happier by eating more chocolate. The book is relatively thin and dark red in color. I think. 

Book three: 
This is a very thick book, and took me a while to get through. It's also about the disappearance of a child, but this time he/ she is very young. The characters involved is the mother, who used to date this man, who is very good looking and sensitive, but still lives at home with his parents and without serious job prospects. He is currently dating a prostitute named Angel or something like that. Angel is incredibly introspective and bright, and the father of the missing child happens to be one of her customers. During the subsequent interrogation, she is bullied into sex with the police officers. The child is returned without incident, and I can't remember the circumstance of his/ her return. But the father is rich but on the cusp of financial collapse, and the prostitute girlfriend finds out she has MS by the end.

- There was a dock of some sort.
- The kids were able to make enough cookies later.
- The cookies were put in boxes
- If I remember accurately, the cookies were put onto a conveyer belt in globs of dough before going in the over. They perhaps went straight through fire and came out done
- The dog I remember was purple, however over the years I believe this to be an inaccuracy in my memory and not what the dog actually looked like.

- I believe the kid (Main one, owner of the dog) skateboarded.
- In what I believe to be a separate episode, the pet dog sneaked into another dog's area through a broken fence post. The other dog was angry but was tied to his dog house. He may have been going in to get a ball that went in the yard. I MAY have been a kid and not the dog.

I thought I'd let you know that about 90% of the stuff we're seeing caught in the spam trap is either a tumblr link, or a shortened URL.

These comments (or posts) will not show up until a mod approves it - so if you're replying to someone, time is usually of the essence, and it's probably in your interests to not be caught by the spam trap!

The tumblr thing seems to be a recent change to reddit, and there have been a few posts about it on other subreddits with rumours of infected scripts on certain tumblr pages. Either way, every tumblr link is automatically going in the spam trap, and requires mod intervention to verify it's ok, and approve it. It would obviously be better if alternate links could be posted!

Regarding URL shorteners, and ignoring the usual LMGTFY japery, if you're trying to post a link using reddit's usual markdown, containing unusual characters - brackets () for example, you should try putting a backslash \ immediately before each bracket in the link, that will usually work. 

For example:

    [Some wikipedia thing about AC/DC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC_\(disambiguation\))

which gives you this:

[Some wikipedia thing about AC/DC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC_\(disambiguation\))

Thanks for your help and understanding - and for making this an awesome subreddit to be a part of!

The way I heard it explained, the creators decided to forego a soundtrack and open the movie with a really faint static sound. It was so quiet that the viewers couldn't hear it, but the static gradually increased in volume. It happened so slowly that the viewers didn't notice it until it suddenly stopped. Supposedly, it was a really jarring effect.

Extra points if somebody could find a clip of it. I'd love to see this scene.

I'm remembering more about the description though, so if anybody is still interested, here's what I can tell you:

* The gradual rise and sudden stop is the most important part. I think the description said that it was so jarring that it made the audience's ears pop.
* The bit about the lack of soundtrack might be partially or completely wrong. I'm pretty sure there was no music at least in this part of the movie, but that doesn't mean we can eliminate any move that has a soundtrack.
* Same goes for this scene being at the beginning of the movie.
* This might be a false lead, but it's *possible* that I read about this movie in [this book] (http://www.amazon.com/Reel-Music-Exploring-Years-Film/dp/0393925749).

It would probably take about 3-5 minutes for each image to draw, and then it would sit with the image for a while and then start a new one. There were a lot of scenes and I don't know if I ever saw them all. Some that I remember include various still lifes, an island with little palm trees and a volcano, and a man playing a saxophone. They had a sort of paintlike quality to how they were drawn.

Sometimes I'd stay there late and just sleep there, and would end up watching the screen saver for a long time before actually sleeping. It was probably the most relaxing screen saver I've ever watched. Unfortunately, without a name or anything, I am completely unable to locate it. I've tried Google with various keywords describing it, but it's rather impossible: most Google results for screensavers are tainted with malicious sites, and when I find something legit it's a modern screensaver that isn't even what I meant (for example, something that doesn't draw an image at all but just instantly filters an existing one to look painted).

I really want to find this screensaver.  Unfortunately, my friend and I had a falling-out years ago and he has since moved away, so I can't really go and ask about this. And it's very likely the machine has been tossed out since, so I have very little to go on. Anyone have any thoughts?

ok so it goes like this: the author is visiting a friend and finds a manuscript that he starts reading in the late evening. the manuscript is a diary by a guy who went on to visit his friend in a cottage (or something like that). at some point the friend had to leave for a bit and the narrator of the diary promises to house sit for a couple of days. in the course of this housesitting the narrator starts noticing that he gets sicker and sicker...is loosing weight. and at some point he notices at night in the mirror some creature crawling from the door of his room. he turns around but noone is in the room. but the creature is still in the mirror. and it's wearing a ring on its finger that the owner (narrator's friend) of the house is usually wearing. so he comes to the conclusion that the creature is his friend but it's too late because the creature kills his reflection and then crawls out of the mirror (I think.... ) and then the whole story ends with the guy who started to read the manuscript crawling under bedsheets with his friend's dog because he's scared of the night after reading this diary....

*""The Fun They Had"" by Isaac Asimov (which crops up all over the place so not much help) 
*A story about automatic weapons-building machines that continue to build and send bombs to obliterate neighbouring countries long after all humans are dead and everthing is rubble
*One about a man and a woman who are the last people on earth. They visit each other but because they are unused to company, they don't get on.
*A character who comes across some frozen animals in a forest. He works out that although they don't move, they are being kept alive (their eyes move) as part of some kind of sinister museum collection (think there is some floating orb that collects and paralyses them?) and has to escape before becoming part of it himself.

This sounds like an easy question, but I've been googling and binging for this thing for years..literally.  It plagues me.  So here's what I remember:

The most important clue is that the song was featured in a Virgin Megastore promo cd that I got for free in New York City sometime between 2004 and 2006 (I was in high school).

There are 2 tracks that I'm 100% sure were featured on that very cd.  One was the now very well known ""Don't know why"" by Norah Jones, and the other, ""The End of Nothing"" by Funeral for a Friend.

Funeral for a Friends album, Hours (the album that was being advertised) was released in 2005, so it's possible that this promo cd could have been handed out between '04 and '05.  But since Norah Jones' album released in 2002 and was added to the promo cd 2 years later, since I was still in high school I'd put the range between '04 and '06.

Either the band name, or the song of that band, had the word ""Inc."" in it, preceded by another word.  I do not believe the band is Hate .Inc because I've spent a lot of time on YouTube listening to their songs and it doesn't match the obscure tune that's in my head.

It's not Garage Inc.  everyone knows Metallica.

This song did have kind of a dark sounding yet heavy alternative metal theme (imagine ""So Cold"" by Breaking Benjamin, or the verses in ""Holy Mountains"" by System of a Down).  The verses were a bit slow with some melodic electric guitar and softer drum beats and working up to the chorus got louder riffs (but not hardcore sounding) and I thought for the longest that the last line of the chorus sounded like ...""it's the on-ly thing..that will set you free..""  But after extensive searching, no dice.

I've searched endlessly for ""Virgin Megastore promo CDs"" and any sort of search that would link Norah Jones and Funeral for a Friend to Virgin Megastore and have found nothing.  If there was a database of all of Virgins promo CDs, I'd search there, but alas I have not found one.  I tried amazon and Paypal just to see if someone happened to be selling one with a track listing..nothing.

I'm hoping a Redditor out there may have better resources than I do.  I'm sorry I don't have a humming tape or anything.  To be fair, I've tried it on this one site and just got links to weird Japanese songs.

If I think of anything else, I'll edit accordingly.

Here's a link to ""So Cold"" by breaking Benjamin for a general idea of the overal feel of the song http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rTiGlNDnOtE

And here's a link to ""Holy Mountains"" by SOAD...the sound of the verse feels very familiar to the song I want 
http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X-bNqBjKrQI

Hope I did this right.  I hope there's enough info.  I'm newish to reddit so let me know if there's some weird Internet winner award or whatever for whoever helps.  Thank you.

EDIT: I'm starting to think that I was wrong about Funeral for a Friend being in the same CD.  I've received some interesting links to discographies and can't find any that has Norah Jones and FfaF together, so I may not be on the right track.  I am confident that it was a CD with one or the other though, so I'll continue searching for compilation CDs with Norah OR Funeral, rather than AND.

EDIT:  Solved!  lanegan has found it!  The song is Freakhouse - Liars Inc.  I am so damn happy it's stupid.  I don't know how or where I heard this song before, but I'm happy to have found it again.

**General plot:** 
  
Scientists had developed a drug that can extend a person's life indefinitey, or to around ~200 years (I can't remember) and as because of this, nature seems to have made births very rare to offset the low death rate.  
There's good money to be made in letting couples spend an hour or two with your child if you're lucky enough to have one, to get the experience that they can't have and whatnot. Because of this, there's an illegal drug called the ""Peter Pan Drug"" which will keep them physically a child indefinitely - however it's highly illegal.   
  Also, kidnapping a child is seen as one of the most atrocious crimes one can commit, and a life-long jail sentence is the standard punishment. Which in this case, can be a looooooong time.  
  
The story follows one child learning how stagnant society has become when everyone lives forever, and meeting Peter Pan-children, and how he never wants to end up like that.

Pretty hot girl and her step-brother (or something like that) are living together in some European country.  She's a model, and I dunno what he did but I guess he decided to try smuggling a designer drug over the border for extra cash and got caught.  He's now in jail (maybe he was a cook, cause I remember him cooking stuff in the jail), and one of her model friends tells her about this super secret escort service that she might be able to join.  Turns out the state dept guy who's helping the pretty hot girl (PGH from now on) with her brother/boyfriend/lover is also investigating some murders where pretty girls are being killed in some kinda weird fetish lingerie that inflates (yes, inflates... like a bike inner-tube).

Sooo, PHG gets to start training to be in this secret circle.  Nice apartment, fancy clothes, massages, the usual ""pampered"" story line.  Oh lookie here in the underwear drawer, there's one of those kinky lingerie things that inflate.  Lots of weird stuff ensues, people are getting drugged by PHG with the designer drug via something they put in her tooth (of all things).  State dept. guy starts hallucinating about nuns.  Cheesy stuff.

Then it gets really weird.  Part of the process for getting into this super secret call girl ring is that she has to have all the hair removed from her body... including that special lady place down there.  So they make her soak her lady flower region in ""a green liquid"" and THEN PROCEED TO HAVE CRICKETS EAT ALL OF THE HAIR OFF.

Yes, this was a movie that was played on HBO.  

I think there was a famous guy in there somewhere... not famous, but recognizable (like I've seen him in another movie) and he was the owner of the call girl ring.  So he gets killed, she gets her brother out, and then dumps him for the blind masseuse.  And she's going to buy him new eyes or something with all the money she suddenly got.

This one video I want to watch made me go whaaaaat the fuck. In the beginning its a husband and wife (older, maybe around 50ish) driving in an SUV. The wife is driving and talking on a cell phone while her husband is staring out the window with a worried look on his face. From her side of the conversation, you find out he is some kind of politician and its an election year.  I'm guessing she is also his campaign manager. They are taking care of the accident before they have to head to some dinner party. The husband has flashbacks of him hitting a little girl on a bike. I think he might have been drinking when he hit her. He picked up her body and her bike and threw her in the back, then somehow told his wife. Back to the present, his wife gets off the phone as they drive into some sort of desert graveyard of things people don't want found. She parks, opens the back, and grabs the bike. While she is throwing it in the pile, she tells him to get the girl out of the car. Throughout the video she is constantly berating him, calling him a coward and such. He goes to get the little girl out of the car (she is covered with a tarp) when she starts moving. He gets a horrified look on his face and calls his wife over. She gets annoyed and walks over to so what he wants, when the girl moves a little more. the wife says something like ""oh for gods sake"", takes a shovel from the back of the SUV, and the video ends with her slamming the shovel down onto the girl.

3. At some point he was locked in a closet, or hid in a closet himself. He might have been kept away for a long time.

4. He had carved wooden animals that were somehow tied to the magic. Maybe someone found his animals in the closet later? One of the animals might have been a lion. 

5. The house was covered in ivy on the outside.

I found it in a thread from 4chan, and this recent influx of interest on the Deep Web made me remember it. 

I also recall someone linking to a certain part and somewhere saying that an old hermit lives there that can help you, etc. It was all very mysterious, and judging by the website map someone posted, very, *very* large. Anyone know what I'm talking about? Or what exactly it even is?

Now I don't know whether the websites were all on one domain, but I do recall you could access other website from one website, and so on, but trying to go far would be met with some difficulty. That's where I was reminded of notpron, but the exact specifics of going from one page to another (and the reason to do so) elude me for now. I'm not even sure what the website was supposed to be about, whether it was just a game for people to learn hacking, or a database of hard to get info, but whatever it was, it's supposed to be locked up securely for only but the best of hackers. Also, the place was pretty creepy, to me at least, because it had strange, nonsensical stuff writen on some pages, making it look like bizarre puzzle.

Also, it was not Hackthissite or anything TOR related, because I was able to normally access the pages with my ordinary browser. It might have something TOR related behind it, but it was not readily apparent.

So basically...

One boy cast a spell on himself that allowed whatever he said to come true. He was told off for this because what if he had said ""2=2=5""? Or something to that effect. One kid was being chased and ran to hide, and found that he had turned invisible. 
I think towards the end two girls posed as people collecting for charity - using spells, they gave themselves ""costumes"" - one dressed up in a horse riding outfit, the other girl gave herself a red ball gown.

The protagonist is from a human tribe that wears pendants which display their emotional state. He meets a girl (who doesn't have a pendant, or maybe his got lost, something like that and later they get a replacement that says they're compatible?), they go on adventures, meet and travel with a big humanoid plant based life form, a robot, and eventually find a gateway into a younger universe.

This is basically four TOMT's combined.

All were watched on Comedy Central in the late 90's early 2000's. Three were ""Comedy Central Presents"" and another was a show that I believe was called ""NY Standup"" or something like that. It was like ""CCP"" but took place in a park in NYC.

So the first one. A Comedy Central Presents. The comedian was a average height white guy. He had a series of jokes about getting his first computer and looking up weird things online. The joke started with looking up dinosaurs, then looking at girls, then girls in panties, then girls naked then dinosaurs in panties. 

Second. Another Comedy Central Presents. Tall white guy, leather jacket. His set had a chest high roman pillar he leaned on. He was kind of a whiney sounding and complained about going to the dentist and the dentist's light aggravating his astigmatism. I also think he had a joke about living on a street called ""Tarzan"" or something.

Third. Short white guy. COmedy Central Presents. I think his set was an old fashioned baseball scoreboard. I THINK. He had a joke about him and his friend getting a hooker that turned out to be a dude, and him grabbing the roll cage on his jeep and kicking him/she out of the jeep after she tried to steal their wallets.

Last was the one off comedy special. The set looked like a modern set but it was outdoors. The comedian was a tall muscular white guy who I believe was Canadian. He had a joke about smashing his penis in the hotel toilet seat (o_0).

I know that was a lot but these keep me up at night. I saw these all long ago when I was staying up late when I should have been sleeping and being a good student.

Any of these answers to these mystery comedians would be very helpful. I remember laughing for days while snoozing through math class after watching these guys.

A really good song I heard on a college radio station has been driving me nuts for months. I didn't catch the name or the artist, and it hasn't come on while I've been listening since. Their website doesn't display the day's playlist, so I couldn't check it online when I got home. All I remember by way of lyrics is a few common words that don't turn anything useful up in a google search, so don't bother. I've done everything but call the people at the station to sing it for them. I'm not that desperate yet, although I am going to email them a similar message to see if they can figure it out. I even tried singing it for a music recognition app online, but it didn't work either. If you have heard this phantom song, please help me identify it!

Here are your clues:
1. It was playing on a college radio station (specifically, the Impact 88.9 FM at MSU) which plays mostly alt rock and indy music from the last couple of years. I heard it sometime around early July, I think. If you know the station, I believe it was one of their ""Top 5 at 5"" at the time I heard it.
2. It's an upbeat song with a fairly quick tempo. I can't recall the instrumentation.
3. The vocalist is female and sounds young (20s-30s). I didn't notice an accent so she's likely American. Her range is average to high. Despite the tempo, she sings it in a way that is fairly withdrawn/emotionally unattached. The vocals are sung in a mostly staccato pattern.
4. These are the only snippets of lyrics/melody I can remember, and I'm not even sure how accurate they are, I may have mixed which lines go with which:

""When I lie awake,
D-D-D-A-C----
""you could always care less, you could always care less""
F#-F#-F#-G-E-D---F#-F#-F#-G-E-D---

And then a similar verse that I can only remember the first part of:

""When we are apart,
D-D-D-A-C----
""da da da-da da daaa, da da da-da da daaa""
F#-F#-F#-G-E-D---F#-F#-F#-G-E-D---

Here's me whistling the melody of this part of the song:

I am trying to remember the title of this movie i saw about 5 years ago. My best guess would be that it was made from 1990 or sooner because of the picture/production quality. It was a short movie, maybe 30 minutes tops and the synopsis was something like this...

Widower lives as a lighthouse keeper and is looking back on his life as he nears death. He has several flashbacks to moments that changed him. One flashback is of a couple laughing and holding each other on the beach. He remember this vividly because he was struck by how carefree and in love two people could be. Another flash is from when he was a young newlywed and he was in a grocery store with his wife and newborn child. They go through line and he can't afford the food. A gentleman steps up and pays for their stuff. This sticks out to him because he learned the true meaning of generosity. There are a couple other flashback I think, but I can't remember.

Anyways, upon his death, letters are sent out (from his lawyer maybe?) to the people that changed his life. The carefree couple each get a letter but have since divorced and the daughter of the guy who paid for his groceries gets a letter. They all meet at the lawyer's office and happy endings all around with tearful epiphanies of what is important in life and whatnot.

I hope other people see this which haven't answered on the other two posts. Here it goes:

Link to older thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/c59vj/tomti_cant_remember_the_name_of_this_moviemovie/

Let me explain to you what I know:

The first thing that happens is one man (Caucasian) getting robbed by a few men in a car. The thing that's got robbed is a suitcase he needed very bad. He calls his friend to pick him up. His friend shows up (also Caucasian) and he starts whining about the car his friend stole (it's quite a bad car). They both wear suits (?).

They get a call from the robbers about how to get it back. They start swearing and trace the call back to visit the robbers to try to get the suitcase back. Two other men join them in their quest to get the suitcase back (1 Caucasian and 1 fat African-American). Two of them go around the back with a slight detour (a few stairs and all). The African American man isn't really fit at all and starts breathing heavier (one of the parts I can remember very good). They don't have a hard time getting the suitcase back (4? robbers died in the gunfight).

They got the suitcase back and they go to some jewel store to steal something (?) don't know what the suitcase was needed for.

A few scenes I don't know where they happened in the timeline given above:

One scene is about the two first men going to meet an ex-girlfriend of one of them and he has sex with her. The other man is buying cigarettes and after he is done the other guy is done and they continue their mission.

One scene is in a dry-cleaner store where they (2 men) interrogate one man and shoot him. Also two customers who (unlucky) walked in to get their drycleaning get shot too.

One scene is in a alley where they (2 men) chase a man in a vivid colored training suit (red or blue?) and they manage to get to him and get the information they want. They let him walk away (?)

It is possibly an American movie and it all takes place in one city (don't know which city). It all takes place in a suburb like place. It was good weather (no rain).

One thing that stands out in this movie that the ASL (average shot length) is very high. It almost looks like the movie is filmed with one camera and in one take.

The movie was probably from between 1998 till 2007.

Hope you guys can help me out. Really want to watch this movie again :D

Ofcourse the question-marks explain the parts I'm not sure about!

Epic (in the true sense of the word) prank/mystery puzzle played on guy who eventually figures it out and... Ends up meeting with people who are actors playing characters in this huge mystery puzzle thing. There is this part where he meets a person (an actor in on the 'prank') and goes out into a forest and crazy stuff happens, the guy actually films a lot of it IIRC.  IIRC there is also a bit about some kind of letter box and some location he found on this peninsula and something about a hatchet it all started from some scrapbook-like diary/journal that had weird time travel shit in it.

It all culminates into an absolutely amazing stage show involving time travel and saving the world, all centered around this guy who is solving the puzzles. They lead the 'pranked' onto the stage and have the actors act out a play around him, they even scripted parts for the play in case the 'victim' didn't know what to do.

I've tried searching a bunch of terms like puzzle, mystery, time travel, diary, stage show, in all sorts of combinations but obviously that is too general to get anything. I'm sure someone out there knows what I'm talking about.

Ok, so this is maybe a long shot, or maybe not. Anyhow, for some odd reason I was thinking about old movies today and I remembered this funny show (about 30+ years ago) called ""Dialing for Dollars"". I won't go into the details but essentially they played mostly black and white movies and gave away money during breaks, from time to time.

On Dialing for Dollars they'd play a promo thing when it started up (kinda some quick shot from lots of movies) and during the promo thing they'd show (for like half a second) what looked like hundreds of medieval type guys and horsemen flooding out of what looked like a meteor, or maybe a big fire (again this was black and white and like a half second shot). The picture was specifically of a round fire/ meteor thing in the middle of the screen and guys pouring out of it, at speed, from all sides.  I imagined this to be some sort of time portal or maybe the thing was supposed to be manufacturing the guys coming out of it, but its hard to say with a 1/2 second clip.  This would've been a shot from a movie they played but obviously I never saw it.

Does anyone have any clue what movie this is from and what I'm talking about? I know the clues and a bit obscure but apparently this has been bothering me for 30 plus years (though I doubt I've even thought about it for 20 years - brains are weird).

Eventually the girl's brother is found and he speaks to her with sign language and we find out that she used to have red hair and violet eyes which were a sign of good luck but something happened to her and her hair and eyes changed colour leading people to think she was cursed or something?

At the end of the book, Arthur is born  and Merlin takes him away to raise him and also finds a chest of poisons, tricks and gunpowder from a man to the Far East. This we are led to believe is how Merlin's magical legend grew (from the use of these objects)

It's set in the 80's or 90's. There are two protagonists, a man and a woman, and I think they get romantically involved during the movie. They live in a normal world, but suddenly weird stuff starts happening that foreshadows the coming of the apocalypse. They go together on a search for answers and for a way to stop it. I think they are looking for a diamond, but I'm not sure. They are most definitely looking for something, though. The movie ends with them realizing that their search was in vain and that there is no hope. They are clutching each other and despairing. I think they are about to drown in the last scene, but I'm not certain.

It's a very surreal movie. It's unclear how the apocalypse will happen or how to stop it, but all the while it seems like there are answers to be found, but they are beyond the grasp of mere humans.

It left a strong impression on my young mind and I would like to see it again. Anyone has an idea what it is?

It's Miracle Mile!

I have a feeling it was foreign, because I remember watching it with English subtitles. I'm guessing it was French, but it's just a guess.

If memory serves me, it's about a man that feigns suicide (I think he plunges a knife into his back) to see how the other people in his house will react (I don't recall if they all lived there, if he was having a party, or what). There are maybe five to eight other people in the house, one of which I believe is his daughter. I think the movie takes place in a fairly large house; maybe a mansion.

I think one of the characters sings (what about I'm not sure); if I recall, it was a particularly frou-frou woman.

In the end, the man reveals that he faked suicide to see how the other people would react. However, he does end up actually committing suicide, I think because he was shocked/disgusted by how the people did react.

Sounds like an interesting movie and I'd be happy to see it again.

* It's written in a similar style and reading level to *The Phantom Tollbooth.*

* The basic plot is that the adults in the town are losing their minds. Kids wake up in the morning and their parents are acting very strange, talking nonsense, wearing funny objects, stuff like that.

* In the end it turns out that there is some kind of brain stealing machine up in the mountains that sucks the intelligence out of adults if they are out at night.

* The kids all get sent to the local orphanage. People think the orphanage is great but it's not. They parade the kids out on Sundays, rosy-cheeked and carrying giant lollipops. It turns out they rub the kids' cheeks with sandpaper to make them look rosy and the lollipops are made of glass.

* There is a local diner. One of the patrons is an old man with a very long beard that covers his mouth. In order to eat, he has to order what he wants hours and hours in advance. He pours it into his beard and it takes that long to reach his mouth.

It was a black&amp;white thriller/film noir, with a 40s or early 50s feel. Somehow, I seem to remember the movie is set in London --- but I could be completely wrong about this. I could also be completely wrong about the black &amp; white --- maybe it was a color movie that I just happened to see on a black &amp; white TV. 

The movie features a fancily dressed killer who is never fully shown; his face is always off-camera, or hidden by shades; typically, only his leather gloves, or his shoes are shown.

There are three scenes I distinctly remember. The first one is set in an office building. The killer first removes the 'out of order' sign from an elevator. Then, his unsuspecting victim steps in the elevator, and promptly falls through the elevator floor. He manages to latch onto a steel girder, but then the killer enters the elevator shaft, lights up a cigarette, and proceeds to burn one of the hands of the victim, who is forced to let go of the girder. The killer then puts one of his feet on the other hand of the victim, and pushes down hard, causing the victim to plummet down the shaft.

Another scene has the killer driving a white lorry. His second victim (who is either one of his henchmen or a corrupt cop) gets in the back of the lorry to talk to the killer. They have a conversation via a small grill between the drivers cabin and the back of the lorry. Again, the killer is not shown. They get into an argument, ending with the killer sticking a gun through the grill and emptying it straight into the victims' face.

The finale scene finally shows the killer in full. It is set in some basement, or sewer system, where the heroine of the story is tied up a the bottom of a wide round pool or basin, that is quickly filling up with water. Of course the hero is just in time to save the day.

The movie was about a boy (~16-20 years old), who lives in a mental hospital. He' mentally disordered because of his disturbed relationship to his mother. He can pretty much leave the hospital whenever he wants to (or maybe he sneaks out) and he eventually meets the daughter of his therapist, and starts somewhat of a relationship with her, without her knowing about his illness. When the therapist finds out about it, he of course tries to stop the boy from meeting his daughter.

There are two scenes in particular I remember:  
In the first he is at an outdoor party (maybe with the therapist's daughter, I don't remember her being there or not) and gets flirted with by some girl. He considers her to be slutty and compares her to his mother (who he considers to be slutty as well). The movie then either heavily implies him killing her or actually shows it.  
In the second scene he and the therapist's daughter visit her old house, which is now vacant. She then tells him about her dead mother (and he starts to pity her somewhat?).

I already tried to find the movie via google, but to no avail. Thanks for all help.

- The main character was a white male, I'd say in his 20s-30s.
- Part of the credits scene are happening in his apartment.

There's a part where he struggles to fall asleep because the credits are rolling; he finally falls asleep, and when he wakes up they're still there, which drives him mad.
- He starts throwing stuff at the credits, and while the lines he hits fall down, there's still more coming down.

--------------------------------------


This is what I understand from my mom's description:  It was a sci-fi book where people on a sea ship found themselves trapped undersea in total darkness when their ship sank.  They must have figured out how to have a supply of food and air, but the people were worried about forgetting precious books.  Eventually, they trained themselves to improve their recall and they jointly remembered all of scripture and all works of Shakespeare and much more.

She read it about 40 years ago but says that it wasn't new when she read it.

1293137098.0,45,self.tipofmytongue,eqm0b,[TOMT] *VERY* strange &amp; surreal [movie],54,9,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/eqm0b/tomt_very_strange_surreal_movie/,"I've been looking for a very odd (European?) film, I've trawled through a crap load of Wikipedia entries and found nothing.

All i know is that the movie is probably from Europe (sounded Italian, Spanish or Portuguese or something)
The main protagonist is a young man who seems to find himself in a series of strange situations.

Its not an old movie itself, but set some time in the late 70s, 80s or early 90s (the cars didn't look that old)

I remember it was shown at in or around the same time as Rashomon (1950) on RTE 2 a few years ago if that helps.

Some notable scenes i remember:

* 2 men play a game of Frisbee with circular saw outdoors, and end up inadvertently killing an (annoying?) husband when the main character disrupts their game... the main character is then implicated in the man's death and is interviewed by police.

* The main character is in a phone booth, and calls a captain of a ship, he fires a pistol into the receiver end of the phone, and the guy on the other end of the line gets shot.. 

* A car stops suddenly on a road, and the car behind it does not crash into it, it ""overlaps"" / merges into the car in front - a woman in the car is distressed, while the male driver casually exclaims ""relax, i've got virtual drive"" or something similar ""virtual drive"" was definitely in the subtitles.

* A flashback of the main character's mother's untimely death features her dancing in a quarry or building site, then being hit with a bulldozer or digger. (a narrator explains the details).

* The main character's fat girlfriend, dramatically thins through sheer willpower when the two find themselves being chased and need to squeeze through a narrow gap..

I've seen this movie 6 years ago on TV, forgot the tile, and have been trying to track it down ever since.

Even with those very specific scenes i haven't been able to track down the movie.

I know for definite this was an actual movie and not a dream / hallucination. Help me Reddit!

As we came across the topic of techno music, he started to remember things he did in his younger ages. 

Apparently, in the 80's or 90's, he composed a techno/electronic piece while he was living in Latvia. Many electro pieces, to be exact. He describes most of them having an organ play in the background, but that may not help. There was one piece, however, that he remembered the most. After creating the piece, he sold it to - using his words - ""a famous group from the UK."" 

The ""famous band"" released his track on one of their albums. My uncle told me that it got pretty famous around the UK, and he even heard it playing in America once. He tells me that if it was 2001 right now, he'd be able to tell the exact name of the song. But, after a severe car accident in 2006, he had forgotten most of the details of the track. 

But I won't leave you hanging there. He remembers one thing. 

Apparently, there was a music video along with the track. He remembers that he had to write a story to go along with the track, which would later become the plot of the music video. Through his words, the music video was a lot like this:

""In a mountainous area, there was a man who once lived in a village that always flooded. During a large flodding the man would swim on top of the water with a very long pipe to feel around for his house. 

And when he found the house, he would swim down and go inside the house, regardless of the fact that he was underwater. He would sit on a chair inside his over-flooded house, and just sit there and think - using his pipe as a breathing tube that he would stick out of the water."" 

He described how the man's favorite spot in the world was the flooded house, where he can just think. 

I know this is a HUGELY ambitious thing to ask for, especially because I don't have very many details. But if you remember something like that, tell me. It would serve my uncle very greatly.

Years ago, my family and I were all watching tv in October. While surfing through the channels my Dad stopped on a channel that had a seemingly creepy movie playing.

It featured a middle aged man running around a house during a storm, with the usual scary music and lighting. Meanwhile, the movie keeps cutting to his dead mother, who is upstairs and in bed. I don't know what the premise of the story was, why she was there, etc. But I do know that her corpse was scary as hell.

Later, the body starts to wake up. It sits up in bed in a very unnatural motion. Then starts shambling across the house looking for the frantic man (who I can only assume is the son). The whole scene is corny and cheap but oddly frightening, at least in my memory.

The site then tells both of you only the interests that you both have. So, for example, if I said I want to role play, but my partner didn't, neither of us would be told anything about role playing...that way, my partner would never know that I was into role playing. However, if we both said we were into it, then the site would tell us that and we'd now learn something new about each other.
The idea is that you got to reveal what you were into to the website, without revealing it to your partner. Only if you both were into the same things would your partner find out.

I'm trying to recall the name of a movie I saw when I was young. I remember watching it on TV. I don't know if it was a crappy film on the SciFi or if it was a blockbuster. Anyway, let me describe the details I do remember:

It was set in the future, I think in a small town. Some sort of event happened, maybe a nuclear war, and the future was really bleak. People were deformed, and if I recall correctly, people even had robotic implants. Because everyone was depressed with their lives, it was decided that everyone would get implants in their heads and a signal would be broadcast that made them perceive their lives were great. They wouldn't see the crummy house they lived in. Instead they'd see a beautiful house. They wouldn't see their own deformities, they would see healthy bodies. This went on for generations, and the babies received implants at birth. Eventually the people forgot what their real lives were like. 

That's the setting. Then we meet the main character, who is just an ordinary guy who thinks his life is great. One day, though, he has an accident and head trauma and his implant becomes damaged. He sees flashes of the real world, but he thinks he's just losing his mind. Eventually though, he figures out that what he is seeing is real and the life he is used to living is fake. 

I think he meets a handful of others who have figured it out as well and in the end they decide it's time to shut down the broadcast. I vaguely remember the broadcast was being sent out in a nearby nuclear power plant, but I'm not sure. 

From the look of what I'm remember in my head, I would say the movie came out in the 1980s. 

If any of you might have seen it and can tell me what it was called that would be great! I've been trying to find it for a few days now without any luck.

I'm certain that it's not Think Like A Dinosaur.

Spoilers follow.

Some bored tech or scientist did some math against sensor readings.  They found that two places in the universe or galaxy or whatever range they could read showed mass accumulations.  If you added the accumulations of the two locations together, they equaled exactly the sum of the mass difference from initial transportations.

1) A boyfriend and girlfriend were fighting on I think Valentine's Day or their anniversary. Then one god of love appears to help them through it. Then another one appears and tries to step in. I believe more showed up. Definitely the Aztec god of love showed up. The man kills them and the man and woman fall in love.

2) Ragnarok. That's really it. The Norse Gods were playing a game, I think, and called Loki a cheater. The comic ended with the two human characters on the tree of life.

3) Two characters were lost in a magical forest. They were told to find the great, wise tree. They find it and something happens and the main line I remember is ""...will provide the most tender of meat!"" (as in a sacrifice to the forest, not anything dirty).

I'm offering a reward this time to see if that will help, this has been bugging me for ages and I just want the book already. The reward will be an amazon gift card, unless you prefer something else.

I remember reading a book when I was younger, at least ten years ago, about a haunted house (possibly on a hill). If it helps I live in Winnipeg, MB, Canada, it was most likely read in elementary in grades 4+. I am 25 now, so it was somewhere in that range, I'm fairly certain it was before high school, so somewhere that range, though it could of course be older.

There were a series of short stories about it starting with three inmates who were killed building the house for the warden of a prison (or just building a house). They were chained in the basement, there was a flood in the basement (due to heavy rain I believe), and they died. The house became haunted, and grew more powerful as it took more and more ghosts in. Eventually the people came to destroy the house, and set it on fire, however when they went back to their town they found their town on fire. They turned back to the house and it was fine. 

Various people came to live in the house over a hundred years or so, starting with the warden's family. I remember the warden's child being taken by the ghosts of the inmates, I can't remember if the warden and his wife left or were taken. Eventually the house was abandoned after various people had gone missing in it and kids would come to play and disappear.

I also remember one of the short stories involved a fountain, something was in the fountain that (ghost fish or something) that almost got a boy, around the beginning of the century. He was an old man when the townspeople went to burn down the village and shared his story about the evil of the house. A lot of people had shared their stories in the last story (after someone went missing I believe), but they waited too long and the house had taken too many so it was too strong.

Please!,60,20,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/iscbg/last_time_ill_post_this_need_help_finding_song/,"i've tried posting before but didn't have any luck. Just this Friday  a song was played at my friend's funeral that i really want to find. I believe it was from a reggae rock band much like slightly stoopid, b foundation, the expendables, or something like dispatch.

The beginning of the song started out with just one acoustic guitar and it had this blues-ish sounding intro followed by your regular instrumentals. Towards the end of the song it turned into a more reggae sounding song with upstrokes and what not.

The only lyrics i can remember went something like, ""Everytime i watch the news i get on my knees and pray for just one more day."" I believe the line was part of the chorus.

If anyone out there can help i would greatly appreciate it. I've tried all the b foundation, slightly, expendables, dispatch, michael fanti songs i could find but i still haven't had any luck. I've googled just about everything but i still couldn't find it. Redditors, you are my last hope. Thanks a bunch.

1308061794.0,41,self.tipofmytongue,hzf4z,[TOMT] i've been trying to remember the name of this book for years [book],49,8,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/hzf4z/tomt_ive_been_trying_to_remember_the_name_of_this/,"**EDIT: I found it, thanks to Portlander's ingenuity.  The book is 'The Far Kingdoms' by Allan Cole and Chris Bunch.  Thanks very much to you all!**

It was quite a few years ago that I read it.  The genre was pretty much medieval fantasy, though it wasn’t all that ‘fantastic,’ if you will.  This is absolutely everything I can remember about the plot:

The story starts with the young-ish main character falling in love with some kind of prostitute.  He tries (I can’t remember if he succeeds) to trick her into loving him back via some form of love potion or spell, but he gets caught by her employer (or whoever) and gets in a lot of trouble.  

Later, he joins some kind of expedition (which I believe was affiliated with the military in some way?) and becomes friends with its leader, who is the other main character.  I want to say that this new guy’s name starts with an H.

So they all go on a journey together, and I’m not really sure how all that goes, but eventually they get to where they’re going.  At the end of the book, the main character and the expedition leader dude have a fight, I don’t remember over what.  The main character wins, and stabs the other guy through the chest.  I distinctly remember the guy who got stabbed saying ‘when you take this sword out my soul comes with it,’ or something like that.

Other random details I remember:

At one point, the main character gets married and has a daughter, but I believe both the wife and child die.

At another point, the main character is tortured.  The man who tortures him only has one eye, and there’s something weird about his empty socket.  It either has a worm in there, or some kind of ‘glimmer,’ or… something.  The author talks about the almost intimate relationship that develops between the torturer and the tortured.

The expedition leader has an orgy in his tent.     

Something about a ferret?

The main character has a fight with some evil prince, and the book makes a big deal about how the prince holds his knife in just the right way so that it’s impossible to disarm him.  

Anddddd that’s about it.  I know I’m throwing a lot of random stuff out there, but I figured too much information was better than too little. 

I would be SO excited if I could re-read this book.  If anyone knows which one I’m talking about, I would be super grateful.  

Thanks!
