Had a plank drawbridge over a deep water crossing, with a combination lock on a chain to get to it. once you walked the plank, you came to a long 12"" wide bridge that was a few inches above a little pond. from there there were more planks and walkways to a main dech that was built on trees and stilts also above the water. the high room was built in 3 trees that came from a little island underneath. the whole thing is surrounded by water and the entrance is completely invisible unless you look up to see the padlock and follow the chain. It was completely undetectable from any area because it was in a low lying area, and in one picture you can see the camouflage wall they built in the one place it could be spotted from in the winter. The only reason we found it was because we heard kids hammering and yelling and we followed the sounds. We worked on the treehouse with them and alot of different people would show up there, it was a fun meeting spot for a few years. sadly it's been destroyed.

It was a good 15 minute walk from his house (the edge of the woods) to the fort, which was well hidden on Vandenburg Air Force Base. We were sophomores in high school at the time, and it took us about a year. The main structure was supported by square lashings and eucalyptus logs in between 4 roughly rectangular forming eucalyptus trees. The floors were made of 4 4x8 plywood planks, sometimes cut to fit. The main fort had 3 stories - The ground floor with a fire pit, camping chairs, a folding table and camp stove. The next floor up had a couch, lazy boy, walls, handrails, coffee table, porn collection, shelf with tools, sleeping bags, etc. The top floor (deck) was for hanging out, had rails, mostly sleeping space for guests. Above that we sometimes put up a roof-shaped tarp depending on the weather. There was a rope ladder across to the tower behind the fort. The tower was a large eucalyptus with alternating ladder/spiral staircase steps. There were platforms every 10 to 15 feet up, which went on for about 70 feet.

We had ""fortnights"" with our friends once a month or so - kind of a more responsible high school party/camping adventure. Kids that had never been outdoors got to learn about outdoor cooking, sleeping, etc. without an RV. 

Eventually the Air Force Base caught wind of it, and destroyed it with bulldozers with one day notice. Hearts were broken.

The pictures don't really do justice to its awesomeness, but take my word for it, it's awesome.

This is how my living room normally looks:

* [Angle 1](http://imgur.com/dXO4o)
* [Angle 2](http://imgur.com/2TWUM)

Here we have cleared a space for the floor and turned around the couch and chairs to act as the main supports:

* [Angle 1](http://imgur.com/Lfxo1)
* [Angle 2](http://imgur.com/yYWBd)

Then we dragged my mattress in from my bedroom and made it into the fort's floor, for maximal comfort. Finally, we hung sheets for the roof and strung up rope lights inside:

* [Angle 1](http://imgur.com/9tJdu)
* [Angle 2](http://imgur.com/Pi1ny)

And here is a view from inside. Note the rope lights and the entertainment features:

* [Inside](http://imgur.com/fT7Wv)

That was three days ago. We're still hanging out in the fort, having a grand old time. I'm even in the fort as I type this!

This is a good fort for several reasons:

* Mattress floor. Remember when you built a fort as a kid and you wanted to sleep in it, but your mom wouldn't let you? Well now we pretty much *have* to sleep in it, and it's everything we ever hoped it would be.
* Entertainment. The TV is holding up one side of it and the DVD case is holding up another, so we can watch whatever we want without leaving the fort. Also, free wireless access.
* Rope lights. The interior lighting makes for some seriously nice ambiance. 
* (In)convenient placement. The fort blocks off the kitchen, so you can't *not* go through the fort to get there. That forces everyone to enjoy the fort whether they want to or not (which, of course, they do).

We also have plans to make a few expansions. There's enough space to add a northern wing, which might be used as a mother-in-law suite or perhaps a pantry/observatory. And naturally we will be adding some battle stations, in the event of zombie attacks.",,False,,t5_2raqa,False,,,True,t3_ac9xr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Forts/comments/ac9xr/we_made_a_sweet_fort_in_my_living_room/,

Relatively zombie proof.

* [Ladder down](http://i592.photobucket.com/albums/tt9/SoAwesomeItHurts/Fort%20Camping/IMG_0734.jpg)

* [Note honeycomb support and railings](http://i592.photobucket.com/albums/tt9/SoAwesomeItHurts/Fort%20Camping/IMG_0736.jpg)

* [Height put into scope](http://i592.photobucket.com/albums/tt9/SoAwesomeItHurts/Fort%20Camping/IMG_0739.jpg)

* Edit: Learning to format properly. 

* 20/M. All Uni students. Construction commenced when we were 17. Honeycombing WAS intentional, but as the construction took place in stages, it is not uniform. The most weight we had had up there was about 400 Kilos.
Lots of fun to stay up the entire night and drink brewskis/ cook steak on a portable propane BBQ. The trees surrounding were pruned of all lower branches so the only way to get in other than climb the ladder is to climb up a tree like climbing up a fire pole.

* Edit 2: More Pictures and info

*And to answer CasualDave, these are the only other pictures we have. The fort is in [Canada](http://i592.photobucket.com/albums/tt9/SoAwesomeItHurts/Fort%20Camping/IMG_0743.jpg) in the middle of nowhere and we are currently backpacking in Australia, so I hope these do the trick. The first platform took about sixty hours.  Construction was spread out due to difficulties acquiring lumber. Finished product was fairly close to what we imagined but we had to make due with the trees in our location. Further plans are always up for debate but nothing has been decided.
Also, anyone wanna give me pointers on the formatting? This is really annoying with the bulletpoint.",,False,,t5_2raqa,True,,,True,t3_abn41,http://www.reddit.com/r/Forts/comments/abn41/check_out_our_awesome_fort/,

It was a beautiful winter day, and me and a buddy of mine were bored out of our minds, stuck on an empty base in the middle of nowhere.

Looking out the window, we saw that the week's copious snowfall had been deposited in fairly large piles around a field. We were instantly in agreement that this was an obvious chance to build a most fantastic snow fort.


We sprang into action, naming our new military operation Operation Arctic Endeavour somewhere along the way. Shovels were procured and we enthusiastically told a few of our fellow soldiers, who also happened to be idle, our plan. We would create a mighty frozen bastion capable of withstanding any assault at any temperature so long as it was below zero.
Unfortunately, our grand plans fell on deaf ears, as mass effect had just been released, and we had a 50"" plasma in our barracks, so yeah...

Not ones to lose heart, the two of us lept into the snow outside, and enthusiastically carved out what was to be named Fort Invincible.


Alas we were having way too much fun building the thing and taunting those passing by (except for those driving armored vehicles) for their obvious inability to assail our mighty stronghold. Therefore we didn't take a lot of pictures. Snow, being all white, is also a little difficult to get good pictures of, but these at least give you an idea of how it looked:



**tl;dr:** a buddy of mine and I were bored, so we built a sweet snow fort, hope you like :)

* [View 2](http://i.imgur.com/tgYC4l.jpg)
* [The making of FI](http://i.imgur.com/2uvXol.jpg)

I suppose I'd give the fort a ZPR of around 2 (1-10) by itself, but considering it's location in a military base, it's probably rather safer.

I am thinking that one of the beds would need to be perpendicular in the event of a successful climbout attempt but I am in need of your expert suggestions.  I am very handy and have built some furniture.  I have all of the tools you could imagine to pull this off.  I have thought about many options for a theme as in get all paper mache up in there with a volcano or tree or something.  Anything goes as I do not care about anything except piercing the hardwood floors.  Other than that, the only rule is that the build and cleanup has to be complete in 5 days.  I love this community and I cannot wait for your responses.

Heres a shot of it:

[Shot From Below](http://imgur.com/FO4ty.jpg)


My uncle's a linesman so he just climbed the tree like you would a hydro pole, drilled a few holes and bolted two 4x4's in each direction. Then two more 4x4's on the end and we covered it with planks and added some handrails made from the sides of our old pool.

We use a tv tower to get into it...its quite the climb, although its hard to tell from this picture. 

I may have some more pictures if anyones interested gotta dig around a bit.

Edit: Found some more pictures, they show the height a little better I think ;) and they're much better quality then the first one.

it started small, with just two sheets, but once i started constructing it, i couldn't stop. it also helped that we had a ridiculous amount of sheets and blankets laying around. like the winchester mystery house, i just kept adding and adding until pretty much 80% of the dining room was my fort. 

i think the final material count was something like 5 chairs, 4 sheets, 4 blankets, 1 pillow case (for the ""door""), 1 dining room table and a handful of pushpins. 

i mostly just lounged around in there. drank a few beers, browsed the intertubes a bit and just relaxed.

i had more pictures but a few months ago, i deleted most of them from my phone, figuring i would never need 4-5 pictures of a blanket fort that i had built. clearly, i was wrong.

I decided to make this wall of beer for my room.

I have had zero experience with power tools. I'm an EE, so I didn't expect this to come out as good as it did.

The only tools I used were a circular saw, measuring tape, leveler, marker, screw gun, and a jigsaw here and there.

I also put in some shelving and sliding doors. One of the doors came out a lot narrower than expected, hence making it a ""fat filter"". I also just kept going with it and made a drop-down desk and sliding closet doors as well.

Welcome, to the first (and hopefully not last), ""/r/forts ""Fort-a-thon!"" Took me a bit longer to get around to this than I thought it would, but we're finally here! 

It's time to nut up, or shut up. Show each other who's best at building forts. And, uh, stuff like that. Let's just get into it, shall we?

Okay, so we're going to have two categories to build for: *Indoor*, and *Outdoor*. Indoor is your classic furniture/blanket forts. Outdoor is your treehouse type forts. Seems simple enough to me.


**Rules:**

* Must be new to /r/forts. No reusing old forts for this contest.

* Must be an original fort, and to prove this I'm asking that in one of your pictures, you have a ""Hey reddit!"" or something in there somewhere to prove that you didn't just rip off someone from google. I guess this helps solve the the previous problem too.

* One entry per person, per category. You can enter in both categories, but only one entry for each.

* Contest starts whenever I post this, and will end 2 weeks later. So, July 14th at 11:59 PM, Eastern Standard Time.

* After that, There will be a week for voting. So, July 21st, 11:59 PM, EST. I'll make a topic with all of the submissions, and people will be able to vote for which ones they like. I'll only count the upvotes, so don't be a dick because it won't work. Whoever has the most is the winner. Everybody else is losers. If there's a tie, I'm flipping a coin.




**To enter the contest:**

Post a comment in one of the two contest entry threads ([indoor](http://www.reddit.com/r/Forts/comments/ckso1/rforts_fortathon_indoor_fort_entry_thread/), [outdoor](http://www.reddit.com/r/Forts/comments/cksoh/rforts_fortathon_outdoor_fort_entry_thread/)) with all of the pictures and whatever that you want as your entry. You can edit it all you want, but after Midnight on the last day, your submission is final. Also, feel free to submit your fort as a link if you want the karma or whatever. You won't be disqualified if you do that. 

**Prizes:**

TBD (if, for whatever reason, you want to donate prizes, hit me up. I'm kind of broke, and it would be greatly appreciated)

Alright, so get out there and start forting!

Story: We built this fort in ceramics when it was nearing the end of the year last year. We were supposed to be finishing our final projects but...eh.

So as we sat in the fort of cardboarditude, our art teacher walked into the room. He is stunned at what had unfolded in front of him. We stared at him through the window of our fort. We could see the fear in his eyes. He finally summoned enough courage to asked us what we were doing in a fort instead of working on our class projects. he obviously underestimated the amount of awesomeness our fort radiated. It weakened him, he began to sweat vigorously. Again he mumbled what were we doing with a fort. We responded ""Well...making art.""  He attempted to scold us, explaining us how we needed to stop wasting time and get to work on our final projects. We pulled our cardboard blast shield to close the fort off completely. Our art teacher continued to scold us but his words could not penetrate the glory of our fort. we remained in our fort for the remainder of class, basking in our glory.

**TL;DR: We built a glorious fort, our teacher got mad. Zero fucks given.**

Originally, I had nifty [postcard cube](http://imgur.com/PfiY8.jpg ""I don't travel much.. most of them were gifts/trades"") above my bed, but they started getting damp/warped and I didn't wanna ruin them so I had to take 'em down. But I needed to replace it with something of equal or greater coolness, hence the fort! 

To make the blankets hang from the ceiling, I bought three handles from a hardware store, tied the corners of the blanket around them, and tacked/duct taped the handles up. The duct tape kept falling, though, so eventually I replaced it with velcro, which worked much better.

I'd never slept so well as when I had my fort- it was so dark! Sadly I had to take it down after I moved out of the dorm, and I'm not going to have a bunk bed next year so I won't be able to rebuild it. :( I suppose I could settle for a non-aerial fort though. 

BTW, just found this subreddit. Keep being awesome! :D",,False,,t5_2raqa,True,,,True,t3_cdfeg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Forts/comments/cdfeg/bunk_bed_fort/,

Blue fleece blanket on the bottom is the main entrance, since the other one is a little bit unstable.

http://imgur.com/DXUEh    This is the corridor to the main room of the fort, rotate it in your mind or else it will make ZERO sense. Same blue blanket entrance from the previous photo, for reference.

http://imgur.com/FHnyJ    This is the leftmost part of the fort, basically just a side entrance and a couch. There is, of course, a roof on top of the side entrance (between couch and coffee table) but I forgot to photograph that.

http://imgur.com/66VBR    This is the main room of the fort, there's a bookcase that holds the two roofblankets, which are weighed down by a pillow. I did my homework in here and felt AWESOME

http://imgur.com/L15ya    Larger view of the right side of the fort. I'd like to note, the whole thing took up half of the room and blocked the back door to outside.

http://imgur.com/e82fy    Another large view, this contains both entrances, both couches, and the main room. It only misses the bonus addon part.

Yes it's a lot of blue. My mom chose the blankets and wall colors and I guess she likes blue? For those interested: It took about 20-30 minutes to make and consists of 2 large blankets, 6 small blankets, 2 snuggies, 1 bedsheet, 3 pillows, 1 two-pound weight, 2 couches, and 1 reclining chair.

We brought a hammer and a saw from home, and spare nails from the nearby construction site. We got on friendly terms with the construction workers and they let us take their spare wood to use on our fort. Its roof was a network of PVC pipes tied along trees, the roof made of sheets of plywood. The walls were also plywood, and any holes were covered in tarp. Despite its uncoordinated roots, it was a pretty damn nice place if I do say so myself. This was our little hangout, it was our pride and joy. We made countless campfires and had stick fights a plenty. One day, someone in our school had tipped us off that the fort had been destroyed. Later that day, we visited our little fort to find that the worst had happened. The entire thing was destroyed. Ropes cut, nails pulled out, everything had crumbled to the ground. It was almost like a little heartbreak. On the flip-side, however, not all hope was lost. This fort was secret, no one but our group knew about it. Therefore, we knew the kid who'd given us the tip had to be the culprit. He was close friends with this huge pothead who lived near the fort, too. Considering they had spray-painted ""420 :)"" on the downed roof of the fort, they were our guys. Now that we know who did it, we still don't know what to do as revenge, or whether avenging action should even be taken. They tried building a little box behind our fort, but we took that down easy. So, I ask you /r/forts, what should we do? (Other than rebuilding, of course)

For those curious, my fort looked nearly identical to [this](http://i.imgur.com/aP304.jpg), aside from the fact that mine had PVC pipes instead of logs, and walls.

The ladder was just 2x4s nailed to the tree trunks. The trees would sway like crazy if there was any wind at all and the ladder at the mid point was on a part of the tree that bowed out so you were basically climbing a tilted back ladder. So in summary, a swaying fort built far up from old creaky timber with a bad ladder. It was scary as all get out. He never understood why we didn't use it :).  I think I'll stick to blanket forts.
