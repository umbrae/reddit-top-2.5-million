[Lightning Reaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=180617)

Lightning reaver is something I play in my Adun Oakenheart EDH deck on mtgo. Every time I have got in into play (4-5 times) it has really wrecked the other 2-3 players. The haste makes up for such a high mana cost for a 3/3 and the fear also is very useful. The damage is does is pretty insane after two or three turns and it works quite well with multiple attack steps through cards like [seize the day](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=30573). 

In multiplayer EDH it definitely seems a ton more powerful, due to the charge counters hitting each player, so I would not recommend in 1v1.

1376692089.0,82,self.EDH,1kim09,Why You Should Care About Lands!,94,12,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1kim09/why_you_should_care_about_lands/,"When visiting this subreddit or r/magictcg the most common topic is, ""Can someone look at my deck and tell me why it isn't working/anyone have some ideas for my deck to make it run better?"". Either when i am streaming deck techs on Wednesdays or looking through deck submissions here the first thing i look at are the **Lands**. 

Consistency is one of the hardest thing to attain in an EDH deck. Whether its a teneb, the harvester reanimation build or a Odric soldier aggro build you cannot determine how your deck plays out each game, and that’s ok. Half the fun of EDH is running into new situations because you are playing cards the deckbuilding guidelines force you to. Ever try out an  [Endless Horizons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=157975) in that odric deck or a [Vulturous Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=247391) in that Teneb deck? New situations are great!

Except for land screw. No one, and i mean no one likes Mana screw. It creates unfun situations where a deck that was slaved over for 2 hours+ doesn't even the play the game it sat down for. This is why i care about lands. Without a good land base a deck will run like a 68' Chevy that hasn't had an oil change for the last 15,000 miles; clunky, slow, and filled with regrets. 

It's rather simple to avoid, just play more lands! The most dangerous mind set to have while building a deck is the ""Well..... I could cut a land and play this sylvan primordial, it gets me lands so it counts for a land spot... Right?"" [NOOOOOO!](http://cdn3.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1192101/SCARY-MARINE.gif) You need lands to play the spells in your deck, for every [Paradise Mantle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370448) and [Lotus Petal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=194975) you play instead of a land you are strangling your deck's ability to compete! A one-shot jump in mana for a single turn does not equal the consistency of a land for every turn. Being able to cast a five drop before your opponent can cast a four drop is not worth a card in EDH. Let's say you live the dream and you drop a [Mirrari's Wake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=338455) before you opponents can cast their  [Master of the Wild Hunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=191064) , [Ogre Battledriver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370662), and [Explosive Vegetation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=247345) . How much do you really benefit? Was that Lotus petal really worth the cost of a card in your deck when the other opponents can just overwhelm any modicum of a lead that has been created? A land drop will be better than a card like Lotus petal in almost every single situation, besides maybe storm, and even in storm i'd rather play an island.

If you are just starting into EDH and find that the mana bases are overwhelming here are some basic guidelines. **Start at 39 lands**. It may seem like much but being able to play your cards is always more fun than watching your friends play the game. For every two mana rocks you add into your deck, whether it be a Golgari signet, mind stone or sol ring, It is ok to take out a single land. But never drop below 36 lands, even the edric deck shouldn’t drop below 36 lands and that thing plays 4 different types of llanowar elves.

Also, don’t overburden a deck with to many non-basics that don’t tap for colored mana. Adding an expensive suite of your favorite foil non-basics can make your deck look nice, But what do you do when you open up a hand of [Miren the moaning well]( http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=88807) , [Haunted Fengraf]( http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=245289) , and [Kessig Wolfrun]( http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=233256) ? You lose, that’s what. You need colored sources to cast you spells, so please play your basics, it’ll do the deck good.

Overall, I made this post to remind the newer players as well as the experienced players to please look at their land slots. The best way to tune a deck into a well-oiled piece of American muscle is to reexamine the land base first, and then proceed to specific cards. Although the spoiler on the car is really flashy, the engine is what does all the work.

I'm an avid TCG player- started with Harry Potter and Yu-Gi-Oh, now I love Star Wars, Naruto, Lord of the Rings, and of course, the mother of all TCGs, Magic!

What brings me here to your screen is an appeal for assistance- I know just what my playstyle is, but I don't know where it exists in Magic, specifically in EDH.

My favorite way to play is theme/flavor-centric- my all time favorite deck is a Yu-Gi-Oh Dark Magician deck- for those unfamiliar, basically it's a pretty standard creature, but with a lot of card-specific tricks, cheats, and tricks- it's usually considered quite bad, unless you structure around it entirely (which I do).

My current two EDH decks are Rhys the Redeemed (pretty standard stuff) and Gisela, Blade of Goldnight. Now- Gisela's deck is pretty fine-tuned- focusing around rushing her and comboing off- but her mana cost is so high that by the time I am able to bring her to bear, faster decks are already controlling the game... 

While my colors are maybe red and white, it's more important to me to find a card that has real thematic support cards- something like my good ol' Dark Magician, haha.

TL;DR- I like playing Dark Magician decks in Yu-Gi-Oh, and want to find an EDH commander that would function with similar mechanics!

Have any suggestions? Throw 'em my way!
Thanks mates!

Unfortunately, the answer is that Black has trouble dealing with artifacts/enchantments, Green can't really remove creatures, and Red can't deal with enchantments.

I keep referring people to the same handful of cards, so I figured I would make a list for the subreddit. Here's a list of those elusive types of removal players are looking for. I ordered it *roughly* in order of best to worst, and only included single cards that were removal. I didn't include combos like Shatter + Mycosynth Lattice, which does give red an additional form of enchantment removal. You should look for those combos on your own and find which work best for your deck!

My goal is to make a playable deck that fits this (somewhat satirical) America theme. The deck wants to force opponents to attack while making attacking me either impossible or very undesirable. And President Ruhan will smack the opposing players (foreign countries) at random. If you have a suggestion that fits the theme and goal of the deck, let me know. Also, the mana base is (very) rough around the edges. Tuning that up will come once I am satisfied with the rest of the list. 

Very much a work in progress, but I wanted to share it with you guys to see if anyone has ideas for better support cards or suggestions to replace members of my cabinet. Cabinet members must be legendary, of course.

I just finished a game on MTGO where my friend playing Lazav, Dimir Mastermind had copied a Platinum Emperion, and the other player left had Akroma, Angel of Wrath and had been attacking me for the last couple turns. 

All I had in play was my commander Melek, Izzet Paragon , Caged Sun, and a Gilded Lotus with some lands.

I had no outs in hand, so I cast Foresee and put Reforge the Soul on top of my deck and passed the turn.

My friend was convinced he wouldn't have any problems beating the Akroma player once I was gone so not only did he not help, he attacked me with the Lazav/Emperion too!  I was left at 5 life and having taken 18 commander damage from Akroma and 8 from Lazav.  

My friend sends me a message saying "" Sorry /u/PyronicEX ""

I draw the Reforge the Soul and dump my hand.  Drew Call to Mind Brainstorm Mana Geyser Spell Crumple and 3 lands.

Cast the Brainstorm and drew Epic Experiment and Elixir of Immortality and Shattering Spree.  Put the Experiment on top, and then the Mana Geyser.

I Played the Geyser off the top of my library twice for 18R, then the Experiment twice for X=18.

I said back to my friend, 'I might be sorrier.'  and overloaded Cyclonic Rift to get rid of the Lazav/Emperion

I hit Mind's Desire in the 2nd Experiment and Grapeshot / Temporal Fissure / Ignite Memories.

1373254726.0,38,self.EDH,1hubnp,[META] On improving the quality of /r/EDH.,52,14,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1hubnp/meta_on_improving_the_quality_of_redh/,"Ladies and gentlement of /r/EDH, I would like a moment of your time to discuss the quality of both posts and comments on this subreddit.  This probably will not be a short post, but please bear with me.

A little about myself, I've been playing Magic seriously for about a year now and have been interested in EDH as a format since I first heard of it as a concept.  I have finally convinced my playgroup to switch to EDH as opposed to Standard formats and we haven't looked back since.  I credit this subreddit and the sidebar resources with massively expanding both my card pool and general game knowledge. Thus, I feel compelled to try and improve the quality of this subreddit so that future generations of EDH players can use this subreddit to share ideas with other like-minded people.  So, without further ado, I'd like to discuss some of the issues I have noticed with this sub.

**1. What exactly is /r/EDH *for*?**

At first glance, it is hard to tell.  Glancing across our post history shows some general card discussions, lots of decklist advice, a few alters, and tales of EDH shenanigans.  One could say that that this place is for all things EDH, a concept I support, but what exactly do we offer as a community that somewhere like mtgsalvation doesn't offer?  We do not have lists of community created/reviewed primers, we do not have well organized and defined areas of discussion, we almost never acknowledge 1v1 EDH and we have zero posting guidelines beyond ""basic reddiquette"".  This brings me to another negative facet of this subreddit...

**2. Our lack of posting guidelines and any level of standards is limiting the potential of this subreddit.**

All too often while browsing this subreddit I notice posts like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1hsucx/my_thraximundar_deck_needs_fixing/) or [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1hpy2q/looking_for_input_on_my_first_edh_deck/) or one of the hourly ""help me with my Kaalia deck"" posts.  The problem with these posts is that they provide little to no information about what their local meta looks like, what they hope to accomplish with their deck (is it themed, do they like combos, etc.) and what their budget is for additional cards.  This severely hampers anyone wishing to provide constructive criticism.  Some kind souls are willing to comment anyways to get the relevant information from the OP, but that really shouldn't be the case in a subreddit that discusses decklists as often as we do.

A quick fix to this problem would be to add and *enforce* some posting rules/guidelines in the sidebar that ban non-self posts to deckhosting websites like Tappedout.net in order to encourage the relevant information to be added in the initial post itself.  While this would ideally improve the quality of the posts on this sub, this is not the only part of the threads that needs some help because...

**3. The comments can be just as low quality as some of the self posts.**

Comments that just say ""look at the sidebar"" do not contribute anything to the discussion that this subreddit is supposed to host.  People come here looking for ideas from a friendly community and it saddens me that some of us feel we have nothing more to offer than links to a completely different EDH forum.  In an ideal world we would have our own series of regularly updated primers submitted by members of our own community for general use and perusal.  Some members in the past have expressed interest in writing primers of their own to submit and I feel many more share that interest.  We should be able to provide that as a community dedicated to EDH.

I have also noticed a significant amount of hostility directed towards a series of deck archetypes like dedicated Combo, Stax, Control, and Land Destruction.  The popular opinion is that running cards like Memnarch or Armageddon will lose you friends or be justification for some level of physical violence against your person for running those cards/combos.  In a format that stresses playing what you find most fun above all else I ask you why do we have people discouraging the archetypes listed above or ""hateful"" cards?  Everybody has different definitions of fun and nobody's can be considered superior.  Just because you don't like fast combos doesn't mean there aren't people who DO like them and you shouldn't discourage their use because of your own issues with the archetype.  I personally am a Stax player who plays cards that other people may not enjoy.  That being said, I thoroughly despise watching people ramping into turn 4 Ulamog in monogreen or cards like Possibility Storm.  However, I do not discourage their use simply because I do not enjoy the same things other people enjoy.  I hope as a community we can keep that concept close to heart as we move on in the future.



**In Conclusion...**

Despite the negative things I've noticed within this subreddit I truly do love this subreddit and its community.  There are a lot of great people out there willing to coach an EDH noob through his first deck and provide some real and interesting feedback on a deck concept.  To those people I say thank you, and I ask those same people to join me in helping make this subreddit even better.  I think that with some help from our Moderators and the general community we can work to start creating and hosting our own original primers and increase the quality and breadth of our threads. 

We have a fantastic opportunity here to make this subreddit a haven for EDH enthusiasts worldwide, all dedicated to producing current and quality content and discussion for the community to enjoy.  For those of you who have made it all the way through my rant: I thoroughly appreciate your time and I hope that we can come together to help improve /r/EDH as a whole.  Thank you for reading.

TL;DR: [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1hubnp/meta_on_improving_the_quality_of_redh/)

Edit 1:  I would love to hear from the moderators on some of the issues I've raised here, I think the rest of the community would benefit from their input as well.

Edit 2:  This has been great guys, the amount of discussion going on is fantastic.  Already I have noticed new posts with more in-depth information with plenty of well thought out comments below them.  I think this is a great start.  The general feeling I'm getting is that an updated sidebar with posting guidelines would be the best thing to add to help newer members direct their posts.  A little more moderator activity on the sub would also be beneficial I believe, as I rarely see modposts of any kind.",,False,,t5_2scee,1373315892.0,,GWS,True,t3_1hubnp,http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1hubnp/meta_on_improving_the_quality_of_redh/,

Thanks to ClayCRUSH for the idea.

In this weekly thread, we will be discussing a given legendary creature.  I got Karn, Silver Golem through random.org, but subsequent weeks will be chosen by popular majority.  At the bottom of your post, add in a vote for the next legendary creature we should feature and I'll tally them up next week.  Now that that's out of the way, go nuts.

**EDIT:** Since it appears my voting idea has failed due to huge commander pool and lack of foresight, We will instead be voting on one of 10 randomly chosen commanders.  These commanders are:

**EDIT2:** To clarify: I used random.org to find a number between 1 and 492 (the number of legendary creatures) and looked up that creature.  If I considered that card boring, I skipped it.  Cards I find boring are cards that are either [completely vanilla](http://magiccards.info/lg/en/261.html), have [very mediocre effects](http://magiccards.info/lg/en/278.html), or are (in my opinion) [pointless to build around](http://magiccards.info/lg/en/280.html).

**EDIT3:** skipped cards in case someone actually wants to vote for them:

* Boris Devilboon
* Commander Eesha
* Frankie Peanuts
* Huang Zhong, Shu General
* Jacques le Vert
* Lu Bu, Master-at-Arms
* Morinfen
* The Lady of the Mountain

Are you ever late game needing a board wipe, and you draw a mana?  One of the worst feelings in the world when you have to scoop and you look at your next card and low and behold your next card was a Day of Judgment.

Cycling lands prevent dead draws late game at the small cost of coming into play tapped if need to use them as mana.

Thopter Assembly is an expensive card, but by the next turn, it does put 10 power and toughness on the board, spread out over a lot of creatures.

It also has a CMC of 6, and it searchable by [Treasure Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=213753).

1376162499.0,30,self.EDH,1k3q0u,The moral dilemma of Deadeye Navigator,43,13,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1k3q0u/the_moral_dilemma_of_deadeye_navigator/,"Preface: The game store I play at holds weekly EDH events for store credit. You pay $5 to enter, and get one point per person you kill, one point if you win the table if at a 3 person table, and one point per game just for sitting down at the table and playing to the end. We play three rounds a night, which means you will get at least three points, with the possibility of as much as 12 points in a night. Each point is $1 in store credit. We also hold occasional events with FTV boxes and other prizes.



Dilemma: A vast majority of the games end with a resolved Defense of the heart or entwined tooth and nail, almost always for deadeye/sylvan primordial or deadeye/craterhoof. It's also common to see such things bound to deadeye as Venser, which while not enabling a same turn win, completely shuts down the game. Our local meta has since become an arms race, with a ton of UGx and mono black combo decks, all racing to hit their ""I win"" cards first. I am not immune here; I play maelstrom wanderer and have won games in such fashion.



Why do I care, then? Because I hate winning games that way. It sucks, it's boring, it's the same shit every single time I sit down to play. It's not fun anymore. There is no incentive to play a fair deck, as there is significant financial benefit to playing combo or deadeye.



Several of us in the group have petitioned to have deadeye banned from EDH in the store, but to no avail. At this point, we figure that the only way to get him out is to adopt the strategy and show how abusable he is, but this stifles creativity, fun, and is harmful to the growth of the group.



What would you guys do in this situation? Take the moral high road, while,knowing that you're losing money every week and will likely never win a big prize, or play the degenerate decks/combos and be part of the problem, but also have a chance to be successful?

The following will be my personal analysis of cards in my Karador, Ghost Chieftain deck.  This post will contain all cards that rotate in and out of my deck on a regular basis and as such I will not provide a decklist but instead talk about each card in the deck.

---
Artifacts:

Blasting Station - This card is a must have in Karador in my opinion.  You do not want your cards exiled and it gives both a good sacrifice outlet AND a combo piece(if that is your style).  It provides insane value with other cards in deck(Skullclamp, Blood Artist, etc) as well.

Chromatic Lantern - This is a personal choice of mana rock, it is vulnerable to many destruction effects and it takes your second or third turn over, but the bonus to fixing AND ramping in this mana hungry and colour hungry deck can be well worth it.

Crucible of Worlds - This is a card that rotates in and out of my deck a lot based on whether the meta has LD or not.  I try not to abuse the wasteland/strip mine interaction but if a player is asking to be striped of their lands, then I will bring justice towards them.  Would not really recommend unless you have fetch lands, I personally only run the 3 on colour fetch lands.

Mimic Vat - Usually a must have in almost any graveyard based deck to eek out value.  No exception here and not much to discuss, personally I do not use it in my meta because it gets destroyed instantly and draws too much hate.

Sensei's Diving Top - Very underwhelming in Karador compared to many other decks, but helps greatly with filtering draws.  Again, not much to discuss, it is a staple.

Skullclamp - Insane value in a toolbox/utility Karador build.  Equip to a Qasali Pridemage before you blow up someones artifact and you get to draw 2 cards.  Dont need the land from Sakura-Tribe Elder? Draw two cards.  Absolutely necessary in Karador IMO. 

Sol Ring - Zzzz staple, etc.  Might replace but it really is too good not to have.

Witchbane Orb - I ran this before I had a leyline, it is severely inferior because there is much more artifact destruction than enchanment destruction.

---

Creatures:

Acidic Slime - Trades up, great ETB, value creature.

Angel of Despair - There arent too many traditional reanimation fatties that you normally see in a strictly reanimation type deck.  But angel makes the cut easily.  Vindicate with wings, and a good beater when you have stabilized.

Dawntreader Elk - Ramp on a creature that sacrifices itself.  I run this because of skullclamp, you get both the ramp and the card draw unlike tribe elder.

Deathrite Shaman - My meta runs a lot of flashback, fetches, and graveyard based shenanigans.  This card is a perfect answer to ALMOST anything to due with a graveyard.

Dryad Arbor - Land on a creature, or creature on a land.  Both helps cast Karador in both the graveyard and on the field.

Duplicant - Pesky indestructible cards getting in your way?  Well then I have an answer for that.  This is a staple and not much more needs to be said.

Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite - Norn allows small utility creatures to become beaters worthy of taking down opponents in a quick manner.  And she is a great late game reanimation target, or just casting her works too.

Eternal Witness - Clampable, regrowth on legs.  Insane value, the card.

Harmonic Sliver - A great card to deal with anything bothering you, works great with Necrotic Sliver too and it is clampable after its ETB has done its work.

Harvester of Souls - A lot of the creatures in my deck are able to sacrifice themselves for the greater good.  Feeding your draws and allowing you to reach a critical mass where you cant be stopped.

Karmic Guide - Kills itself after its done its work so you can use it again.  Getting back a fatty or a utility creature, combo with Reveillark, etc.

Kitchen Finks - Some might think the life gain is irrelevant, but it adds up over time when you cast it, throw it at someone with blasting station, throw it again, cast it, throw it again, etc.  Combos with Melira/Mikaeus.

Melira, Sylvok Outcast - Im not going to lie, this is really only here for comboing purposes.  It is usually not in the deck, but when the meta is cut-throat she goes right in.

Mikaeus, the Unhallowed - You know all those creatures that sacrifice themselves for your benefit?  Why not do it twice!?  Not only is he an anthem, but undying is great for almost anything in the deck.

Necrotic Sliver - Vindicate that is a creature with a sacrifice built in, its like it was made for this deck.  Increased value with Harmonic Sliver is not to be taken lightly as it happens a lot.

Qasali Pridemage - Remember what we said about creatures that have utility an are their own sac outlet?  This guy is great, clampable while still being able to use his ability is huge, and he helps some other creature battle if it couldnt normally get in there.

Reveillark - VALUE TOWN, THE CARD.  This card is absolutely insane when you have a million small creatures to target with it.  Combos with Karmic Guide too AND brings another friend along on its journey.

Ronom Unicorn - Personal sac outlet?  Check.  Utility?  Check.  A GOD DAMN UNICORN? CHECK CHECK CHECK.  Other cards similar include Kami of Ancient Law and Keening Apparition.

Sakura-Tribe Elder - Rampant growth on a creature that sacrifices itself.  Helps you get to Karador 2x and if you draw late game he suddenly disappears and becomes two new cards when his skull is burrowed through.

Shriekmaw - In a meta of mostly green decks, this almost always has a target.  It is usually an unblockable creature that kills another and can beat into planeswalkers with ease as well as being evoke-able from the graveyard with karador.

Solemn Simulacrum - Ramp on a creature that provides value when he dies, the only thing missing is a personal sac outlet, but we can forgive that.

Soul of the Harvest - Similar to Harvest of Souls, this allows you to draw an insane amount of cards.  Being a 6/6 trampler is nice too.

Sun Titan - Notice all the &lt;4 cmc cards listed?  Ya, he works great with those.

Sylvan Primordial - Huge blocker, utility creature, ramp spell, all in one.  Whats not to love.  I still miss you prime time :'(.

Sylvok Replica - The body is extremely underwhelming for 3 mana, but being able to do a great impersonation of pridemage is acceptable.

Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre - One of the major finisher in the deck, also allows you to save your graveyard using Survival and save you from being milled to death.  Oh, and hes a vindicate,  a 10/10 beater, and he is indestructible.

Viridian Zealot - Again, not that impressive on its own, but being able to fill your graveyard while getting value is worth it.

Wispmare - Not usually in deck anymore actually, just worth a mention if your meta has a ton of enchantments.

Yosei, the Morning Star - Yosei lock is in the deck for when it is needed, but he is usually used as a 5/5 ""unblockable"" beater.

Kokusho - the Evening Star - Kokusho's life drain is great in a 3+ player game.  Being able to do it every turn is great too.

Blood Artist/Falkenrath Noble - Of the two, I prefer the artist as the deck is mana hungry enough as is.  Do NOT underestimate how much the life drain adds up over time with all your creatures that you are sacrificing to further your plans. 

Butcher of Malakir - You are going to have your creatures die. A lot.  Why not make it so no one else can have creatures too?  He costs a ton, but is definitely worth the price.

Crypt Ghast - Personally I do not use, but a decent card none-the-less. The deck is very colour hungry and he only really works with Urborg, but I could see someone using this.  Extort is great too.

Restoration Angel - Some thing this card is bad in EDH, I completely disagree.  There are a ton of abusable ETB effects in the deck, and only one other angel.  You should be able to get good use of this card even if it is just for saving a creature from spot removal.

Scavenging Ooze - So, its late in the game, and you want to cast your living death?  But what do you do about other players creatures in their graveyards as you have no doubt killed a lot of them, well, here is the answer.  Also, again, great against graveyard strategies and the life gain adds up over time.

Bone Shredder - Terror on a self sacrifing stick, great card like shriekmaw.

Vampire Hexmage - There is no dark depths combo here(mostly because I do not have one) but even without it this card stays in my deck because repeatedly killing planeswalkers for 2 mana is great value.  As well as killing creatures with out of control counters or even other permanents.

Massacre Wurm - Can cause huge pains for your opponents, especially if you can cast this twice on one turn, wiping their boards and doming them.

Spore Frog - This card, I can not believe how good this card is.  The only thing it really doesnt stop is eldrazi, and they arent really common enough to worry about.  Another alternative to this is Kami of False Hope, but the deck generally only needs one of these type of effects.

Yavimaya Granger - Ramp on a 2/2 self sacrificing creature, great value.

Yavimaya Dryad - Ramp on a creature, great value.  Green is easily the most played colour in EDH as well so it can turn into an unblockable 2/1, which might not be great but it gives it some value after it has finished its ramping.  The target player clause I find especially useful as I HATE to play against opponents who are manascrewed, helping them on their way with one of my own forests is great and allows for fun, interactive games.

Wood Elves - Clampable ramp, chump blocker, etc.  Being able to grab any forest like dryad helps a ton in mana fixing.

Farhaven Elf - See Wood Elves, except you cant grab any forest.

Fertilid - In the same vein as Dryad, this helps games be interesting and fun or helps you ramp while getting a creature into the graveyard.

Spike Weaver - Whats better than one fog?  How about three!?

Krosan Tusker - Mana fixing and creature put into graveyard as well as a card drawn?  Sign me up.

Diligent Farmhand - Similar to Dawntreader Elk, and able to be thrown away to draw two cards later.

Fleshbag Marauder - Using this while Butcher is on the field is almost cheating.  Just casting this every turn can deal with a ton of things that you normally couldnt.

Dauntless Escort - Sure, you want your creatures into your graveyard, but what if you want to keep them around a little longer?  Allows you to block anything and even kill larger creatures while keeping your guys around.

Riftsweeper - Great card for late game when you need a card that SOMEHOW got exiled.

Angel of Serenity - This card is at its best when you can flicker it, it has been out of my deck for the longest time as I simply do not find it useful enough.

Hermit Druid - This card is great, and I have not tried playing it since I increased the count of basics in the deck, but personally I think it overextends the graveyard too much unless you have 16+ basics.  Also I killed myself with this once on accident because I miscounted, so fuck him.

Jarad, Golgari Lich Lord - Not really all that useful when your average creature is only 3 or so power, you want to be throwing big guys at your opponent.  This really is not the deck for that.

Nezumi Graverobber - The problem with this card is that it is incredibly mana hungry.  Your deck just to operate normally is hungry for mana too.  I also found that too many times was there far too many cards in a graveyard to eat when I could do it much better with ooze.

---

Enchantments:

Animate Dead - Cheap reanimation, and can target opponents creatures.

Aura Shards - MVP of the millenium.  This card does so much work against every single deck I have seen.  Most people try to get rid of this ASAP, but it usually does its work.

Mirari's Wake - As I said earlier, the deck is insanely mana hungry.  Being able to pump your dudes as well as giving an extra mana is easily worth the spot.

Survival of the Fittest - Personally, I have been moving away from tutors as I find them to lead to boring games.  But this is one that I will make exception to as it allows me to do so much.  Someone bogs you? Well shit, just activate it twice to put Ulamog in graveyard and then bog hits nothing.  You have to rebuild your graveyard but at least you dont lose the cards.

Sylvan Library - Card draw when needed or filtering, standard fare.

Leyline of Sanctity - Sometimes you would like to overextend your graveyard, this allows you to do so with some protection.  Keep in mind that this does not stop Rest in Peace.

---

Instants:

Chord of Calling - A tutor, but it puts the card on the field at instant speed.  I try not to run too many tutors, so this sometimes gets cut.

Grisly Salvage - This card actually reads draw 2-3 cards, at instant speed for 2 mana.

Krosan Grip - Only here because pesky blue mages dont like me blowing up their Omniscience.  This'll teach 'em.

Path to Exile - Spot removal, downside is pretty negligible late game.

Ready//Willing - You want your creatures dying when you say so, as well as being a huge life swing late game or surprise blockers that kill anything.

Swords to Plowshares - Spot removal, has no downside(serious, no downside).

---

Lands:

Gaea's Cradle - Expensive, sure, but my deck is definitely not meant for a budget.  Having a ton of small creatures helps beef this up and you have a ton of ways to make use of the mana.

Bojuka Bog - Standard fare in black EDH decks.

High Market - Life gain over time adds up, sac outlet to boot.

Maze of Ith - I have been increasingly dissapointed with this card as of late, but it helps against voltron decks before they get their hexproof/shroud online and keeps large beaters at bay.

Strip Mine - Pesky land, go away.

Wasteland - Pesky land, go away.

Vesuva - Kill pesky legendary lands, or copies a command tower.

Urborg - Does not do much here other than occasionally help fix mana, worth a slot most of the time unless your meta runs a lot of nonbasic hate.

---

Planeswalkers:

Vraska - I mostly keep her in because I have a foil, that is really about it.  I have actually won more than a few games with the ultimate after clearing the way with fleshbag marauder.

Garruk Wildspeaker - Not in the deck most of the time anymore, did not do enough to warrant a spot.

For my cake day, I'd like to share with you a story from my recent play that I really enjoy (karma be damned!). Sorry for the long self-post, feel free to move along =)

## We used to be good

My friends and I play EDH almost exclusively now. A few of us used to play competitively, played a few SCG opens, never made any money. Local tournaments, we're nice big fish in these tiny little ponds and can usually walk out with some prize.

We've sort of taken to EDH the same way. ""Let's build an awesome deck!"" Iona's a thing at our table, as are Vorinclex, some nasty Zedruu combos, Olivia as a commander, and some of my scarier decks. 

We play with newer players who don't have huge collections to draw from, so we allow full proxies if you want (because printing out Forests never felt so good). It lends to a strange group, and it ends up with the 2 or 3 of us ""good"" players beating the hell out of each other while everyone else cleans up the pieces or dies. It's lead to me focusing on jokey decks, that are silly and have no win condition.

## Then Peter had a fantastic idea

We drafted for my friend's birthday ([lordmanimani](http://www.reddit.com/u/lordmanimani), he's a cool dude), and planned on playing EDH after. Before we got to drafting up some cards, I noticed my friend Peter brought his giant collection and had been rummaging through it, but didn't think much of it.

When we sat down for EDH, Peter dropped an unsleeved monstrosity. Niv-Mizzet (old) at the helm. I audibly sighed and stared bleakly at him.

""Really, kid? Really? We complained about Mayael, so clearly _Niv_ is an improvement? I don't follow.""

""Just wait!"" he assured with a devious smile that betrayed the jank within.

## He pulled 99 cards from a box that were the right colors

The shittiest rares. Ever seen Murder of Crows in EDH? I have now. Augury Owl? Oh yes. [This fucker](http://magiccards.info/ala/en/48.html) wiped our board as I was trying out a token deck. Then he handed the Sea Monster [a sword](http://magiccards.info/m12/en/222.html) (not one you might think) and wiped us again. Then he unearthed the bastard.

We played a 5+ hour game. He literally decked himself, a few turns after knocking me out (the bastard).

## Responding in kind

I thought a lot about that game over the next week or so. Peter had a great idea:  why the hell am I spending money on decks when I bet I could build something stupid and janky without mail-ordering a thing.

So I did. I had a Jor Kadeen laying around, threw 12 mana ramps and some shitty equipment in, then filled slots with random cards.

These cards (or most of them, at least) should be in every deck they can fit into.  Now, without further ado, the best cards in the format:

**White**

* *Land Tax*, because never missing a land drop and simultaneous deckthinning tend to win games.
* *Restoration Angel*, because ETB creatures are ever so common.
* *Reveillark*, because recursion on a creature that can later be recurred is crazy.
* *Karmic Guide*, because ^
* *Sun Titan*, because permanent recursion on a creature is extremely rare.
* *Swords to Plowshares/Path to Exile*, because 1-cost exile at instant speed.
* *Replenish*, because enchantments deserve recursion too.
* *Planar Cleansing*, because boardwipe is so strong.
* *Austere Command*, because sometimes you want to keep some of your permanents.
* *Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite*, because a passive +4/+4 difference between yours and your opponent's creatures tends to win games and stave off defeats.

**Blue**

* *Body Double*, because blue needs creature recursion too.
* *Rhystic Study*, because either you get card advantage or they waste one mana for each spell.
* *Jin-Gitaxias, Core Augur*, because forcing opponents to discard their entire hand each turn is devastating.
* *Time Warp*, because going again usually means you win.
* *Phyrexian Metamorph/Clone/Phantasmal Image*, because ETB creatures are so powerful and because they can kill shrouded commanders.
* *Crystal Shard*, because ETB creatures are really, really powerful.
* *Rite of Replication*, because ETB creatures are really that powerful.
* *Bribery*, Depends slightly on your playgroup, but odds are you'll hit something worthwhile.
* *Hinder/Spell Crumple*, because tucking away commanders can end games immediately.
* *Deadeye Navigator*, because, yes, ETB creatures are *that* powerful.
* *Consecrated Sphinx*, because if this doesn't get answered within one or two turns, you're soon swimming in card advantage.
* *Gilded Drake*, because stealing any creature for 1U is too good.
* *Jace the Mind Sculptor*, because he's his own toolbox full of useful abilities.

**Black**

* *Necropotence*, because drawing up to 7 every end step is very worth it.
* *Demonic Tutor/Vampiric Tutor*, because tutors enable combo decks and these don't give opponents any knowledge of the cards you tutor for.
* *Graveborn Muse*, because zombies are plentiful in black and because pain-draw is almost always worth it.
* *Yawgmoth's Will*, this card gets exponentially more powerful the better the rest of your deck is and has been known to quickly change the tide of games.
* *Sheoldred, Whispering One*, because both recursion and forcing opponents to sacrifice creatures makes for one annoying card.
* *Damnation/Decree of Pain/Plague Wind*, black's boardwipe suite is, in some ways, better than what white has to offer.
* *Beacon of Unrest*, reusable creature recursion from any graveyard is very worth 3BB.
* *Grave Pact*, this card makes non-boardwipe removal significantly less appealing while also giving certain decks a method of wiping opponents' boards.
* *Reanimate/Animate Dead*, extremely cheap reanimate spells can decide games as early as turn 1.
* *Buried Alive/Entomb*, In some ways, these cards are more effective tutors than either demonic or vampiric tutor.
* *Mikaeus the Unhallowed*, because saving all of your non-human creatures from death once and enabling certain infinite combos make this card a staple in human-light decks.

**Red**

* *Chaos Warp*, because it's one of the cheapest ""tuck"" effects available. 
* *Comet Storm*, excellent outlet for infinite mana (if you swing that way) or just excellent method of removing a lot of creatures.
* *Magmatic Force*, because a lightning bolt at each player's upkeep tends to add up pretty quickly.
* *Blasphemous Act*, because it's often the most cost-effective boardwipe spell available to red.
* *Wheel of Fortune*, because forcing opponents to discard their entire hand while also refilling your hand is almost too powerful for only three mana.
* *Wild Ricochet*, because your opponents sometimes cast spells that you'd like to steal.
* *Kiki-Jiki*, because ETB creatures are kinda good.
* *Insurrection*, often ends games in one fell swoop.  On the rare occasion that it doesn't, it will likely put at least one opponent out.
* *Zealous Conscripts*, because steal effects on an ETB creature can snag victories from the jaws of defeat.
* *Sneak Attack*, the Crown Jewel in red because ETB creatures are so plentiful.

**Green**

* *Primeval Titan*, ETB ramp that also poses a significant threat if it goes unanswered.
* *Seedborn Muse*, untapping during your opponents' untap steps keeps you ready for just about everything.
* *Tooth and Nail*, the big daddy of tutor effects.
* *Sylvan Library*, because deciding what card you draw and/or drawing extra cards is good on a sorcery.  this is an enchantment.  in green.
* *Eternal Witness*, one of the most versatile recursion effects slapped onto a cheap ETB creature.
* *Oracle of Mul Daya*, because passive ramp that also saves you from topdecking land is irreplaceable.
* *Green Sun's Zenith*, because tutor.  Also because everyone loves it.
* *Krosan Grip*, being able to destroy any artifact or enchantment you like without worry is incredibly effective.
* *Terastodon*, because answering three different threats with a single ETB creature is almost unmatchable.
* *Beast Within*, because answering literally anything for 3 mana is extremely cost-efficient.
* *Survival of the Fittest*, repeatable creature tutor that works excellently with recursion. 

**Colorless**

* *Sensei's Divining Top*, fixing your draws and getting you an additional card when you really need it make this one of the best utility cards in all of EDH.
* *Mimic Vat*, because stealing just-killed creatures and playing them for yourself in a format full of ETB creatures results in some downright insane boardstates.
* *Nim Deathmantle*, because being able to save a creature from death for 4 an unlimited number of times is very often worth it.
* *Gilded Lotus*, because EDH is a format full of big things and this helps non-green decks stay in the game.
* *Sol Ring*, because ^, but also allows decks to race past others.
* *Skullclamp*, because creatures die a lot.
* *Lightning Greaves*, because shroud and haste are two excellent abilities.
* *Spawning Pit/Phyrexian Altar/Ashnod's Altar*, because free sacrifice outlets are surprisingly few and far-between.
* *Crucible of Worlds*, because some lands get hated on.  Also allows for hitting every land drop when used with a sac-land.
* *Oblivion Stone*, because Planar Cleansing should be in every deck!
* *Erratic Portal*, because Crystal Shard should be in every deck!
* *Cloudstone Curio*, a drastically underrated artifact that lets a player abuse ETB effects.
* *Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre/Kozilek, Butcher of Truth*, gigantic creatures that also shuffle your graveyard into your deck.  What's not to love?
* *Sword of Feast and Famine*, now, all of the swords are useful (Body and Mind less than the others), but Feast and Famine tends to create a huge lead if it lands even once.
* *Quicksilver Amulet*, because it can dodge counterspells if you really need something to hit the battlefield.

**Multicolored**

* *Mirari's Wake*, because doubling your mana while also acting as a Glorius Anthem is too good to pass up.
* *Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker*, because he's Nicol Bolas.  
* *Bant Charm*, lots of relevant effects piled onto one 3-cost instant.
* *Maelstrom Nexus*, because it turns the first spell you cast on each turn into a 2-for-1.
* *Maelstrom Archangel*, because casting stuff for free is always nice.
* *Maelstrom Walker*, because a 3-for-1 card that hits 90% of the EDH playable cards and also lets them attack the turn they land is pretty much amazing.
* *Violent Ultimatum*, If you're running Jund colors, this is the only card that could possibly be run instead of Terastodon.
* *Cruel Ultimatum*, because if it resolves, you're in a *great* spot.
* *Eladamri's Call*, because it's the cheapest creature tutor outside of black.

**Land**

* *Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth*, converting all land to swamps both enables swampwalk and allows any land to tap for mana (including things like sac-lands)
* *Cabal Coffers*, when used in conjunction with Urborg creates a plethora of mana for very little cost.
* *Academy Ruins*, because artifacts deserve recursion too.
* *Reliquary Tower*, because having a maximum hand size gets old.
* *Alchemist's Refuge*, because casting things at instant speed makes for some unbelievable plays.
* *Kor Haven*, because deciding not to take damage from a creature is well worth three mana.
* *Homeward Path*, because stealing creatures is such a popular mechanic.
* *Gaea's Cradle*, this card needs no explanation.

Did I miss anything?

A lot of people seem to agree that playing the obvious combo generals - Niv-Mizzet the Firemind, Sharuum, Azami, Riku, etc., means you're gonna be the first one everyone targets. However, I've gotten a very mixed reaction to some of my Commanders, none of whom can do the things most playgroups universally hate. Some people complain about Merieke Ri Berit, and many other groups don't even know who she is and discount me until I come out swinging. A lot of people groan when they see Rafiq or Talrand, but they still don't get the kind of hate Azami or Arcum do. 

Personally, I try to only hate on the obviously game-warping Commanders in a few different categories of ""make the game not fun for anyone"". 

Combo generals get my ire, especially the obvious, popular ones. I will attack and disrupt Azami, Arcum, Sharuum, Niv the Firemind, etc, because I know that if I don't interact with the player, they'll find a way to win non-interactively. 

The really easy-win Voltron generals, mostly the Hexproof ones like Sigarda and Uril, seem to also be hated on pretty widely and I try to run answers to them in all of my decks, though a lot of people groan when they see Rafiq too. 

I hear a lot of people groaning over Tax and Punisher generals like Grand Arbiter and Kaervek (or Gaddock Teeg, since he turns off a lot of creature-light decks).

I've found that any general that tutors can get messy very fast - Sisay, Arcum, Malaren, Momir Vig, etc. I learned the hard way to try and win against these players or else they'll eventually end up with a silver bullet for everything. 

Other than those four categories, which I try to avoid choosing for any of my own decks, I see a lot of mixed reactions. I don't see a consistent reaction to commanders that are just very good or efficient - Merieke, Animar, Hanna, Dromar, Wrexial, Edric, Jenara, etc. I've never been hated on while playing any of those generals, but I've heard other people on the internets say that they get hated out for playing generals like those.

**The Complete Critique**

The most 'helpful' way for me to critique a deck is to divide the deck into categories and comment on essentially a card by card basis: giving opinions on the cards I don't like as much, saying which cards I would add, general deck strats, etc.  Now, the issue here is that I'm essentially just building my own deck around someone else's shell.  Sure, it may be a fairly good deck, but it's essentially mine now, not the person who originally submitted it.  

In most cases I will just skip over the cards that I agree with, or if I'm actually talking with someone about their deck I'll just put them in a pile and say that I agree with them.  The big downside is that the worse someone's deck is-at least the worse I think it is- the more time it takes me to go through it, and the less likely I am to help the person that actually needs the help.

So this includes:

* Summary of the deck in question
* Cards to take out
* Cards to put in
* Interactions between cards that are being put in
* Questions I have for the maker of the deck

**The Minor Critique**

I'll use this if I don't have much time. I'll also use this if the deck already has a review and I want to write a few other things that aren't already brought up.  This includes:

* A few cards I really think don't fit
* A few cards that I think are staples that aren't included
* Questions I have for the maker of the deck

**The Not-Very-Helpful Critique**

Sadly this is the one I usually see.  The main reason there are these critiques is because the OP just isn't helpful.  Here is what you will get if you submit a decklist with something like ""I just made this deck and haven't played it yet, what do you think.""  Also ""This is my first EDH deck, what do you think?""  So this is what is written:

* CARDNAME, CARDNAME, and CARDNAME are good in these colors, you should run them because they're good.  
* Wait, you didn't include your decklist.

**What to write if you want useful help**

In general it's helpful if you've already played your deck before submitting it, that way you actually have something to write about.  Things that make me much more likely to write my thoughts.

* What you think is the general strategy of the deck.
* Maybe decks that you're having issues against.
* Writing a little on the local Meta never hurts.
* Specific questions.  
* If you have a budget for changes.  
* How a usual run of the deck goes. (e.g. First I play Azusa on turn 3, drop as many lands as possible, ramping as much as possible, then playing fatties.) - /u/mpaw975

Everything was fine until someone played a spell that made everyone discard their hand which ended up triggering Lazav's ability about 15 times.  

As the person playing Lazav I must say that his ability is extremely awkward due to the limitations of the online client.  When you have multiple FX on the stack it does not tell you which effect corresponds to which creature in a graveyard so you have to literally go through each one to see which creature you could shapeshift in to.  This isnt too big of a problem when you are playing 1v1 but when you have 3 other people it is a huge problem.

Secondly...the first time this happened all of my opponents got annoyed at having all of these effects explode on their screen, as well as the time it took me to go through them all (thanks again MTGO client).  They all voiced their annoyance in chat and then they all proceeded to gang up on me and kill me off...not due to any threats that I had but simply because they were all annoyed by Lazav's FX.

Personally, I think well made and tasteful EDH decks carefully select 100 cards (less basic lands and the like) which all work towards a goal.  Singletons automatically reduce the overall consistency of a deck because you can't rely as heavily on drawing one specific card at any given time.  Because of this, a lot of decks run a huge suite of tutors to find specific combo pieces more often.

Now, I think tutors add something good to EDH.  Tutoring is the most direct counterplay to effects like Hinder, Spell Crumple, Spin Into Myth, Hallowed Burial, and other spells which tuck important permanents (and your general) into your library.  The counterplay they provide is healthy.  Even using a tutor to find a specific card to help you go off is okay.  What I think is excessive, though, is a deck with 10+ ways to search for unique cards in the deck and cobble together a fragile combo which ignores the rest of your deck entirely.  EDH, to me, should be about finding the best 100 cards you can get together for a certain strategy, not assembling a 3 card combo and packing your deck with filler tutors which only make your deck more consistent.

A lot of people really hate Momir Vig as a general.  Likewise, I personally find Captain Sisay distasteful because I know that every single Captain Sisay deck is just going to be more or less the same toolbox of legends.  I love EDH because of its wild variation.  Games are never quite the same because I see different parts of my decks every time I play them (except for the tutor heavy ones).

Deadeye, though, is a ridiculous value machine. It (and Sphinx) require instant-speed removal, but it's very tricky timing. You have to kill it in response to the soulbond trigger, and that's not something people are used to. 

Deadeye gets around Unearth. It turns two mana into 5 life and a 3/3 with Thragtusk. It's 1U: Exile a creature with Duplicant. It's mega-land removal with Sylvan Primoridial.

1375913201.0,20,self.EDH,1jwx0w,"[Guide/Discussion] Partial Paris Mulligan - A Guide for People New to EDH, Guaranteed to Improve Your Experience (Older players, make sure you try this at least a few times to feel the power, if you don't already)",29,9,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1jwx0w/guidediscussion_partial_paris_mulligan_a_guide/,"**tl;dr** - Only keep ramp and lands. Dump everything else.

**WTF is ""Partial Paris""? I Ain't playin' no French Rules!**

""Mulligan"" refers to dumping your hand and grabbing 1 less card, hoping for a better hand to lead into a better game. EDH, being geared towards longer games, requires a slightly better hand on average to have fun, hence [Partial Paris](http://mtgcommander.net/rules.php). Basically, you draw your hand, drop as many cards as you want, then pick up that many cards from your deck. In the event that you want to do this again, then drop as many cards on the table again, then draw ONE LESS than you put down. So if you only want to keep 2/7, drop 5 cards, then draw 5 cards. If you want to keep 3/7 of those cards, drop 4 and draw 3. If you only want to keep 3/6 of those cards, drop 3 and draw 2. I wouldn't go below 5 cards in hand.

**The Method**

Keep all [ramp](http://wiki.mtgsalvation.com/article/List_of_Magic_slang#Ramp) and lands, as long as the ramp can be used on time and the lands won't cause missed land drops or discarding cards (bounce land turn 2).

**Why? I want to play stuff!**

Do I need to point out the obvious? You can't play stuff until you have the mana for it, and you won't have the mana for it any time soon if you keep 3 lands and 4 amazing cards. Missing land drops almost always means a completely wasted turn within the first 8-10 turns of a game. In EDH, the curve (average mana cost) is high and the life starts at 40. Attacking with that 2/2 turn 3 may get you a board state in draft, but it doesn't mean shit against the HP-bag sitting across from you in EDH. The only creatures I play before turn 5 are creatures that ramp, draw me cards, or are just using up mana I can't spend on anything else.

**You have to be ruthless with your mulligans.**

You've got 3 lands, a consecrated sphinx, and three other cards. Do you drop the three cards, keep the sphinx (because it's so tasty!!!) , and draw 3? NO! FUCK YOU! Drop the damn sphinx! Lets calm down and think about this. Drawing three cards ain't that bad, right? You'll probably get a land or two on average. That'll put you at 4ish lands. By turn 5 you've had 4 draw phases, of which you need to have drawn 2 lands/ramp to get to 6 to play the sphinx on time. Not likely, but lets say you do. You play the sphinx on turn 6 after having 3+2 (cards you drew from mulling 3 + draw phases - land draws) that are most likely too expensive or not really that important. Congrats, you're drawing lots of cards, and get hated out first. And lets not forget how unlikely this situation is that you didn't just cripple yourself by keeping that sphinx. Keeping the sphinx can be argued (with three lands at start), but at the end of the day, magic is about betting on the winning horse, and putting effort into making sure the most likely win will happen (Unless you're a Johnny).

Lets look at some math for why aggressively mulligan is the way to go. The goal is to keep as many ramp/lands as possible, and SEE as many cards as we can (to increase the chance of having ramp/lands).

**Situation**: Start with 2 lands, 1 ramp, and 4 other cards, one of which you REALLY like, and is amazing for you deck.

Decision 1: Keep the bomb.

Decision 2: Dump that shit.

**Decision 1**: drop 3, draw 3 (get one land), drop 2 draw 1 (none). Total cards seen: 7+3+1=11.

**Decision 2**: drop 4, draw 4 (get one land(more likely)), drop 3 draw 2 (none), drop 2 draw 1 (land). Total cards seen: 7+4+2+1=14.

Whether you get a land/ramp or not is obviously going to be random, but it's about a 33% chance in most decks, and keeping that bomb just cost you looking at THREE CARDS in this (fairly common) case. That's three cards that could have been a sol ring, wood elves, chromatic lantern. Obviously if you saw something you liked in the 2nd to last mull, you wouldn't do the last one, but the point stands.

What you should get away from all of that is, we know you love the cards in your deck. We know they're so so good with your general and you foiled out that JTMS and then rubbed it all over your tummy. It'll still be in there after you mull it away, shuffle up, and play. It's still in there! I promise. And what's better, it'll come when you have a nice little blanket of mana to wrap around his little face so he can be all comfortable with some friends before he gets out there on the battlefield and mauls the shit out of that prick that put a Blightsteel in his deck. Do it for Jace. It's for his own good. World Peace.

**""This doesn't apply to me! I play controlly wizard man-powers deck!""**

Not true, I don't care what you're playing. Maybe in an ultra-competitive 1v1 where you're used to winning/losing pre-turn 5, but you're doing something wrong if you're playing a deck like that. You're playing the wrong format! Not trying to be mean, but Vintage/Legacy/Modern/Standard are WAY more fun for competitive 1v1s. If you know better, and defy this rule (only keeping ramp and mana), that's because you've tried this method, experimented, and found a card you can actually keep over the possibility of another land or ramp.

**""But I don't have any green in my deck! KREENNNKOOOOO \*Django Theme\*""**

A wise EDH player at my LGS once said that if your deck doesn't have green or isn't heavy on artifacts, you'd better have a good fucking reason. If you're playing Grixis (Blue, Black, Red) and expect to have fun, you're going to want to play your shit on time, and sticking lands in your deck isn't going to be enough. You're going to need that Lantern, lots of rocks, and expect to be using those 20 dollar tutors to get more damn land. The only thing worse than not having what you need in your hand, is having what you need in your hand, but not in your mana pool.

If you keep any cards that you cannot play given the lands/ramp that you already have (this includes ramp), count the number of draw phases you have to get what you want, and decide whether it's reasonable to keep and hope for what you want. If you have 5 lands and a 6-drop, you have 6 draw phases to get 1 land. Pretty reasonable. If you have 3 lands and a 6-drop, you have 6 draw phases to get 3 lands. Much more difficult. Apply this thought process for each time you're deciding what to drop from your hand.

Ex) You have 4 lands, Boundless Realms (7-drop amazing ramp card), and two other cards that you're not keeping. Do you keep the boundless realms? It's a great card, and it's ramp! Lets think about this. If you draw no other ramp, then it's going to be turn 7 that you want to drop Boundless Realms. This means that you had 7 draw phases to get 3 lands (if you ramp at all, you have less draw phases than that). 3/7 is right on the line between smart and risky. That's a tough call. If you start with only 2 lands and a Boundless Realms, you definitely want to drop that Boundless Realms in the first Mull, due to how many more cards you'll be able to look at and decide to keep, if you just Mull that one extra card.

**Exceptions I've found to this rule:**

* Demonic Tutor / cheap CMC tutors - because it could always turn itself into a land

* Phyrexian arena - if you have the lands to play it already -- better chance to not miss a land drop

* Liliana of the Dark Realms (if you have the lands to play her already in hand)

* Garruk Wildspeaker - he actually is ramp, make sure you have the double-green

* Oracle of Mul Daya - same as Garruk, not traditional ramp.

The main thing to think about for the exceptions is that you need the mana ALREADY in your hand or they need to be dropped. If I have a demonic Tutor, but no swamp, I usually drop it in favor of seeing more cards. It really depends on how many black sources are in my deck. If I'm playing mono-black, I'll keep it, of course.

**All of that being said...**

Keep in mind that MTG is a game of risks and rules. Start with a set of rules in your mind about how you think the game should be played, and then modify them as you see fit based on your experience. Mulling is the first decision made in any game of MTG. I urge newer players to try to set this as their mulling rule and then experiment with it, always keeping in mind the changes you make and the effects it had on a game, good or bad. Without reflecting back on how your ideologies were different and what outcomes they caused, you cannot improve.

Take the example of an idea I often use while drafting, ""When conflicted between picking two cards, take the creature."" Rules can take a long long time to test in order to be confident in them. After a game where I played the creature I picked instead of the enchantment, I think about what would have happened if I had picked the enchantment instead, and had drawn the enchantment right when I had drawn the creature. Would there have been a difference? Is that difference caused by a niche situation, or is it objectively much more common in this set to be facing this situation (lots of creature removal, for instance), and the general rule of ""creature first"" isn't a good rule to have? Always challenge your rules, or your game won't evolve. Which, even in EDH, to me, is one of the most fun parts of this game. Whether you consider a hand of 5 lands to be better or worse than 4 lands and 3 unplayables, make sure you challenge that opinion by trying both sides.

I hope this method can improve some people's fun. I know it has for almost everyone in my playgroup that we've gotten into EDH. I said a lot of controversial things up there so feel free to flame me below and we can teach each other a little more about the game we love. I'd also be open to answering questions about specific hands and what I would mull. Really, the biggest thing is knowing your deck. Being able to say, ""there are twenty cards that I would want more than this one at the beginning of the game"" is a very valuable thought to have. Comparing a Swords To Plowshares to a Plains is tough without an entire deck worth of context, not to mention, knowledge of your opponent.",,False,,t5_2scee,False,,US,True,t3_1jwx0w,http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1jwx0w/guidediscussion_partial_paris_mulligan_a_guide/,

We share a card pool, so whenever I ask for certain things, he'll tell me ""Oh it's in the Karador deck"", meaning I can't use it.

I envy him a lot. I really wish I could find a deck I love so much I keep working on and fine tuning over time. I have some sort of ADD when it comes to EDH decks.

So I thought I'd tell a story this morning.


EDIT: Added Gatherer links to each Commander.


Last Saturday my family threw a big party (50+ people) and I (knowing that there would be many Magic players there) let everyone know to bring their Commander decks (if they had them), and that I would be bringing six of mine (for if they didn't). 


Eventually, six of us sat down around the table, me being the only person there who had played Commander before. Two others had their own Commander decks but had never gotten to play them, and the other three borrowed my decks. One of these three hadn't played Magic at all since 7th Edition!


The decks were, in turn order:

1) Me - [Maelstrom Wanderer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=265154) (Mine)

2) Guy Who Hadn't Played in Years (Danny) - [Skullbriar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=236485) (Mine)

3) My Best Friend (Steve) - [Experiment Kraj](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=107385) (His own)

4) My Brother (Ian) - [Child of Alara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=180516) (NOTE: Based off of the ""JUDGE!"" deck posted here a few weeks ago) (Mine)

5) My Brother's Best Friend (Geoffrey) - [Elesh Norn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=214352) (His own)

6) Random Dude (Sean) - [Thelon of Havenwood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=116737) (Mine)


We shuffle up, and begin.


The early turns start out simply, lands and utility creatures being played. I drop [Rites of Flourishing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=235188) to get the game really going, and people start dropping lands and a few random artifacts and creatures, nothing too fancy. Ian drops a [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=209044) for emergencies, but everyone is generally cordial. Danny brings out [Skullbriar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=236485), but most people have blockers, so he's not gaining very many counters. An amusing moment occurs when he draws [Garruk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=247323), blinks, and goes ""What the fuck is this?"", but he quickly gets the hang of Planeswalkers and LOVES Garruk's +1.


Meanwhile, Ian has played [Sulfuric Vortex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=47461), so we're all slowly dying. He also drops out [Child of Alara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=180516) as insurance


Then Danny drops [Forgotten Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220583). 


One full set of turns goes by.


Forgotten Ancient has 10 +1/+1 counters on it. Luckily, Skullbriar was dead for that upkeep. But that wouldn't be the case for long, we all knew, and we had to do something. But no one had an answer. The closest thing was Geoffrey, who had [Scepter of Dominance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=174792), but that just kept him from attacking, not from gaining counters. And gain counters he did, all (now) 18 of them. If that scepter gets destroyed, one person is doomed per turn.


Ian manages to destroy the Forgotten Ancient by sacrificing Child of Alara somehow to stop Skullbriar getting more counters (along with the  [Clone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=266274) I had of it), but it's Skullbriar. If we kill it, the counters stay, and he has more than enough mana to cast it again and again.


It's Ian's turn, and he smiles devilishly. He taps one white and plays [Alliance of Arms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=228218). After the Join Forces, everyone ends up with 18 1/1 Soldiers, and Ian passes the turn, knowing full well what is to happen next.


Geoffrey draws, taps the 7, and casts [Elesh Norn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=214352). Suddenly NO ONE has soldiers, except Geoffrey, who has 18 3/3 soldiers. Skullbriar is tapped, and suddenly Danny takes around 35 to the face. Game over for him.


Everyone breathes a sigh of relief, but now we have Elesh Norn and Geoffrey's Army to deal with. 


The turn goes around, and Steve, in his first (and it turns out, only) major move, casts [Phyrexian Ingester](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=214384), imprinting Elesh Norn. She bounces immediately to the Command Zone, but the hope is someone can counter her or something. The hope never materializes. Elesh comes out again, and this time it is Steve who bites the dust. 


And now there is 4.


Ian decides it is time for things to get silly. He casts [Warp World](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=190187). 


And suddenly, everything changes. I still have a ton of lands, but everyone else has been depleted in favor of artifacts that don't really matter and creatures that are tiny. Geoffrey and Sean draw most instants and sorceries of Warp World. Geoffrey and Sean take their turns, and now it is my turn. 


I cast Maelstrom Wanderer, and cascade into more cascade into more cascade. I don't remember how, exactly, but I end up casting [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=46424) at a storm count of 7. Ian copies it, but this only gives him the one copy.


I end up taking a 25 minute or so turn, because in my Mind's Desire draws there are at least two ""Wheel of Fortune"" style effects. As part of this sequence of events, I cast [Acidic Soil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=5722). 


In the end, I cast [Ignite Memories](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=109756) with storm at 18. Geoffrey, unfortunately, has [Ivory Mask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=83413) out from the Warp World., so he's out. So I deal out the copies evenly to Sean and Ian. We resolve Sean's first, and he dies.


Then we resolve Ian's. As the life is ticking down, he keeps thinking before each resolution. Once he gets taken down to where the next copy will likely kill him, he says ""Hold on. I have a response now."" and I realize:


He has a [Tainted Sigil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=180618).


I facepalm as I remember the Acidic Soil, and he ends up at 77 life.


Ian's turn. He plays [Shared Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=49764).


I blink a couple of times, say ""Fuck this, I need a drink"", and scoop.


After about 15 minutes, Geoffrey and Ian emerge from the room. Ian had been victorious: he had dropped [Teferi's Puzzle Box](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=83294). Because of this, Geoffrey had been forced to get rid of his hand and draw everything from Ian's deck. Since Ian's deck was 5-color and Geoffrey was mono-white, he could cast essentially nothing, while Ian could cast anything he drew from Geoffrey's deck. Ian swung in with Geoffrey's own creatures, and the game was over.




There were a few more plays in there that I left out that were moderately interesting, like the few turns [Hall of Gemstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3390) was out, or the few turns I had [Psychic Battle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=26287). 


In the end, though, it was a ridiculous game lasting about 3.5 hours. We were all drinking during it, laughing, and having a great time. Exactly what I think EDH/Commander is all about.

I play a ton of EDH and lurk a lot. If you follow me at all, I usually criticise people for not making decks with clear plans and say how fantastic Edric is.

I've just bought a Shirei deck on MTGO and would love to jam even more games! Please add me, starfox444 on mtgo if you would like to (hopefully) have fun ( Shirei can do some pretty cute locks that are actually horrifying if you don't have the kill spells for it).

This deck was created out of the ashes of a straight up control Grand Arbiter deck that won by doing stuff like Stasis/Capsize.  I loved/hated that deck so I switched up to a bant deck, leaving in some control elements and adding some ramp/beaters to make the overall game play more enjoyable.  It has a pseudo military theme when I decided to add all three commands and some swords.  Overall, that isn't really something I want to emphasize in my tinkerings though.



This is probably deck 1a in terms of my favorite decks to play.  It has an answer for most things, a steady stream of potential win cons and I've done lethal general damage on turn 5 ([Finest Hour](http://magiccards.info/arb/en/126.html), I love you)



The biggest issue this deck has is generating consisted card advantage.  I tend to run out of gas and if I don't have any good defensive pieces in place I get run over by faster/combo decks.  Looking at it, the ramp cards like explosive vegetation might not be the best choices considering the low basic land total (16).  



I'd like to try and find a better balance between the ramp/draw/defensive support cards.  Spending wise, I don't really want to put anything more than another $50 or so into this deck since I'm working on 3 other decks at the moment.



My metagame has a mix of incredibly power/fast combo decks and stompers however mostly the decks are fairly Johnny and have been trending that way.  I don't need to really worry about heavy countermagic, control or combo decks really.  There's only one Kikki-Jikki in our playgroup and he doesn't go infinite with it.



tl, dr: 
better balance between the ramp/draw/defensive support cards. 

$50 to spend.

As of late, he has been posting good results in my playgroup,  and I tend to play a different style of him than a lot of other Jarad decks I see, so I figured I'd post for some constructive Criticism.

[Jarad, Lategame Lich Lord](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/jarad-lategame-lich-lord/)

So, like the description said, I choose to run more of a controlling style and just outright win in the lategame with huge creatures that can't be dealt with, because of Jarad's second ability.

Now, here are some cards I'd like to drop:
**Hibernation's End:** Great Card, and It's insane value when it gets going, but it does not get going very often.

**Golgari Grave-Troll:** I don't ~~play creatures~~ leave creatures in the graveyard very often, so he is never bigger than a 5/5. I'd rather have a bigger, better creature.

**Troll Ascetic:** Not good in commander. Not nearly enough impact on the board state.

**Sins of the Past:** None of my instants or sorceries give enough of a value to be worth paying six for a second use, save for Life's Finale. I could just add another board wipe instead.

**Skullbriar, the Walking Grave:** Good card, but I'm not looking for a fast clock, because my deck was built around larger creatures.

**Druid's Repository:** Has helped before, but I often ramp quite fast, meaning that the advantage given from this card is negligible. Additionally, I often attack only two or three times in a game, so it rarely gets counters.

Now for some cards I would like to consider as potential replacements for what I would take out:

**Ashes to Ashes:** Amazing card, Probably the best removal in my colors. Helps deal with Avacyn, who is a huge pain for me.

**Black Sun's Zenith:** Good board wipe that recurs itself,

**Beacon of Unrest:** More recursion, brah.

**Decree of Pain:** Board wipe and card advantage. Probably wouldn't use it AND BSZ.

**Spiritmonger:** Efficiently costed, growable beater that can regenerate. Love this card.

**Butcher of Malakir:** Grave Pact on legs. Large, Sac-able, 5/5 Legs.

**Scavenging Ooze:** Life Gain and grave hate. All around good card.

**Lord of Extinction:** Really big guy, works incredibly well with Jarad.

Help me make my deck worse.,24,6,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/186g0m/never_before_have_these_words_been_uttered_in_edh/,"Alright. Backstory. Every thursday I have 5 people over to play EDH. One guy plays a Treefolk-Doran deck, One plays a Merfolk-Sygg deck, One plays an Angel-Kaalia deck, and One plays a Zombie-Thrax deck. Me? I run a Teysa, Orzhov Scion deck.

We played, and the game admittedly went on for like 3.5 hours. Why? Because I was running Teysa. I had a Endrek Sahr, Master Breeder out and was producing tokens like nobodies business. These of course were getting sacced to Ashnod's Altar and turning into white spirits. The saccing was causing Butcher of Malakir to set off, and everyone at the table was saccing 4-6 creatures a turn. Nobody could get board position. Everytime I would get kill damage from tokens alone, someone would be board wipe (of course) and BAM, everything I worked for was gone. 

Alright. Fast forward back to my turn and with all my mana and massive amount of recursion, I got Endrek back, Butcher back, Teysa back out and was right on it again. Creating tokens and saccing tokens, ect. That's what the deck does. It's a grindy-board control deck.

Well. People got pissed. They want me to scrap the deck. The thing about this Teysa deck is that it's been my ""work-in-progress"" for about a year and a half. The first version I created SUCKED. HARD. Like no synergy, and crumbled after turn 5 and a board wipe. So I went back to the drawing board. I came up with another draft that persisted through board wipes, but didn't have the synergy to win.

This final draft was where I got everything right. Not too many combos (Only 1 infinite which I know of, and EVERYONE at my table has a combo like it - A game ender.) Life gain? it's in there. Persist through board wipe? Yeap. Everything thing is there. 

A competitive EDH player will find several things to fix in this, and that's not why I'm doing it. For my meta - it's good. But other people feel it's too good. 

I'm taking a risk posting this, because I have a feeling it'll get downvoted into oblivion. Or I'll get some commenter saying how I shouldn't complain. I want my thursday night group to have fun, not be a ResultsVary wins with Teysa every week. So, check out my deck-list, tell me what would be good potential cuts and replacements to make it a more kitchen-table friendly deck.

My copy of Primal Surge goes off first. I get Darksteel Colossus and one other card, doesn't matter. The Atogatog player is next. He hits a couple lands and Possibility Storm. Kaalia wiffs pretty hard. Of course, the Ruric Thar deck goes bonkers and hits a TON of permanents. He gets Akroma's Memorial, Urabrask the Hidden, and a ton of dudes. With his triggered abilities on the stack (Terrastodon, Woodfall Primus, etc), I cast Rakdos Charm, choosing the mode of each creature deals 1 damage to it's controller. Each of the three other players get a copy of that spell, and due to Possibility Storm, my Rakdos Charm turns into a Terminate, which I use on one of the Kaalia decks creatures. All of the Rakdos Charms go off, and needless to say, the Ruric Thar player, with his 17 creatures in play dies a miserable, horrible death, and his triggers are removed from the stack when he does.

Fast forward a few turns later. My board position is pretty much the same minus my Kaervek. Kaalia actually has some threats and is probably going to win during his next turn. He has 5 creatures and 8 life. The Atogatog guy made everyone draw a bunch of cards and hit a Copy Enchantment through Possibility Storm, copying his Hive Mind. He also has a Noble Benefactor on the board. During his turn, he pops the Benefactor, letting each player get a free Demonic Tutor. I'm looking through my deck and notice something beautiful. I have exactly 2 instants left in my deck: Dark Ritual and the Rakdos Charm from before. So I search for Dark Ritual, of course! During my turn, I cast Dark Ritual. With the triggers of both Hive Minds and the Possibility Storm on the stack, the Kaalia player attempts to Swords to Plowshares his Balefire Dragon. So the Atogatog player gets two copies of Swords, as do I, and the Possibility Storm is still on the stack for the original Swords. The Atogatog player uses one Swords on his own 5/5 and one targeting the Balefire Dragon. I target both of mine at the Balefire Dragon as well. So now the Kaalia player has 4 creatures and 14 life. The Possibility Storm on the Swords turns into a Vampiric Tutor, which is pretty Irrelevant for me, since I know what I'm going into with the Possibility Storm on my own Dark Ritual. He has no further responses, so they both get two copies of Dark Ritual. Then I Possibility Storm into the Rakdos Charm, chosing the same mode as before. So now there are 5 copies of Rakdos Charm on the stack, killing the Kaalia player super dead. The Atogatog player says, ""And with that, I will conceed to your greatness.""

Uril was pretty terrifying before, but now with the new legendary rules, I think we have a pretty insane commander. very hard to deal with not only because of hexproof, but because of lots of totem enchantments or spells that give him indestructibility.

Jon always get incredibly annoyed when anyone does anything to interact negatively with his board state. Kill one of his creatures? He will do everything he can to destroy you. He will start rules lawyering over everything he possibly can, and aggressively point out all of your missed triggers.

Suffice to say, he becomes sullen and intimidating whenever anyone does anything bad to him or his board. The issue is that this means David will never attack him, and just attack me. I used to think all of this might be because of my EDH decks not being fun to play against, but whenever I play the same decks at my LGS, myself (and the other players) all have a total blast.

Jon is a friend, but I am not sure how to deal with this situation. I want to carry on playing Magic with him, but not under these circumstances. I honestly don't know what to do.

Well, that is true, but something that this card taught me is that cost and effect is divided by a colon. If you bounce Mangara in response to the ability, the target creature is exiled, and Mangara just comes back when bounce spell said so.

Fortunately, the semi-casual nature of the format and the wealth of cards available means we don't have to stand for this kind of economic tyranny! Instead, we can find replacements for expensive staples.

Rules of the thread: The card you're suggesting a replacement for must be greater than $10 in price, preferably more than $20. The replacement must cost at least half the card it is replacing, but preferably, try to keep it below $2. It's a singleton format, after all!

My suggestion:

Sensei's Divining Top ---&gt; Soothsaying

Soothsaying is limited to blue, so you won't see it in every deck unlike with the Top, but this innocuous little enchantment is just as mana-efficient at 1 CMC, and can actually go deeper than the Top thanks to the X activation cost. While this means it costs more to hit the 3 cards Top hits, it means you can dump excess mana at the end of an opponent's turn to dig pretty deep, and plan out your next, like, 10 turns. Beyond that, you can actually shuffle your deck if you've dug deep and found that Islands are all you can expect for the foreseeable future.

First and foremost, we are a well-knit Community of brewers and testers who live our daily lives, and if time permits enjoy working and playing with one another through the program Cockatrice, an open-source, free-to-play client that allows users of little to no income to continue to flourish in the gripping, ever-changing world that is Magic: The Gathering.

With that pitch you probably think I am here advertising just that, the program and how I think you should use it. True, I do think you should use it, but in actuality I am here on the behalf of the Community. Magic: The Gathering is just that, a gathering of friends, family, and people you don't even know to take part in adventure, mystery, and battle. 

Without other people sure you can goldfish, solitaire, or other synonyms for playing alone. There are moments where that is entirely fitting, but the mission of /r/Cockatrice is to expand the gaming, testing, and creative opportunities of everyone interested in playing Magic: the Gathering. We've got chat rooms, discussion threads, regular tournaments and themed events too. No matter your play style or format preference, we've got something for you.

Jarad was banned from a personal dislike on how games were ending. After a long hour to two hour game, it felt bad to lose to Jarad going over the top and killing everyone simultaneously.

1, Sacrifice a creature: Remove Ghost Council of Orzhova from the game. Put it directly into play at the end of turn.

Mayael the Anima - WGR

Summon Legend

3WGRT: Look at the top five cards of your library. If there's a creature with power five or greater among them, you may put it directly into play. Put the rest of the cards on the bottom of your library.

Sygg, River Cutthroat - 2

Summon Legend

Sygg, River Cutthroat's mana cost must be paid with only blue and/or black mana.
At the end of any turn in which opponent lost 3 or more life, draw a card.

Summon Legends

Whenever you cast a blue spell or summon a blue creature, target creature gains flying ability until end of turn.

Because then it turns into a bunch of cookie cutter decks.

For example, I recently built a grixis deck with Nicol Bolas as the general, and I themed the deck around it (less removal,more ""gain control"", lots of card draw, lots of politics).  Another deck I recently built was a blue/red ""dragons"" deck, with dragons, mana, and card draw.

A few of the guys in my circle have more or less 3 color good-stuff decks, one bant, one naya.  Most of the cards in eahc of these decks are the same, and it kinda becomes boring to play against them when all they play are a list of 50-60 or so ""staple"" cards, and it gets really old to never see anything new or fun from them.  

Does anyone else hate seeing these kinds of decks? Or at least, get bored of playing against them?  I love seeing themed decks, where they don't necessarily play all the best cards, just so they can build upon a unique theme?

Instead of buying ten Sol Rings and ten Command Towers, etc. (especially on a college student's budget), I simply share cards. 

I have all my cards in the same sleeves, and they all share a box with dividers - I just have to reconstruct every deck when I want to play it. This process is often long and tedious, so I have listed all my decks on tappedout to ensure consistency and make rebuilding simpler and more efficient. Figured I might as well share them.

They're all listed as I run them now, though it can occasionally vary by a card or two, depending on how I feel when swapping cards around. I'm open to suggestions and critiques, especially if you notice any glaring omissions.

I try to play to the general, construct around a cohesive theme/ idea, etc. So here they are, listed with play style, win cons, and a general difficulty (as in casual vs. competitive) level on a 1-5 scale.

[Kresh the Bloodbraided](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/kreshiepoo/)  
**Difficulty: 3**  
Goal: Buff Kresh to 21+ and swing for the win.  
Notable interactions: Bloodfire Colossus wins the game if he goes off with Kresh on the field.

[Zedruu the Greathearted](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/zedruus-fuckery/)  
**Difficulty: 2**  
Goal: Mess with the board state with swap tricks until I can drop a combo.  
Notable interactions: Illusions of Grandeur + Venser, the Sojourner, or making the game unplayably complicated.

[Damia, Sage of Stone](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/damia-sage-of-etb-abuse/)  
**Difficulty: 4**
Goal: Abuse ETB effects and draw cards until I have an overwhelming advantage or combo out.  
Notable Interactions: Kokusho recursion, infinite turns, Deadeye Navigator + anything.

[Shirei, Shizo's Caretaker](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/shireinanigans/)  
**Difficulty: 3**  
Goal: Get Shirei out and keep the board clear, hands clear, and draw repeatedly.  
Notable interactions: Any 3 creatures + Shirei; Blood Artist is a fucking house, and Lightning Coils can pop for 20+ to win.

[Crosis, the Purger](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/crosis-binge-and-purge/)  
**Difficulty: 2**  
Goal: Group hug, then punish everyone. Enchants deal damage for all draws/ discards. Wheel effects to end the game.  
Deck rule: I wanted to deal damage solely through enchants, and equally to all players. I thought this would keep me from having enemies, turns out it just makes everyone your enemy. Oh well.

[Circu, Dimir Lobotomist](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/circus-dimir-lobotomy/)  
**Difficulty: 1**  
Goal: Mill that deck. Super casual, basically just any card that mills went in here.  
Why? Because mill is fucking awesome, that's why. Szadek was my first rare pull, and I originally had him as the general, but he's just too damn expensive to cast.

[Sedris, the Traitor King](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/sedris-the-combo-king-1/)  
**Difficulty: 5**  
Goal: Combo the fuck out. Stop everyone else from comboing out.  
Theme: Every ""infinite"" or instant-win combo I could cram in there, plus plenty of tutors and counterspell backup. I don't really play this one much, but it's around for super-cutthroat games.

[Karador, Ghost Chieftain](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/karador-dredge-chieftan/)  
**Difficulty: 4**  
Goal: Dredge, reanimate, combo out. Kokusho or Yosei will do. Have a response for everything until then.   
Notable Interactions: Nim Deathmantle makes Kokusho and Yosei extra efficient.

[Sygg, River Guide](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/merfolks-03-01-13-1/)  
**Difficulty: 1**  
Goal: Have fun with my favorite tribe. Pile-of-cards level casual, but I love them.  
Notable Interactions: If I do manage to win, it's probably because Seahunter + Wanderwine Prophets.

[Ruhan of the Fomori](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/ruhans-hammer/)  
**Difficulty: 3**  
Goal: Get in with Ruhan for 21 damage before they even know what's happening. Several different god-hands can get turn 3 or 4 wins.

The following information was all gleaned from Gatherer. The prices are TCG mid-price. Some of what I say below may be incorrect, so please feel free to correct me if you think I have anything wrong. 



There are 143 different lands which can legally be run in a colourless EDH deck. 

(Technically, there are 144 which have a colourless colour identity, but Library of Alexandria is banned.) 

Some lands are utterly pointless in a colourless EDH deck, and so we shall ignore them:

- Pillar of the Paruns

- Fetch lands (Onslaught, Mirage, Zendikar)

- Evolving Wilds/Teramorphic Expanse/Thawing Glaciers

- Meteor Crater 

- Command Tower



This leaves us with 122 lands. 

Of these, 17 do not tap for mana. 
The offenders are: 

- Vesuva (although, this will almost always enter as a copy of a land which does) 
- The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale
- Dark Depths
- Oasis
- Sorrow’s Path
- Island of Wak-Wak
- Eye of Ugin
- Arena
- Safe Haven
- Ice Floe
- Maze of Ith
- Bazaar of Baghdad 
- Diamond Valley
- Glacial Chasm 
- Halls of Mist
- The cycle of “bands with other legendary creatures” lands (Adventurer’s Guildhouse, Cathedral of Serra, Mountain Stronghold, Seafarer’s Quay, Unholy Citadel)






The most expensive land you could run in a colourless EDH deck is Mishra’s Workshop ($400).

There are 16 lands over $10, a further 16 that are between $5 and $10, and 27 that are $1 to $5.

This means that there are a whopping 63 lands which cost less than $1 and can be run in a colourless EDH deck. Even though some of these are terrible, it’s still possible to find roughly 40 lands that tap for a single colourless mana (or more) for easily less than $20. 

If you wish to develop your mana base, you might end up investing in some more pricy cards, but as I showed above, very few of the lands which you can run in a colourless EDH deck cost more than $5. 

Hopefully this puts the myth that the mana base for a colourless deck is expensive to rest once and for all. 

EDIT: moved Thawing Glaciers to the list of cards which are practically useless in a colourless deck.

Even the aggro decks seems to play this way.  Until then, we all turtle behind our boards and madly try to reach this critical mass while preventing other players from getting there first.

.

None of us are especially happy with this state, but we're not especially sure what to do about it.  Some of the players have decided that severely limiting tutor counts will make it much less easy to assemble the cards that create a non-interactive board state, and are therefore reducing tutor counts to 1, maybe 2.  I'm willing to try it, but I'm not sure this is the answer.

.

I'm not sure what to do, though.  When the game is essentially ""Nothing happens until one person wins"", then it's not a game.  At the same time, though, cards like True Conviction, Avacyn, Mikaeus the Unhallowed, Tooth and Nail, and Living Death are too good to cut, and if I were to suggest that my body would never be found.  I don't want to introduce new ""Must attack at least every other turn"" type of rules.  I feel like one of the main underlying problems is that, as a friend put it, ""the build-till-kill game is just good, safe multiplayer tactics.""  And he's right.  By committing your resources only when you will lose nothing from a counterattack, you are playing the safest, most strategically sound game you can.

.

So I leave it to you, Reddit.  How do we bring the interactive game back to our games?  How do we make it so, once again, playing the game is all about the game?

TL;DR:  Games are boring when they're just nuclear arms races.  Fix pls.

I'm here to get your opinions and feedback on a format I've been working on for a short time. As you read the general rules and guidelines to the format please understand that we've not actually begun playtesting yet as we have to have a fairly firm set of rules before we can even begin constructing the cube. If you see anything that can obviously be improved or simply doesn't work as is please let me know. This is why I'm showing this to you! Criticism!

That being said... **What is Command Cube?**  
Command Cube is a variation of both the Commander and Cube formats. The format follows all of the rules (aside from the Commander ban list), but a draft similar to that found in Cube is used in order to ensure participants have fresh and moderately balanced decks each time we play!

**Why is Command Cube worth playing?**  
It's hard to balance your local meta. One of the most common comments I see here on r/EDH is people complaining about a particular archetype making their meta unfair and little fun. Too much land destruction ruins some people's day. For others combo decks just wreck them. Some prefer pillow forting and hate aggro. Some hate pillow forters and just want to hit them in the face. The reason for these issues is because we tune our decks week after week until they play out just right. Those pillow forts are made of the softest down and the combo decks have all the right tutors. Variety is sacrificed for competitiveness as someone will always ramp up the odds for everyone. Arms races can kill metas. Command Cube helps stop that by giving a fixed card pool and putting everyone (even the noobs) on an even level.  

**Well, how do I play?**  
Well.. We're figuring that out. Right now we have a general outline as to how the format should work.  
1. For an 8 player draft there is a card pool of 800 cards.  
2. The card pool is split into 40 twenty card packs.  
3. 1/5th of the packs contain only Legendary creatures.  
4. Commanders are drafted first, filler later.

Yup! It's that simple. The idea is first you draft a number of Commanders you may want to build around. Choosing a variety of colors or redundant colors (a RUG general, a RU general, and a UG general in case you don't draft enough for any particular combination) is HIGHLY recommended, but everyone has their own way of doing things. From there you begin to draft, attempting to pick cards that you might think will fit in your deck. In the end each players has 15 legendary creatures and 85 other cards. From this they build a 100-card singleton deck.

**What's the catch..?**  
Well, combo decks rarely work in this format unless you're lucky to draft the cards needed. This could be seen as either a pro or con as infinite combos aren't as common, but when they happen they are a breath of fresh air, not Riku getting his jollies in the corner again.   

Tribal decks are also rather hard to build unless they cube dedicates each color to one or two card types. This is bad news as many of the favorite decks (IE: Elves &amp; Slivers) are likely to be non-existent in this format, and any tribal build will likely feel 'pre-built' depending on what you see in packs.

Mono color decks can be difficult to run depending on how the cube is built. Luckily mono-color legends can just be played in multicolor decks if you can't scrounge up enough of the particular color.

Those are the major issues I already foresee for the format but hey.. If I wanted a game just like EDH I'd play EDH, right?

**Possible Changes**  
Still, to offset some of these issues here are some changes either I've thought up or members of this community have come up with in order to improve the format.

*An open card pool*  
My playgroup and I have discussed having a large pool of mediocre cards, a fair bit weaker than those in the cube, in what we call the public pool. After finishing the draft we go around the table and we are given the opportunity to trade one of the cards we drafted with a card in the open card pool. This helps mono-color decks form as players can trade off-color cards for on-color cards. However, any cards you trade into the pool can be taken by other players as we go around. It would be almost like a second round of drafting. Once we go around the table once without anyone taking a card the open pool closes and we deck build.

 I just recently built two Edh decks before I moved to a different state as I thought playing Edh would be a good way to meet new people and hopefully make some friends.

My question to you is about the strength of my decks. I have two decks, one a Tajic deck that uses indestructible/recurring creatures, wraths, and sweet equipments (such as swords and jitte). When I play with this deck my only real way to deal with my oponents threats is to wrath, but this understandably can annoy some people.  My other deck is a Karn deck with a lot of colorless ramp, a couple combos, and eldrazi.

I want to play my favorite cards, but at times I feel like my decks win too frequently... Should I take some of the better cards out of these decks? Should I sandbag my plays to be worse?



I want to have fun with my deck but not at the expense of everyone else...

Any suggestions?

(Bonus: Soul Soundtrack included!)",16,2,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1h3yb8/by_request_here_is_trostani_and_her_soul_sisters/,"[Some people](http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1guc3c/what_is_your_most_absurdly_fun_deck/cao3io1) asked to see my Trostani Soul Sisters deck, so here it is! [Decklist](https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/natural-soul-sisters/).

First thing's first, here's [the soul sister soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CejaCa6Eewc&amp;list=PL3ZJrWtEhQ6xaMaxdBOs0hH08KQOyaSZQ&amp;index=1) you should listen to while playing this deck, or while reading about the deck.

**The Main Idea**

The point of this deck is to gain life, absurd amounts of life. There are no infinite combos in the deck (I think!) so getting to 50 000 life is an accomplishment. Trostani is mostly used as a [Soul Sister](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;text=+[%22gain%201%20life%22]+[battlefield]+[%22another%20creature%22]&amp;type=+[%22Creature%22]), and token creation is only a minor theme. Once we are up a silly life total, we let other players knock each other out, then try to get off an enormous Serra Avatar, or win outright with Felidar Sovereign. The dream is to have Doubling Season and Trostani out, play Ajani, make two avatars, then get Trostani to make two more. Your life goes up 16-fold. God forbid you also have Rhox Faithmender out too...

**The Deck**

The deck plays 6 [soul sisters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;action=advanced&amp;text=+[%22gain+1+life%22]+[battlefield]+[%22another+creature%22]&amp;type=+[%22Creature%22]) including Trostani.

&gt; Soul Warden, Soul's Attendant, Essence Warden, Auriok Champion, Suture Priest

Combined with creatures that have ""**ETB gain some life**"" we try to get up to 80 life within the first 8 turns. There are tons of really bad creatures in the history of magic that do this - Venerable Monk? - so this deck only runs high-impact ones. Lone Missionary is the outlier, but he plays nicely with psuedo-flicker effects like Kor Skyfisher.

&gt; Jaddi Lifestrider, Kitchen Finks, Lone Missionary, Loxodon Hierarch, Thragtusk

From there we run a variety of **flicker** and pseudo-flicker effects to keep the life-gain-train going. (This deck is still in the works, so I am missing things like Ghostway. I'd be happy to hear suggestions for more flickering effects!)

&gt; Flickerwisp, Kor Skyfisher, Cloudshift, Otherworldly Journey, Flicker

We also are running a **4-post package** (mostly for the hilarity), which can be set up by tutoring KotR:

&gt; Cloudpost, Glimmerpost, Vesuva, Thespian's Stage, Expedition Map, Knight of the Reliquary

Once we are floating around 80 life, we try to **Double our lifetotal**. The thing to note is that With Trostani out, Serra Avatar reads ""double your life"".

&gt; Serra Avatar, Ajani Goldmane, Celestial Mantle

Other **big cards** that work well in our deck. Saproling Burst is a total beast. With *only* Trostani out, at worst Saproling Burst reads ""5 mana- gain 21 life"" but it is so much better.

&gt; Ageless Entity, Rhox Faithmender, Well of Lost Dreams, Eternity Vessel, True Conviction, Saproling Burst

Finally, I guess I should talk about the **win conditions** of the deck. Note that many of the flicker effects will help you protect Felidar Sovereign. There are a handful of tutors in the deck to help you get Felidar or Test of Endurance, and those tutors can also help you find useful enchantments. There are more creature tutors I could put in the deck, but frankly, I don't really care about getting a Felidar win. If anything I would tutor up KotR to get 4-post online.

&gt; **Tutors**: Enlightened Tutor, Idyllic Tutor, Eladamri's Call, Sterling Grove

&gt; **Win Cons**: Felidar Sovereign, Test of Endurance, Grove of the Guardian + Seedborn Muse + Trostani, True Conviction

Also, the deck isn't quite complete, and I've included some cards in the maybeboard that I just haven't gotten around to getting yet; I'm looking at you Scroll Rack and Ivory Tower!

So there you have it. That's it. Thanks for the interest!

**Bonus Story**: This deck was inspired by my wife (who plays very rarely), and whose favourite card *was* Fountain of Youth. The first Christmas I knew her (before we were dating!)

There are some really strong interactions between [Animar, Soul of Elements](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=236504) and morph creatures. Primarily is the fact that once he has at least three +1/+1 counters, all morph creatures are free to cast face-down (and why would you ever want to cast a creature face-up?). There are several ways to exploit this, and the most broken way I could think of is to use [Cloudstone Curio](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=89089). Once Animar is on 3 counters, you can chain-bounce two morph creatures, pumping Animar up arbitrarily high. Big dude = big damage, and his protection acts as natural evasion (but there's also a [Rogue's Passage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=277992) to get through). 

Now, having the Curio combo out may not be enough to win the game on its own. That's what [Soul of the Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=240179), [Primordial Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=89083), and [Borborygmos Enraged](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366283) are for. These allow you to draw your entire deck and chuck lands at anything that moves, clearing the way for a massive morph swing.

There is also the stasis-like interaction between [Brine Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=189245) and [Vesuvan Shapeshifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=109765). This effectively creates a lock on your opponents' permanents, never allowing them to untap.

That covers the main combos in the deck, the rest is just fun stuff with morph dudes and some run-of-the-mill ramp.

Definitely open to suggestions on improving this one. I know some people frown on infinite combos in EDH--I never include them in my other decks--but let's be honest here. A deck centered around morph is going to need a little help from broken cards like the Curio.",,False,,t5_2scee,False,,BGS,True,t3_1bz53l,http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1bz53l/animorphs_giving_some_love_to_an_awesome_ability/,

When we sat down at a table the judge started telling us how we were playing a point system.

+1 for being last man standing

+2 for eliminating an opponent

-1 for destroying 4 land 

-1 for taking 3 or more turns

+1 for destroying a legendary land

+1 for saving an opponent from death

+1 for being the first person to remove a creature from play

-1 for looping for than 10 times in a turn


there were a couple more that I can't remember for our specific game.

A big complaint I had, if we're sticking to the spirit of the game, is that if you attacked a player then saved them from yourself, you got the point.

I love EDH format (as well as Cube format). I really only have 1 EDH paper deck, but don't go to my LGS much anymore due to time and distance. 

Should I invest in a competitive EDH deck on mtgo?

I'm worried that it might be a big investment and looking for encouragement from either yay or nay sides. 

I enjoy 1v1 Commander, which is good since I've been reading MTGO has quicker 1v1 queues than the multiplayer commander. My usual way of play is to just go straight into a game from the available queues.
 

I also enjoy esper. Whenever I draft mtgo cube or my own physical cube with a few friends, I seem to mostly stay within esper colors. So, if Sharuum isn't a fun esper commander, any suggestion for other commanders in the esper colors?

Ruric draws a lot of hate, but I don't care so much about that, since it's not a voltron style deck.  There's a sub-theme of creatures with ETB effects ([Terastodon](http://magiccards.info/query?q=terastodon&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname), [Sylvan](http://magiccards.info/query?q=sylvan+primordial&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname)/[Molten Primordial](http://magiccards.info/query?q=molten+primordial&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname)), since I wanted to play a lot of creatures anyway. However, the other major theme of the deck that I want to push more is permanents (especially creatures) with abilities that trigger when my opponents play spells.

Me and some friends got into magic and the Vampire deck was the first thing I build. (I had a lot of vampires in my deck building tool kit and some help) More and more people started playing EDH so I had to follow, only problem was that I didn't have a legendary vampire.


Then my birthday happened. I got Oliva from a friend with the message: ""Now you'll have to, no excuses.""


So I got some more cards gifted to keep the tribal up *Triumph of Cruelty*, *Aggravate*, *Vampiric Fury* &amp; *Wooden Stake* amongst others. I took a look around other vampire EDH decks on the internet and bought myself some more vampires to fill it up and here's the result!


There's the obligatory Vampire Hexmage to get rid of a Planeswalker or other card with counters. Wooden Stake &amp; Blazing Torch help me get rid of (or bypass) creatures that I'll lose when Olivia dies and some creatures that can sacrifice them just before I lose them. 


Now, our metagame doesn't mind infinite combo's but I don't like them myself so I won't run Sanguine Bond and Exquisite Blood. Any comments?

Unfortunately I don't have much to say. I'm not a big fan of the colours on their own, nor do I see a whole lot of appeal in her personally. But that's what these discussions are for, convince me otherwise, what makes Vela a strong general. best cards with her? Anything that lets your flicker creatures in the colours (would be great with white in my opinion). Tell my myself, or anyone else for that matter, should consider vela as our 1st slot in our deck.

We have several options; Child of Alara, Progenitus, Slivers, Reaper king, Horde of notions, some dragons, and Karona.

All of these seem like tons and tons of fun, and the one I'm most drawn to is Child of Alara because it seems very easy to make a VERY decent [pauper alara deck](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/deck.asp?deck_id=910032) that can actually be tons of fun. 

On the other hand, I could always just put pieces together and make a pauper fun Genju of the Realm deck because he looks like he can be absolutely CRAZY if you form a deck around him well enough to keep him on the field and keep spitting out an 8/12 every turn for the low low price of 2 mana. 


I'm really leaning towards Child because it's a rather well established General among 5 color players, but ALL of them seem just absolutely nuts and fun to play with having the option of every single color in the game.

Unfortunately, I've never come across anyone who actually plays a 5 color, and I'm not quite sure what the exact goal of it is. 

I know it's a huge question to ask, but could any of you weigh in with your opinions on 5 color generals and how they play or how you play them if you do? I know what to include for B/U/W decks, but I have NEVER played Green and I have almost no knowledge of Red besides some kill spells and artifact hate in a Gisela deck.

I did a little casual tech on it (steel golem, form of the dragon, illusions of grandeur, etc) and had a blast.
I want to tech out two more casual decks that I can bring around with me to show off the format.

Doing a little searching around I found two commanders I am interested in building around. 

Experiment Kraj 

http://deckbox.org/sets/212238

 looks like it could be a lot of fun.  It's a little janky but I've always found creature centric light combos to be entertaining.  This is my list so far.  I'm trying to keep the budget as tight as I can. We're all casual players so shouldn't be too difficult.  I do want to try and keep it from relying on mill and/or infinite damage combos.

The second commander is Thelon of Havenwood 

http://deckbox.org/sets/212635

I am an unabashed lover of alternative tribal decks.  My first set was Fallen Empires and I have always had an affinity for fungus.  I keep going back and forth between Thelon and Ghave, but I think for the casual budget setting Thelon can act as a beatdown deck where Ghave would be more combo centric (something I want to avoid as the other two decks I am working on involve some combo'ng).

Any advice for either of these decks would be very helpful.

These are some lands I came across while looking for mana fixing on gatherer. They have some obvious synergy with the [profilerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;format=|[%22Commander%22]&amp;text=+[proliferate]) mechanic and with [crucible of worlds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=129480), allowing for reuse after reuse. 

I think they would work great in mono-colored decks, because they do tap for two of one color. On the flipside they seem quite a bit worse in any deck running more than two colors, because you have a more fragile land base.

I like them because they are unique, cheap (although most are sold out on starcity games!) , and do provide an advantage, even if it is only for a few turns.

What is was your favorite victory story in EDH?    Personally my favorite was with my little play group.  First a little bit of background story, my brother doesn't enjoy EDH since he doesn't want to invest money in it.  Because of this we limit our games to 2 hours so it doesn't take the entire night to finish.  We were playing 5-player and it was very... bouncey?  After every board wipe people just kept getting really good fields out.  Well, slowly but surely we eliminated two players, a Karador dredge deck and a Thraximundar good stuff deck.  It was down to Aurelia, Geist of Saint Traft, and Zegana decks.  My brother who loves screwing things up played a Worldpurge with 13 minutes left on the clock.  My brother being the clever man he was kept a precinct captain and a Champion of the Perish.  Luckily he was beating down the Aurelia deck before he got to me.  I got my doubling season on the battlefield thankfully.  Then with about thirty seconds left with an avenger of zendikar on the battlefield I cast my Zegana from my hand getting her 14 +1/+1 counters.  Finally I equip grieves and drop an overwhelming stampede.  Swinging Avenger and plants at my brother and lethal commander damage and the Aurelia player.

Saw this one coming, Ghost Council's discussion was a lot of comparing him to Teysa, which she usually came out on top. So we have a discussion on old Teysa, but I encourage discussion on new Teysa. Which one should be your featured commander? I have a feeling most people running W/B aren't going to like new Teysa as much but let's hear some opinions.

Compared to r/magictcg, this subreddit contains far less of the trolling and dismissive/downvoting attitude to beginners which is fantastic in that it encourages a more helpful and communal approach to deck advice.

One issue though that I have noticed is that there tends to be a large volume of deck discussion threads which amount to ""Just built this deck, need suggestions"" without any explanation of what the deck wants to achieve, or what problems the deck builder is having. 

These are by no means bad submissions by default, but in essence they often just get a handful of responses and get buried. It's also hard to look at a potential list for a general which you have never before played and see if the list is actually going to be viable without testing. Often enough, the lists submitted are people at the first stages of tuning a deck and a lot of the card choices can be questionable, and there's nothing worse than ordering some cards for an EDH deck and later realising that they really aren't what you are looking for!

It's not a perfect comparison by any means, but consider r/spikes. Another magic subreddit with a comparable number redditors. They have had issues with streamlining their content to suit the subreddit's aims. As a forum for competitive deck discussion, they have somewhat solved this by having submission rules and formatting guidelines like [modern], [standard], [RTR draft] etc which really help find what you are looking for, and you know fairly well what kind of issues are at hand in a particular thread before you click. 

I would respectfully suggest that tags for posts could greatly improve the functionality of this subreddit with tags like [tested], [untested], [competitive], [casual/kitchen table], [tuning], [deck staples], [aggro], [control], [combo]. 
Lets face it, there are a hundred ways to skin a cat, you can play the same general as someone else and share no common cards aside from basic lands. A little organisation will go a long way towards helping find the post relevant to your deck.

Also people will feel more inclined to comment on a deck if they think the discussion is somewhat different to one that was had only a few weeks before on the same general. 

Whaddya think?

My girlfriend  beautifully fits the definition of Timmy, Power Gamer. She loves big angels. She wants to build a Kaalia of the Vast Comamnder deck. What creatures would you recommend we put in there ?

So far we have:

Bloodgift Demon; Rune-Scared Demon; Utavara Hellkite; Bogardan Hellkite; Avacyn, Angel of Hope.

We could also use recommendations for strategy and staple cards for this kind of deck.

I have spent several weeks attempting to design an EDH/ Commander deck so I can join in with my pals during their weekly multiplayer games. The massive selection of available cards, combined with my own tendencies for rebuilding decks on a whim, has made my progress completely awful. I'm finally turning to you brilliant planeswalkers for guidance! My current card collection can't support this type of deck so I plan on ordering singles.

UPDATE!
Thanks guys, I really appreciate the guidance so far.  I've decided on a commander!

Commander: Sharuum
Colors (U/B/W): I think I would like to stay primarily blue, with Black and White acting as more of splashes.
Style: Control - I know Sharuum can be used for some sick game-breaking combos, but since this is a fun casual play-group, I'd instead like to play this deck like a control deck with some artifact ramp that leads into lots of huge flying Sphinxes! 

Cool cards I'd like to include:  
1) All of the awesome Artifact and Blue Sphinx (Enigma Sphinx, Consecrated, Magister, Sphinx of Magosi, Sphinx of the Steel Wind, Summoner, Sovereign, Uthuun, etc)
2) Card draw! Can't get enough!
3) Late game big blue spells that are tactical and fun (Rite of Replication for instance).


===Old Post:===

I'm going to outline some basic goals for what I'm interested in, and if any of you have experience or ideas that could put me on the right path I'd super appreciate it.

Colors: Blue or Black, or Blue/Black Style: Control or Combo, with an emphasis on on card advantage.


Previous notes: I had toyed with doing a Dimir-style draw/discard deck with Sygg, River Cutthroat as my commander, with cards like Bloodchief Ascension, Underworld Dreams, and Liliana's Caress. However, since this is for such a friendly play-group, I think focusing on punishing discard may be a bit too hostile. I love mill but I'm skipping it for the same reason; I'd like a deck that's as fun to play against as it is to pilot.


I am leaning more and more towards mono-blue Combo/Control. I'd love to get some use out of Reliquary Tower, Mind's Eye, and fun creatures like Sphinx of Magosi. I have never built this type of deck though (in standard I favor aggro/tempo U/R).  I was also considering this style of deck in W/U led by Isperia the Inscrutable, with an emphasis on late game big Sphinxes (cos they're fun).


Any ideas for a commander? Staple cards that fit this style and are fun to use? Combos that aren't too frustrating to play against?
I really appreciate it!

This deck is the response to the post I made in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1i33no/who_was_your_first_general_and_who_is_your/)

I posted a very brief description of it on Tappedout, but I give a more concise description on this thread.

This is an infinite combo based deck that relies on the fair draw engine of various Howling Mine effects. The game plan as well as the concept is twofold:

1. Use a mass draw engine to execute an infinite combo

2. Because everybody gets to draw cards, theoretically speaking, they should draw counter/draw/kill spells to disrupt the combo. If they don't  you execute the combo ""fairly""

I put fairly in quotations because we can back up the combo with free and under costed counterspells, meaning we almost always get the combo anyway. While infinite combos are very unfun to most people, Kami and the Howling Mines makes it so everybody pretty much always gets their land drops, and draws gas. That is why it is my personal favorite EDH deck to play, it is always fun.

Ill give a brief description of the cards and how they interact to make the deck work.

Howling Mines (Font of Mythos, Otherworld Atlas, Kami etc.)

The backbone of the deck. This allows you to draw into your combo, and ensure land drops in a lower-count deck. This can be a double edged sword, as it can allow lower costed infinite combos to execute first, or hard ramp decks like Azusa to go nuts, but it is what I like most about the deck. People tend to ignore strong plays like mana doublers when they are drawing 5 cards a turn. Standstill is my favorite, I like to play it, put my hand face down on the table, fold my hands and say ""Take your time"" Nobody wants to be the guy who cracks Standstill.

""No Maximum Hand Size"" (Library of Leng, Venser's Journal, Graceful Adept)

These are the next most important cards next to the mines. These let you keep a full grip of cards at almost all times, ready to respond to any threat. Plus, its damaging for your opponents to see you have 20+ cards in hand. The best is Anvil of Bogarden, as it stops your opponents from discarding Eldrazi or triggering ""Whenever X is put into graveyard, shuffle your graveyard into your library"" effects. My favorite is Venser's Journal, it gains you a ton of life.  

Punishers (Iron Maiden, Back to Basics Psychosis Crawlers, Anvil of Bogarden, Mass Bounce effects)

These are the cards that are able to subtly exploit your opponent's having a large amount of cards in hand. Iron is my favorite, the damage really adds up as the game goes on. Other cards interact more subtly, for example, Back to Basics is back-breaking in the vast majority of EDH decks I see, even in mono-colored. Your opponents can't play anything if their lands don't untap, obviously. Jushi Apprentice is my favorite, it can make your opponents draw their deck when you flip him into Tomoya. 

Protection (Propaganda, Cyclonic Rift, Meishin)

This deck runs a very low number of creatures, so it requires a number of cards to protect its life total until it can combo. Evacuation and Rift Overloaded stops the onslaught. Meishin is *ridiculously* good at this, one time an opponent played a Craterhoof into a huge boardstate, I activated Tomoya in response to put 40 cards total in hand, first time I ever saw a resolved Craterhoof not win.

Clones

Pretty self explanatory, it allows blue to get creatures it wouldn't normally be able to get, take advantage of a kicked Rite of Replication when an opponent has a Kokusho on the field to pretty much win.

Ramp
Again, self explanatory. I've collected a good amount of rocks since I started playing EDH, they are pretty much blue's only way to ramp.

Mana Doublers (Caged Sun, High Tide)

These cards are insane. They are they key to infinite comboing, and utilizing the card draw engine to lead to absurdly powerful plays. They also ramp you into Omniscience and such, so if you can't infinite, you can *just* play free counterspells. I cannot stress enough how much these affect gameplay in EDH, these are the reason Disenchant variants always go into green/white decks.

Counterspells (Force of Will, Pact of Negation, Desertion)

These protect your combo most importantly, but also have a political aspect in multiplayer, stopping other infinite combos. Try to keep at least 2 in your grip, one for yourself, and another one for when the table looks to the mono blue player to stop something degenerate. Free ones are the best, but splashy ones like Desertion and Draining Whelk keep the game fun.

Combo engines (Mind Over Matter, Palinchron, BSZ)

These are the cards that win you the games, there are many, many interactions in this deck, I'll just go over the main ones.

Palinchron+Mana Doubler= Infinite mana. With this you can:
Draw you deck(BSZ, Stroke of Genius)
Make your opponent draw their deck
Steal all permanents (Memnarch)
Bounce all permanents (Capsize, Sunder+Devastation Tide)

Mind Over Matter+Nearly Everything.
Seriously, you can't trip without hitting a card that goes infinite with this, it is my favorite card in the deck, and my favorite blue card ever. Even if you can't combo, you can make tons of mana with a doubler and a land, or a Gilded Lotus, and draw a bunch of cards with Stroke of Genius to continue making mana. If, under odd circumstances, you can't do that, if you have a big grip of cards, Mind becomes the Fuck You Button. Your opponents can't attack, you can tap all their lands at upkeep, and turn off all their artifacts. This card is completely nuts, your opponents **require** Krosan Grip to beat this.

Omniscience+Enter the Infinite

The ultimate duh combo in magic. Honestly, I don't like this combo because it took years of deck building and intricate synergy and condensed into two cards a 5 year old can play. It is the IKEA furniture of magic combos, and even then, tables usually have more than 5 steps. As much as I don't like this combo, it is very powerful and wins upon execution. I could see taking this combo out in the future.

Anyway, that is basically the gist of the deck, everything else is just blue goodstuff, or hard card draw. The only thing I could do to improve it is add more expensive blue cards, currently my Force of Will is gold bordered. I would love to add some more untap land cards like Treachery and Time Spiral, as this deck plays kinda like a High Tide deck, also i would love a Misdirection. My dream cards would definitely be Mana Drain, Jace TMS, and Timetwister, as I have no plans on retiring this deck anytime soon. I hope you enjoyed this tech on my favorite EDH deck, comments, suggestions and recommendations are welcome, feel free to ask me about anything in the deck that is confusing.

Given that, I was wondering what your thoughts on this problem are! Generals, and themes, I have been considering are...

Sapling of Colfenor - I like treefolk a LOT, I like the colours, and I think some good recursion could work here.
Doran - treefolks!
Thelon of Havenwood/Ghave - I really like the idea of a fungus tribal deck. I know ghave can do loads more... But I'd want to take it tribal i think and enjoy the theme
Wrexial, the risen deep - I would use this guy for a sea monster almost HP Lovecraft theme
Lazav - subterfuge/spying theme
grimgrin - zombies tribal
wort boggart auntie - goblin tribal

Until someone played Sylvan Primodial. It got rid of some enchantments and artifacts. Quite nice. And that is when clones, cloudshifts, dead eye navigators and other blinking shennanigans hit the table.

My newest EDH creation. It can play super agro, or more like a aggroloam deck.

The general idea is to get Borborygmos to stick around and throw lands at people. 

Life from the Loam + Cycle lands can set up a brutal loam engine.

Keen Sense/Snake Umbra mean every time you throw a land you draw a card (or dredge LftL)

Furnace of Wrath/Gratuitous Violence end games.

Chord of Calling lets you play a land and bounce one back. This is sweet for Valakut, tapping, bouncing, replaying if you can play more than one land turn, or just late game to return lands with ramp spells to throw with Borborygmos.

Storm Cauldren lets you pick up all your lands to destroy someone.

Lots of ramp to get Borborygmos out early, and get lands to hand late game.

Wheel effects are key, Knollspine Dragon is an all-star, wheel of fortune and Dragon Mage are super powerful too.


I've been working on this list since Borborymos was spoiled, and I'm pretty happy with it for now. I'm thinking of adding another tutor for Ullamog, possibly in the form of Fierce Empath.

This deck is in the same vein as 99-Land Ashling and it is the stupidest deck I have ever won with (sitting on 3/0 W/L).  No small feat in the cut-throat Casual circles.  

I have exactly 2.5 win-cons (Maniac, Mortal Kombat, and if I must, attacking with 37 Shadowborn Apostles turn 7) and I have many ways of getting to them.  

--------------------------------------------
1.) Sphinx + 2 Apostles in hand + Doomsday (choosing at least 2 Apostles and 3 of whatever) + (counter magic possibly) + Lab Maniac

2.) Sphinx + A ton of Apostles in hand + Lab Maniac/Kombat

3.) Thrumming Stone + Orrery/Leyline + Apostle + Rune-Scarred Demon + Mortal Kombat EOT

4.) The all important Demonic Consultation + ""Aquus Steed"" + Lab Maniac combo

5.) Extractor Demon + Kill many Apostles + (Dark Prophecy) + Lab Maniac/Kombat

-----------------------------------------------

I have some tutors in here to search for whatever combo piece I want for whichever combo I want to do.  I've hit #1 once and #3 twice thus far.  

One reason I am sharing this is because I am very proud of how stupidly Johnny it is while also being cheap and fragile enough to make those very infrequent wins so worthwhile that you'll fall in love with EDH all over again.

Another reason is that I think I want to make it a bit faster/more consistent.  I'm thinking of taking out something (cut the mass reanimation probably? Suicide UB would be fine and more efficient) and adding in more card draw or something else to speed this deck up.  Part of me dares to try to make this even marginally competitive, and part of me wants to make Search the City work in here somehow.  Thoughts on cuts/adds?

Today I had the idea for this deck, which I call ""Hippo Police"".

Essentially it's going to be an even split between group hug and devastating removal. I'll sit there playing all of my group hug cards without doing anything threatening or removing anything at all.

That is, until someone commits a crime.

Let's say player A casts [Animar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=236504), and player B [Spell Crumples](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=237005) it. I'll ask player A ""Player A, would you like to press charges?"". If he says yes I'll hit player B with heavy removal until I feel he's taken slightly more damage from the exchange than player A did.

Where I would really appreciate some help is in finding the removal cards I need, I can't use sweepers, it has to only hurt the player that ""committed the crime"". I don't care if it's cost efficient or is considered good or not, this deck literally has no win condition, I win through the satisfaction of meting out swift justice.

The kind of removal I'm looking for are things like [Hex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=247382) or [Shattering Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=5221). Unfortunately most of them (such as these two examples) are in colors I can't play in a [Phelddagrif](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=159097) deck. If you guys could help me find some good removal in these colors that would be great. If possible I want things that can deal with more than one permanent at once (although I'm going to have to throw in some things such as [Arrest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253573) and [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=270356) purely for flavor) 

This deck doesn't respond to threats. For example, if someone casts [Door to Nothingness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=288992) I won't remove it even if I can, not until they use it and commit a crime. For this reason it doesn't make a huge difference if my removal is instant or not, only that it elicits a groan from the criminal when I play it.",,False,,t5_2scee,False,,,True,t3_1bj4u8,http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1bj4u8/deck_concept_hippo_police_suggestions_appreciated/,

Our overall deck power level is moderate, so we don't have any thirty or fourty dollar cards.

Here are some of the cards I am looking at:

* Scion of the Ur-Dragon - Five color, so finding not stupidly priced land would be difficult, but it'd be fine for a more casual environment. Also leaves a lot of room for reanimator cards with his ability.

* Darigaaz, the Igniter - His ability is decent, but I feel like you'll reach a point in the game where it's useless.

* Karrthus, Tyrant of Jund - Definitely under consideration. He's a great card.

* Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind - My concern with having him is that the deck would be less Dragon-tribal and more draw combo focused, and he really wants to go full Dragon. I assume it's best to have him in the deck if he's included at all.

Whenever I cast Bribery, my first choice in any deck is either Primeval Titan or something that'll clone one.  If I tutor for a creature, more often than not it'll be Primeval Titan.  If I have a counterspell in hand, I'll often keep it there specifically for Primeval Titan.

I want to get at least a small consensus on the card before proposing a ban of the card to my playgroup before it shifts out of standard and suddenly everyone can afford one for every deck.  Would anyone care to share their thoughts on the power/fairness of this mighty card?

targetting say saffi erikstodder and retainers with revilliark and yosei/kokusho/milera &amp; kitchen sinks combo from karmic guide --

Since Counterspells are not that great in multiplayer (I'm only playing the 'free' counters, in order to have protection from combo while tapped out), I'm looking at discard and sac effects as whole-table disruption. 

So far, I've got: 
Unnerve  
Syphon Mind  
Death Cloud  
Scythe Specter  
Syphon Flesh  
Fleshbag Marauder  
Slum Reaper  
Brine Elemental  
Diluvian Primordial  
Sepulchural Primordial  
Damnation  
Oblivion Stone

Geth's Grimoire  
Cyclonic Rift, since I can completely reset everyone's board but my own for 6U at Instant speed  
Cabal Conditioning  
Mind Swords  
Words of Waste (seems amazing with Consecrated Sphinx!)  
Necrogen Mists  
I'm seriously considering Delerium Skeins, since Blue (and Geth's Grimoire) could help me draw enough to survive the discard.  
Nevinyrral's Disk  
Smallpox  
Bane of the Living  

Does anyone know of any other cards that attack the hands or nonland permanents of all opponents or all players? I would prefer to avoid serious Land Destruction or permanent Stasis effects, because I consider that too unfun, even for a disruptive deck like this.

Sorry to beg for card help like this, but this isn't really an easy and obvious Gatherer search, and I would love to hear success stories from other people who have managed to fight the whole table at once with U or B cards!

The best samurais are obviously white and red, but there is also a green one that regenerates other samurais, and I could use green as a ramp. So the only semi viable commander would be Uril, the miststalker. I know he isn't a samurai or have any abilities that relate to them, but he is pretty good and has hexproof.

What do you guys think? Should I try and make an EDH with all the badass samurai and then throw in a crap ton of enchantments and fetch with the green or should I leave the green samurai out and focus on a red and white general, like Tajic, or Gisela, or Aurelia? Thanks for the help!

As much as I love building control decks, I've come to find that my latest builds (Borborygmos Enraged and Skullbriar) have run into a small issue:

Everyone at the table plays control. I'm talking Jhoira control (every blue counterspell in existence), Ertai ""Stasis"" (usually uses great card synergy to put the board in a hard lock late game), and my sister just built a Damia deck (which has its aggro moments but relies pretty heavily on control).

As a result, our games start off pretty political. No one attacks anyone, and everyone just sits on open land and quietly builds a board presence.

When I play Skullbriar, that really isn't possible. In the instance described above, I'm sitting on 4 creatures turn 6, a few 1/1 counters on Skullbriar, and a pretty obvious board presence. A few turns later the Ertai deck boardwipes, and I stall pretty hard for the rest of my game after Skullbriar ends up catching a Spell Crumple to the bottom of my deck.


And after a few playthroughs with Borborygmos, they've learned that if he sticks, my next play is usually Storm Cauldron, and then I just sit there with all my lands untapped waiting for someone to point their hate in my direction so I can float all my land, bounce it to my hand, and throw it at them. Creeping Renaissance follows shortly afterwards :P

As much as I WANT to play politics, my aggro decks are the Borg of the Magic world (resistance is futile, prepare to be assimilated).

I guess my question is this: **Is there any way to play aggro in a political fashion, or will I always be forced to try to overrun the table early game?** (because if I let any of the 3 decks described above get late game with open mana, I go from ""Hey, I have board presence"" to ""here, let me bait Jhoira deck's counters so you can play big things instead of me"" which isn't exactly a fun strategy)

Then Avacyn drops and suddenly I'm up to my neck in indestructible Angel tokens (because of whatever that spear is that she's holding in her picture, which he'd been swinging with on little dudes, for this exact reason) chump blocking, and a hand full of spot removal that is now useless. 

Fortunately for me I dropped Crypt Angel shortly afterward, followed by Call to the Kindred on Garza. So now our boards were roughly even, sitting at a stalemate. He attacks, block it down with Crypt Angel. He can't extend too far, because if he opened himself up just once it would be over. I can swing with 25/25 Garza all day and his indestructible shits just eat it. This goes on for a few minutes. 

Then he pops down Gideon, Champion of Justice. With a mighty, ""COME AT ME, BROS!"" Gideon +1s all the way up to 9 Loyalty, giving me a two turn clock before everything is exiled. At face value, this seems like what I want to happen... but my hopes for this are shattered as he makes another land drop, now sitting at ten.  

Unable to penetrate the line of indestructible angels and apparently unlucky enough to draw more and more damage-based removal, I had to scoop when he floated 10, ult-ed Gideon, and recast Avacyn against my now very, very naked board...

I recently returned to Magic after playing on and off. I've been playing a lot of standard lately, finally getting used to making my own decks, and I've been told I'm really adaptable. When my friends were teaching me, no matter what deck I used I usually won after 2 to 3 games. I've also played a few modern and legacy games, but they didn't appeal to me as much as standard, because the limited pool in helps me focus on ideas better. 

My LGS has recently started getting into EDH tournaments. Seeing my friends work on they're decks, i realize how interesting a format this is. Me and my best friend have decided to build the our dream list (realistic dreams, so no original Duals or Mishra's Workshop and such). 

He's running some Red/Green aggro and I've decided to go with something completely different from what I normally run. I have three fully built decks, a Tribal Angel, a Cipher/Extort, and Firemind Draw deck. 

Now to get to the point. 

I want to make the most evil, controlling Sen Triplets deck imaginable. I know EDH is a casual format, but in my meta, being a douche will not lose you friends.

I am currently facing a dilemma and would love some suggestions. (Okay, this got a little long, but I really really appreciate any guidance) So recently after finding myself opening a Lazav it has inspired me to perhaps try making another EDH deck.  Though as I started I wondered more and more into the territory of multiple fun concepts that I would like to do, and it became a giant blender of concepts.  Though I think two clear ideas hinge out.

----

**Ninjas and Mirrors:**

Commanders(?): Lasav, Vela, Oona, Wrexial, (maybe Circu) 

So more around having a lot of ninjas, clone-effects, and over all trickery.  Though of course it'll have some fun standard EDH staples, its set in the realms of U/B and all the scary things in there.  

Looking at how the theme really goes I imagine it has to be swift and dexterous with not a lot of place for patiently toying away at people.  So like the name-sake it has to be good at quick assassinations.  On the other hand it will have access to cloning which is one of my favorite things to do in any game. Unlike the following it will most likely have less ""yours is mine"" and more ""ohhh let me copy that and then destroy it.""

Fun Themes/Combos: Vela + Rite of Replication, Cipher, Vela + Color manipulation (Scuttlemut, etc.), Wonder (flying ninjas!)

* Benefits: Most likely more consistent than latter, ninjas (did I mention a oni-ninja?), two colors, possible to go voltron-ish, more tribal

* Cons: More aggressive than I would like, might be reliant on opponents (though might also be fun with all the copy effects), might garnish a lot of table-aggro

----

**Grand High Court:**

Commander: Merike ri Berit 

This is more based on my fond memories of Merieke ri Berit, and what kind of court she would hold on her dominion.  When I started adding in ninjas I just couldn't resist the idea of splashing into white.  After all, there's a bit of Mother of Runes fun that can happen, or access to a good exile.  I'm also a sucker for white because Linvala, Keeper of Silence is one of my favorite cards and I try to include it whenever I can.  Unlike the theme above this is completely based in nostalgia, but it is closer to my personal play style.  

Fun Themes/Combos: Elesh Norn + Sheoldred, Godhead of Awe, Penmin's Aura/Freed from the Real/Intruder Alarm + Merieke ri Berit, Demon/Angel Subtheme, Storm Herd, Mind Control

* Benefits: Oh so many fun mini-combinations and themes, access to defensive builds (Ghostly Prison, etc.), versatile, let's exile things

* Flaws: most likely just stuffed more of things I like rather (this single statement says a lot...I think.)  Though the format is/can be casual, one still can't help but want to maximize things. 

----

Things that kinda go in both: Serendib Sorcerer + Beguiler of Wills, Graveyard Resurrection, Cumulative Upkeep(?), Counter Spells, Temporal Extortion, Infinite Mana...for something?

----

I really don't know which one I like better.  Personally I'm very fond of both, though I only have the resources to really build one.  I don't really have a regular playgroup, and the one I am (kinda) apart of is very fond of winning.  For that reason, usually I build things centered around fun combos than anything else; since I play more for themes/interactions, it doesn't matter to me much if I win or not.

(aka What do you consider first when building a deck?),9,1,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/16rzl8/what_is_the_most_important_aspect_of_a_deck_for/,"I'm interested in seeing what r/EDH thinks is most important about a deck. Powerful sorceries? Large creatures? Mass/spot removal? Counters? Board diplomacy? Mana Ramp? Control-oriented cards? etc.

In my opinion, draw and card advantage is the most important aspect of EDH. Here's why:

100 cards is a lot for a deck. Every card in a deck should be picked for a certain purpose and in order to respond to the situations that come up during a game you need to be able to have the appropriate tool (card). If you just go around drawing one card per turn the chances of you having that tool in hand when a threat arises is very slim. Whether it is by directly tutoring for a certain card or just rolling the dice and hoping you get it by drawing more cards than each opponent, having card advantage greatly increases your chances of being able to respond to threats and keep other people from getting too far ahead.

Having draw / card advantage is also necessary if you want to keep from stalling out after a strong start to a game. The worst thing that can happen to you in a game is for your hand to get depleted and then have no way of drawing more than one card per turn. The more cards you draw per turn the more spells you can potentially play. Playing more spells inevitably advances your board position compared to opponents with inferior card advantage and pushes you towards victory. Card advantage and being able to replenish your hand also makes you incredibly resilient against board sweepers since you will be able to recover quickly. 

When I go to make a new deck the first thing that I look at is the deck's potential for card advantage. Only once I feel like I will be able to out-card-advantage my opponents do I go further into the building process and find the utility creatures / other spells that I want to play.

So r/EDH...what are the first things that all of you look for when deciding to build a new deck?

For a little while before I came back to MTG, I had a brief affair with the World of Warcraft TCG. That system had a very interesting play style: Raid Decks. 

In a fashion similar to Archenemy, several players using normal decks would cooperate against one Raid deck. The Raid deck was pre-constructed, and consisted of a half dozen boss monsters with unique effects and large health pools with handfuls of monster groups in between.

I want to see a commander-theme game mode that feels like this; a boss deck with packs of monsters and spells, separating several legendary commander ""bosses"" and, perhaps, a pumped final boss.

We've all heard of Archenemy, and I've heard of Horde EDH, but I'd like to combine aspects of the two, to simulate an old MMORPG. What do you all think? I've got a few ideas, but I'd love to hear some suggestions, or to be pointed in the right direction if something like this exists.

Update! 

I've been reading over the old WoW TCG Rules, and have started coming up with a few ideas. In short, here's how a ""raid"" deck was conducted.

Players would play against mini-bosses. These are creatures with very large health pools, and specific abilities, and are played with specific associated minions. Minibosses shared a deck of spells. Every turn, bosses would play face-down small creatures as ""resources,"" which are functionally identical to lands. They would then be able to cast spells, attack enemy heroes, etc. 

After the boss is defeated, all of their resources would be flipped and played as a wave of randomized minions.

The Final boss has a special, separate deck with more characteristic abilities. The raid is beaten when the boss creature runs out of hit points.

For a Commander variant, the raid/dungeon player would have a few piles of cards: A minion deck, nearly identical to Horde Magic, a selection of boss legendarily including a final legendary, and a deck of boss spells.

Players would play reduced-length rounds of Horde Magic, representing monster groups between bosses.

A boss round would be more similar to archenemy. The dungeon player would begin with that boss commander in play. They would need some other advantage to keep even pace with the players; I haven't decided what yet, perhaps additional turns, combat phases, mana, immunity to whipes, or the like. That boss would be defeated when the dungeon player had lost a sufficient amount of life.

A final boss would be nearly identical to the above, but the dungeon player would get steeper advantages, whether they be more life, more draw steps, or some other mechanic.

The challenge of this variant format would be to test players to stretch their life totals. Horde-magic breaking spells wouldn't be as effective against bosses. Quick combo engines would leave players exposed to later fights. Losing a commander too many times may make playing them impossible by the last round. Thoughts?

I'd prefer thematically linked boss choices, sharing at least 1 or 2 colors. For example, Grixis, featuring Crosis, Bolas, Sedris, Thraximundar, and the like.",,False,,t5_2scee,1358117908.0,,RGWS,True,t3_16gxux,http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/16gxux/lets_talk_cooperative_commander/,

* 2) Use the lowest price of a card ie: the commander solemn is 2.5 tics, the M11 Solemn is .5 tics.

And those are them. On January 13th from noon-8Pm (probably later) I will be streaming a host of ten ticket decks and would love more community involvement! So come join!

After getting in about a week a foil niv-mizzet (izzet vs golgari), a chinese dracogenius, and the prerelease promo of hypersonic dragon, I felt the calling to make a U/R EDH deck, the color combination that is my favorite, but one that I actually never built.  I didn't want to use the original Niz Mizzet as the general, to remove any doubt that I'm not playing the infinite-damage combo, so Dracogenius steps up to the plate.

It's a pretty simple concept, one that strikes at the root of my inner Timmy.  Aside from a few tricks here and there, the deck has 3 types of cards: mana, card draw, and dragons.  Mana to cast dragons, card draw to draw more dragons to cast, and dragons.  Cause dragons.

I got to play it this past Sunday for the first time, and it actually worked rather satisfyingly.  Since Dragons are typically pretty scary on their own, you rarely had to walk into too many sweeps, and one single-handedly could do it's fair share of damage...not to mention late-game shenanigans with the Dracogenius himself.

Probably the funnest play of the day, a guy who had been trading haymakers with me all game managed to get Anger in the yard, and threw down a Sheoldred, and attacked right into me.  I had a Belbe's Portal out, but an empty hand, so I popped mind stone, drew the classic Shivan Dragon, flashed him into play, and pumped 1 to trade.  Felt good.

Anyways, hope you guys enjoy, I've had a fun time playing with it, and look forward to tweaking it some more.",,False,,t5_2scee,False,,,True,t3_165ddl,http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/165ddl/here_there_be_dragons/,

I appreciate it. For anyone who cares, Elesh Norn and some Shock Lands were added, along with Karmic Guide and some other things. 


I'm back again to ask for sagely advice on Jhoira since I have a very limited knowledge of MTG. I'd appreciate it if you guys would be brutally honest in your opinions. 

Testing out the new Jenara deck though I ran into 2 or 3 things in my meta that didn't sit right with my stomach:

 First, getting hit with Kiki Jiki + Pestermite after the whole ""No infinite combo"" things. 

Then an infinite turn lock by the same player and no one bats an eye. 

The final rule...and the one that people told me I wasn't allowed to break: Mass Land Destruction. No less than 3 times playing against Zur the Enchanter were all my lands blown up as Jenara (I wasn't even aware Zur could do this but apparently it happened). Again, no one complains.

Now I feel cheated. I got rid of Jhoira, my first and favorite EDH deck, because everyone instantly hated me out of the table and despite my best efforts to be nice about playing her (If you read my Jenara thread, you'll know I don't typically play Magic. I was very on and off and Suspend was a cool mechanic I just happened to really love. I didn't know playing the only real suspend general would get me all the hate in the world)... everything I was told was thrown in my face.


Here is the current iteration of my Jhoira deck: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/1st-edh-deck-jhoira/


**The Problem**

The question becomes now which road do I take? Do I go all in with Mass Land Destruction and just be the asshole who plays this deck if people are going to go ""High Power"" and I'll just use Jenara when they're willing to be nice? Or do I try my best to make the deck powerful without going all in?


**Issues with the Deck at the Moment**


I have very little experience with this iteration of the deck (I do not yet own all the cards for it...surprisingly most of them being cheap commons. The expensive stuff I already have) but generally my deck struggles early on. Either I get run over by aggressive threats before anything I have can hit the board or I have a really fast start in ramping but I have no threats to suspend. 

I assumed that the best way to answer this was to stack my deck with cards like Ponder, etc. to try to get cheap card draw and filter to dig for threats. What other cards can you guys suggest to accomplish this? What should I cut for them?

This deck currently just replicates a ton of turns and beats people down with one fatty until nothing remains. It's consistency in winning is entirely dependent on how long I last. Usually if I can live about 10+ turns around the board, I win. I don't usually get that far though...basically it feels too slow without using MLD. Is it possible to be stronger without it?


**Creatures: Am I even playing the right ones?**

Tidespout Tyrant has consistently been mediocre for me for almost a year and a half. Am I not using him correctly?

I keep hearing Bogardan Hellkite is a card I should be playing but I'm not.

Kiki Jiki has always been a card I felt I should be playing but the whole stigma that comes with him is something my group hates. There is someone at the table who is now regularly playing him and again... no one bats any eye. If we're going down the ""I'm going to be a dick"" route, do I grab him?


**If I'm going Mass LD...**

Which ones do I play? How many?


**On Manabase**

I don't think I need to change anything here. I've almost never had any issues paying for anything. If you feel an Artifact or Utility Land is necessary for this deck to be viable, please suggest.


**On the issue of $$$...**

I don't have unlimited funds, as with Jenara. I'd like to try to keep the cost of things down around $50~70 to improve this one as well however if there is something that I should definitely be playing, regardless of price, let me know. I'll add it to a wish list and try to grab it further down the line. 

This deck has been revised so many times that I'm simply sick of having it be ""lackluster."" I personally have fun with this deck even if others may or may not. That said, it feels like I'm the weakest player at the table anymore due to the speed at which I'm eliminated. If it's possible to not be a dick and still compete, that's for the best. If it's necessary to be a dick to get to use Jhoira, so be it.

Perhaps it is best to just have a transformational sideboard so I can go from being ""Nice"" to ""Jerkface"" depending on how people want to play it.

So, I've been wanting to make this deck for a while now. I've been putting it off as too janky as I'm normally a spike. However, my inner Timmy comes out when it comes to Demons and I really, really wanted to build this deck. I want to keep the flavour there while still trying to make it as good as possible. I also didn't want to run a typical mono-black general as Shelly, Geth, Oona and Mikaeus draw a lot of hate. No one cares about Endrek, Master Breeder... worshiper of Demons! I thought out of all the other monob generals his Thrulls would fit perfect with the sacrifice clauses of big demons, black sacrifice artifacts and for Skullclamp targets.

I don't feel that going B/R gives enough to justify it. I'd love to hear what people think about this though. I obviously may be wrong here as I'm still somewhat new to the format and don't have the knowledge of cards that some players do. It's mostly for Multiplayer and not 1v1. Group has a mix of competitive players to casual players and proxies are 100% allowed. I didn't want to run Imperial Seal because it's just too good to proxy - I also wouldn't mind fully buying this deck if I enjoy it. But suggest things even if they are expensive!

I'd love to hear some criticisms or feedback on it. I feel that as of right now it's too creature heavy and there isn't enough support spells. But, as a newer EDH player I'm not sure what cards I ought to be looking at. I don't want it the deck to be too oppressive as I'd like to play it out and I really felt like winning I'd pull out Tesya and go infinite.

I'm not sure if I have too much ramp, or too little as I've never done mono-black before. Is there anything I'm seriously missing, or anything that is severely bad that I am running?

Long post incoming! I'm looking for some advice on how to revise my Jenara EDH deck for when I meet up with a bunch of friends next month to play several EDH games.  I'm hoping Reddit can give me some awesome advice like it has in the past and try to help me make the deck better on a budget. 

**I'm trying to improve this deck as much as possible with a $70 budget**

**About Me and my Playgroup**

I'm not a regular Magic player. I played a little when I was in middle school for a few months, again in high school and college on and off for a few months. Basically, I never really stuck with the game so my collection isn't very large for cards and having played other CCGs competitively, I know that competitive play is a lot of money so if you want the best, you have to pay a lot. I was drawn to EDH because I loved multiplayer formats in other CCGs and this was a way to play with my MTG friends and have a lot of fun in a social way with them. That said, they're all very competitive so striking a balance of competitive and fun is key for me. Mass Land D and Infinite Combos are probably out but there are still some pretty powerful and expensive cards flying about in my meta.

Commanders I'm usually playing against include Zur, Kamahl Fist of Krosa, Maelstrom Wanderer, Riku, Drana, Azami, Edric, Sedris, Azusa, and occasionally my own Jhoira deck used against me.

**Cards I'd Like to Keep that I Realize may be underwhelming**

*Avacyn, Angel of Hope* - Wrath effects are very heavy in my meta. Tutoring her or podding into her gives me a lot of stability versus the craziness of my metagame. I also just really love this card

*Iona, Shield of Emeria* - Usually grabbed via Tooth &amp; Nail late game. Monocolor is usually 1 or 2 players at my table. This is half for politics and half for winning games. Everyone knows I can grab this thing at will and shut them down if they cross me so simply having the ability to play it makes some of the harsher players at the table respect me.

*Yosei, the Morning Star* - Mainly a defensive tool that has won me several games as tapping someone down usually allows for the rest of the table to sweep them, if I don't myself.

**Cards I'm Considering Cutting**

*True Conviction* - It doesn't seem to do much unless I'm sitting on Jenara with a sword. Very rarely do I actually get any benefit from it but I recognize it's pretty good... I just think there's gotta be something better than this card.

*Aura Shards* - I don't think I've ever actually got the effect off more than once a game but I recognize that Artifact/Enchantment removal is good and that it is reusable. It is a dead draw early and late game, everyone instantly wants you dead for playing it and it gets countered/removed almost immediately.

*Day of Judgment* -  I play too many Wrath effects I feel. This is the worst one.

*Trygon Predator* - Artifact removal. It has no synergy with the deck other than it's colors.

*Dauntless Escort* - Friends talked me into this cause it has synergy with Sun Titan...but what doesn't? Super underwhelming middle and late game as I can easily get Avacyn, making him redundant. 

*Mystic Snake* - He's strong...but is he better than Restoration Angel? I really need help with this one guys.


**Cards I wanted to add**

1 or 2 larger late game creatures simply because I find that unless I win super early (doesn't happen in a 5 or 6 person game usually) I don't have enough power houses besides Avacyn to stand up to the rest of the table. These include...

*Ulamog/Kozilek/Blightsteel* -I own the Eldrazi Titans &amp; Blightsteel from my Jhoira deck but I feel their synergy with this deck is ZERO so I haven't bothered. If you feel otherwise, let me know if you'd play them and why.

*Elesh Norn* - I keep hearing how amazing this card is but friends keep saying it's garbage for my deck. I personally feel Elesh Norn would be fantastic for me as I have a lot of cheap creatures and most of the utility creatures in my play group are 2 or less toughness. Can someone explain why this creature is worth playing? More than any other creature on this list, I feel I should be playing Elesh Norn.

*Akroma, Angel of Wrath* - Saw people on MTGSalvation are playing it. Seems really strong but is she really that good? I don't want to cut Avacyn for her and they feel like they overlap.

*Angel of Serenity* - I keep hearing to play this over Elesh Norn. I can't deny the card reads amazing but it's more than 1/3rd of my budget and I feel I can get more value than just picking up Angel.

As for other cards...

*Restoration Angel* - Considering replacing Mystic Snake with this. Has a lot of synergy with the deck. Friends saying having the counterspell is more useful though. Very on the fence about this.

*Coiling Oracle* - I played it once. I don't dislike it but... what do I cut for it?

*Ixidron* - Something I saw on MTGSalvation. Seems powerful for the same reasons as Elesh Norn. I want to cut down on Wrath effects while still having answers to problems and perhaps this is good.

*Karmic Guide* - Feels like the best card I'm not playing but it's a $10 price point which is a chunk of my budget. Worth the investment?

*Gilded Drake* - Second best card I'm not playing it seems. It's about 1/3rd my budget but if it's THAT amazing, I'm willing to sink the $$$ on it. Is it worth getting this over a lot of other stuff?

*Detention Sphere* - Seems like a no brainer but it eats up about $5~7. Is this a for sure in or is there something better?

*Bribery* - See Gilded Drake/Karmic Guide

*Wood Elves* - My mana base can best be described as ""Average"" or ""Mediocre"". . . this just makes things easier on me it seems. I don't see a reason to not run it...what would you cut though for it?

*Chromatic Lantern* - The Fix for my crappy mana base...

*Time Warp and other extra turn cards* - I have all of them from my Jhoira deck. I don't really feel they fit here too well as my Jhoira deck has ways to stack 3+ of these effortlessly giving me maximum value for them. I'd love to hear your experiences with these in this deck.

**My Manabase**

I know there will be people who suggest I get no new creatures/spells/artifacts/etc. and just focus on land. Is it worth it to spend most of my budget to just go for straight lands rather than power cards? I'd like to do a mix of both lands and other cards if I can help it. I realize I need better lands but for the cost of 1 to 2 lands, I can basically get 3 or 4 of the other cards on this list. In the case of original dual lands it seems that I could buy everything else on this damn list.

**Anything else?**

So what do you think Reddit? What would you cut/add to my list? Is there something here I'm not playing that you think I should be? I'd love to hear lots of opinions as I don't have a whole lot of experience as I said earlier. That said, new is a lot of fun to me but at the same time I don't wish to be the weakest player at the table (I'm not saying I am now but there are those that are still consistently stronger).",,False,,t5_2scee,1352500690.0,,URS,True,t3_12xpam,http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/12xpam/my_jenara_edh_deck_looking_for_advice_and_to_have/,

Some have been playing for 8+ years, and aren't phased by dropping the cash for a JTMS (dat money... I couldn't do that) and some just took swamps out of their memnarch edh after some rule explaining. I was the one to really get the group together, and I was also new at edh at the time. I fostered the mentality of sit and build, and let everyone play out their decks. Nowadays, I'm not sure I like the atmosphere that became established, being ignorant of the idea of swinging before turn 6, (let alone winning that early) or making enemies/allies or any political moves at all because it sets you up to get boned by others. If one person DOES happen to piece together something early on, no one has any way of dealing with it. After making passive decks like Zedruu and Rubinia, and late game one turn kills like Animar, I decided to make a goblin deck to force people to learn that it is important to have answers for things. Yesterday I played with a new group of people, and I won the first game with them by turn 6 due to none of them having answers to my board. 

IMO, the best position for EDH is in a group of 4-6, everyone playing varying decks that range over all the colors, with decks that work at different paces, and many with some minimum amount of answers in case someone gets too out of control. People shouldn't get butthurt at things like pre turn 8 non infinite wins, but should reserve the right to be wary of playing with mass LD, turn 2-3 eldrazi, infect, 2 card easy infinites, and other such abusive mechanics. I think there is a balance to be struck between fun hugging and absolute spike aggression, and the game can get very stale at either extreme of the spectrum, and also that politics is a huge part of the format that should be embraced.",,False,,t5_2scee,False,,URGS,True,t3_11mvnx,http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/11mvnx/what_is_your_play_group_like_what_do_you_think_is/,

A discussion.,9,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1euda5/how_do_you_grixis_a_discussion/,"Grixis is one of the most under-represented color combinations out there at the moment, and I'd to open a discussion on how to best capitalize on those three colors in EDH. When you first look at Grixis colors, what you find is that the commander pool is a bit limited. The only 'wow' power comes from the two Legendary creatures found in the Alara block, and the origins of our formats name, Nicol Bolas. Unfortunately, all of these generals are a bit expensive, so unless we're running a strong reanimation theme, or some serious artifact ramp, you'll most likely only play them once or twice. Thraximundar, and Sedris, the Traitor King, while both present interesting options and interactions, have also proven to not be quite so essential to your decks tech, and rely mostly on the 99. Still, many of the Grixis generals have their uses. From Tetsu Umezawa to Lord of Tresserhorn you find there are plenty of generals to choose from, the trick is focusing on finding their specific synergies. 

Grixis presents a strong base to create a blink/ETB type of deck. Sedris lends himself mostly to this, with cards available like Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker, Deadeye Navigator, Conjurer's Closet, and the various reanimation spells, it promises to be very strong, playing similarly to Riku, or Bant blink. These kinds of decks tend to be strong, but generally fall into a Deadeye Palinchron combo. Easy enough to win with enough protection, and access to instant kill spells such as Comet Storm and Exsanguinate.

Alternitavely, these colors also provide incredible access to stax type effects. Smokestack, Tanglewire, Thraximundar, Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker, Price of Glory, Tectonic Instability, Pendrell Mists the list goes on and on. This would require a strong mana rock game, as stax tends to keep everyone dry on mana. Sol Ring, Mana Crypt, Mana Vault, Gilded Lotus the signets, all of these are your friends in this type of situation. Plus access to counterspell's and and spot removal will further your game plan.

Or you could go for a control build. A focus on denying your opponents resources while capitalizing your own. Almost any of the legendary creatures could be used for this type of build, but I'd recommend Nicol Bolas. Played right, you can slow the game down enough for him to come out, and decimate an opponents hand and life total. These decks will be very reactive, and will require you to prioritize your counter spells. It's an important skill for any blue player to learn what spells actually need countering. What hinders your game plan? What pushes your opponents closer to their win condition? As always, free counterspells are a massive source of value. Force of Will, Pact of Negation, Commandeer and many of their ilk will help you out. I'd also recommend counterspells that are hard to interact with. Time Stop is the ultimate no. Last Word and Counterflux have that beautiful line of text, ""Can't be countered."" Counterspells attached to creatures are also very difficult to deal with since there is no casting involved. Morph creatures such as Voidmage Prodigy and Voidmage Apprentice are great since morph doesn't even use the stack. Glen Elendra Archmage is persistent and forces everyone to think twice about what their playing. Deadeye again rears his head here, as he can fetch back your spells with Archeomancer and create a lock down with Draining Whelk. 

Any way you decide to build it, Grixis has powerful options. Strong Generals, and some of the best removal available. I'd like to hear from you guys and maybe see some archetypes I didn't cover, or success stories involving your decks. I may cover more color combinations in the future if discussions like this prove popular. Here from you all soon! and take care.

The card I've chosen for the first post is a unique artifact from the Mirrodin block, the Tower of Calamities.  

Sure, it only costs 4 to put on the field, but tapping it is a different story.  It costs a whopping 8 mana...  For what?  12 damage to any target creature.  This can be useful for getting rid of big nasty creatures, either by depleting their defense with it during a block, or on a creature that has 12 toughness or less.   With it's high mana cost I can only see it being good in a ramp deck, with spells like Boundless Realms for mega-ramping extra mana you won't need every step.

I will be doing more in the future if you guys like this. I also posted this to /r/magictcg, but this is a more fitting community I think.

**Introduction:**

[Borborygmos Enraged](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366283) is one of the most interesting generals around. It allows you to play a very different game, and there are many different ways to build around him. For this primer, we will be focusing on a combo-centric build.

This build is for you if you:

* Enjoy complicated, math heavy combo strategy that can win in one turn
* Enjoy table politic

This build is not for you if you:

* Enjoy casting creatures and attacking
* Enjoy having answers to everything
* Dislike fragile combo
 
[**Sample decklist**](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/edh-borborygmos-enraged-2/)

**The combo:**

* Step 1. get lands into play
* Step 2. get lands in play into your hand
* Step 3. use our general to kill the opponents

There are many ways to accomplish these 3 steps. 

**How to play this deck:**

* Avoid becoming the target at ALL COST. I can not stress how important this is. This deck will not survive the onslaught if it becomes the target. You have very little answers and very little ways to bounce back. This is where your political skills come into play. You need to constantly assess your perceived threat level and make plays accordingly. It's usually correct in the early game to try and balance the overall strength of your opponents so that they spend their resources fighting each other. Remember, the less your opponents' life totals are, the easier it is to kill them in one turn. This means that you should give a land to a mana screwed opponent with [Fertilid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=247335), or use [Wheel of Fortune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=202558) even if it means that you don't get the most value. You should try to feint weakness throughout the game. Sometimes it's best to not do anything even if you have a play. You should avoid making obviously powerful plays that does not cripple the opponents or win the game immediately. 

 
* In the early stage of the game, you should focus on setting up mana. Get as much lands into play as possible without getting everyone's attention(Again, very important). Clear the board with [Starstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=41167), [Comet Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=247539) and [Chain Reaction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=247538) when necessary. And by necessary, I mean the last possible moment. There isn't a lot of answers in this deck, so you should try to get your opponents to answer the threat for you. Don't cast your wraths if there's a control player who just drew 5 cards.
* The middle stage is where proactive decks try to take over the game with overwhelming board presence and card advantage. Try to stop them when necessary, but don't spend too much of your resources in doing so. Proactive decks like [Riku of Two Reflections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=236469) and [Maelstrom Wanderer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=338447) are some of the easiest for us to kill, as they have very little way to interact with our combo, and their life total will often be very low by being the threat. Let these decks cripple or kill the control decks for us. Focus on setting up the combo in this stage. Find key cards with [Planar Portal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=45486) and [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=194972). Draw as many cards as possible. 

* The late game is where we kill! After we assemble the combo, wait for an opportunity. This is a very important skill for combo players to have, but it's hard to explain properly. Sometimes it's correct to wait until you are absolutely sure the opponents can't react, sometimes it's OK to just go for it. It depends on the situation. Also, don't be lazy, do the math before you combo!

*  Step 2 and 3 of our combo should all happen in one turn. So cards like [Mana Flare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=159264), [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=159264), [Mana Reflection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=146750) and [Rude Awakening](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=202281) are needed in order to get the necessary mana. You should try to play these cards in the same turn you go off, in order to avoid sorcery speed answers from your opponents. There are a two ways to accomplish step 2: [Storm Cauldron] (http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=25663), or [Greater Gargadon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=111048) / [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=146593) + [Praetor's counsel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=214034) / [Creeping Renaissance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=245198). Don't forget to consider the damage from [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=190400) if you are going off with [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=146593), and the 9 hasty attack if you are going off with [Greater Gargadon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=111048). Step 3 is to play our general and use the lands we get from step 2 to kill our opponents. The following cards can be used to effectively double the amount of ammo you have: [Furnace of Rath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=205268), [Illusionist's Bracers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366426) and [Chandra, the Firebrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=259205) -2, [Reiterate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=109729), [Increasing Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=262661) on [Praetor's counsel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=214034) / [Creeping Renaissance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=245198).

The Commander - Eight-and-a-Half Tails:

This guy is a total house.  You don't want to put him out onto the battlefield until you have the mana open to be able to protect him OR you want to get him out early before the other guys start drawing extra removal.  It's up to you and how you feel the game is going.  He is innocuous enough to avoid a lot of hate and his abilities make him resilient to all but the most determined of removal.  The big pillowfort enchantments and planeswalkers end up being surprisingly long lasting with your General blocking threats.  Feel free to ask specific questions on the interactions he has with just about anything that hits the stack.


Interesting cards and my thought process behind them:

[Palisade Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253567) - She's fantastic with my Eight-and-a-Half Tails (Especially against Voltron) and she's even better when I can tutor for Darksteel Plate

[Reverse the Sands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=79125) - This is a fantastic political card and, when used properly, can completely turn the game around in your favor.  It's beautiful.

[Debt of Loyalty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=4573) - The amount of wipes in my local meta is pretty heavy, and this card lets White be tricky in ways usually attributed to Blue.

[Sudden Disappearance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=262865) + [Sundial of the Infinite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=228118) - These two cards are only in this deck specifically for the interaction they each have with the other.  Via some interesting stack interactions, if I vanish my opponents field and then activate Sundial ~~my end phase never rolls around~~ in response to the trigger at the beginning of my end phase, Sundial wipes the stack and those permanents remain exiled.  Someone else mentioned this combo in a thread a few weeks ago, and I have stolen it because it is fantastically awesome.

Anyways, feel free to add input and critique/question my card choices!

Edit: Fixed description of Sundial interaction, credit to /u/Dunderpunch and /u/Mahsvector for helping clarify that for me.

Edit 2: Added a bit on the General.

Note: I tend to avoid ridiculously powerful decks as my playgroup doesn't care for them (and neither do I, but that's a conversation for another time).

important for me: 

* Everyone should have the same space for his/her cards 

* you should be able to see what every other person is playing. 

* cupholders should be UNDER the table and slide out -&gt; no space to waste!

* The middle should be reserved for stuff like generals. Also it won't hurt to keep it free, since noone wants to play on a triangle anyway ...

* The table should be foldable, most likely it will fold upwards, so the playing field is inside.

The 2 pictures in the album show quite nice poker-tables that could work well. 

I am still unsure if the 6-corner solution would be the best, because there would be over 50cm distance between the players when looking over to the other side.

Zombies is when we play a free-for-all game, if you kill someone (or do the last point of damage to a player before they kill themselves) they are set to 10 life and are under your control

In the usual EDH fasion the player in the weakest possion is left alone and the person with the most powerful deck is looked at as a very valuable Zombie indeed.

You see people not attacking the player who is wide open because they can't do a killing blow and the player going next well get the kill.

We've seen people bearly escape a death by a percectly timed unsummon and then proceed to die to a lightning bolt from a third party and the table explode in ""No way!""' and ""OOOOOOOH!""

The most amazing part to me is the fact that someone made a zombie holds no animosity but rather they imediatly show their hand to their Master and ask ""Who should I do this to?""

For a long time I've been goofing around with different commanders/color combos looking for:

* Lots of recursion, engine type stuff.
* No infinite combo, but with strong synergies (to the point of almost broken, but i want people to be able to respond to the deck. non-interactive not cool)
* Ideally the commander isn't an afterthought

Finally I came upon bant colors and so I'm playing [Jenara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=180605) good stuff blink with [mirari's wake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=35057), [future sight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=39628), [alchemist's refuge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=240194) and [seedborn muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=129722) as the go over the top win condition. Another strong feature is a couple blink targets, [parrallax wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=22028) and [venser, the sojourner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=212240).

I love the deck. It's everything broken I love doing in cube, without being combo per say. It's a pleasure to play and it wins even big multiplayer games on mtgo way too often. 

What I don't like that Jenara is just an afterthought (a crazily threatening one though, especially with ramp and mana doublers). Also, it's too generic. I really like flavorful and obscure cards...

I was hoping the community of /r/edh could point me to a general with a cool powerful engine that's not as generic as the goodstuff blink plan. I really enjoy working hard to put the engine together (see the future-sight-seedborn-flash hot mess above).
If there's some route to go down that features a lot of recursion while avoiding too much goodstuff, that would be ideal.

oh, i've looked into the artifact esper route but there are just too many oops i win infinite combos going on for my taste...and sen triplets/sharum are too overused/hated to interest me...

tl;dr - i'm looking for a powerful engine that isn't infinite combo that people can interact with but at the same time will take over the game if left unchecked, ideally using the general.

The idea is to storm out a win with Ignite Memories or Sphinx-Bone Wand, with Mind's Desire and Epic Experiment to make the kill more likely.  Grapeshot at low life totals, Insurrection, Young Pyromancer, and Empty the Warrens are backup kills.  The rest of the deck is built to survive, manipulate the top of the library for Melek advantage, recur powerful spells, and look for specific pieces/protection.

1373974764.0,6,self.EDH,1ieocc,"Geth, Lord of the Vault",8,2,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1ieocc/geth_lord_of_the_vault/,"http://www.mtgdeckbuilder.net/Decks/ViewDeck/748889

Hey all, posting my Geth deck list to see what you guys think, and to sort of do a deck-tech type thing. I'm no master of EDH, but I think this one is alright. At the very least, I have won with it a lot, and each time was fun, interesting, and different. Just like I think EDH should be. 

The deck does trip over itself on occasion, but it usually does one of two things. It either overruns the board with recurring creatures that all power each other up, or completely drains my opponent's decks in a matter of turns. There are a few ""infinite"" combos in the deck, but as per my group rule, no two card combos. 

The only other rule we have is no excessive tutoring. I try to limit all my black decks to just Demonic Tutor, Vampiric Tutor, and Liliana Vess.

Now, on to the actual deck if I can stop rambling on!

*Geth, Lord of the Vault* is a pretty awesome commander for me. A good 50-60% of my playgroup uses their own graveyards as resources, and quite heavily. When I was looking at Legendary creatures for ideas, Geth made me chuckle a little bit. I figured I'll use their graveyard as a resource too! It turns out I can also use Geth politically, helping an opponent that wants his graveyard full or helping the Mimeoplasm player get some extra fuel from across the entire table. 

One of the main ideas I had when I was building it was to not rely on my own graveyard too much, in case of Relic of Progenitus or Leyline of the Void. But Zombies like their graveyards, so I still play out of it quite a bit. Geth being a zombie was partially why I wanted a zombo sub-theme, but It's mostly because of Mikaeus! Oh sweet lordy is Mikaeus one of my favorite Magic cards of all time. He is the centerpiece of a few combos, as well as just being awesome.

**Some of the combos**

To win the game, all you'll need is to assemble Mikaeus, Triskellion, and any sacrifice outlet. Pretty common combo, but at least mildly hard to interrupt. Just ping everyone to death with a recurring Triskellion. On this note, I need more sac outlets. Alter of Dementia is good for what I'm going for, but I definitely need more. Suggestions?

INFINITE MANAZ
This one is a little silly, requiring a very specific board state.
You need: 6 lands. Urborg, Cabal Coffers, Deserted Temple, and three swamps/other lands. You also need Rings of Brighthearth. Pretty unlikely, but with infinite black mana, you can pretty much totally mill out an entire deck with Geth if it has enough creatures in it. Because of this combo, I took out Exsanguinate and Consume Spirit. It's just a really anti-climactic way to win. 

Now, although infinite mana is unlikely, you can make a TREMENDOUS amount of mana with this deck. Cabal Coffers, and copying it with Vesuva and thespians stage makes for all that mana you should need for a turn.
Thinking of adding stuff like Crypt Ghast or Nirkana Revenant, but I can't make any cuts. 

So what are we going to do with all this mana? Well, we can pump out zombies, pump up creatures, steal things with Geth, blow up lands with Helldozer, repeatedly sack undying/persist creatures to get neat effects and suck off their counters with Hex Parasite.

For another combo, try getting three counters on Bloodchief Ascension with a mindcrank out. 


Things I want to do with this deck:
Add a discard sub-theme to help slow my opponents down. I don't know the best cards for this type of thing though.

Add more sac outlets. Creatures or artifacts, doesen't matter.

Add a few alternate win conditions

And finally, add MOAR POWER.

Let me know what you guys think. Thanks.

How about color split?  An even five color deck requires so much mana fixing that it will struggle to be consistent.  Green gets a lot of focus for being the mana fixing color.  How do you balance the deck?

Is being five color enough of a drawback to make slivers not OP, or are they generally unfair to play?

Do you play standard tribe support like Coat of Arms and Changelings, or do you rely solely on the Slivers?

New Slivers vs old?  Does the ""All Slivers"" vs ""All Slivers you control"" mean an EDH deck should focus very heavily on new slivers to avoid mirror matches that give your opponent too much?

I'd like some help choosing between some big scary creatures and all for my Olivia deck.,9,2,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1hvc2t/99_slots_just_isnt_enough_id_like_some_help/,"So, firstly, here is my most recent rendition of the deck. 

http://www.mtgdeckbuilder.net/Decks/ViewDeck/729487

I'll try to explain my card choices and what they are based upon, and this may be a long read, but I'll try to keep it interesting. I'm also going to explain my meta, so that maybe you can come up with some good cards for specific situations. 

The decks I play against most often are:

*Super-Dredge Kerador, Ghost Chieftain
*Voroniclex, Lord of Being Annoying and Playing Large Creatures
*Scion of the Mana Ramp into Scary Dragons
*The Mimeoplasm, by douche with a lot of money
*Skullbriar, The Walking Grave by a guy that is actually pretty bad at magic

And sometimes that angel lady that brings dragons and demons into play or whatever. I forget. He doesn't show up that often.

As a playgroup, we can get pretty competitive, and almost all of us have acess to the really high-power cards of the format, but that said we wanna have fun too, and not all die to a turn 3 combo that kills everyone. It's an unwritten rule that our infinites should be minimal, and we should be able to see them coming to have a chance to stop them. 

What I want the deck to do is pretty obvious, have a lot of mana to throw into Olivia or another mana-sink, or exansguinate for a million. There are a few combos too, but I don't find those so much fun so I may take them out.

I'd like to talk about my land base first. I tried to put in the best duals, and minimize lands coming into play tapped. For this reason I'm thinking of cutting Leechridden Swamp, since it doesn't seem to do enough. Although, I'm worried I don't have enough red sources to go without some of the other dual-lands. I need this deck to be fast to beat out Skullbriar (sort of ) and Scion. Once I get Olivia on board it seems to make others afraid to play their commanders, which is great. I think the best I can do is T1 land, sol ring, greaves, T2 land, Olivia, fuck shit up, become public enemy #1. 

Apart from wanting a fast mana base, I think I need more swamps for Nirkana Revenant, and possible Crypt Ghast and Magus of the Coffers. I think big mana is really important in this deck, so I'm not too worried about going overboard with the extra mana effects. However, I'm not sure 37 is the right number. My logic is if all of them are producing extra, I'd certainly rather draw a spell than a land. But I'd also rather not have to mulligan a lot.

On to my Creatures. I pull my hair out trying to figure out the best stuff for this deck. It should absolutely be close to tribal, but since Olivia can turn my other creatures into vampires, it doesn't seem that important. Sheoldred and Urabrask seem way too good to cut. And honestly, I may actually want to go up a few creatures, but I don't know what would be great versus just pretty okay. They definitely need to make an immediate impact. Some of my candidates for creatures slots are:
**Grave Titan**
*Poops out tokens, has deathtouch. Seems awesome if I just need to overwhelm opponents with little dudes*
**Massacre Wurm**
*Talk about immediate impact when he hits the board! Not only that, his other ability is pretty beneficial to me too. I have lots of stuff that makes opponents creatures die, seems like a good way to drain them. However, -2/-2 doesn't seem to be a wipe in EDH. Maybe some mana dudes, but mehhh*
**Desecration Demon**
*I love the flavor of this guy, fits in with the theme of opponents sacrificing for sure. Plus, he's huge and has wings*
**Vampire Nighthawk** 
*I just can't cut another card it seems. I really think he should be in here though*
**Geth, Lord of the Vault**
*WOAH, why isn't he already in here? I must be retarded*

Some creatures I'm contemplating trimming:
**Stuffy Doll**
*Basically the idea is to just have a way to directly assault a player with all that extra mana and Olivia. No way to choose a new player once the first one dies though, so maybe not worth it. Seems neat though*
**Baron Sengir**
As awesome as he is, there might just be a better creature to go in his slot. This would be a tough cut. I love my Baron*
**Filth**
*Maybe if I ran stuff like Entomb, and more graveyard-oriented cards, he would be awesome. But it seems like a rarity that he ever gets where I need him to go; the graveyard. I have to say though, running both Blanket of Night and Urborg make him seem like a solid fit*
**Mirri the Cursed**
*One of my favorite vampires, but is competing with Olivia as a turn 4 drop. And unlike Drana, Skeletal Vampire, and Nirkana Revenent, nothing to dump all my mana into.*

I'm sure I'm missing some great creatures or vampires, be sure to let me know. I'd really just like more more more mana sinks that give me a huge advantage.

**SPELLS**
Keeping the X costing spells for sure. Profane command is one of my top 10 cards in the deck, Exsanguinate is a win condition, and Black Sun is an amazing board sweep (especially against skullbriar, lol!). My other slots are very much up fro fixing. Sorin's Vengeance seems fun, and works well with a lot of my big life drop cards, but in EDH, without the other pieces of a combo it's nearly useless. 

Looking through my deck makes me realize I'm silly for not including diabolic revalation, but my other tutors seems solid. I'd love an Imperial Seal though if someone needs some good hookin'. (joke)
I've thought about beseech the queen, but I'm not so sure it's as good as any of my other more costly options. 

I tried to keep all my removal sacrifice effects, mostly because I don't usually have to deal with a lot of tokens or anything, and everyone has a way of giving their big guy hexproof or shroud. Maybe some targeted stuff would be good, but I don't know what a good balance would be honestly. 

I haven't played magic enough to know about the best enchantments and artifacts, but these look okay. Going to take out either Sanguine Bond or Exquisite Blood and keep the other. Which one should I keep? Wound Reflection is a CRAZY enchantment for this deck. Once it hits the table, I'm confident I can win in the next few turns. Mana flare is iffy since it helps out others, but that's kind of fun in itself. Plus, I'm running out of options for big mana.

Maybe I should have a lashwrithe or demonspine whip? Both seem good.

I love this deck a bunch.  However, my problem has been with Mono-G/UG Ramp and other similar decks.  This deck is very slow but explosive at the end, and the combos in it are veeeeery prone to disruption.  This is by design because I want a somewhat more ""pure"" EDH deck.  However, that means Ramp, especially with Blue, can just run over me all day.

I would like to add in the minimal ramp options I have in BR to speed things up a bit more:  Sol Ring, Darksteel Ingot, maybe even Lantern.  However, I don't know what to cut.  Any ideas for what I could add and replace?

Second, I would like to improve control/disruption elements specifically against ramp and control:  Tectonic Instability, Stranglehold, and Ward are awesome, and Mindclaw Shaman is fun, but I'd like to have more effective ways to slow the game down a bit.  Maybe more wraths?  Any suggestions?  Things I might cut to make room?

Finally, any ideas to improve consistency of my strategy, apart from more tutors?  Sometimes this deck explodes and smashes in faces, and sometimes this deck flails for 10 turns until people decide to kill me anyway because Rakdos.  I'd like to make my starts a bit more consistent.

Azusa is probably my ideal general. A land ramp fatty aggressively costed card that screams ""build around my ability"". I never had the money to build an effective build, but as my edh collection has increased in size, and I got a nice amount of money for my high school graduation, I decided to go all out and build my dream deck. 
 
Info on my meta, budget, and all that good stuff: My meta is a relatively competitive one who play in 3-4 man pod's (no 1v1), ranging from $2000 hermit druid t4 combo deck to your average ""play to have fun and try to win"" deck. I tend to find myself somewhere in the middle, attempting to be competitive while remaining on a much lower budget than many of my group members. As it is I'm more willing to spend on Azusa as she's my grad present to myself, so instead of the 1-2 $20 card limit I normally use, I'm willing to go into the 3-4 range, but card's like Gaea's Cradle are still out unfortunately. 

Now onto the deck itself. This deck is kind of your stereotypical Azusa build, running the high land count little-no ramp strategy that seems the more effective of the two. I enjoy landfall, and Rampaging Baloths/Avenger of Zendikar tend to be my go to wincon's. The deck tries to generate a huge amount of mana by turn 6-9 on average, enough to dump a massive amount of damage on board and draw enough of my deck to overrun my opponents. Drawing into Concordant Crossroads so I don't have to give my opponents a chance to respond to my sudden 140 damage on board has seemed pretty important in playtesting. 

So there's my story, now comes your bit r/edh! Any opinions on my list, cards that are worth a slot, what to drop to put them in, advice from Azusa old hats, or anything else would be great!

I play in a highly competitive meta, ABUR duals in several decks, everything is allowed, infinite combos, land destruction, all that good stuff. I want to be sure this deck can hold it's own despite my lower budget and lack of many infinite combos.

I bet everyone owns at least twenty. I started putting one in my Tariel re-animator, and I have to say... sometimes it sucks. 

But sometimes it's awesome. 

It's awesome either early on, when there aren't a lot of creatures in my graveyard, or if I need an extra card in my hand to discard to Firestorm or Sickening Dreams or something. 

Or if I use it immediately after a Firestorm or Sickening Dreams or another board wipe. I now have another creature to play next turn. 

It's also great early on after a Buried Alive. 

I find that every time I have it out, now that I've been remembering that it's there, I use it for something. Sometimes I get a creature I don't have the lands for, though. It's times like those when you shouldn't use it, like if you have one white source and Angel of Serenity in your yard. You just know that you're gonna get Angel in your hand, then top deck Miraculous Recovery. 

So it's not great all the time, but sometimes it's really handy. 

Also, it only taps for colorless. That sucks pretty hard. Though, I find I'm willing to take that hit for it's usefulness... cause it's a land. 

As a spell, not so great. As a land... not so great, but at least it's useful in the context of this [deck](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/valhalla-1/).

This is my first time making a mono red EDH deck. The main goal is to use [Jaya Ballard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=234707) for value while making the game difficult for my opponents. Jaya is very strong with the several phoenixes, madness cards, and other recur-able things in the deck, as well as [Distorting Lens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=45473). Repeatable 1 mana Vindicate? Sign me up.

But the cards that Jaya uses are only a small portion of the list. I'm going to be completely honest and say that this deck is not perfectly tuned by any stretch of the imagination. Rather, it is full of awesome red cards that I've always wanted to play in EDH but have never had an opportunity. There's some land hate, some global burn, some mana doublers, and some big flying creatures. Pretty much everything that I think red is great at doing.

There is also a small anti-blue subtheme in the deck. I didn't go as far as including cards like [Boil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=45373), but [Pyroblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=159243) and [Red Elemental Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=202447) easily made the cut. I've found these incredibly useful for when I want a bomb spell to land and a blue mage is holding counter magic.

This is a very new deck and it's still in the proxy testing phase, but I'm pretty pleased with it so far.

I'm not looking to make it a top of the line deck, but I do want it to be fairly strong and I'd like it to be very enjoyable to play. I love the concept of sac'ing and rezing my creatures so that is my main focus.

I'm looking for any suggestions to improve my deck. My biggest worry is I didn't do my lands right. I don't know what would be the proper amount with the cards that I have, or if there are any staples that I am missing. Also I see a lot of decks use more Artifact's that give mana, which I don't really have besides Sol/Dimir.

I do have a fair bit of combos in my deck though, I listed some of them in the comments section.

Budget-wise. I don't mind spending a buck or 2 on a fairly good card, but going $5/$10/$15 for one isn't out of the question if it's a vast improvement over something I have.

I'm just looking for some friendly people to play EDH with during the year, as my playgroup goes to school further away and we can't get together very often.  

I'm 21, go to Laurier and live in Waterloo during the school year, and Cambridge during the summer.  If you're from around here, you'd know that everywhere in the KW area is pretty accessible by bus, so I'd be willing to go pretty much anywhere to get some games in!

I'm curious to see if there are any groups that play out of the universities, or at some of the LGS in the area in either a playgroup that's looking for more people, or an EDH league that needs more people.

just to give some background of my EDH experience, I've been playing for a few years, and play mostly for fun and on my spare time.  although EDH is about having a good time, I find it fun to play powerful cards, so my decks are pretty competitive, but easily answerable.  I prefer not to play combos at all.

To get an idea of my decks, I currently run a maelstrom wanderer-primal surge build that I'm working on:

And a pretty tuned Omnath deck that I've had for a long time:

I also have some non-competitive builds that aren't as tuned but I'd be willing to play if they'd fit in to your meta more then these ones!

The idea is that I give everyone as much mana as possible, give them as many creatures as possible, and draw them as many cards as possible. Then, when everybody is sitting there plump and happy, I Word of Seizing my own nephilim, and steal the whole board and win the game.

I'm playing with a few ""win"" conditions, Rite of Replication, Illuminate, Word of Seizing, but I'm really not all that interested in winning. If they tuck my general, I'm okay with spending the rest of the game just doing silly things.

I don't really want to play a lot of counterspells or removal or things like that, since my goal is to make everyone go crazy, not slow anyone down. The only reason I'm playing Mercy Killing is for the inevitable Avacyn that tends to make games go very one sided.

Am I missing any cool interactions with my general? Are there other group hug cards I could put in to make other people explode more?

edit for help guidelines:

I want the deck to get people as much of their decks out as possible. Stuff like Temping Wurm and the blue Braids are what I'm shooting for. Mana doubling effects like Mana Flare, group card draw, group land ramp, or anything like that is that kind of stuff I'm trying to play. Bonus points if it uses Ink-Treader. I'd like to have the option of stopping someone from going out of control without everyone else, which is why Mercy Killing is in there, but that's less of an issue. That's what everyone else at the table is for. I also like silly things I can do with Ink-Treader, like Illicit Auction or Polymorph.

For budget, I'd consider cards under 30 dollars, at the most. I'd prefer less than that, but if it's fantastic or hilarious enough, it'd be worth it.

I come to you today with a predicament regarding my next EDH deck.

Just for some background on my playstyle and deck interest:  I currently play mono green omnath with a ton of ramp, removal and huge dudes (usually wins with a giant genesis wave, commander damage, or straight beats).  My interests lie with creatures, ramp and some control so omnath has been perfect.  I hate combo!


Now, I'm trying to decide between Maelstrom Wanderer and Jenara, Asura of War. 


My idea for the Jenara list is to make it a control she'll with some ramp and ETB creatures to abuse with venser and the like, which fits my playstyle.  (So basically bant goodstuff)


The idea for Maelstrom Wanderer is a primal surge-esque deck with all permanants costing 7 or less, lots of ETB effects and bounce to reuse cascade and the like, running tons of creatures.  This fits my playstyle and maelstrom wanderer seems really fun, but ramp and fatties in this list seems like it could get redundant with my omnath list and pretty much end up being a ramp and fatty deck like omnath.


So which should I run?  Anyone with experience playing with or against either general, I'd love to hear what you think about either one.  Strengths, weaknesses and the like.  


Thanks a lot everyone!

It's definitely combo oriented, but many times Animar will win a game just through the sheer value he puts out with my creatures. Win conditions are Cloudstone Curio combo's with morph creatures into Ulamog, Tidespout Tyrant with Palinchron or Aluren + Man-o'-War, or Avenger of Zendikar into Craterhoof Behemoth, or just getting into the red zone with Animar and pals.

He refers to it as his ""underwater friends"" deck.  This game he had dropped a first turn [Quest for Ula's Temple](http://magiccards.info/wwk/en/35.html) which turned into him having an Inkwell Leviathan and some other monsters on the board around turn 7 or so. 

Meanwhile, I have Riku and a Guttersnipe in play and I've done literally nothing.  I draw a [Turnabout](http://magiccards.info/us/en/105.html) with [Peer through Depths](http://magiccards.info/mma/en/57.html), [Izzet Chronarch](http://magiccards.info/ddj/en/11.html), [Temporal Fissure](http://magiccards.info/sc/en/53.html) and a personal favorite of mine [exploding borders](http://magiccards.info/cfx/en/106.html) in hand.

Cast a doubled turnabout.  Cast a doubled Peer Through Depths, which leads to an [Early Harvest](http://magiccards.info/9e/en/235.html).  Cast a doubled early harvest.  We're about 10 minutes into the turn now.  I've done 6 damage.  So I cast a doubled exploding borders, that's another 8 damage.  

At this point I pop the Temporal Fissure, bounce some of his threats and get the Chronarch back to my hand.  Recast a doubled Chronarch and get turnabout and peer through depths back. Cast the doubled turnabout and peer through depths for another 4 damage.

So, we're about 20 minutes into the turn now, my opponent is playing a game on his cellphone and I'm trying to do all the mental math with my mana pool.  Thank god for spare die.  I cast some other draw spell (can't remember) and get my hands on a [flame wave](http://magiccards.info/sh/en/81.html) which does lethal damage, and if it hadn't the recurring insight would have netted me the cards to win the game next turn.

I have never actually build an EDH deck myself, I always just modified other people's lists, so I decided it was time to start. These are the first two decks I build that I was satisfied with, but I'd like other people's opinions on the decks. I am mainly interested in bad cardchoices I made and which cards I would fit the decks well.

Keep in mind I've never actually played either deck, I want your help before actually buying them.

--------------

**[Wrexial](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/wrexial-wrecks-you/)**

The general idea of the deck is to use my opponents cards against them by cloning my opponents' creatures and using their spells against them. Wrexial obviously works best if my opponents' graveyards are full, as do a lot of other, similar cards. To support that, I play some mill cards, I tried not to play ""one-shot-effects"", but couldn't resist putting in Traumatize. As always with a blue deck, I was tempted to jam it full to the brim with counters, but I know my friends wouldn't enjoy that, so the only counters are ones that fit the theme of the deck.

My main concern about this deck is the relatively high mana curve, but it's hard to find smaller cards that feel worth their slot in this deck. Maybe I should include Hedron Crab, Riddlekeeper, Ambassador Laquatus etc. ? But all those effects seem so small.

----------------

**[Vish Kal](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/vish-kal-wishes-you-dead/)**

The theme here is playing creatures with sweet ETB effects and being able to recur them. I am not sure how feasible this is, since many great ETB effects come with a larger mana cost, maybe a token focussed build would be better?

My main conern however is the correct ratio of etb-creature, recursion and sac-outlet. Right now I feel the deck is lacking the latter, but I am not sure what kind of sac-outlet the deck actually wants. 
As with the other deck, I am not sure about this deck's mana curve either. The creature count also seems pretty low for what the deck wants to achieve, but I don't know what to cut.
I also think this deck might have a little too much removal, but that's something only my friends' reactions will show.

There was a post a while ago about other cards that would serve as good Commanders but as I'm writing this I can't think of too many.

Some areas I'd like to see explored/focused on:

1. Effects/Interactions with the command zone: Your creatures get +1/+1 while he's in the command zone, and opponents creatures get -1/-1 while he's in play

2. ""Negative"" effects like Abyssal Persecutor

3. Cards that refer to Allies like Imperial Mask

4. More political orientated cards: Making players choose, or giving you the ability to make ""friends""  

5. More variety in some colour combinations: Ruric Thar and Bory 2.0 are good examples of this for Gruul. I think they feel flavourful without being just a beatdown commander.

Reaper King double tribal(trouble) - Scarecrows and Slivers.

I love Reaper King as a general, and the color wheel made me think the other tribal could easily be slivers, but how viable would this be?


Are there any tribal staples that would take on a new role or a modified role, have two tribes dominate in a single deck?  Should I use scarecrows for their own role, and focus slivers for another?


Obviously changelings will be a great buffer, will having two tribes open up more potential changelings that aren't normally run in tribal?

Rules: 1.33 non-land cards from either ravnica or RTR block (nonbasic land doesnt count). 
2. Must use a general from one of the guilds, so only 2 color decks allowed.
3. Deck must follow multiplayer edh rules in terms of banlist.

My favorite guild is Simic, u/g is a great color combination and fits my playstyle well. I wanted to build a bug counter based deck with mimeoplasm, but when they announced this tournament I decided to cut down to 2 colors so I didn't have to build 2 decks with the same idea. Prime speaker seemed like the best choice for general that fit a counters theme, although vorel is a close second and deserves a slot in the deck even not being at the helm. 

This is what I came up with http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/counter-speaker-zegana/ 

The deck is supposed to play to abuse Prime Speaker's ability, blinking her, moving counters, and generally taking advantage of the multitude of counters and card advantage generated to win. Psychosis Crawler with Prime Speaker has been an all star, and Primordial hydra (if left alone for even a turn) becomes a massive threat and draw generator. 

Now here's the problem, when I heard about the tournament I misunderstood and thought it was 33 nonbasics, so the deck is missing about 5 cards to meet the guidelines (i was at 27 last time I counted). I put all the cards I could find in simic colors from the two blocks that I thought would be good in the decks, but I'm at a loss for what to remove for them. Any input on what I should drop or change to make that magic 33, or swaps of one ravnica card for another would be great. Thanks a lot! 

TLDR; having a Ravnica themed tournament at LGS, need 33 non-lands and only have 27 in current deck.",,False,,t5_2scee,False,,RGWS,True,t3_1he71h,http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1he71h/ravnica_tournament_competition_deck_help_prime/,
