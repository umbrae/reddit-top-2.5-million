1354554399.0,57,self.sexpertslounge,147hjz,I [f]inally did it! I can come during sex! The difference between g-spot and clit orgasms is much greater than I thought.,61,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/sexpertslounge/comments/147hjz/i_finally_did_it_i_can_come_during_sex_the/,"Sex started out as horribly painful for me, then thanks to you guys I learned about vaginismus and managed to get myself over it. Then for a while I could have sex, but to no avail. Didn't get me anywhere. So I asked you guys again, looked around, read a lot, fantasized a lot.... 

And it's finally happened! Happened the first time a few weeks ago, I didn't really know what was going on. Then it started happening more and more often and more intensely, and now I will come two or three times per time we have sex, and sometimes just continuously for ages.

The thing that I didn't understand and I basically figured out on my own, is that THE FEELINGS ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. Clitoral orgasm, I knew extremely well on my own and with my boyfriend's vibrator. It's an overwhelming wash of sensation and contractions that disappears very quickly and leaves me a bit nauseous and very hyper-sensitive. It's still great, but very very different from g-spot orgasm.

Thing is I thought it would be basically the same thing, just feeling in a different spot. Except not at all. It's literally a completely different feeling, and I can't tell which is better tbh! G-spot orgasms, or what I've had so far, is an insanely aroused, powerful feeling deep inside that literally leaves me unable to breathe for about 10 seconds over and over again. Makes me contract everything in my body and dig my nails in. I can also keep going with sex afterwards if we slow down a bit, then comes right back once we speed up. After I'm literally left there feeling like a happy pile of fluff that wants to be cuddled but can't even move. :3



So yeah. I thank you guys, thank the rest of the internet, and of course, my lovely lovely amazing and patient boyfriend for helping me relax and be able to enjoy the pleasures of life, hopefully for a very long time more.",,False,,t5_2shg2,False,,,True,t3_147hjz,http://www.reddit.com/r/sexpertslounge/comments/147hjz/i_finally_did_it_i_can_come_during_sex_the/,
1341449494.0,24,self.sexpertslounge,w20fq,4-Hour Body Guide to Incredible Sex? This is worth a read.,30,6,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/sexpertslounge/comments/w20fq/4hour_body_guide_to_incredible_sex_this_is_worth/,"The book 4-Hour Body by Tim Ferris claims many ""body hacks"" that are rooted in self-experiment based on advice from various studies and experts. One section is on Incredible Sex. It features three main parts: three improved sex positions, a technique titled ""fifteen minute female orgasm,"" and naturally increasing testosterone levels (and therefore sex drive among other things).

The sex positions are improved angle missionary (where the woman's pelvis is raised and the man's knees are under his shoulders to more of a kneeling position), improved pressure missionary (where the man moves up a few inches and focuses his weight on her pelvis and incorporates some grinding), and finally improved pressure cowgirl (where the man sits up at an angle of about 20 degrees).

The fifteen minute orgasm is where the man very lightly strokes the clitoris in the ""one o'clock"" position (the upper right quadrant while facing the clitoris). The man attempts to be otherwise motionless and keeps the strokes at a constant rhythm. The woman is supposed to focus on the sensation and be aware that there is no objective and just to experience it.

For the increase in testosterone he recommends 3 brazil nuts twice daily, 3000-5000 UI Vitamin D twice daily (until a 55ng/ml blood level is reached), 10 minute ice baths or showers twice daily, and 2 capsules of fermented cod liver oil + vitamin-rich butter fat twice daily (for what I believe is the Vitamin A and the cholesterol). Then for an extra boost he recommend 24 hours before sex to eat 800 milligrams of cholesterol before bed (in eggs, meat, etc.). 4 hours before sex he recommends 4 brazil nuts, 20 almonds and 2 capsules of the liver oil/butter fat. These in conjunction allegedly greatly boost testosterone levels and makes sex incredible.

Of course these claims are seem unbelievable. I've referred this advice to a friend and his girlfriend personally thanked me saying that the fifteen minute orgasm was one of the greatest experiences of her life. But I tried it on my girlfriend twice (while not following all the books directions) and she didn't particularly enjoy it.

I've tried the improved pressure missionary with some very good results (lasted longer and my girlfriend loved it). I've also tried some of the testosterone increases with little notable change to my sex drive. I couldn't find the vitamin-rich butter fat and I used lower doses of Vitamin D and the liver oil and I practiced the daily directions sporadically. So those changes could have caused the problem or these changes normally only effect people that don't already have a high sex drive (as I do).

The sex was just perfect. I remember I could last as long as I want and everything was great. Now after a year we broke up and half an year later I got a new girlfriend. As we first had sex I was very nervous for whatever reason and came very very fast ( I think it happend because of my fear to not perform great ) Then I spend the past 2 months in a forum dedicated to help people who suffer premature ejaculation and I made progress in terms of masturbation. After the time I suffered premature ejaculation for the first time I noticed my bad masturbation habbits. I always wanted to finish as quick as possibly which is not great if you want to last longer in bed, before beginning working on my pre.e. I lasted about 5 minutes. Now I can last as long as I want during masturbation. Sadly this is not happening during actual intercourse. There is only one simple answer why this is still happening: I'm anxious, I'm worried but after all my practicing I could last longer than before during intercourse. How can I replace that fear and get more confidence? I realised that my main problem seems to be psychological and I spent the last 2 days convincing myself that I can do it like I could do it before (why should I even suffer P.E?) and I don't have this problem anymore. I think it's working. Every time I think about this problem I find answers and positive thoughts which make me calm and relaxed about it. The problem is I still think more about that problem than I should and I want to stop that. I also want to get even more confidence. I'm sure I fixed the problem but I still think about it, I think the fact that I think about it so often could ruin it all over again when I'm in actual intercourse.",,False,,t5_2shg2,False,,,True,t3_xtwuk,http://www.reddit.com/r/sexpertslounge/comments/xtwuk/how_to_get_confidence_and_release_worries_i_have/,

We made it through our first week and are looking for as much feedback on it as we can get!

I brought you female and male sexual anatomy.  Bacchante wrote the Parenting and Sex article which features a great story from Lifeliver as well. Dr. Kinkenstein and Patientpolyamorist co-authored an article on sexual technique. N_Sheppard and her crew of Sexperts includng Zomboi, Phantasmal, BlueLantern and LoveHotel covered a frequent r/sex question about shaving. We also got permission to bring you a great book review of Sex at Dawn.

We’re excited about what we have to offer you next week too!

We’ll introduce the “My First Time” series with an article on cunnilingus penned by Azureknightmare.  Our opinion page takes on the question of whether sexual orienation is a choice or not (which I personally think is an exeptional article, written by patientpolyamorist).  I’ve also written up articles on why and how to masturbate, and, of course, the Sexperts’ panel will return (wahoo!!). 

We’re almost as excited about our new subreddit as we are about the blog.  Look for a sidebar feature there next week where you can submit your questions to the sexperts.  We’re not sure whether to keep the panel or go with individual columnists so that the format more closely mirrors your favorite professional sex columns like Savage Love.  

We’re doing this blog for you, so tell us what you like, what you hate, and what you think we should do instead. Any comments or questions you can think of are more than welcome! Also, help us get an idea of how many people are really interested in sexpertslounge by clicking the ‘frontpage’ on the sidebar of this subreddit :)

Honestly, it makes mine seem pretty unhealthy. 

I've never questioned my approach to sex. I figured that I just had a naturally high libido and that was that. He has a lower libido, and we just try to make it work. It usually also get myself off at least once per day regardless, and honestly, I feel like I need it to to be productive with my day. There are times when I definitely have to postpone doing work to either have sex or masturbate, and times when I didn't have the means to do so and spent the day unable to focus or get anything done. And then there are the days when I skip classes/meetings/whatever because I spent the day in bed with my vibrator, even when I know I should go, even if I want to go in some sense, but I feel like I just can't. Luckily my current job has flexible hours.

Anyway, I would prefer to have sex at least once per day. He doesn't. I told him that I felt unwanted/undesired always having to initiate and consistently getting turned down, and his response was that it hurts him that sex seems like the only way to make me happy. He tries to do lots of things for me to make me happy and it’s frustrating for him when sex is the only thing that seems to do it. He said, “you are more than just sex and when we do it everyday, it seems like that is the only thing our relationship is about,"" which makes him feel ""objectified."" 

I honestly had no idea that I was hurting him. I can understand what he is saying, obviously, but I can't imagine being in a situation that would make me feel that way, so it's hard for me to truly understand where he's coming from. 

We tried to develop a compromise so that he isn't left feeling pressured to have sex every day or inadequate and I'm not left feeling unwanted or inadequate either, so that's in the works. 

I resolved to myself that I would not take it personally when he rejects me anymore, because I can recognize that it is kind of immature and just letting any insecurity that I might have get the better of me. I also am trying to see things from his perspective more often. However, I was still somewhat anxious until we had sex that night. Afterwards, I was content, happy, relaxed, you know the drill.

tl;dr My current SO feels objectified by my high libido and approach to sex, realized that I might be doing something wrong ",,False,,t5_2shg2,False,,,True,t3_1bjn7g,http://www.reddit.com/r/sexpertslounge/comments/1bjn7g/unhealthy_sex_f21/,

I was originally on Leonore, a low-dose pill, but I realised fairly quickly that it was destroying my libido. I still managed to get turned on, but I couldn't come. Very frustrating.

I switched to Ovranette, which is just twice the dosage of Leonore, and found that my sex drive increased a million times over, and I was finally able to come from sex. I loved it. It seemed like everything was great.

Unfortunately, after three months on this new pill I've realised it has caused some SERIOUS mental health issues. My periods are a million times worse (never used to have bad periods), and I get insane mood swings, anxiety, and am slightly depressed constantly.

I thought the anxiety and depression were caused by stress and other factors, but I'm starting to realise it could just be the pill, as nothing has really changed in my life.


So, what do I do? I'm going to talk to a doctor about the implant (I hate shots, so those are out). I don't know if it has similar side-effects. Does anyone have any ideas?

Sex with my boyfriend (both 20) of a couple years has always been great, really good, always fun and enjoyable, and usually I can never get enough. I'm really comfortable around him. But lately we tried anal and I can't say I didn't not enjoy it... but then trying it again resulted in a pretty awkward moment on my part.

Trying to not make it anymore awkward, I just let the awkward moment go because I felt like dueling on it would just make it worse, and he did seem not to care so I didn't want to make it worse by bringing it up more. 
But now, I honestly just don't want to do it anymore... sex in general. He tried to initiate yesterday but I told him I didn't feel like it and made an excuse that my stomach hurt. I just feel too embarrassed and self-conscious now and really don't want to anymore. Maybe I should talk to him about it but I really don't want to because I'm embarrassed to death. 

I can't see myself getting over this anytime soon honestly. Maybe I should say something to him? I'm afraid bringing it up again will make him remember and not want to anymore or something.

* I've read about people using a hand to press on a girl's abdomen during cunnilingus. Where exactly should I press? Should I be feeling bone, or soft tissue? Should it be a rhythmic press-release-press-release, or constant pressure? Is it more effective if done with some form of penetration?

* The A-spot. Anyone have tips on the best way to hit it with fingers? I've noticed that the G-spot responds well to pressure vs friction. Is the A-spot similar?

* Anal. I'd like to hit both her G-spot and A-spot during anal (finger and/or intercourse). Is this just a matter of angle? Any advice on positions to that end? (We're both practiced with anal, so lube and safety issues are always well taken care of.)

* We practice light bondage. Maybe this would be better asked in r/bdsm, but... I'm trying to figure out how to tie her up so that she's on her back, unable to close her legs, with her hands restrained but away from her torso -- with nothing to actually tie her too.

Really it’s more like needed psychotherapy. 

You know how everyone has these d secret sexual taboo memories or experiences, but precisely because they are taboo we suppress them and don’t talk about them ever again? Well for me it was sexual experimentation with my brother (somewhere between age 7-10, my brother only two years older) which consisted of kissing, playing with each other, and eventually my brother trying to emulate the porn movie we found in the parents’ bedroom… fortunately he was unsuccessful and neither of us had any real comprehension of what was going on or what it meant. I wouldn’t call it abuse, because it was just an odd mutual and innocent playing around. We’ve since for the most part forgotten about it, except two years ago when he tried to apologize to me, and I somewhat embarrassedly responded “you don’t have to apologize for that,” and just left it there because I didn’t feel the need to acknowledge it anymore. Its taboo, it’s secret.  

For my husband it was the exact same thing, only with his older sister.

For the first three years we dated these things remained a mystery. It wasn’t until we went on a mini vacation for my birthday, stayed in a log cabin, and took a lot of drugs did it finally come out. My husband and I have taken these drugs before… shrooms, LSD, and cocaine. This night didn’t really seem much different from the other times we tripped. Not until we had sex and then started talking about it afterward, which lead to a pretty extensive conversation… which leads to us revealing these secrets. It was uplifting and amazing… I felt that the drugs really opened the gates to each other’s guilt and shame and we could come to terms with it. We both felt more understanding of each other, that knowing you could have someone you could confide in so much you tell them something you have never told anyone. I felt better about it, and so did he, we felt like we weren’t fucked up anymore, not sex freaks. (What’s even more fucked up is that this is the night we got engaged, I know, weird.) 

From that moment on shit went from acceptance to SUPER acceptance to, ok now shit is out of control. And by that I mean we started incest role-playing, and it became extremely arousing for both of us. I have absolutely no sexual attraction or desire towards my brother, but the idea of a brother and sister sleeping together drives me nuts. And not just that, but dad and daughter too although I never even had any sexual experience with my father. I should clarify too that we are not turned on by rape or sexual abuse (which I suppose can probably be defined this way, but it’s not how I define it) it only turns us on when both parties are consensual, no force. Anyway, we did this for a while, I want to say several months. Then one day I asked him if I always had to pretend to be his sister, or if he could just fuck his wife, plain and simple? He said something along the lines of, “of course, I love you and I want to fuck YOU.” I was reassured. But apparently that fucked him up. Now he’s back on the guilt train and I didn’t even know until very recently. 

His sister and her husband came to visit us. We were drunk, then my husband said he needed to talk to his sister alone. I knew what he was going to do and I knew it was a terrible idea. I tried to stop him as he was walking to the backdoor and whispered “I can’t believe you are doing this right now, this is extremely awkward, especially because “Bob” (sister’s husband) has been talking to me about how close you and your sister are, how he’s never seen a brother and sister so close, that you both have a special relationship that he can’t match.” I don’t remember what he said, but he went out back and had whatever conversation he had with her. I stayed inside and uncomfortably talked to Bob. 

The next day a horrible anxiety is burning inside of me and my husband is at work, I send him the “we need to talk” text message, which he responds “yes, we do.” Then he comes home and I start to ask him questions and he hardly even talks to me, essentially brushes me off. Every time I try to talk to him about this he becomes extremely defensive. 

Since then I’ve felt this horrible jealousy, and I have these irrational fantasies about them fucking, and him leaving me, and whatever else. And I knew he was withholding things from me because he wanted to spare my feelings. 

Eventually I asked him if he wanted to fuck his sister or just the idea of his sister. This made a huge difference to me. He said the idea, but that certain sexual aspects that aroused him probably came from his sister, namely, that he loves large breasts (which I have, not  huge, just a D).  This assured me slightly, but I still couldn’t help but want to know EVERY SINGLE WORD that was exchanged between them… I am jealous and paranoid beyond reason… but I tried to stop nagging him for answers. 

I forget about for about two months. Then it all comes back to me, because sex just changes all of the sudden. The other night, we woke up aroused in the middle of the night and it was fucking awesome. We’re totally going at it when I climb on top of him (our typical cumming position) and I can see in his face a sudden lack of arousal. We’re about to cum but then he just gets tired and we stop. I cry uncontrollably (because you know girls are so easily fucking offended by these things, I don’t want to be, but I find that I’m no different) and he consoles me: “It’s not you baby it’s me… I love you… we have the best sex ever I’m just tired…“ etc. I try to get a hold of myself but I just don’t let it go. 

The next day I’m still fucking horny, and thinking that he finally got some rest, I start getting frisky with him in the kitchen. He chuckles and plays along for a little bit but then he makes me take my hand off of his erection. He says he doesn’t want to have sex right now he has a lot to do. I feel like I just got stabbed for a second but I don’t want to show it because he has every right to not be in the mood. But because of what happened the night before that thought of “wtf is wrong with me” came back and I said weakly “ok” and put my head down tried to walk away. And then he sighs and asks me if he hurt my feelings, and I just completely shut down, don’t want to talk about it anymore, just want to cool down and try to stop taking so much offense. 

He texts me at work that night and says he’s sorry, that he wants to “make sweet love to me.” That’s exactly what we do. And again it’s fucking weird. We both came, but the whole time I still felt it, this sense that he was only half there, not enjoying it as much as he used to. Later on that day I get horny again (we used to have A LOT of sex up until this past month, sometimes multiple times in one day) and I start playing around with him again. Then it’s like I end up begging him for it. He tells me again that it’s not me, that he just feels that sex is weird now. I wanted elaboration but I got none. 

So I holed up again. I didn’t know how to approach the subject in a constructive way anymore. Nothing was ever resolved every time we talked about it. I increasingly became more jealous, paranoid, anxious, and lost all self-esteem.  I was in the middle of studying when I just had to get my feelings out on paper. I basically wrote a letter to him. Then last night he reads it and we start talking about it over a glass of wine. Right off the bat, he was completely defensive. He started to elaborate on the conversation with the sister and told me he regrets talking to her about it, because she told him that talking about it has made things dangerous and I completely agree, because he told me that at the end of their conversation they were both aroused. 

Now I’m totally fucked up in the head. That just blows my mind. All I can think about is my husband talking to his sister with a raging erection and it infuriates me. I’m also pissed because he withheld these details from me, even though it was to spare my feelings it made it worse because I felt like he lied to me when he said that he didn’t want to fuck his sister, was not attracted to her, but only the idea. He lied because he got a fucking boner. Because she was wet or whatever the fuck. And clearly, they both had to have acknowledged it to each other and all I wonder is HOW exactly did that happen? How do you talk about being horny for each other without… I don’t know… taking it another step. 

I don’t know what to do. No health insurance. Can’t afford therapy. I don’t think I could look somebody in the face and tell them all this, I guess I prefer being anonymous on the internet. 

 td;lr: My husband and I fucked around with our siblings when we were young, started role playing incest fantasies, he tries to be at peace with his sister, both get aroused during that conversation; I’m infuriated, sad, and jealous.




**Update:** Thanks for the advice guys. We've done the whole ""lay the cards out on the table"" multiple times, each time getting nowhere. I didn't update so quickly because I've been in the hospital. I have a history of mental disorders/problems, and the one I struggle with the most is anxiety/panic disorder. Well, last time I tried to get some things off my chest (Tuesday) it went very badly, and my husband wasn't just defensive this time he was also very aggressive. With all the irrational thoughts that have been throwing me into the abyss as of late, this just threw me over the edge-- the panic was so bad I thought the only way to stop it was to end my life. I tried to overdose on some pills, luckily didn't (suicidal behavior is something I've also struggled with for a long time-- first time I've acted on it though.) I certainly don't blame anyone for it, especially my husband, who was by my side the whole time. I'm sure it was more than just this issue that was a contributing factor. 

Anyway, since then I've made an appointment to see a psychiatrist and a therapist. Hopefully at some point I can do couples counseling. Since this incident we have not spoken a word about it. Not even about why I did it. I think he knows. It's too painful now to approach it. I'm afraid I'll be driven to extremes again even if I think about it (which is why I've avoided reading and updating this). I've done my best to preoccupy my mind and time with other stupid bullshit and resisting every sexual urge I can. I know repressing it just makes it worse but I don't feel as though I have a choice at the moment. This world isn't what you want it to be, it is what it is. I can't change the social rules just because I think they suck. Of course I don't believe that anything we did was fundamentally wrong, obviously, since we were so open about it to the point of exploring it further, and in terms of my ""moral"" principles I don't think it was wrong (both the act itself and what we did afterward). How we deal with it now I don't think is an issue of right or wrong, there's no point in looking at it that way now unless we want to cause further feelings of guilt/shame/regret etc.

Thanks for helping me out guys. At the very least you all made me feel less ashamed about the whole thing. Now I just have to deal with the aftermath of the huge shit storm this has become because of my stupid fucking actions. (Imagine waking up in the hospital, your whole family is there staring at you and they're all thinking the same thing: why'd she do it? Yeah... I made this issue WAY worse.)

I just never feel like I want to do it because I'd much rather be doing something else.

For example, my SO would start touching me a bit and it feels nice, but in my mind I can't help but think of things such as ""I'd much rather be playing League of Legends or watching The Walking Dead right now."" There's just a lack of sex drive and I'm not sure what the issue is. It feels good but it's not something I ever really ""want"".

I should also note that the strange thing is I do have times when I get horny, but this is only at the idea of sex. I would get horny at the idea of having sex with my SO and masturbate, but when it comes to the actual act itself it seems like such a tedious chore I have to do in order to please my SO.

* My clit is too sensitive to be touched directly. So when I masturbate, I usually go a little below the clit. I do have very sensitive labia so I mostly just rub these really quickly, which is very pleasurable but I mostly just 'have to stop' after a while.
* I recently bought a vibrator which is designed to stimulate the G-spot (I thought that this was the way to get off, since my clit is too sensitive). I really enjoy using it, but after 20 - 30 minutes, I mostly just don't feel like it anymore.

To put it bluntly, me and my girlfriend are 17-year-old virgins and we're not really sure how to have sex. We've tried three times and it's resulted in failure. I'm not sure how to describe but...I just can't seem to get inside her.

for starters she's a very small girl and I'm much bigger than her. I dont have a monster cock or anything but compared to her body Im pretty large, and even though I'll be fully erect and she'll be wet, we just...can't get it in. So far the positions we've tried are me on top or her on bother or both laying on our sides, but none of those are working. My girlfriend told me she was scared of it hurting and she tends to clench up, I've noticed her legs usually aren't spread very far apart when we do it but I'm not sure if that's really the problem or fi she's trying to make me feel better.

We've tried three times and it's the same thing. I press hard against her, but I just can't get it to go inside! Then after a few minutes of trying this I start to feel frustrated, embarrassed and inadequate, which kills my erection. In the three times we've tried this my girlfriend has gotten angry at me for losing my erection and ends up asking me whats wrong over and over again in an angry tone, which only adds to my anxiety and destroys any arousal, so we're pretty much done for the rest of the night once this happens.

After this has happened three times I have to admit that sex is kind of a scary thing for me now. I wish we could just keep mutually masturbating or giving oral because then we're both happy, but I know we can't do that forever. I want to have sex with her but I'm not sure what I'm doing and now it just scares me to think about it because I don't want to fail her and upset her.

[x-post from /r/sex]",18,4,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/sexpertslounge/comments/101uio/what_are_some_paths_for_my_girlfriend_and_i_to/,"My girlfriend [F, mid 20s] and I [M, mid 20s] have a very solid, emotionally-grounded relationship. We've been together for nearly 2 years.

She has a history of traumatic sexual abuse stemming from early childhood onward, which has left her with a very strong sense of physical dissociation when it comes to sex that it is (obviously) very difficult for her to overcome.

She rarely desires sex on her own, but will become very aroused when we start making out or other physical foreplay. However once things reach full intercourse, no matter how gentle I am or how much she has been enjoying it up to that point, she will slowly detach from the experience due to the associations it brings up. It is very rare that this does not happen.

Her previous partners have always either ignored or become frustrated with this aspect of her, but I have done my best to accommodate as best as I can. I do occasionally become frustrated with myself for my inability to please her without also scaring her, which only makes her feel worse, and then me even worse, and so on in a negative spiral.

Sex has never been the foundation of our compatibility. Even though in previous relationships I was quite sexually dominant (not usually in the BDSM sense, but generally rough/aggressive), I've never felt disappointed in her or frustrated that I can't act out fantasies with her -- I love her how she is, regardless of her 'sexual problems'.

However, she has recently decided she wants to work on her issues along with me, and I want to do everything I can to help/support her in that growth since I agree with her that it would be good for her emotionally.

The reason I mention my own sexual history is that there have been moments when my aggressive side comes out during sex, and it causes her to further emotionally withdraw -- it is completely unintentional on my part, as is her reaction. I have never really liked that tendency and would not at all mind it disappearing forever if it meant I would never have to scare her in that way again, but I know that it is unlikely I'd be able to 'get over' it any more than she could her issues.

So, how do you think we could approach this? I've tried to be as detailed as necessary but I'll be happy to provide any more info if someone has a good way of thinking.

I totally thought this was just a weird thing i did, until I saw a ""House"" re-run. I have always had a habit of ""waking up having sex"" with the particular woman I was sleeping with at the time. It recently has gotten more frequent with my current long-term gf.  Its never caused much of a problem other than a midnight, mostly unconscious, brush off. At this point i usually wake up, half realize what I've done and I fall back asleep. It definitely seems to be triggered by physical contact from my sleeping partner. This started with a girlfriend i dated for a pretty long time in college, and continued with my current squeeze. The peculiar thing lately is the frequency, which has gone from maybe once or twice a month, to that many times a week, as well as the particular sexual act my unconscious mind seems to enjoy. Whereas until several months ago I would generally kiss and sort of gently thrust my sleeping buddy I now unconsciously perform analingus on her. Now don't get me wrong, we have been together for a while now and we are both fairly open minded, so i am not repulsed by this act. It is, however a fairly unusual and funny way to wake up.

**THE ISSUE**
This is very uncomfortable to talk about (so this is a throwaway) but my issue is this. I can achieve a full erection, however it won't stay ""100%"" for long, after a few moments (even wile having sex, or any other activity) I lose some of the stiffness. if I had to give a percentage to how hard it stays, I would say anything from 60%-70%. the only exception to this is masturbation (with myself) to ""finish"".

this doesn't bother me so much that ""Oh no i have a problem"" it bothers me that with this, my GF feels like she can't do enough for me, when in all honesty, i'm crazy about her, she does amazingly, but this is an ongoing problem and i dislike the fact that MY problem, makes HER feel like there is an inadequacy on HER part.

I'm not going to sit here and toot my own horn but I know how to spot a faker versus a girl who is genuinely pleased.(psych major) I offer the full package when it comes to passionate, sensitive, and considerate loving. I have read the Kama Sutra and various books on Tantric sex. Enough about my current level of sexual knowledge though, I come to Reddit with this question. How do I go about building more stamina and lasting longer? I get turned on really easy and its easy for me to achieve climax. I don't know if I last a short enough time to be considered ""Premature Ejaculation"", but I can go for about 4-5 minutes if its been 3-5 days since the last time I've had sex. Shorter if its been over a week or two. I'm a young lad, but by no means have I just been initiated into the glorious world of sex. I figured maybe over time and the more girls I was with, the longer I would be able to last but nothing seems to have changed over the course of 5 years and hundreds of sexual encounters with various partners. I have tried hypnosis and climax teasing, but to no avail. Any suggestions would be appreciated. 

Just some info that may help people diagnose my problem.
-I do get nervous when having sex because I know that I don't last as long as some guys can. It doesn't really interfere with my physical abilities but I know the thought of cuming doesn't help me psychologically. 
-I used to masterbate downstairs when I was a little pissant, I would try to climax as fast as possible as I didn't want to be discovered by the family members. (possibly muscle memory?)
-I do keegle exercises but I have not seen any improvement from this.
-I can climax and remain hard and after about 10 minutes climax again.

I'm a 24yo female, and I've been sexually active since I was about 20 or so.  I have absolutely no problem achieving orgasm through clitoral masturbation.  I've had a few sexual partners, but the most recent ones have brought something up.

I'm not sure how to describe it but I'll try: When having sex eventually I'll get to this point where suddenly something deep inside of me will feel amazingly good.  It's not like a ""wave"" crashing over me though like a clitoral orgasm is.  The way I've described it to my boyfriend is that it basically feels like the build up of the potential orgasm, but instead of the wave reaching it's peak and then subsiding, it will stay at the peak.  When I'm on top I can control how quickly this happens or not etc.  But once I'm at that point, as long as there's a penis moving inside me I'll stay at that point.  I wont come down from it unless if I have like 5-10 seconds of chill time.  Also this mostly only happens when having very deep penetrative sex, like when I'm on top, but it can happen in other positions as well.

While this is great in a sense it's kinda ridiculous.  The first time this happened was with my ex, who was actually pretty emotionally abusive to me.  When it happened with him he would tell me things like I was doing it wrong, and that I need to stop doing whatever was going on at the time because everything was a bad job, and all this stupid shit that I wasn't having an ""orgasm"" right.  So when it happened I always felt pretty anxious as I really can't imagine anything feeling better than that?  Like, if something felt better I'm pretty sure it would either hurt or I would literally pass out.


With my current boyfriend, who is incredibly understanding and wonderful, he's just curious about what was actually happening.  He thinks it's great either way though.

Also, unless he is thrusting during sex, if I'm grinding on him (not up-and-down), or if he tries to slow down, he loses his erection.  - eventually gets it back but only if he's the one masturbating himself, and we finish.

Sometimes it stays in between flaccid and hard and I can put it in and move, but because it stays that way for a bit I don't know if I am exciting him or not.

being as how the relationship is very limited to sexual interaction, I'm not as open as I would be with a lover and don't want to offend him if I ask him to explain what he feels - if it's normal - what he needs - how he likes it - what i can do differently, etc etc.  Maybe it's normal but I haven't experienced this with other guys.

I realized the -best- thing would be to find a way to talk about it, but was wondering if anyone who has also dealt with this (first or second hand), can give me some insight - I realize everyone's different, but maybe based on what others say, I know how to approach it.

Finally - the reason why this is on my mind isn't because it's bothering me, it's because I don't know if I am the one turning him off

I'm more fit and outgoing and have *much* more experience than my husband.  We agreed not to discuss my past relationships (most of my relationships had lots of exciting, fun sex).  I was my husband's first girlfriend and sexual experience.  

My husband is the forever alone type- introverted, into tech stuff, and spent his whole life in school and got a Phd in Math (not the most social guy).  We met online and I knew he was the one for me....he's perfect for me *except* that he's inexperienced at sex.  

I knew this when we got married and figured that I had enough experience for both of us and could teach him.  I'm also encouraged by the fact that we have good chemistry.  I've found that I'm not a very good teacher and believe it would be a better approach to learn things together.

My husband thinks the sex is amazing.  For me, the only time that the sex is okay is when I'm on top fucking him- he just lays there; no technique, no thrusting, no nothing.  Sex has become a chore for me and I don't want this to happen to our marriage.  Sex has always been one of my favorite things about life.

Does an asexual experience the elevated sexual desire normal in new relationships? http://www.youramazingbrain.org/lovesex/sciencelove.htm (I'm thinking no?)

Could an asexual fake wanting sex and being a good sex partner for a year or so - be convincing in their enthusiasm, etc?

If an asexual gave a partner consent, could they be led through arousal and climax and feel ok about it?

To what degree is asexual a different label for responsive desire?

I'd like to understand better how an asexual might behave similarly to a sexual person, but how that behavior would be different in some way. For example, perhaps an asexual might masturbate, but not to porn because porn, like all sexual expression, doesn't arouse them.

I was never a very sexually inclined person until about two years ago. A little after my 18th birthday I just exploded with hormones and suddenly could not stop thinking about sex. It was very strange for me and I just tried to ignore it. I grew up in a very conservative Christian household and would never have considered ever acknowledging any sort of dirty thoughts like that, let alone do anything about it. 

However starting around age 19, I started to lose my faith and I now consider myself an agnostic. With this loosening of my personal religious restraints I started to (gasp! The sinfulness of it!) do some online research. 

I was shocked to discover that many women masturbate. I had had a vague knowledge that a small percentage of perverted, lost women messed with themselves, but I had never known that outside of evangelical circles, aka the real world, female masturbation was not only common, but considered normal.

Around a year ago, I took the plunge and tried masturbated for the first time. It didn't feel like anything. I have read every ""how to"" thing I can find. Rubbing my clit feels like rubbing my elbow--there is absolutely no pleasure there at all. I have tried other methods as well--nothing.

The closest that I came to any sort of feeling was when I was staying at a hotel a couple of months ago and had access to a detachable shower-head. When I aimed the high intensity water at my clit, it was the first time that I had felt any sort of sensation there. But it wasn't pleasurable at all. It was actually unbearable and I couldn't stand it for more than a few seconds. 

I am horny all the time and constantly fantasize about sex. I have absolutely no problem getting myself aroused and wet from my imagination, but if I actually try to physically make my body experience anything else? Impossible.

I've read plenty about women struggling to climax or orgasm. My problem is that I don't feel pleasure AT ALL. 

It's extremely frustrating. 

Is this just a psychological block based on my strict religious upbringing in which anything sexual was from satan tempting us? Am I still feeling some sort of residual guilt? Will this go away when I finally have my first sexual encounter with another human? Is there something medically wrong with me? Should I see a doctor?

It just frustrates me because I read these stories about women having their first orgasms at age 13 and I can't seem to figure this crap out as an adult.

My ex-wife didn't like sex, but (begrudgingly) obliged blowjobs.  I became a fan of them.  New girlfriend seems to have an issue with giving them though she denies it.

TMI Scenario:  This weekend we're lying in bed and getting frisky, I bring her to orgasm with my hands, and afterward she starts to go down on me.  After a few minutes she stops and lies down.  Confused, I ignore it and suggest we go out for breakfast.  Asking later, she said she was feeling one of her bouts of queasiness.  (These seem to happen occasionally, not related to sex.)  A couple hours later, after she gets out of the shower I'm putting lotion on her and end up bringing her to orgasm again.  Things are going well, and she initiates going down on me again for a few minutes.  It's very start-stop with talking in between, but it's not actually contiguous enough to get close to cumming.  She suggests using the hitachi on herself whilst felating me and I agree she should go get it.  After she cums by vibrator, she stops and gets angry at me that I made her get it, that she doesn't want to be anybody's ""bitch"" and that she doesn't like the way I lie there acting like I'm ""entitled.""  Complete rage out of nowhere that I can't understand.

I consider myself a very generous lover and go down on her all the time.  I bring her to orgasm at least once a day while we're together.  With regular intercourse there is no issue, but when head is involved she freaks out.

A similar argument happened several months ago.

Clearly there's something there, but she doesn't seem to be able to talk about it when I ask.  She gets mad and misdirects and we can never really talk about the issue at hand.  The only thing I have to go on is that she feels that she has to do all the work.  I guess compared to everything else that we do sexually, this is true, but it's like she can't see that the other 95% of the time I'm the one making all the effort.

I'm a 20 y/o female who's been diagnosed by my gyno with ""vaginal hypersensitivity"" (not really helpful to me; I already knew that). Essentially, my problem is that inserting anything (tampon, penis, etc.) into my vagina hurts...but only for the first inch or so--once it gets past a certain point, there is little-to-no pain.

When I insert my finger to apply meds, I can feel quite well what seems to be going on. It will hurt (the pain is an extreme burning sensation), and then it's almost like something is blocking my finger. Once I move past the ""blockage"" the pain subsides for the most part. It usually burns for a while after, and sometimes even after I urinate.

The gyno told me to use hydrocortisone on it once a day for three months then come back in. He did a culture and said everything looked normal, and he did a pelvic too and didn't find anything abnormal (although he did say I had a rather small vagina).

I am almost wondering if it's some sort of issue with my hymen. I've had sex four times, and I'm about 95% sure that I ""broke"" my hymen (I know it's not really breaking it) when I was horseback riding when I was 13--I know the exact moment it happened. But if it is a problem with my hymen, shouldn't the gyno have noticed?

Has anyone else had a similar experience? 

Sorry for all the text, but this problem is kind of affecting my life. I don't use tampons (I had a terrible experience trying to get one out when I was younger; the pain was the exact same as what I have now), fingering hurts, even applying my medication hurts. Any advice is welcomed!

We've had our good and bad periods in the past (we had a 3 month 'dead bedroom' for a bit which was extremely difficult, but then things were picking up for around the last month and a half with fairly frequent sex) but we're again seemingly hitting a spell of no sex. My girlfriend has had intermittent issues with sexual pain, but for the most part they've been solved by patience and taking our time. The last month of sex (prior to the past 3 weeks of no sex) for the most part has not been painful and has been reasonably enjoyable for me and for her. Things were more vanilla than in the past and she didn't want me to go down on her anymore, but the intimacy and physicality were still really nice (for both of us), as was being desired (for me).


We haven't had sex for about three weeks, and my girlfriend has told me she just hasn't been in the mood. She has not changed her birth control in years, our relationship is in a fairly good place (we are very affectionate) aside from our sex issues, she does not drink excessively or do drugs and there are seemingly no other complicating medical factors (she isn't on any medication). I haven't put on weight and am in okay shape, and still put a lot of effort into my appearance, hygiene and grooming… She says she still finds me attractive (and for the most part, I believe her). 


We are both very comfortable being naked, affectionate and playful (all at the same time!) around each other and there is a lot of mutual love and investment in our relationship. We have got a lot better at discussing the topic but can't really seem to make any headway in it. She understands I am frustrated with the lack of sex, she feels guilty about her lack of desire… I try and communicate in a manner to show that I am not upset with her or blaming her (and I do not hold this against her) and she listens and communicates where her head and heart are at. 

She tells me that she has not really felt desirable or beautiful for a while (she is stunning and in great shape, and I try and tell and show her this every day we spend together - although I understand that this of course does not solve things) and this contributes to her lack of desire for sex. We kind of started to have sex this morning and she got a little sore (we didn't use lube like we usually do) so we stopped and were caressing each other, I told her she was so beautiful and she got very upset, turned around and started crying a little. She eats healthily, exercises (yoga 1-3 times a week) and is possibly/probably is going to get a gym membership soon. She is gorgeous but I understand that she does not see herself with the same eyes that I see her. I don't really know how to be any more supportive on this front. In addition, even times when her self-esteem has been better our sex drives have not really matched (mine higher) but the situation has not been so infrequent or bad. Our sex was less vanilla, more passionate, and she would sometimes climax from me going down on her. We would both initiate some and both generally desired sex.


Penetrative sex has generally not been super pleasurable for her (although occasionally we will hit a position/angle that she REALLY enjoys) and she can only orgasm from penetration very rarely (yes I know this is the case for the majority of women) while I can the majority of the time. I try and put a lot of effort into learning to be a better lover, listening and responding to her desires, and just generally being a good and satisfying sexual partner. I won't claim to be a casanova in the bedroom, I have a lot to learn, but I think I'm okay. I love going down on her and am always happy to (and always offer to before/after intercourse if she doesn't orgasm) but for the last month of sex [prior to the dry spell] she has not wanted me to. I'm not really sure what other sexual activities to engage in that she can enjoy or orgasm from… She doesn't really desire to be fingered when we were having sex the last few times, and just kinda wanted me to get hard, use lube, and have sex. This also made me feel a bit less desirable and almost selfish and that she was just doing it for my pleasure rather than hers.

I'm not really sure where to go from here, besides simply being more patient and supportive towards her self-esteem situation. I am totally open to trying anything in the bedroom whatsoever and have communicated this to her, suggesting that I am open to anything she wants to do/try and am happy to go halters on buying a toy or anything that might make sex more enjoyable for her. She has said she wants us to have a good sex life, although this was qualified by ""if it'll make you happy"" which kinda worries me a bit. She worries we are going to break up over this and I reassure her that I love her and have patience left in me, and this is the truth. But it still is hard for me to cope. I don't think I have a particularly high sex drive, more of an average one… but after a week and a half of no sex I get a bit more irritable regarding our relationship and little issues I'd otherwise be unperturbed by begin to bother me more, and this just gets more difficult to deal with the longer we don't have sex for. I have gotten a lot better and patient at dealing with this, but I hate feeling this way and building any resentment towards the situation and my relationship. She has told me she doesn't really enjoy giving oral so on the occasion when she does offer that instead I am not really turned on by it (and can't get even close to orgasm from it) and hand jobs are pretty unsatisfying. I would be far more satisfied of a sexual session which consisted of some mutually enjoyable play (i.e. me going down on her, something I love, with her enjoying it) than her giving me oral which she didn't enjoy. I just want to be able to have mutually enjoyable sex with her.


I tend to start feeling really guilty at the thought of initiating as I don't want to make her feel pressured or put her in the situation of having to reject my advances AGAIN, and she has started to feel anxious towards foreplay (when we were kissing naked a bit and things were getting a little heated she stopped me, saying that she ""[was] scared"". We cuddled for a bit and then we both kinda reinitiated. I love my girlfriend very much and I think we are really compatible in a lot of ways. This issue is becoming really difficult and I don't know what to do, suggest, or how to support or help my partner from here. I've read the FAQs, a bunch of other stuff, and her and I have had a few conversations on this. I am not at my wits end but I am confused and lacking direction on where to move forward from this. I worry that the situation is going to get worse. My girlfriend doesn't have any thoughts on how to improve things either. 

Any insight or advice on how to start repairing things would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.

We have so much sex (esp on the weekends) that I usually get really horny but end up sore and can't go on. This is like, after 6+ sessions (lately we've been holing up over the weekend with work). 

IDK, I do have small orgasms here and there, but I haven't had a big one in a while. Also I've been having weird Birth Control related spotting (which I'd also appreciate input on, it's been like 6 months of irregular spotting), so I haven't been receiving oral. 

TL;DR I need tips on how to get off faster, or just how to have a mind-blowing orgasm. ",,False,,t5_2shg2,False,,,True,t3_101j8p,http://www.reddit.com/r/sexpertslounge/comments/101j8p/stepping_up_the_orgasms_f/,

It hurts a lot. More than I expected, more than I can endure. I've managed to bite a pillow and last long enough to get a very rushed and minimal orgasm from him, but we both want more.

The first time hurt so much it took an entire day to recover. And my bowel movements haven't been the same since. It still functions, but it takes more time and effort than before, and the straining now gives me a headache. That was a while ago, last year at least.

1. She cheated on me years ago before we got married while I was away for the summer, and I forgave her but now she snoops though my phone every chance she gets and she knows it pisses me off but when I tell her that she gets mad and tells me if Im hiding something, and if Im not I have nothing to worry about. This kinda came to a climax when she hijacked my facebook account and made me delete all the girls I knew that she didnt.I have since got back my account but she still freaks out when I add a girl she doesnt know.

2. Like my headline says I love my wife but I really hate the person she is sometimes. She bosses me around. Takes her work frustration out on me and i let her get away with everything she does.  She treats me like shit for a few days then apologizes and tells me she doesnt deserve me and asks me why Im still with her. and again I tell her I love her and forgive her and so on but It all just starts again. IM the farthest thing from the old stereotypical male who just tells his wife to get back in the kitchen. 

3. (yea i said 2 but fuck it) lastly I dont think Im attracted to her anymore. Shes a very cute chubby girl and Im down with bigger girls, but shes not any fun in bed anymore. Its gotten to the point where i can make her cum in less than a minute without any foreplay and she wont even let me do down on her anymore. but the kicker is that when i make her cum then I want to come too but sometimes it takes a while and she starts to get mad. Partly cause Im taking too long and partly cause she thinks she doesnt turn me on anymore. And sometimes I feel bad about finishing because I feel like im using her as a fuck toy to finish myself off. anyway I have no idea what to do and I spend alot of time away from home so my mind starts to wander and that scares the shit out of me.

Throughout my history of having sex, it had become apparent that I was not like other men. 

Premature ejaculation is an affliction that seems to easily affect many men in any age group, but I, on the other hand, have the exact opposite. To put it simply, I am a lot of work to get off.

I've noticed several things that I have to put a considerable amount of mental and physical concentration to orgasm. Too much to effectively implement in an intense and passionate act of intercourse. 

I suppose it might be the result of over a decade's worth of dry masturbation.

Also, I can't seem to get off unless I stretch and tense up my legs in a rigid, board-like manner. Also hard to implement during intercourse.

This problem has been brought to the forefront when, during the very latest sexual tryst with my newest partner, I made her orgasm roughly four times and was no where near to orgasm myself. Luckily, she's nice enough to focus on me afterward and makes me cum in her mouth, so I get my share of fun in the end.

This problem is complicated, because I realize that there are men who would seemingly die to be in my situation since:

1. I don't lose things in 30 seconds, and can continue for quite some time.

2. If I cannot orgasm during intercourse, that nearly destroys any possibilities of unwanted pregnancy.

But I am DESPERATE at this point to know that feeling of just letting go inside a woman.

Any suggestions?

Two days ago I ran into a female friend that I had a crush on in high school. We were at a party and had been talking all night. I was hammered drunk and feeling ballsy so I went in for a kiss... she kissed me back! She asked why we never hooked up in high school and I then told her how bad I wanted that to happen back then. She told me it wasn't too late and to get up with her next time I'm in town. That time will be next week. 

While I was in high school I had a girlfriend and lots of sex, but after we broke up and I went to college I got more into exploring my mind via drugs. Slowly my interest in sex fell to the wayside and before I knew it I was graduating and 5 years had passed since I last had a romp. It's been about 5 1/2 years total with absolutely no sex at all, even though I do masturbate often.

SO, I need advice! When I first started having sex I had a lot of trouble with PE. I overcame it by taking supplements like Cockstar and those supplements work well! I think Ill go that route again mainly because it's a week away and I also don't want to embarrass myself. The thing is, I've not sure if those will even work after so long. I DO have a Fleshlight that I use regularly and I can go for about 15 min with it. Also, I'm in my mid 20's if that helps at all.

1333544140.0,9,self.sexpertslounge,rsspq,Marriage feeling like a companionship with a great roommate.  Sex rare and unsatisfying.  Advice?  (lengthy),10,1,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/sexpertslounge/comments/rsspq/marriage_feeling_like_a_companionship_with_a/,"I don’t feel like I’m in a relationship anymore… I feel like I have a phenomenal best friend and roommate, but the physical aspect of our relationship is albeit non-existent.  I hear old married couples warnings regarding the lack of physical relationships, but I’ve been married less than two years and am only 27 years old… according to the ‘elders’ wisdom of many, these are the ‘fun’ years.  According to them, they were going at it like bunnies at this point in time.  If I have no romance now, what do I have to look forward to?

•	I’ll start by saying that I have a very high libido.  If I could go for multiple hours a session, multiple times a day, I would.  My wife is non-existent.  It wasn’t always that way…

•	I’ve tried every romantic thing I can think of.  I can spontaneously bring home flowers.  I can make dinner.  I can give back, foot, shoulder, neck, scalp massages (which are now *asked* for and *expected* and my wife gets quite pouty if I don’t immediately step up).  I can do any combination of these things and have even taken her to a spa for relaxation.

•	I may see physical sex once every 10 days or so.  Even then, it’s not exactly satisfying.  I climax, sure, but half the time my wife just lies there, typically complains of discomfort if she’s not 100% comfortable in every way, and has a very passive look on her face with her eyes closed most of the time.  It doesn’t instill confidence that she wants me.  It just feels like she’s ‘taking it’ to appease me.  Don’t get me wrong, sometimes it’ll come in ebb and flow and I’ll see a day or two almost consecutively.  But it’s rare, and I ~~practically~~ have to beg.

•	If I ask for sex, even if it’s a ‘romantic’ insinuation, I’m told it turns her off.

•	There’s almost never any foreplay.  She doesn’t like to ‘touch’ me, absolutely hates giving oral (she cramps, it’s unpleasant, bad tastes, etc), and typically it’s done within 20 minutes (if not less).

•	She climaxes (or at least claims to).  She swears she’s never ‘faked,’ and for the most part I believe her, because the few times we do get intimate, if she cannot climax, she gets rather frustrated.  But to further my conviction that she does, there are the physiological anecdotes that go along with it, which are rather telling.  I *do* pay attention! 

•	Even when trying to kiss my wife passionately, if not to say “honey, I’m home and glad to see you.”  She starts giving choppy, quick pecks as if to say “I’m done kissing you now, stop.”

•	If we talk about any of this, and we have (as it’s a huge point of contention between us), she gets even more ‘put-off’ because she hates the fact that she doesn’t make me happy (she cares; I know she loves me).  We’ve had some calm, adult conversations, and some rather heated debates regarding the topic.  At the end of the conversation (which is typically after I express my feelings on the subject), I normally receive a response such as “I don’t know what you want me to do about it.  I just don’t want to have sex.”

•	I’ve never been unfaithful.  Though the thought has crossed my mind.  And I feel like a terrible person for having had those thoughts.  And that’s kind of why I’m here.  I’m hoping for some advice.  I want to make my wife happy, and I don’t want to be the typical “I have needs” kind of guy.  I want to be happy too.  Even if there’s some herb I can take to completely turn me off, I’d love to hear the option.

•	I do ‘take care of myself’ when I have the chance.  It’s not enough.  I require physical human contact and emotion, and the breathing, and wanting, and lusting.  I miss it so.  But lately, my wife left her career to start her own business.  She’s in the very beginning stages of the business and so she is home when I leave and when I return from work.  I don’t really feel comfortable taking care of myself when she’s home.

•	I’ve gotten to the point where I can’t sleep at night, lying awake with the proverbial “blue balls.”  I can’t stop thinking about wanting sex in general, falling asleep and waking up with a quite tenacious erection.  Last night, I actually left the bed and slept in the guest room because the tension (from my end) was unbearable, and otherwise I could not sleep.  I’m a very healthy (health conscious) individual, and typically I fall asleep within 15 minutes of hitting the pillow, sleep through the night, and awake on my own refreshed before the alarm clock goes off.  Now I’m lucky if I sleep 5 hours a night, tossing and turning due to my ‘frustration.’

•	When my wife and I first started dating, we couldn’t keep our hands off of each other (6.5 years ago, now).  Life was fantastic.  I left for military duty (training) for 3 months, saw her for a weekend, left for 4 more months, but was able to see her 3 weekends throughout that time.  This was 3 years ago.  It was when I returned that I proposed and we were married 9 months later.  It was shortly before I left that our sex life started to stagger.  I assumed it was because I was living 2 hours away (for my career) and she felt uncomfortable with physical things as she was living with her sister, who was almost always home when we were there.  It was when I returned from training that it became almost nonexistent.

This is probably more than enough information to give you a picture of what I’m facing currently.  I’m not sure what to do… any thoughts, advice, or experience in this would be more than appreciated.

What do I feel that I need: a semi-consistent physical relationship.  Someone who *wants* me, desires me, lusts for me in a way I long for her.  I want a tender, loving relationship with the thrills of wild, romantic sex, with all of the foreplay and all of the sweaty, forceful, primal nature of the epitome of passion.  I guess I want to be wanted as much as I want…

Best,
-J

Edit: I'm not sure if it adds to the content or is relevant, but there are several instances where I'm ""promised"" sex, typically prior to bed.  When the time comes, she will either claim 'not feeling well,' 'extremely fatigued,' or lately, she'll purposely go for a bath before bed, knowing full well I have work early, and will remain in there until I fall asleep, or it's basically too late for me to do anything, due to having to arise at a specific time.",,False,,t5_2shg2,True,,,True,t3_rsspq,http://www.reddit.com/r/sexpertslounge/comments/rsspq/marriage_feeling_like_a_companionship_with_a/,

Sex in the first 6-8months was good and was happening pretty often. We're both in our early twenties, and we've had a few rough patches.. but.. sex life has definitely gone down over the past two months.

I always have to initiate and she only seems to want to have sex after she's got ready for bed. Which leads to a lack of spontaneity I guess.. So at the moment we have sex 1-2 times a week. A couple weeks ago we had foreplay for about 20-30 minutes but when it came to the act she was bone dry, and that was definitely a bit of an ego dent....

She has trouble orgasm'ing but managed to get her to climax once by oral.. I often find that if I do manage to get her close she forces me to stop.. I've asked what she likes and how I can make it better but never really get an answer out of her..

I asked if she masturbates and she said she doesn't and never gets the urge to.. She also said that she found the fact that I masturbate creepy. Although not an issue I guess it gives further light on the issue?

Recently the lack of passion and me feeling that I'm basically quilting her into having sex with me have started to think she's getting it elsewhere but.. rationally I don't think that would ever happen.

We tend to be quite open and everything but I'm not sure how to broach this one..

I would prefer at LEAST twice a week. I don't think that's expecting too much. The issue is that we do mostly the same thing every time. Sometimes with foreplay, sometimes without, we have sex for a little while, and then I get on top (if I'm not there already) and use penis and our vibrator to make her cum. I cum promptly afterward. And its... fine.
My concern is that its really the same thing over and over again, and where she says she would like to change it up a bit, she doesn't ever offer any suggestions, but any suggestions I may have, she doesn't seem interested in. She doesn't seem to have any sexual fantasies... which seems ridiculous considering how many fantasies I have.
We recently stopped using condoms (shes on the pill and we don't have std/sti), but she still wants me to put a condom on before things get intense and we start orgasming. I'm fine with it if that's what she wants, I feel happy enough that I don't have to wear one the entire time. That was something I talked her into that made things more exciting for both of us, but it hasn't changed too much.
Anyway, what do I do about this? Any suggestions on how to make things more exciting, or how to get her more excited about sex? How to impress to her that I'd like to have more sex without her breaking down in tears because she thinks that I think that shes not good enough for me and that I'm going to dump her?

She get's really raucous in bed when we get drunk together, but by that point I'm numb as a dental patient, and then I can't orgasm. How can I get her drunk-excited about sex without getting her drunk?

That didn't work.  So I went back asking about the results, cause the thrush tablet didn't work. And then she said it was definitely thrush, but I'm not even sure she gave me the results. She then prescribed me a tablet to take via mouth but that hasn't work either.  The pain seems to just be getting worse now and I'm getting so upset about it..

His issue is he finishes before I do and it's starting to annoying both of us, he feels ashamed because I'm not getting the same amount of pleasure. I take a while before I start feeling anything good happening and just as I feel I'm really getting somewhere, he's telling he's about to cum. I don't get to finish fully (just because I don't have an orgasm doesn't mean I don't like having sex with him) and I would like too.


So what's something's that can help me? We've tried him on top, me on top, lots of foreplay (rubbing me down there, kissing my nipples) and all the speeds. I once came close to having an orgasm but I starting feeling the urge to be sick and had to stop... Kinda sucked. 


Also, after he cums he still has a full erection.. (Dont know whether lucky or not) Would it be worth going again after he finishes? He might take longer to finish the second time. First time is with a condom, maybe the second without one? (I'm on the pill, so don't freak out!)

We are both 22 and this is the longest relationship for either of us and by far the most serious as well. For a little background she was a virgin until we started dating and I am by no means an expert. For the entirety of our relationship we've never really had sex, we've tried, used to try much more often in the early stages but it is so painful to her that it just isn't worth it.  She has visited her gyno who says there is nothing physically wrong that would cause this pain however she has been diagnose with PCOS, but I don't know that this really has any correlation to the painful act of penetration.  

I am by no means anything larger than averagely endowed so I don't think that's the problem. Also she claims the pain is the same when I try to penetrate with even a single finger or even when she's tried to use tampons in the past, even during regular gyno exams or pap smears she emerges near tears from the pain of the exam. We still pleasure each other with manual/oral but this is really putting a huge kink in our relationship. Any advice on what could be causing such intense pain for her and how we might be able to fix it?

I've been reading a lot and am leaning towards that the cause is Vaginismus but I'd certainly appreciate some outside help and if anyone agrees perhaps some methods of treating the issue.

I have a few questions regarding this that I'd love to have answered to give me a better idea of what to expect, intercourse-wise. Thanks a ton for any and all answers!

1. In term of condoms, does anyone have suggestions? I guess my actual measurements will probably be helpful here: length is 6 inches/15.25cm, girth is also 6 inches. I tried to do some research, but from what I was seeing online there was very little with actual measurements of what size the condom is made for, and more with ambiguous labels like ""small"", ""normal"", ""large"", ""x-large"". I'd rather not buy a bunch of different condoms and try them all on, but maybe that's what I have to do?

2. I've certainly heard stories of girls having discomfort with longer penises, but is the same true for thicker penises? I've been told that some girls will have a difficult time fitting thicker penises into their vaginas, to say it in the most anatomically correct way possible. I'm not sitting here thinking I'm monstrous or anything, but is my size gonna be a problem in terms of discomfort or fitting?

3. This feels silly to ask, but will that discomfort or fitting issue be worse with Asian girls? Obviously everyone is different, so it wouldn't be a problem with EVERY Asian girl, but I've been told that Asian girls are generally tighter than non-Asians. Is this even true? If so, will it give me problems in possible future sexual encounters with Asian girls?

4. Is there a difference in the woman's experience between a wider (mine is considerably wider than it is tall, to the point of being a little less wide than my ipod) and a more circular penis? Not really concerned about it or anything, more curious. I've seen people suggesting that a wider penis might do more in terms of moving a woman's clitoris around during sex, and I've also seen people suggesting that a more circular penis might do more in terms of hitting the g-spot. Any experiences or information on that?

5. I guess this is just a general question about the female experience with thick penises. What's it like? What kind of an experience is a sex partner of mine likely to have (once I get past cumming before penetration even begins)?

Thanks again for any little bit of information you can provide me! My exact measurements are hidden there in question #1, and I'll just let you look there rather than writing them again, because I don't want to seem like a douchebag who just wants to brag!

Anyway, we happened across a position which turns out is pretty intense. I can't do it like that for long because it's simply too much, but that's not the point. I've never heard mention of anything similar, nor seen it in any videos (I'm pretty nomdadic, video wise - I've seen pretty much all there is to see, or some variant of it). It's sorta secret, and I've only told my friend so far, but I realise this is the internet, so eh.

Anyway, now for the description. The guy/me is down on the bed like I'm playing crab football. She then climbs on top, facing me. Because of the way my legs are arched, it makes a sort of back rest for her, if you like, although you can move things about as you see fit. Her legs are arched the same way, and go under my arms, meaning my shoulders also have somewhere to rest. I do what I want with my hands/arms, it doesn't really matter.

I'll list why this position is awesome:

* We're both really close together, and I can embrace her, kiss her etc.
* She's sitting directly on top of me, so it's about the deepest penetration you can get.
* It's reasonably comfortable.
* I have hands free to do whatever I want with, hold her boobs, pinch her nipples, rub her clit, slap/scratch her (kinda kinky like that).
* I'm a boob guy, and I love to suck and abuse them, and they just so happen to be at face height, which is perfect for me. She loves it too.
* If we've been going for a very long time and I get tired, then it's easy for her to simply take over on top, or for us to roll onto our sides.

So, I doubt I'm actually the first to come across this position, so I was wondering what it's called.

So my problem is that I can never cum when I'm with another person. Meaning, I can't cum from sex, from bj's, from handies, I can't even get myself off in the presence of another person. I come nowhere near orgasm. It isn't ED, I have no problem maintaining an erection, I just never gets close to orgasm. In fact, it starts to just not feel good at all, it starts to feel like rubbing a finger would and then it gets boring.

It's almost like I get hard but not horny.

I've had sex with two people multiple times who I am certain I was very attracted to, and couldn't orgasm on any of the occasions we had sexual contact. I first had sex 2 or 2 1/2 years ago and the problem has been present since the first time.

I have no problems masturbating by myself. Although, I did use to masturbate strangely up until about two months ago. I used to always have to hump a pillow, but I made it my goal to learn to masturbate normally and now I do.

I've tried not masturbating for a couple days before a day I might have sex, but it doesn't seem to help.
I'm not on any medications.

I'm circumcised, I don't usually use lube when I masturbate but I have tried lube during sex and it didn't help.

I'm an 18 y/o gay male.

If there's any other information you think you may need go ahead and ask. I just want to get your opinions on what the problem may be, I haven't been to a doctor in a little over a year and I'm still on my parents health insurance so I don't want to ask them to schedule a checkup for this (they are very conservative people).

I'm a 21 year old gay male and I'm normally a bottom. For the past few months, I was having lots of sex with anonymous males - about 3 or 4 men per week, totaling about 40 men since I've been abroad. Prior to and during all this sex, I had an insatiable libido and would jack off at least once per day, often to extreme porn (dominition, SM, gangbang, etc.). My sex drive has been overwhelmingly strong ever since I was 12, so it had been going full steam ahead for 9 years straight. 

However, a little over a month ago, I had an unprotected threesome with a random couple and immediately went on post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to reduce the risk of contracting HIV.

In a sense, it's liberating, but it's also a little worrysome because I'm seeing a guy that I really like and I can't be the sexual beast I want to be.

However, I have been lurking /r/sex and /r/sexpertslounge.... giggling over some stories, and sitting in quiet contemplation while pondering others.  I thank you for your guys' candidness and openess.  &lt;3  So, bear with, I actually have two questions here. :)

I am 24 years old (female), and I've never really been able to masturbate.  Sure, I can put my hands there and do things, but it was always just so... boring.  I always thought it should be fun.  Trust me--I tried and wanted to.  I poked, prodded, rubbed, swirled.... I bought all sorts of toys: dildos of various sizes, shapes, colors, textures, styles.... I've experimented with butt play, I've tried vibrators, I've tried vegetables.... I mean.  I'm pretty creative.  But none of it felt good, none of it made me climax, and none of it was *fun*. :(  I'm also in the local BDSM scene, and haven't found any good tips there.  Seems like everyone can, does, and enjoys masturbating but me!! :O

To that end, I've never really had a sex drive, like... at all.  It really interfered with my relationships, up until the past 4 months or so.  For the past four months I've been with this guy who drives me wild and I feel like if I got sex with him twice a day every day for the next year it still wouldn't be enough.  We have sex EVERY day, with maybe 4 exceptions a month.... three of those fall on my period until we get fed up and put towels down. &gt;:D  I am a happy, happy girl. :3

The only thing that got a good reaction was watching porn.... it would make my lady bits kind of throb, and that was fun.  It was like foreplay kind of, except that my SO's have never really been into porn.  I think to this day I have only watched like 5 or 6 different pornos.

So, I discovered reddit a few months ago, and then subreddits after that.  Like I said, I've been lurking... not really wanting to make an account until this morning.  I got to thinking that maybe I want too much sex and it might be putting a strain on my partner.  So I thought ""hmmmn, I'll see if there's anything sexy on reddit I could watch.""

One one of the female porn subreddits a link was posted to this porn of this asian newscaster who is trying to give a report in japanese while being fucked.  (Actually really hot!! haha)  It was so hot, I thought ""what the hell, I'll try fingering myself.""  And.... omg--it felt great!!  Seriously! :D

I was so excited, I kept at it, propping my tablet up on a pillow on the bed and furiously happily fingering myself.

See, reddit, when I come I tend to squirt sometimes.  Especially with clitoral stimulation.  Which is what I was doing.  I've always been afraid that all that squirting was coming from my urinary tract---that it was pee.  ""I mean, how else could I be spitting out that much fluid?? This is seriously a LOT..."" I would think to myself.  I always try to discreetly smell the liquid after we're done and check the color just to make sure.  I enjoy doing it, but sometimes when I'm riding him and I come and squirt I worry that I may have just peed on him. :(

So, I'm going to town, and smelling it and it smells like NOT pee. (Whew! Yay!  I am paranoid for no reason because this is a normal female function!) But then I start really going, and then when I'm done I smell it (again, I know, I know....) and it's all goopy and SMELLING LIKE PEE.  Omg. :(  Reddit, I finally enjoy manual sex and then I make a huge mess of it. :(  And now I feel apprehensive about playing with myself AND having sex tonight.  Blah. :( 

So, it was his bed.  At his house.  The sheets are in the wash right now.  I am washing up. :(

Anyone know about the physiology of squirting or something?  The internet isn't terribly fruitful.

Anyone have the same experience with having no sex drive and then all of a sudden being launched into one?  It wasn't like I was on the pill or anything either.  Just... normal development.  Maybe because I didn't start my period until I was 17?

Anyone else find manual stimulation boring like I did?

He watches porn and masterbates almost daily. We have sex about three times a week. I'm happy with the sex and he is, too. 

Recently, I discovered that he has been chatting online with other women about what it would be like to have sex with them. He flirts and leads them on, but does not act on these chats. He says this fulfills somthing sexual for him, like sex chat lines or porn viewing. 

 In addition to, but not as a result of these chats, he has been physically unfaithful twice--only once with each woman (and both while drunk), and since finding this out, we have broken up, reconciled and are both seeking therapy. 

I believe he has issues, but I don't know if addiction is the correct wording. Or at least ""sex"" or ""porn"" addiction. Is it attention addiction? 
He doesn't have a problem with too much fapping. And he doesn't have a problem getting off or desiring me. I don't have a problem with his porn viewing, unless that underminds our relationship.

I have two questions, I will go more into detail about the each of them in the next section of my post.  
1.  How do I get my girlfriend to squirt?
2. How is it possible to get my girlfriend to overcome her ridiculous fears about anal and anal play?


So, as promised more details.

1.  Ever since I've seen female ejaculation in porn I was intrigued by it, even skeptical on if it was real.  I read up on and came to the obvious conclusion that it was.  My girl and I have been dating for nearly a year so a couple months ago I mentioned it to her and she was open to it, so we tried it to no avail.  Then I read Maxxters article about it to become more informed on the subject and we've tried it a few more times sense.  Here is the issue.  I get her to the point where she is squirming from how good it feels, her g-spot is swelled up a good amount, the ""Squshing and vacuum life sound"" are present and her vagina is tightly clenching my fingers.  But every time I my arm literally gets so tired I can't keep a proper rhythm (this is after about 5 minutes by the way) and we always come up short.  What can I do to help her achieve a healthy, amazing female ejaculation? 


2.  My girlfriend and I have talked about anal and ass play numerous times (I sort of have a fetish for it), and we've gone as far as her not minding me licking her ass and her allowing me to try fingering her ass with my pinky (which we did not do correctly due to my misunderstanding of the subject) so it hurt her a bit and we stopped.  After reading further on this anal I learned a lot and showed my girlfriend some articles on it.  She's sort of open to trying again but has some ridiculous fears.  Number one is she's afraid that no matter what we do it will hurt, unbearably.  I let her read about it and assured her that if done correctly, there will be little to no pain, and if there is any we can stop.  Second off, she's convinced that because of the size of my penis which she says is really big, I think it's not too impressive but whatever, her asshole will be permanently gaped or spread open from it.  If need be my penis is 7.5 inches long circumcised with a 6 inch girth.

We started fooling around, and at first I couldn't get anything from her because I was too nervous to want her to even try.  Eventually, she just felt like it was weird for me to go down on her and her not to do anything, so she went down on me, and of course, I had problems getting up.  I get really hard during foreplay and kissing, and I have morning wood, so I don't think i'm physically ill.  It really didn't make her feel good about anything, and it was just weird, I could tell how annoyed she was.  A week or two later, she tried again, and it worked!  So we kept fooling around and I was able to cum from her giving me handjobs and stuff, but then we started thinking about sex. 

We were standing up, kissing, she was starting to rub me, I was hard, and she told me to stick it in.  I was able to go for maybe 10-20 seconds, but then I was starting to get soft.  We tried different positions and rubbing it semi-hard on her area, but nothing worked, I was just getting softer.  She was really upset and it was pretty bad...

Anyways, we just resorted to more fooling around for a few weeks, and we tried doing it again.  I was so confident and not nervous, but yet again, same problem.  I can tell that if it happens again, things might go really really badly.  

Last night (a few nights after our last attempt at sex) she tried just fooling around with me and doing stuff to me, and I was having the same problem I had at the start: I just couldnt get up when she was doing stuff to me.  She tried for a while, doing things that almost always make me hard, no luck.   To add though (which was probably dumb of me), I took half an adderall that night a few hours before we tried fooling around, so I HOPE that was the reason fooling around didnt work.  

TLDR;  I have some questions regarding sex! (not really a tldr, but anyways..)

1.  Do pills like cialis or viagra help with anxiety related problems with erections?  If I took one of those pills before hand, would I be fine?

2.  Can taking adderall for just one night cause more nervousness and anxiety and be the reason for erectile problems? (im not someone who normally takes or ever needs adderall)

3.  If I take cialis or something just once, would I become dependent?

I'm a 26 year old male. I've been sexually active since 19 or 20 (college years) with a couple of women, but I've never had intercourse (only sexual contact/up to third base).

When I was in college, I was a typical horny guy. I was aroused easily, watched porn occasionally and masturbated once a week or so. When I was with my first partner I easily got hard just from being close to her, and after orgasms, I was able to stay hard as if nothing had happened. With my second partner, I have had the same experience for the first few years (I am currently seeing her). 

It's been several years since then and I have noticed a progressive decrease in everything over the past 18-24 months. It's more difficult for me to become hard and I'm not as hard as I used to be. I even think my penis has gotten smaller. After having an orgasm, I immediately go limp. I am intimate with my gf about once a week. If I try to become intimate with her within 48 hours of my last orgasm, I struggle to get hard and stay hard. If it's a week later, it is a little easier, but my erections are definitely not as fulfilling as they once were. Also, I talked to my doctor; he didn't see anything abnormal and my testosterone levels were okay. Even my partner has noticed this change and sometimes she feels she's the reason why, as if she isn't doing something right or I don't find her attractive any more, which is certainly not the case. I still very much love her and she turns me on. However, I just don't feel as horny as I used to. I have almost completely stopped watching porn and masturbating as I don't ""feel"" like doing it.

I'm not obese, I exercise every now and then, my diet isn't terrible. I'm struggling to find out why my sex drive has taken a dive. 

I don't feel like I have ED as I can get an erection, but I wish it could be like I was 20 years old again. I'm only 26, I shouldn't be having these issues right? The only things I can think of are :

* my environment has changed since college and I'm not around many 20-something attractive females often
* it's just a normal fact of life that this happens to people as the get older, even at 26
* I don't have intercourse, so instead I do a lot of dry humping and grinding which may put a lot of pressure on my penis. I never have felt pain as if I sprained a muscle, but it could be possible that maybe I broke it....who knows?  But then why does my sex drive suck?
* I watched too much porn and that has affected me some how? But I haven't watched porn in a year or so...and masturbation is about once every few months. The last time I masturbated, I forced myself to do it because I wanted to see if it would help with my problem.

Most recently I have asked my gf to pleasure me but stop before I orgasm so that I stay somewhat horny afterwards. It seems to help, but it's kind of a bummer that in order to keep myself excited, I have to avoid an orgasm.

My wife and I have been together for 6 years (married for 4 years).  We have two kids, three and 6 months.  I'm 26 and she's 27.  For about the past 3ish years, sex has been shitty.  She says that I don't stimulate her, and then she lays there like a log, so then I'm not excited, blah blah blah.

We had an argument about it tonight, and I asked her what she wanted me to do differently.  Her response was ""everything"".  From the way I kiss/lick on her back to go down on her, everything needs to change.

Needless to say this is crushing to my already waning confidence, which makes it difficult to maintain an erection.  I used to be really good at getting her turned on, and now I'm basically crap.

She is only my 2nd sexual partner, (I'm #5 for her) and things used to be really good for a few years.  Now they suck (See above).

I'm not opposed to new methods/techniques, but I don't know where to start.

I need to switch things up, but I don't know how.

So, I suppose the short of it is I need to know how to kiss differently, touch differently, caress differently, etc.  I just don't know how else to do anything differently, just kind of ""the way I do things"".

So, straight to it. My penis is a bit oversensitive, specifically on the top of the head. Whenever I start out having sex, it's fine, but after a while it starts to feel really uncomfortable, painful almost, to have that spot directly stimulated. 

I'm in a healthy sexual relationship, and we've found ways around it. During penetration, I can angle my hips up, entering downward, and use medium/shallow thrusting. this helps avoid pressure on the overstimulated spot. We can still bring each other to climax.

She kisses/caresses my neck, ears, lips, and chest, and inner thigh. These spots give me pleasure but it I'm still flaccid.  I rarely obtain an erection while ensuing other activity (giving oral sex, kissing, foreplay).  The one sure way to experience an erection is to manually stimulate my penis, but it is difficult to obtain results.  I believe erectile dysfunction runs in my family (dad and grandfather).  

Climax is also difficult to achieve by means of a partners stimulation.  Through masturbation it is successful but I feel bad that I can please her to multiple orgasms but she can't please me to a consistent one. This has been a common theme throughout previous sexual engagements with others.  Communication seems to aid in the climaxing but not the non-penile stimulation issue.

Mental / Mindset concerns 

1. While im masturbating my head is filled with lots of thoughts and desires about the girls in my life that i would like to date and the things id like them to do with me, but as soon as i climax my mind flips a switch and i have a very strong repulsion for all of those acts and activities. i no longer want to deal with anything of a sexual nature, in fact if i were with a female partner i would do whatever was needed to get her to leave me alone or just plain leave,(very shitty i know), even if it took a lot of effort to get her involved with me. i fear that if i were to get into a relationship i would ultimately push her away due to my inability to continue the sexual desires past the point of climax.. DEA have this issue?

Physical anomaly 

2. Is it possible to have hypersensitivity of the penis (glans)? I feel i may have hypersensitivity for touch, but it is most noticeable to me when it involves anything touching my penis.  The best way i can explain it is that most people say that sex with out a condom feels ""AMAZING"", and that sex with a condom "" they cant feel anything"".  For me sex with a condom feels ""AMAZING"" to the point where i have to use the numbing condoms and even then the first ""pop"" is always within 10 thrusts.. and sex without a condom, (more than 5 thrusts), is impossible. the fact that i am hypersensitive to begin with doesn't go away once i cum, in fact it gets to the point that if anything touches my penis after, i will use all my strength to end the contact, regardless of what it is.

These 2 issues work in conjunction to put me in a weird limbo area, such that i want to have lots and lots of sex so i can get used to the feeling of sex but i cant get over  the ""post-orgasmic sex hate"" that comes after the very quick finale.

Pleasure all round, i just want it to come from fucking 

3. I am not worried i wont be able to bring her to climax ,i feel i have mastered cunnilingus due to the fact i cant fuck the brains out of my partner and bring her to climax that way. It is a goal of mine to be able to outlast any woman on my first round, and not have to force myself through the disgust of sex after my 1st &amp; 2nd rounds end, and wait till round 3 starts where my dick is numb enough from the numbing rubbers that i can do actual fucking. Is there a mindset i could force myself into that could help?

TLDR: want to fuck like a rabbit, but having issues with sensitivity both physically throughout sex &amp; mentally post-orgasm toward sexuality.

I cleaned it off with a napkin. He stood by the bed afterwards (we were getting ready to put the condom on and go for round two), and I noticed he still had some cum on the tip. I kinda sloppily licked/kissed it off (he moved just before making contact), and I got some on my lips. Lips went tingly/numb. This has never happened to me before. However, I can't remember a specific time where I've ever had cum on my lips before. After doing a quick reddit/google search, I came up with nothing. So... thoughts as to why this happened?

I'm in a long distance relationship, I'm 18 - 20 and I have some ED/PE related problems: before my first orgasm, I can't really penetrate her, because I'd come too fast. So usually we start with oral sex. She gives me a blowjob, I go down on her, everybody's pretty happy. The problem is that most of the times after the first orgasm my penis is dry and oversensitive and it's not hard enough to put a condom on it. Sometimes it even hurts me when she gives me a handjob (after a blowjob and me going down on her).

I'm trying to nofap (thanks to r/nofap) since October with rather mediocre results (my biggest streak counts 17 days). However, I haven't looked at porn since October. Also, I started doing kegels a month ago, but I don't really know if they work (I haven't been able to penetrate her for a month now). If I masturbate and try do stop orgasming by doing a long kegel, it just doesn't work - I have an orgasm, but I don't ejaculate and then my penis flattens.

Basically I'm not happy with how erect I get during sex.  

While masturbating, I have zero problems, either with pictures or videos.  Nothing too erotic or anything.  Penis can get very hard, without difficulty.

However, with a woman, if there is any sort of foreplay, i'll have difficulty keeping a solid erection.  With penis on vag stimulation, it can get a bit hard, but certainly nowhere near as hard as masturbation.  And if I choose, I could keep an erection via masturbation for 20+ minutes without difficulty - and it will be rock hard the whole time.

Some other info:
Hand Jobs / Blow Jobs, while enjoyable, don't make me hard.  If they go on too long, my skin actually gets sore (very easily) and then pain sets in - nothing is happening after that.  I've only came maybe once or twice from blow jobs, and it takes a LOT of effort - and if they try too hard - pain.  Intercourse - I come within a few minutes.

During intercourse, I almost feel like I have to finish right away or I'll lose my erection.  At a certain point, I become too self-conscious that it will go limp.

With my ex-wife, she got used to foreplay-less sex - and the erection would be fine.  Granted I wouldn't last that long, but confidence was there and the feeling was great.

The few times where we did more than just intercourse - didn't work as well.

So, part of me thinks I'm overly nervous, but when I relax to offset it - well, that's the thing, I relax, which doesn't help.

I have super sensitive skin all around the body so if it gets ""over-stimulated"", pain sets in, and I'm not a masochist, at least, not down there.

I'm seeing a dermatologist about my skin (need to do a body-wide mole/cancer checkup anyways) so I guess my uncertainty boils down to these:

1) Nervousness?  (I have confidence in my foreplay ability but now nervous about intercourse itself)

2) Skin condition? (Too much stimulation is bad)

3) Straight up ED?

Guess if I were to go see someone about this, I'm not sure who I'd approach.  Would I start with my general practitioner?  

Medications:
I'm currently on Verapamil for migraines, but that's only within the last few years.  (This goes back before that) I also take Flo-vent, an inhaler for asthma - last 4 years or so.  Other than that, nothing unusual like anti-depressants or anything.

Thanks in advance for any advice or direction!

An example of an interesting tactile toy might be a feather.  I suppose there might be another end to this, like sandpaper.  What objects/materials feel really good when your tied up and blindfolded?  Hmm, okay, we can keep the B in BDSM...

Maybe some suggestions on how to use these materials as well?

Now that we are, things are tough. Everything in our relationship is wonderful, except for our sex lives. 

About half of the time, the sex is okay and we're both left happy. It isn't great for several reasons.

I have an extremely hard time getting aroused because I am on both birth control and anti-depressants, both that lower a women's libido. Because of that, I am almost never in the mood to have sex, and he thinks it is because I'm not attracted to him, even though I've explained it is not that and due to my meds.

He loses erections extremely fast. He hates the feel of condoms (even though we buy ultra-thins). By the time we try to switch positions, since he isn't being stimulated, he loses it almost immediately. This leads to us almost never able to successfully change positions. Also, I can NEVER be on top. Grinding on top does nothing for him, and he says he needs me to go straight up and down, which so far, I haven't figured out how to do. The only way we ever did was on a chair, which made it much easier for me to go up and down instead of a more diagonal or scooting motion (does that make sense?).

Because he loses erections quickly, it makes me feel sad. Since we can never do positions with me on top, it makes me feel like I am not contributing. I feel like if I was better at what I was doing, he would never lose his erections. This makes me feel horrible, and him feel like less of a man because he loses them.

I need help, sexperts. I want to improve our sex life together and leave us both happier, and not feeling miserable. We love each other very much, and want to fix this together.

We've been together for 6 years, and over time I've begun to realise that we're not as sexually compatible as I had initially thought. When we first started dating we had (as would be expected) sex all the time, different places, lots of oral (which I love). Then, when we moved in together, the sex tapered off. It went down to a couple of times a week and oral maybe once every couple of months. She suffers from depression and has problems with her moods, so I've always attributed the lows to that, but recently it's been coming up more and more that she just isn't as into sex as I thought. 

The drop in frequency has been something I've had a hard time getting out of my head. I've got a mild anxiety disorder and it's hard for me to stop thinking about it all. It's gotten to the point where the fact that we haven't had sex in a bit tends to put me in a mental spiral where I stop being as excited. I get all stuck up in my own thoughts and then when we do start to get intimate, I have erectile issues. Not sure if they're physiological or not, but I think I know myself well enough to know that it's in my head. I've gotten my hopes up too many times that things are going to change - that we're going to do oral more or that we're going to try and increase our frequency/experimentations - and now I find it hard to get my hopes up sexually at all. I've been unrealistic in my expectations and it's come to bite me in the ass. 

We've done stuff in the past that was quite adventurous - anal fingering, different positions etc but nothing particularly hardcore. However, I discovered this year that she actually never wanted to do any of those things and was doing them to keep me interested. I feel fucking terrible about how I've made her feel, but I also feel terrible that several of my sexual fantasies are pretty much never going to happen. I know that fantasies sometimes need to stay as they are, but it hurts a little. 

Now, unfortunately, this all seems to come up after I've had one of my mental spirals and had erectile problems. She tells me she feels like she isn't enough for me. I tell her that I don't feel like I'm being fulfilled sexually and that hurts her even more. Our communication is breaking down, and when I chatted to her to see if she would want to talk about sex in a more neutral time, she told me she didn't want to talk about it at all - that it's not something she *can* talk about. 

So now I'm stuck. I put too much pressure on her to live up to my sexual expectations and now it's crumbling from the inside. I love her completely, but I'm just not finding myself excited by things any more. I know part of what I can do is to get back into my 'extracurricular' activities like performing, to kick myself out of my own mental rut, but I don't know how to fix what's happened between us. I don't feel like she's willing to meet me part way, and I can't explain how I feel without hurting her more.

Frankly, I've become somewhat impotent...except for one thing.

Porn very seldom does anything for me. Be it pictures or videos, I simply get only slightly aroused at best. What really turns me on right now is the idea of a gay man experimenting with a woman.

The reason this is strange is because, in truth, I highly dislike gay men who do that. In truth, I could almost say I hate them. My immediate collection of friends seem to share my belief that the lines (in our instance) are very set in stone. Now I'm not saying some people don't genuinely want to experiment or develop different attractions -- I know that happens. It's kind of a ""joining the majority"" or ""us and them"" mentality and I find myself (perhaps even highly irrationally) holding a lot of contempt for those gay men who decide to temporarily ""go straight.""

And yet I find myself becoming super hard thinking about them and visualizing the scenario. It's both extremely frustrating and infuriating to me as it is hot. Am I turned on by the idea of something I hate? 

Before you begin to ask, I have NO attraction for women and would NEVER try them. The very thought of a woman's genitalia is, frankly, an anti-boner for me in all ways (no offense ladies, I'm just not interested in that way). It has nothing to do with some deep-down heterosexual tendency I have. Again, I actually really strongly dislike the idea of a gay man trying women. 

So what gives? There are lots of things I hate in this world: people kicking puppies or hurting babies or something. None of those things turn me on. Why am I simultaneously scoffing at bi-curious gays and jerking off to them?

I had to make a throw-away because I'm somewhat scared of my friends finding out. I wish I could understand this myself, I know they won't understand it. 


TL;DR --become very sexually aroused at the thought of bi-curious gay men even though I truly hate the idea.

I'm a woman in my 30's with my share of partners.
I have recently begun seeing a man that is a bit older but has had fewer partners. He often expresses interest/admiration in what he regards as a life lived more fully than his. He is very high energy, direct and comfortable in his communication. I am a more reserved personality and tend to be, uh, less direct. I, of course, prefer to think of it as softer. He calls it nicer.

I think he enjoys sex for the 'sport' of it - fun, experimentation, etc. He has many ideas of things he'd like to do.
I enjoy sex for the companionship of it? I like experimentation, fun, etc but not so much for just for sex's sake. I like to play with a person, if you see the difference? This maybe isn't unusual?

Anyway, I was concerned early on that he had an image of me as a sexual partner on top of having ideas of things he wanted to do that he had 'missed out on'. I'd be happy to oblige but I feel i've gotten it into my head that I was assigned a role in his fantasy and that I'm being compared to that.  Ironically, as comfortable an environment as he is creating (anything goes), its terribly uncomfortable for me. I am now hyper sensitive to him and constantly judging myself to what I imagine we should both expect from me (more experienced 'wild' woman). I feel like a novice. Its honestly like I've never done this before.  It's gotten to the point that I don't even want to touch him because of how much I belittle myself when I do. The anxiety is too much. I think he sometimes makes jokes - to lighten the mood - but it makes me feel worse. Because I feel so out of sorts.

Last night I decided that maybe I had just outgrown my sexual usefulness and should hang up my lingerie for a number of cats. I feel so small it's hard to even discuss with him. At all.

This is unreasonable. I have plans to see a doctor for anxiety I've got it coming up in spades lately.  So maybe that will help. But I can't help but wonder if maybe we just aren't compatible. Perhaps my communication style just isn't well-suited to his?

(20 years old) [x-post from r/sex],1,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/sexpertslounge/comments/uc2db/why_am_i_constantly_quick_on_the_trigger_20_years/,"First time I've ever talked to a single person about this. I'm 20 years old and have a bit of a problem with premature ejaculation. Let's be clear though that sometimes I can last long. Honestly I think it's an anxiety issue, but I'll let you decide that. Here's kind of a personal sex history...

First off I'm 7 inches and every girl I've been with said I was endowed. I'm not self conscious about my size, just my performance.

First girlfriend - never came early. We never had sex, but we always fooled around and performed oral sex. We broke up after 3 months.

Next girl - this occurred about 4 months after I broke up with my girlfriend. We started doing stuff and then BAM, I immediately came. This occurred almost every time we messed. This was my first semester in college and I was obviously self conscious about this.

Second semester - hook up with a couple girls. same thing, I'm coming early.

Over the summer I masturbated a lot and looked into premature ejaculation. I tried the stop start and practiced my KP's. I was doing pretty well.

First semester sophomore year - I have a new confidence and I want to lost my virginity. I started dating this girl and after about 2 weeks we are both drunk and we have sex. I last probably 10 minutes, not bad in my book. We go at it about 2 hours later and I last for 40 minutes and give her an orgasm, she said it's the first one she's received. Que the casual sex - I'm lasting about 15 minutes every time. We stopped talking for awhile and that was that.

Over the next semester I hooked up with a few people, I wasn't lasting that long anymore.

Now comes the new girlfriend. We've been dating for almost a month and I've been practicing my KP's and stop start for about 2 weeks. Tonight was embarrassing. We're starting to fool around and I'm fingering her, she's tugging on me. I'm paying attention to how I feel and then notice that she's really into me fingering her. I got into it and she was tugging and bam, *I couldn't fucking stop it.*

I'm embarrassed. I told her I came and I laughed and she just kind of laughed too. She didn't judge me; we just kind of left it at that. Why is this happening and how can I fix it? It's to the point where I don't even want to have sex...

And so i've noticed a few things in our sex life that i would like advice on:

* **We get aroused at different times** - For both of us, when we're aroused, we're both  ready and willing, but if not, then we just aren't in the mood.  And for some reason, We are rarely in sync: She gets aroused during the day, and for me its mostly at night.  Not a huge problem, but any idea whats causing it?

* **Touble getting her to cum** - I know that this shouldnt be entirely unexpected from a first timer, but after six months, i've figure out her body pretty well.  I've tried every combination of penetration, oral, g-epot and clitoral stimulation, and nothing seems to work, no matter how long we're at it for (current best is 2 hours, and after her not cumming from that i got a little worried about what I'M doing wrong).  Don't get me wrong, she enjoys it, but no orgasm.  Which brings we to my next problem...

* **She stops me from making her cum** - I'll need a female opinion on this one.  She has told me she's never cum before, but on the few times i've gotten her close she always pushes me away, or grabs my hand and tells me to stop.  Part of it is she says she wont be able to stop herself from screaming (our apartment's walls are very thin, and we're both worried about privacy).  But i can't get a straight answer out of her.  Except for one time.  She said she didn't want to, because if she enjoyed it it would raise expectations for me, and she wouldnt enjoy normal sex anymore.  Any help here?

* **Fingering issues** - plain and simple: she loves it when i stimulate her G-Spot, but my hand starts cramping after a while.  

* **She is annoyingly selfless** - She always wants me to cum; thats her priority during sex.  So during foreplay, she'll insist on giving me oral.  Unfortunately she doesn't always let ME do anything.  I mean, i love going down on her, and she enjoys it too, but she just wants me to cum and doesnt care about herself.  help?

The first night we had sex, everything went great, then an hour or so later we had sex again. But while we were fooling around before sex my penis like pushed a little bit into her vagina, when I had cum on it from cumming inside a condom the previous time(if that even made sense) and we freaked out and went to the pharmacy and got plan b, within an hour of that happening. We ended up having sex a few more times that night, we were still horny but I used protection and didn't touch her. NOW the next time, we decided to get drunk and have some raunchy sex... well things were starting to heat up and she started giving me head while we were making food, and after a bit of that she got on the floor asking me to get on top of her, so I ripped her clothes off and got on top of her, and eventually I could feel myself getting ready to cum, and as I pulled out I started to cum and she says I got cum in her, I say I pulled out in time, but I was slightly drunk and once again we freaked out, called her friend to drive me to the pharmacy, AGAIN and get the pill.
I just wanted to know if we're okay? Like is there a high chance of her being pregnant or what can happen if you take plan B two nights in a row? Shes scared of being pregnant, and the side effects of the pill, being bloated, pains, spotting and all that.
Has this ever happened to you? What advice could you give, other than don't have unprotected sex? Do you think she could be pregnant based on all of that?

Thank you so much guys, I'm sure you could understand why I'm pretty scared right now...

**tl;dr** Had unprotected sex first night, got plan B. Unprotected sex again the second night, got plan B",,False,,t5_2shg2,False,,,True,t3_sbsay,http://www.reddit.com/r/sexpertslounge/comments/sbsay/made_a_few_mistakes_this_weekend/,

The next day I had the same amount of smegma, washed it with a wet towel, and today again. Should I be worried?

However numerous times I’ve had conversations with smaller more fit people whose partners are fit/ healthy as well. And I have had conversations with slightly overweight people as myself, and it seems unanimously the larger people always seem to have the more satisfying sex life?
