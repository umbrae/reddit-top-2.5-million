1340667525.0,84,self.louisck,vlln5,Louis CK is bypassing crap like Ticketmaster and scalpers by selling tickets for his upcoming tour directly and cancelling tickets that are resold for more.,89,5,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/louisck/comments/vlln5/louis_ck_is_bypassing_crap_like_ticketmaster_and/,"Text from his newsletter:

hello folks!  I'm going on tour this  year from October through
Feb.  I'll be all over the goddamn place.  This year, I'm trying
something new, building on the fun, success and fan-benifit of
selling my content online.  We are selling tickets to this tour
exclusively here on louisck.com.  I only wanted to do this if
there was a way, like with LIVE AT THE BEACON, that  it could
bring the price of tickets down and make them easier and less
complicated to buy.  We figured out a way.

Making my shows affordable has always been my goal but two things
have always worked against that.  High ticket charges and ticket
re-sellers marking up the prices.  Some ticketing services charge
more than 40% over the ticket price and, ironically, the lower
I've made my ticket prices, the more scalpers have bought them
up, so the more fans have paid for a lot of my tickets.

By selling the tickets exclusively on my site, I've cut the
ticket charges way down and absorbed them into the ticket price.
To buy a ticket, you join NOTHING.  Just use your credit card and
buy the damn thing.   opt in to the email list if you want, and
you'll only get emails from me.

Also, you'll see that if you try to sell the ticket anywhere for
anything above the original price, we have the right to cancel
your ticket (and refund your money).  this is something I intend
to enforce.  There are some other rules you may find annoying but
they are meant to prevent someone who has no intention of seeing
the show from buying the ticket and just flipping it for twice
the price from a thousand miles away.

Some of these rules may be a pain in your ass, but please be
patient.  My goal here is that people coming to see my shows are
able to pay a fair price and that they be paying just for a
ticket.  Not also paying an exhorbanant fee for the privalege of
buying a ticket.

Tickets across the board, everywhere, are 45 dollars.  That's
what you'll actually pay.  In every case, that will be less than
anyone has actually  paid to see me (after ticket charges)  in
about two years and in most cases it's about half of what you
paid last year.

The benifit for me is that I won't get angry emails from anyone
who paid a ton of money to see me due to circumstances out of my
control.  That makes me VERY happy.  The 45 dollars also includes
sales tax, which I'm paying for you.  So I'm making more or less
depending on the state.

Another benifit to me is also one to you.  I get your email
address (if you opt in) when you opt in.  You don't have to join
ANYTHING to buy these tickets and if you opt in, youll only hear
from me once in an old man's jizz-cycle.

Obviously  none of this means anything if the shows aren't good.
So that's up to me.  As I do every year, I'll be performing a
brand new hour (or more) on all of these shows.

Lastly, it was a real challenge to find venues around the country
that could work with our exclusive ticketing service under these
perameters.  It means I'm playing in very new places.  I really
appreciate all of these theaters that are letting us give this a
try.

Setting up this tour has been fascinating and difficult.  this
ticketing service is a brand new thing and I really fucking hope
it works and that there aren't any problems.  If anything comes
up, please be patient.

Doing things this way means I""m making less than I would have
made if I did a standard tour, using the usual very excellent but
expensive ticketing service.  In some cities I've had to play
smaller venues and do more shows.  But I like doing more shows
and about a year ago I reached a place where I realized I am
making enough money doing comedy so the next thing that
interested me is bringing your price down.  Either way, I still
make a whole lot more than my grandfather who taught math and
raised chickens in Michigan.

alright, that's it, folks.  I'll be sending this message out to
folks on the opt-in list and sending a separate email that lays
it out much more simply with the proper links.  I am doing this
because when I emailed you about LIVE AT CARNEGIE HALL, (which is
still on sale for 5 dollars!) about half of the people who got
the email really enjoyed the long, verbose, unedited message.
The other half HATED it and would have preffered a price, a link,
and me shutting the fuck up.

This way, you can read this if you like, or your can just see the
massive shit-ball of text and throw it in the garbage, and focus
on the simple email.

I hope to see you all on the road.

regards,

Louis C.K.

First off, though I agree it's probably not his best, it was still a great show.

Secondly, I felt that the in-the-round setting was distracting and not ideal for his style of delivery. I know he wanted to do a show where Carlin had done his [famous 1978 special](http://splitsider.com/2013/04/in-his-hbo-specials-credits-louis-c-k-thanks-george-carlin-chris-rock-and-china/), but he looked a little uncomfortable.

You could tell he was thinking 'OK, I'd better turn around to these guys for a while'. And he was constantly wheeling around to face another camera -- it was making me sea-sick.

Was it just me? Or did you think he was less confident this time? He's such an absolute pro that his lines were delivered flawlessly, but I couldn't help but think that he looked nervous and under pressure. The bits were recited by rote but his eyes darted around worriedly -- he smiled but his eyes didn't.

Perhaps because when he filmed The Beacon he was in an all-or-nothing mood. But since that was a huge success (along with the series) he suddenly feels like he's got everything to lose.

Someone released a recording from an early show on the tour, I forget where from, but even though the jokes were still developing, I think the overall tenor of the act was better -- more confident and fun. It didn't seem like he was truly enjoying himself in the special.

Those are my two cents, please add your own -- or just tell me to get lost.",,False,,t5_2qsmq,False,,,True,t3_1cfatd,http://www.reddit.com/r/louisck/comments/1cfatd/opinions_on_oh_my_god_vs_other_louis_ck_specials/,

It's one of my favorite inspirational videos. In that tribute, Louis says that he spent 15 years after high school building this ""shitty hour"" of comedy and that he was still performing at Chinese restaurants before he decided to pursue the Carlin style of throwing everything out.

However, at about 10:55 during the HBO special, [Talking Funny](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVgD6S_Qdmo), he says that when he was 19 he got to open for Jerry Seinfeld. Then he and Seinfeld did a bunch of shows together - some of which had like 1200 people.

Am I missing something? It just seems like these are two very different versions of his early career. [The Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_ck#Early_life_and_career) seems to support the latter version.  Either he started having luck right after he started or he struggled for 15 years. Can someone help me reconcile these two versions?",,False,,t5_2qsmq,False,,,True,t3_18pwfe,http://www.reddit.com/r/louisck/comments/18pwfe/question_about_louis_cks_early_career/,

This is Louis C.K. I'm writing for two reasons. Maybe three, but two that I can think of right now. If more come up, I'll return to this sentence and up the number. Ugh. Okay. 

Reason one. I want to thank everyone who came out to see me on the road this year. I have never traveled so much and done so many shows. The tour covered over 100 shows in 39 cities. 300 thousand people came to see me. I can't think of one city where I didn't have a great time. That doesn't mean there wasn't one. I just can't think of it right now. Anyway there really wasn't one. (I'm so tempted to say ""except Tampa"" or something, just to be a dick. But the truth is I really enjoyed every show I did in every city I visited. This part is now too long to be in parentesies. I can't spell that word.) I went to a lot of places I had never been to before. Tulsa Oklahoma. Athens Georgia. Actually I think that's all. I had been to just about every other place. 
Everywhere I went, the audiences were generous and energetic and just lovely and other puffy positive happy adjectives like that. And even though I keep undercutting my appreciation with sarcasm at the end of each sentence I truly honestly appreciate how many of you came to the shows and for your help in honing the material for my next special, which I'll get to in just a second. 
I would also like to say thank you for participating in the experiment of buying the tickets directly from my site. We found that, while the average national tour can expect about 25 percent of it's tickets to be sold on secondary markets, the final count for this tour was less than a 1% scalping rate. So over 99 percent of those who came to the shows were able to pay the basic 45 dollars for their ticket. So yay about that. I felt like I saw more regular actual people in the front row, rather than Cohiba smoking loafers with no socks dudes who buy their tickets on stubhub and brag about how much they had to pay. Not to disparage anyone who smokes Cohibas and fits that description. But yeah, I'd rather see a tired looking couple who got a sitter and took the bus into town and they have a great time but then at the end of the show they are leaning on each other and sleeping. But they had row one tickets and they didn't have to pay some douche a bunch of money. 
Okay so that's about tour. 

Toward the end of the tour I recorded 4 shows at the Celebrity Theater in Phoenix Arizona, which became my next standup special ""Louis CK: Oh My God"" 
I picked the Celebrity theater because George Carlin shot one in that same place, which hasn't changed a bit since he did his in 1977. I got very intrigued by the idea of shooting a special ""in the round"". 
Anyway, that special premieres tonight on HBO at 10pm. 

""Louis CK Oh My GOd"" will also be available on my website, louisck.com in September, globally, for the same 5 bucks you pay for all my shit that is there.

Okay so please watch the special and enjoy it. 

Lastly I'd like to apologize for all of you who have been confronted with my stupid fucking face as you go down into the subway, watch a bus drive by, or drive through time square, or buy Roling Stone Magazine, or the magazine two magazines down from Rolling Stone. Or the one next to that. 

I'd like to write more or, better yet, go back and edit this, but I have noodles and a chicken just finishing and my kids need to eat in front of project runway. Then I'm going to Radio City to see Donaire beat the shit out of that guy who's name begins with R., right after my special airs. 

Thanks again for everything.

Thought it might be good to post for anyone who might have missed it.

&gt;Hello. This is Louis C.K. I'm writing for two reasons. Maybe three, but two that I can think of right now. If more come up, I'll return to this sentence and up the number. Ugh. Okay. 
&gt;
&gt;Reason one. I want to thank everyone who came out to see me on the road this year. I have never traveled so much and done so many shows. The tour covered over 100 shows in 39 cities. 300 thousand people came to see me. I can't think of one city where I didn't have a great time. That doesn't mean there wasn't one. I just can't think of it right now. Anyway there really wasn't one. (I'm so tempted to say ""except Tampa"" or something, just to be a dick. But the truth is I really enjoyed every show I did in every city I visited. This part is now too long to be in parentesies. I can't spell that word.) I went to a lot of places I had never been to before. Tulsa Oklahoma. Athens Georgia. Actually I think that's all. I had been to just about every other place. 
&gt;Everywhere I went, the audiences were generous and energetic and just lovely and other puffy positive happy adjectives like that. And even though I keep undercutting my appreciation with sarcasm at the end of each sentence I truly honestly appreciate how many of you came to the shows and for your help in honing the material for my next special, which I'll get to in just a second. 
&gt;I would also like to say thank you for participating in the experiment of buying the tickets directly from my site. We found that, while the average national tour can expect about 25 percent of it's tickets to be sold on secondary markets, the final count for this tour was less than a 1% scalping rate. So over 99 percent of those who came to the shows were able to pay the basic 45 dollars for their ticket. So yay about that. I felt like I saw more regular actual people in the front row, rather than Cohiba smoking loafers with no socks dudes who buy their tickets on stubhub and brag about how much they had to pay. Not to disparage anyone who smokes Cohibas and fits that description. But yeah, I'd rather see a tired looking couple who got a sitter and took the bus into town and they have a great time but then at the end of the show they are leaning on each other and sleeping. But they had row one tickets and they didn't have to pay some douche a bunch of money. 
&gt;Okay so that's about tour. 
&gt;
&gt;Toward the end of the tour I recorded 4 shows at the Celebrity Theater in Phoenix Arizona, which became my next standup special ""Louis CK: Oh My God"" 
&gt;I picked the Celebrity theater because George Carlin shot one in that same place, which hasn't changed a bit since he did his in 1977. I got very intrigued by the idea of shooting a special ""in the round"". 
&gt;Anyway, that special premieres tonight on HBO at 10pm. 
&gt;
&gt;""Louis CK Oh My GOd"" will also be available on my website, louisck.com in September, globally, for the same 5 bucks you pay for all my shit that is there.
&gt;
&gt;Okay so please watch the special and enjoy it. 
&gt;
&gt;Lastly I'd like to apologize for all of you who have been confronted with my stupid fucking face as you go down into the subway, watch a bus drive by, or drive through time square, or buy Roling Stone Magazine, or the magazine two magazines down from Rolling Stone. Or the one next to that. 
&gt;
&gt;I'd like to write more or, better yet, go back and edit this, but I have noodles and a chicken just finishing and my kids need to eat in front of project runway. Then I'm going to Radio City to see Donaire beat the shit out of that guy who's name begins with R., right after my special airs. 
&gt;
&gt;Thanks again for everything. 
&gt;
&gt;regards,
&gt;

Check my bank account today, which was empty-not in use, and It was debited and overdrafted cost me 35$. I call paypal, and after two hours of arguing and 4 different reps the last one tells me paypal is having a glitch where it isn't allowing people to use their paypal balances. He tells me it's still my fault for continuing(only did b/c of language listed above) and that I'll have to take it up with wells fargo. Fuck PayPal, never using them again.

1364665970.0,0,self.louisck,1bb8hy,My friends are getting married. They really want Louis C.K. to officiate. Can anyone at least run it by him?,6,10,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/louisck/comments/1bb8hy/my_friends_are_getting_married_they_really_want/,"So my friend Daniel and his fiance Chantelle are really huge Louis C.K. fans. Chantelle said I could be maid of honor if I got  Louis C.K. to officiate the wedding. I think I'd look sexy in a dress.

So, in the spirit of being kickass, I am going to at least give it a shot. 

Here's the skinny:

* Wedding is in Cape Hatteras on September 14th. Plenty of time to schedule.
* They rented a beach house.
* Louis is requested to officiate the wedding, but even just showing up and drinking would be a ""fuck yes!""
* If he wants something, he gets something. He wants a bowl of brown M&amp;Ms? Done. Football helmet full of cottage cheese? Easy. Naked pictures of Bea Arthur? I have my ways.
* Louis can bring whoever the fuck he wants. Screw the RSVP. If he wants to roll in with Dimitri Martin's mother in skimpy lingerie, we don't care. A midget on dialysis? Awesome. A gang of Hell's Angels? Even better. We draw the line at Garth Brooks, though.
* We will pay for him to get licensed to officiate. (it's super easy, I hear)
* He gets a place to stay. Food provided.
* Transportation probably wont be provided by the bride and groom, but I bet a shitton of money that we can find people to make that happen. (How do you feel about Greyhound?)
* We will leave him the fuck alone if he decides he just wants to go fishing, sit on the beach, etc etc.
* No press allowed, if he's concerned about that.

[This is a pic of the lovely couple.](http://oursweetweddingwebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cropped-DSC_4689e.jpg) (site under construction at the moment)

So if anyone knows how to get this message to the guy... PM me.
