Think about it, there are already uncontacted tribes here on earth (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontacted_peoples), they have no idea  people that are way more advanced in science medicine and techonology are out there, they don't know we exist because they don't have the means to get to us, also right activists groups have adviced for them to be left alone, one of the reasons being they are probably not inmune to our basic dissaeses and also because they have the right to develop as a civilization by their own selves.


What if we are just one big civilization that is being protected like that by more advanced beings? maybe they're also humans, they are way more advanced than us in every aspect and they want to protect us from themselves, they want us to find our own way and don't want to intervene with our society just like what we are doing with the tribes.

Also, what if since we have so many resources here on earth and they are also more advanced in terms of being a more moral and peacefull society they want to keep us away from their bad people that are probably going kill us all and take our stuff if they found out were we are? that's why they keep us in the dark, that's why they don't want us to find them, it's too risky for us.

I came across this word and was reminded of a friend who had passed just the other day. We met in an inpatient hospital. I was there because of a suicide attempt and she was there because of her heroin addiction.

I kept thinking of how my mom and dad, friends, teachers, acquaintances, and the like would've reacted had I died the day of my attempt. Then I started making up different scenarios of how people would take the news and continue on with their lives.

Then I thought about my friend and how she probably had these thoughts as well. She would think of her own mother and father, and her friends, and her acquaintances, and everyone else in between. She enjoyed her own set of childhood pleasures and played tag with the person she had a crush on and put bandages on her scraped knees when she fell on the pavement and felt incredible pain and cried for hours at a time for own reasons.

And so did her father. And the people surrounding his life. Everyone that he's ever interacted with had their own lives just as complex and unique as his and hers and my mother's and mine and yours.

Hell, let's go deeper. I even read a showerthought that said that the Queen of England took a shit today. Think about that. Princess Di took shits, Abraham Lincoln took shits. Fuckin' Selena Gomez and her mama took shits. I take shits. You take shits. The people who just fucking rang my door bell looking for my housemate at this goddamned, unreasonable hour took shits. (Fuck them it's 3AM.)

The amalgamated mass of my perception of the collective human consciousness began to unravel and divide and separate into individual specks filled with people's favorite meals and songs that they never got tired of.

We often tend to forget how human we really are. So think about this next time you feel intimidated towards your superior, the girl you've been meaning to ask out, the random stranger you almost awkwardly brushed hands with as you walk beside them in the hallway.

Tonight, I'm going to think about my friend and what she would've thought of this post if I had the chance to show it to her. It's quite beautiful and also insanely mind-numbing knowing that there's this sort of almost paradoxical like connection felt in the uniqueness of every individual's life. There is comfort amongst this ocean of beautiful bodies.

Rest in peace, Michelle.",,False,,t5_2szyo,False,,,True,t3_1gppzx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/1gppzx/take_a_moment_and_let_this_sink_in/,

""I wonder what the temperature of the water is.""

""Forgot to buy more shampoo. Damn""

""Damn. This track sucks and I can't skip it.""

*Some* posts are on the fence, like this one: ""I wonder if I've touched any of this water before."" This post is fine, because there's more to it than just a simple statement about showers.
