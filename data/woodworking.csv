The problem is that I get very anxious when doing new things and it often keeps me from stepping out of my comfort zone. I have to be aware of every aspect of a new venture before starting. We've got a free-to-use shop on campus so that's covered. 

 The problem: I need to bring my own materials, and I have no idea how to go about buying what I need: What store should I go to? What should I ask for? Is there any special information that I should know ahead of time? What's should I expect to happen?

I'm building a small organizer which I've rendered [here](http://i.imgur.com/ZPKcdj0.jpg) and I'm pretty sure all I need is like 6-7ft of 1x10 

TL;DR Could you describe your trip to go buy some wood? 


EDIT: ***** SOCIAL ANXIETY SHEESH ***** I didn't know what to call it and I figured the people on the woodworking subreddit would give me some slack. Dag, yo. For those asking, no I am not medicated, and I'm fine with that. I've gotten along this far and I'm usually pretty good about trying new things, but I think /u/DireTaco had a good description of exactly what was going through my head. 

Thanks for all the help! Oh, and apparently there's a new subreddit because of this /r/Explainlikeimscared/ (I don't really think the title is accurate but whatever) that helps people with social anxiety do new things with explanations like this. Seems really cool. I've got a really busy schedule but if I get around to building my little organizer I'll post it! 

To the mean dude at the bottom: (aside from your actual description): I drew it in Solid Works while procrastinating for a class. I rendered it in two point perspective so that's why the lines aren't parallel. Don't be an asshole. Don't tell people what they have, and have not experienced. Don't call people ""boy"".

Well, I'm finally far enough along to make a post on here.... I knew I wanted to make a keezer and I had grand thoughts of spiffing it up and making a nice spot for it in the dining room. Well, the SWMBO had other plans and though the garage would be a better spot for it...

Since this was going to be in the garage, I wanted it a little rustic and the build price had to be as cheap as possible. With that said, I posted a request on facebook looking for free pallets. With in a few days, I had friends dropping off pallets at the house...

One garage full of pallets...check! Easy to take apart, sure.... NOT!!! These things were a major PITA with a claw hammer and a pry bar! So, after spending 20 minutes pulling two boards off of a pallet, I decided to introduce Mr. Tiger saw to the pallet. Within an hour, I had all of my pallets cut up and boards separated. That saw was like a hot knife through butter. So, word to the wise, go the power tool route if you do this.

In my design phase, I had drawn up a 3 tap keezer since I could easily fit three corny kegs in the freezer without a co2 tank. Well, after a little more thought I realized that if I built up a 4"" collar I could get an additional 3 gallon corny keg on the freezer 'hump'. What to do, what to do... hmmm; 18 gallons of beer or 15 gallons of homebrew on tap. I went the route any homebrewer would go. :) And with that, I introduce you to my pallet kegerator build with four taps: http://imgur.com/a/HR0eF

This was my third try, after a failed attempt using Mahogany (split as soon as I tried routing the locking grooves) and another fail out of red oak, which split while I was drilling the dowel holes.

This one is going to be left unfinished, though I might use beeswax on it.  I'm thinking of making another out of Black Walnut, which I would finish.

As far as I could find on google, I'm the first to make a wooden collar :-)

details:
was using rockler aluminum tapering jig http://www.rockler.com/product.cfm?page=2076, cutting table legs. i was making a cut on a 20"" piece with about 2"" clearance at end of jig after feeding thru blade. definitely too close to the blade

i made four cuts, and at the end of the 5th cut, i must've slipped and the tail of the jig caught the blade, shredded it into shrapnel and fired it back into the palm of my hand.  i had glasses on and was standing outside of kickback zone- i was using a push stick to keep the piece i was cutting held down as well and pushing the jig handle with my left hand. it happened so fast i had no idea what happened until i looked at my hand, huge deep cut about 2"" deep 4"" wide. it severed the nerve to my middle finger which will heal in 4-6 mos. hand in cast for 6 weeks.

what i learned:

know the adress and location of closest ER. store it in your phone. know where your phone is, keys and wallet are before you turn on any power tools and keep them in a safe place.
in my case my wife drove me because it was faster than having an ambulance come. we had to look for keys for what seemed like forever.
have first aid kit handy, i didn't

ill never use anything metal between the fence and the blade ever again. unless it in the mitre slot.  its too dangerous. have at least 5"" clearance from the blade at all points of the cut. i didn't.

call me stupid if u like, i dont care-. id rather someone reads this and doesn't make any of the mistakes i did. i consider myself pretty safe, but a single slip can cause something like this to happen. it hurts a shitload and couldve been worse, i consider myself lucky.

This project was actually a set of experiments. First and foremost, it was a chance to learn to use my new INCRA router table set up. Used some of the money from our tax refund to get this new toy. (Gotta love being over-educated and gainfully employed!) After a couple practice joints, decided to jump right in and try one of the fancy joints that had seduced me into getting the set up. Turned out to be fairly straightforward to cut [Double Corner Post Dovetails](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ngp/7054700271/in/set-72157629763219085/lightbox/)

You might remember me from such submissions like [While digging through the firewood pile...](http://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/pxuj3/while_digging_through_the_firewood_pile/). I continued to do do some digging. In fact, one day I sorted through a half cord of wood and separated out all the pieces I thought might be interesting. This is includes a lovely log of some still un-identified wood with [fantastic spalting](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ngp/6908613484/in/set-72157629763219085/lightbox/) So that was another part of this experiment: turning rough firewood pieces into nicely dimensioned lumber.

Not so long ago, someone here posted a link to a video on creating [A sunburst finish in Figured Maple](http://www.finewoodworking.com/Materials/MaterialsArticle.aspx?id=30136), which led me to reading an article on [Dyes Bringing Out the Best in Figured Maple](http://www.finewoodworking.com/SkillsAndTechniques/SkillsAndTechniquesPDF.aspx?id=30022) (Sorry about links that might be only for subscribers.) I had to try this. Picked up some dyes and after a few failed experiments, finally got [something](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ngp/7054698933/in/set-72157629763219085/lightbox/) I [liked](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ngp/6908609542/in/set-72157629763219085/)
Achieved this by building up first a Dark Mission Brown, sanding down. Then some Yellow Maple dye, sanding down. And finally an Light Antique Cherry red for hight light and  final sanding. Hard to see from the photos, but under sunlight, the different colors come out at different viewing and illumination angles. BTW, this is the same firewood log I mentioned in my previous firewood post. The other new thing for me was the use of Walnut oil.

The final experiment was the finish. I have always liked using fresh shellac. But I recently thought to try wet sanding the final coat. After applying and applying walnut oil (the wood for the sides was *very* dry), waiting for that to dry and then applying and applying 1lb cut shellac (I mean that wood was *dry*), I finally got to the point I could build up a substantial coat of 2 lb cut shellac. Enough so I could dry sand it with 400 grit as to level out the surface and remove traces of brush strokes. Onto this this I padded on some more 2 lb cut shellac until no traces of sanding marks remained. And now the fun: using mineral oil and 600 grit wet sandpaper, I sanded until when wiped and viewed at a glancing angle, I could see no evidence of unsanded  glossiness. After wiping off the mineral oil, I polished with 0000 synthetic steel wool and paste wax and then buffed with a cloth. The smooth, glossy surface lets all the details of the [found, spalted wood](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ngp/7054699799/in/set-72157629763219085) shine.  I love how people are drawn to touching the surfaces, to feel how smooth I got it.

Also added some unfinished [cherry dividers](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ngp/6908608872/in/set-72157629763219085/lightbox/) inside. Unfinished because she wants to keep her loose tea in the box.
